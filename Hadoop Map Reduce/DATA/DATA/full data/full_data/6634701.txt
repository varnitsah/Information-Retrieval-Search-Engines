introduction to old mortality  the origin of old mortality perhaps the best of scotts historical romances is well known in may 1816 mr joseph train the gauger from galloway breakfasted with scott in castle street he brought gifts in his handa relic of rob roy and a parcel of traditions among these was a letter from mr broadfoot schoolmaster in pennington who facetiously signed himself clashbottom to cleish or clash is to flog in scots from mr broadfoots joke arose jedediah cleishbotham the dominie of gandercleugh the real place of broadfoots revels was the shoulder of mutton inn at newton stewart mr train much pleased with the antiques in the den of castle street was particularly charmed by that portrait of claverhouse which now hangs on the staircase of the study at abbotsford scott expressed the cavalier opinions about dundee which were new to mr train who had been bred in the rural tradition of bloody claverse       the editors first acquaintance with claverhouse was obtained      through an old nurse who had lived on a farm beside a burn where      she said the skulls of covenanters shot by bloody claverse were      still occasionally found the stream was a tributary of the      ettrick  might he not asked mr train be made in good hands the hero of a national romance as interesting as any about either wallace or prince charlie he suggested that the story should be delivered as if from the mouth of old mortality this probably recalled to scott his own meeting with old mortality in dunnottar churchyard as described in the introduction to the novel  the account of the pilgrim as given by sir walter from mr trains memoranda needs no addition about old mortalitys son john who went to america in 1776  1774 and settled in baltimore a curious romantic myth has gathered mr train told scott more as his manuscript at abbotsford shows than scott printed according to mr train john paterson of baltimore had a son robert and a daughter elizabeth robert married an american lady who after his decease was married to the marquis of wellesley elizabeth married jerome bonaparte sir walter distrusted these legends though derived from a scotch descendant of old mortality mr ramage in march 1871 wrote to notes and queries dispelling the myth  according to jerome bonapartes descendant madame bonaparte her family were pattersons not patersons her baltimore ancestors will is extant has been examined by old mortalitys greatgrandson and announces in a kind of preamble that the testator was a native of donegal his christian name was william notes and queries fourth series vol vii p 219 and fifth series august 1874 this of course quite settles the question but the legend is still current among american descendants of the old roxburghshire wanderer  old mortality with its companion the black dwarf was published on december 1 1816 by mr murray in london and mr blackwood in edinburgh  the name of the author of waverley was omitted on the titlepage the reason for a change of publisher may have been chiefly financial lockhart v 152 scott may have also thought it amusing to appear as his own rival in a new field he had not yet told his secret to lady abercorn but he seems to reveal it for who but he could have known so much about the subject in a letter to her of november 29 1816  you must know the marquis wellor rather you must be the marquis himself quoth dalgetty here follow portions of the letter       i do not like the first story the black dwarf at all but the      long one which occupies three volumes is a most remarkable      production    i should like to know if you are of my opinion as      to these new volumes coming from the same hand    i wander about      from nine in the morning till five at night with a plaid about my      shoulders and an immensely large bloodhound at my heels and stick      in sprigs which are to become trees when i shall have no eyes to      look at them          i am truly glad that the tales have amused you in my poor opinion      they are the best of the four sets though perhaps i only think so      on account of their opening ground less familiar to me than the      manners of the highlanders    if tomhis brother mr thomas      scottwrote those volumes he has not put me in his secret         general rumour here attributes them to a very ingenious but most      unhappy man a clergyman of the church of scotland who many years      since was obliged to retire from his profession and from society      who hides himself under a borrowed name this hypothesis seems to      account satisfactorily for the rigid secrecy observed but from what      i can recollect of the unfortunate individual these are not the      kind of productions i should expect from him burley if i mistake      not was on board the prince of oranges own vessel at the time of      his death there was also in the life guards such a person as      francis stewart grandson of the last earl of bothwell i have in my      possession various proceedings at his fathers instance for      recovering some part of the earls large estates which had been      granted to the earls of buccleugh and roxburgh it would appear that      charles i made some attempts to reinstate him in those lands but      like most of that poor monarchs measures the attempt only served      to augment his own enemies for buccleugh was one of the first who      declared against him in scotland and raised a regiment of twelve      hundred men of whom my grandfathers grandfather sir william scott      of harden was lieutenantcolonel this regiment was very active at      the destruction of montroses highland army at philiphaugh in      charles the seconds time the old knight suffered as much through      the nonconformity of his wife as cuddie through that of his mother      my fathers grandmother who lived to the uncommon age of      ninetyeight years perfectly remembered being carried when a      child to the fieldpreachings where the clergyman thundered from      the top of a rock and the ladies sat upon their sidesaddles which      were placed upon the turf for their accommodation while the men      stood round all armed with swords and pistols    old mortality      was a living person i have myself seen him about twenty years ago      repairing the covenanters tombs as far north as dunnottar  if lady abercorn was in any doubt after this ingenuous communication mr murray the publisher was in none lockhart v 169 he wrote to scott on december 14 1816 rejoicing in the success of the tales which must be written either by walter scott or the devil    i never experienced such unmixed pleasure as the reading of this exquisite work has afforded me and if you could see me as the authors literary chamberlain receiving the unanimous and vehement praises of those who have read it and the curses of those whose needs my scanty supply could not satisfy you might judge of the sincerity with which i now entreat you to assure the author of the most complete success lord holland had said when mr murray asked his opinion opinion we did not one of us go to bed last nightnothing slept but my gout  the very whigs were conquered but not the scottish whigs the auld leaven of the covenantthey were still dour and offered many criticisms thereon scott by way of disproving his authorship offered to review the tales in the quarterly his true reason for this step was the wish to reply to dr thomas mccrie author of the life of john knox who had been criticising scotts historical view of the covenant in the edinburgh christian instructor scott had perhaps no better mode of answering his censor he was indifferent to reviews but here his historical knowledge and his candour had been challenged scott always recognised the national spirit of the covenanters which he remarks on in the heart of midlothian and now he was treated as a faithless scotsman for these reasons he reviewed himself but it is probable as lockhart says that william erskine wrote the literary or aesthetic part of the criticism lockhart v174 note  dr mccries review may be read or at least may be found in the fourth volume of his collected works blackwood edinburgh 1857 the critique amounts to about eightyfive thousand words since the princesse de cleves was reviewed in a book as long as the original never was so lengthy a criticism as dr mccries performance scarcely shares the popularity of old mortality a note on his ideas may not be superfluous though space does not permit a complete statement of his many objections the doctor begins by remarks on novels in general then descends to the earlier waverley romances the antiquary he pronounces to be tame and fatiguing acknowledging the merits of the others he finds fault with the foolish lines from burns which must have been foisted without the authors knowledge into the title page and he denounces the bad taste of the quotation from don quixote burns and cervantes had done no harm to dr mccrie but his anger was aroused and he like the mccallum more as described by andrew fairservice got up wi an unto bang and garrd them a look about them the view of the covenanters is false and distorted these worthies are not to be abused with profane wit or low buffoonery prayers were not read in the parish churches of scotland at that time as episcopacy was restored when charles ii returned upon the unanimous petition of the scottish parliament scotts collected works vol xix p 78 it is not unnatural for the general reader to suppose that prayers would be read by the curates dr mccrie maintains that at the restoration neither the one nor the other neither the scotch nor english prayer books was imposed and that the presbyterians repeatedly admitted they had no such grievance no doubt dr mccrie is correct but mr james guthrie who was executed on june 1 1661 said in his last speech oh that there were not many who study to build again what they did formerly unwarrantably destroy i mean prelacy and the service book a mystery of iniquity that works amongst us whose steps lead unto the house of the great whore babylon the mother of fornication and so forth either this mystery of iniquity the book of common prayer was working amongst us or it was not if it was not of what did mr guthrie complain if it was working was read by certain curates as by burnet afterwards bishop of salisbury at saltoun scott is not incorrect he makes morton in danger of death pray in the words of the prayer book a circumstance which so enraged his murderers that they determined to precipitate his fate dr mccrie objects to this incident which is merely borrowed one may conjecture from the death of archbishop sharpe the assassins told the archbishop that they would slay him hereupon he began to think of death but here are just the words of the person who related the story behold god did not give him the grace to pray to him without the help of a book but he pulled out of his pocket a small book and began to read over some words to himself which filled us with amazement and indignation so they fired their pistols into the old man and then chopped him up with their swords supposing that he had a charm against bullets  dr mccrie seems to have forgotten or may have disbelieved the narrative telling how sharpes use of the prayer book like mortons enraged his murderers the incident does not occur in the story of the murder by russell one of the murderers a document published in c k sharpes edition of kirkton it need not be true but it may have suggested the prayer of morton  if scott thought that the prayer book was ordained to be read in scotch churches he was wrong if he merely thought that it might have been read in some churches was working amongst us he was right at least according to mr james guthrie  dr mccrie argues that burley would never have wrestled with a soldier in an inn especially in the circumstances this he says was inconsistent with balfours character wodrow remarks i cannot hear that this gentleman had ever any great character for religion among those that knew him and such were the accounts of him when abroad that the reverend ministers of the scots congregation at rotterdam would never allow him to communicate with them in scotts reading of burleys character there was a great deal of the old adam that such a man should so resent the insolence of a soldier is far from improbable and our sympathies are with burley on this occasion  mause headrigg is next criticised scott never asserted that she was a representative of sober presbyterianism she had long conducted herself prudently but when she gave way to her indignation she only used such language as we find on many pages of wodrow in the mouths of many covenanters indeed though manse is undeniably comic she also commands as much respect as the spartan mother when she bids her only son bear himself boldly in the face of torture if scott makes her grotesque he also makes her heroic but dr mccrie could not endure the ridiculous element which surely no fair critic can fail to observe in the speeches of the gallant and courageous but not philosophical members of the covenants extreme left dr mccrie talks of the creeping loyalty of the cavaliers staggering were a more appropriate epithet both sides were loyal to principle both courageous but the inappropriate and promiscuous scriptural language of many covenanters was and remains ridiculous let us admit that the covenanters were not averse to all games in one or two sermons they illustrate religion by phrases derived from golf  when dr mccrie exclaims in a rich anger your fathers as if scotts must either have been presbyterians or cavaliers the retort is cleverly put by sir walter in the mouth of jedediah his ancestors of these days had been quakers and persecuted by both parties  throughout the novel scott keeps insisting that the presbyterians had been goaded into rebellion and even into revenge by cruelty of persecution and that excesses and bloodthirstiness were confined to the high flyers as the milder covenanters called them morton represents the ideal of a good scot in the circumstances he comes to be ashamed of his passive attitude in the face of oppression he stands up for that freedom from stripes and bondage which was claimed as you may read in scripture by the apostle paul and which every man who is freeborn is called upon to defend for his own sake and that of his countrymen the terms demanded by morton from monmouth before the battle of bothwell bridge are such as scott recognises to be fair freedom of worship and a free parliament are included  dr mccries chief charges are that scott does not insist enough on the hardships and brutalities of the persecution and that the ferocity of the covenanters is overstated he does not admit that the picture drawn of the more rigid presbyterians is just but it is almost impossible to overstate the ferocity of the high flyers conduct and creed thus wodrow a witness not quite unfriendly to the rigid presbyterians though not highflying enough for patrick walker writes mr tate informs me that he had this account front mr antony shau and others of the indulged that at some time under the indulgence there was a meeting of some people when they resolved in one night    to go to every house of the indulged ministers and kill them and all in one night this anecdote was confirmed by mr john millar to whose fathers house one of these high flyers came on this errand this massacre was not aimed at the persecutors but at the poundtexts as to their creed wodrow has an anecdote of one of his own elders who told a poor woman with many children that it would be an uncouth mercy if they were all saved  a pleasant evangel was this and peacefully was it to have been propagated  scott was writing a novel not history in the minstrelsy of the scottish border 18023 sir walter gave this account of the persecutions had the system of coercion been continued until our day blair and robertson would have preached in the wilderness and only discovered their powers of eloquence and composition by rolling along a deeper torrent of gloomy fanaticism    the genius of the persecuted became stubborn obstinate and ferocious he did not in his romance draw a complete picture of the whole persecution but he did show by that insolence of bothwell at milnwood which stirs the most sluggish blood how the people were misused this scene to dr mccries mind is a mere farce because it is enlivened by manses declamations scott displays the abominable horrors of the torture as forcibly as literature may dare to do but dr mccrie is not satisfied because macbriar the tortured man had been taken in arms some innocent person should have been put in the boot to please dr mccrie he never remarks that macbriar conquers our sympathy by his fortitude he complains of what the covenanters themselves called the language of canaan which is put into their mouths a strange ridiculous and incoherent jargon compounded of scripture phrases and cant terms peculiar to their own party opinions in ecclesiastical politics but what other language did many of them speak oh all ye that can pray tell all the lords people to try by mourning and prayer if ye can taigle him taigle him especially in scotland for we fear he will depart from it this is the theology of a savage in the style of a clown but it is quoted by walker as mr alexander pedens mr john menzies testimony 1670 is all about hardened men whom though they walk with you for the present with horns of a lamb yet afterward ye may hear them speak with the mouth of a dragon pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides manse headrigg scarcely caricatures this eloquence or pedens many and long seventyeight years lefthand defections and fortynine years righthand extremes while professor simson in glasgow and mr glass in tealing both with edoms children cry raze raze the very foundation dr mccrie is reduced to supposing that some of the more absurd sermons were incorrectly reported very possibly they were but the reports were in the style which the people liked as if to remove all possible charge of partiality scott made the one faultless christian of his tale a covenanting widow the admirable bessie mclure but she says the doctor repeatedly banns and minces oaths in her conversation this outrageous conduct of bessies consists in saying gude protect us and in heavens name who are ye next the doctor congratulates scott on his talent for buffoonery oh le grand homme rien ne lui peut plaire scott is later accused of not making his peasants sufficiently intelligent  cuddie headrigg and jenny dennison suffice as answers to this censure  probably the best points made by dr mccrie are his proof that biblical names were not common among the covenanteers and that episcopal eloquence and episcopal superstition were often as tardy and as dark as the eloquence and superstition of the presbyterians he carries the war into the opposite camp with considerable success his best answer to old mortality would have been a novel as good and on the whole as fair written from the covenanting side hogg attempted this reply not to scotts pleasure according to the shepherd in the brownie of bodsbeck the shepherd says that when scott remarked that the brownie gave an untrue description of the age he replied its a devilish deal truer than yours scott in his defence says that to please the friends of the covenanters their portraits must be drawn without shadow and the objects of their political antipathy be blackened hooved and horned ere they will acknowledge the likeness of either he gives examples of clemency and even considerateness in dundee for example he did not bring with him a prisoner who laboured under a disease rendering it painful to him to be on horseback he examines the story of john brown and disproves the blacker circumstances yet he appears to hold that dundee should have resigned his commission rather than carry out the orders of government burleys character for ruthlessness is defended by the evidence of the scottish worthies as dr mccrie objects to his buffoonery it is odd that he palliates the strong propensity of knox to indulge his vein of humour when describing with ghoullike mirth the festive circumstances of the murder and burial of cardinal beaton the odious part of his satire scott says is confined to the fierce and unreasonable set of extrapresbyterians wodrows high flyers we have no delight to dwell either upon the atrocities or absurdities of a people whose ignorance and fanaticism were rendered frantic by persecution to sum up the controversy we may say that scott was unfair if at all in tone rather than in statement he grants to the covenanters dauntless resolution and fortitude he admits their wrongs we cannot see on the evidence of their literature that he exaggerates their grotesqueness their superstition their impossible attitude as of israelites under a theocracy which only existed as an ideal or their ruthlessness on certain occasions the books of wodrow kirkton and patrick walker the sermons the ghost stories the dying speeches the direct testimony of their own historians prove all that scott says a hundred times over the facts are correct the testimony to the presence of another an angelic temper remains immortal in the figure of bessie mclure but an unfairness of tone may be detected in the choice of such names as kettledrummle and poundtext probably the jogtrot friends of the indulgence have more right to complain than the highflying friends of the covenant scott had cavalier sympathies as macaulay had covenanting sympathies that scott is more unjust to the covenanters than macaulay to claverhouse historians will scarcely maintain neither history or fiction would be very delightful if they were warless  this must serve as an apology more needed by macaulaythan by sir walter his reply to dr mccrie is marked by excellent temper humour and good humor the quarterly review ends with the well known reference to his brother toms suspected authorship we intended here to conclude this long article when a strong report reached us of certain transatlantic confessions which if genuine though of this we know nothing assign a different author to those volumes than the party suspected by our scottish correspondents yet a critic may be excused for seizing upon the nearest suspected person or the principle happily expressed by claverhouse in a letter to the earl of linlithgow he had been it seems in search of a gifted weaver who used to hold forth at conventicles i sent for the webster they brought in his brother for him though he maybe cannot preach like his brother i doubt not but he is as well principled as he wherefore i thought it would be no great fault to give him the trouble to go to jail with the rest  nobody who read this could doubt that scott was at least art and part in the review his efforts to disguise himself as an englishman aided by a scotch antiquary are divertingly futile he seized the chance of defending his earlier works from some criticisms on scotch manners suggested by the ignorance of gifford nor was it difficult to see that the author of the review was also the author of the novel in later years lady louisa stuart reminded scott that old mortality like the iliad had been ascribed by clever critics to several hands working together on december 5 1816 she wrote to him i found something you wot of upon my table and as i dare not take it with me to a friends house for fear of arousing curiosityshe read it at once she could not sleep afterwards so much had she been excited manse and cuddie forced me to laugh out aloud which one seldom does when alone many of the scotch words were absolutely hebrew to her she not unjustly objected to claverhouses use of the word sentimental as an anachronism sentiment like nerves had not been invented in claverhouses day  the pecuniary success of old mortality was less perhaps than might have been expected the first edition was only of two thousand copies two editions of this number were sold in six weeks and a third was printed constables gallant enterprise of ten thousand in rob roy throws these figures into the shade  old mortality is the first of scotts works in which he invades history beyond the range of what may be called living oral tradition in waverley and even in rob roy he had the memories of invernahyle of miss nairne of many persons of the last generation for his guides in old mortality his fancy had to wander among the relics of another age among the inscribed tombs of the covenanters which are common in the west country as in the churchyards of balmaclellan and dalry there the dust of these enduring and courageous men like that of bessie bell and marion gray in the ballad beiks forenenst the sun which shines on them from beyond the hills of their wanderings while the brown waters of the ken murmur at their feet                 here now in peace sweet rest we take                once murdered for religions sake  says the epitaph on the flat tablestone beneath the wind tormented trees of iron gray concerning these manes presbyteriani guthries and giffans passions and the rest scott had a library of rare volumes full of prophecies remarkable providences angelic ministrations diabolical persecutions by the accuser of the brethrenin fact all that covenanteers had written or that had been written about covenanteers ill tickle ye off a covenanter as readily as old jack could do a young prince and a rare fellow he is when brought forth in his true colours he says to terry november 12 1816 he certainly was not an unprejudiced witness some ten years earlier when he wrote to southey you can hardly conceive the perfidy cruelty and stupidity of these people according to the accounts they have themselves preserved but i admit i had many prejudices instilled into me as my ancestor was a killiecrankie man he used to tease grahame of the sabbath but never out of his good humour by praising dundee and laughing at the covenanters even as a boy he had been familiar with that godly company in the original edition of the lives of cameron and others by patrick walker the more curious parts of those biographies were excised by the care of later editors but they may all be found now in the biographia presbyteriana 1827 published by true jock chief clerk to leein johnnie mr john ballantyne to this work the inquirer may turn if he is anxious to see whether scotts colouring is correct the true blue of the covenant is not dulled in the biographia presbyteriana  with all these materials at his command scott was able almost to dwell in the age of the covenant hence the extraordinary life and brilliance of this his first essay in fiction dealing with a remote time and obsolete manners his opening though it may seem long and uninviting to modern readers is interesting for the sympathetic sketch of the gentle consumptive dominie if there was any class of men whom sir walter could not away with it was the race of schoolmasters black cattle whom he neither trusted nor respected but he could make or invent exceptions as in the uncomplaining and kindly usher of the verbose cleishbotham once launched in his legend with the shooting of the popinjay he never falters the gallant dauntless overbearing bothwell the dour burley the handful of preachers representing every current of opinion in the covenant the awful figure of habakkuk mucklewrath the charm of goodness in bessie mclure are all immortal deathless as shakspeares men and women indeed here even more than elsewhere we admire the life which scott breathes into his minor characters halliday and inglis the troopers the child who leads morton to burleys retreat in the cave that auld laird nippy old milnwood a real laird nippy was a neighbour of scotts at ashiestiel ailie wilson the kind crabbed old housekeeper generous in great things though habitually niggardly in things small most of these are persons whom we might still meet in scotland as we might meet cuddie headriggthe shrewd the blithe the faithful and humorous cuddie as to miss jenny dennison we can hardly forgive scott for making that gayest of soubrettes hard and selfish in married life he is too severe on the harmless and even beneficent race of coquettes who brighten life so much who so rapidly draw up with the new pleugh lad and who do so very little harm when all is said jenny plays the part of a leal and brave lass in the siege of tillietudlem hunger and terror do not subdue her spirit she is true in spite of many temptations to her cuddie and we decline to believe that she was untrue to his master and friend ikuse no doubt is a caricature though wodrow makes us acquainted with at least one mause jean biggart who all the winter over was exceedingly straitened in wrestling and prayer as to the parliament and said that still that place was brought before her our hedges are broken down analecta ii 173 surely even dr mccrie must have laughed out loud like lady louisa stuart when mause exclaims neither will i peace for the bidding of no earthly potsherd though it be painted as red as a brick from the tower o babel and ca itsel a corporal manse as we have said is not more comic than heroic a mother in that sparta of the covenant the figure of morton as usual is not very attractive in his review scott explains the weakness of his heroes as usually strangers in the land waverley lovel mannering osbaldistone who need to have everything explained to them and who are less required to move than to be the pivots of the general movement but morton is no stranger in the land his political position in the juste milieu is unexciting a schoolboy wrote to scott at this time oh sir walter how could you take the lady from the gallant cavalier and give her to the cropeared covenanter probably scott sympathised with his young critic who longed to be a feudal chief and to see his retainers happy around him but edith bellenden loved morton with that love which as she said and thought disturbs the repose of the dead scott had no choice besides dr mccrie might have disapproved of so fortunate an arrangement the heroine herself does not live in the memory like di vernon she does not even live like jenny dennison we remember corporal raddlebanes better the stoutest fighting man of major bellendens acquaintance and the lady of tillietudlem has admirers more numerous and more constant the lovers of the tale chiefly engage our interest by the rare constancy of their affections  the most disputed character is of course that of claverhouse there is no doubt that if claverhouse had been a man of the ordinary mould he would never have reckoned so many enthusiastic friends in future ages but beauty which makes helen immortal had put its seal on bonny dundee with that face which limners might have loved to paint and ladies to look upon he still conquers hearts from his dark corner above the private staircase in sir walters deserted study he was brave he was loyal when all the world forsook his master in that reckless age of revelry he looks on with the austere and noble contempt which he wears in hell among the tippling shades of cavaliers he died in the arms of victory but he lives among                           the chiefs of ancient names      who swore to fight and die beneath the banner of king james      and he fell in killiecrankie pass the glory of the grahames  sentiment in romance not in history may be excused for pardoning the rest  critics of the time as lady louisa stuart reminds sir walter did not believe the book was his because it lacked his tedious descriptions the descriptions as of the waterfall where burley had his den are indeed far from tedious there is a tendency in scott to exalt into mountains his own grey hills the bosses verdatres as prosper merimee called them of the border but the horrors of such linns as that down which hab dab and davie dinn dang the deil are not exaggerated  old mortality was the last novel written by scott before the malady which tormented his stoicism in 18171820 every reader has his own favourite but few will place this glorious tale lower than second in the list of his incomparable romances  andrew lang      introduction to the tales of my landlord  as i may without vanity presume that the name and official description prefixed to this proem will secure it from the sedate and reflecting part of mankind to whom only i would be understood to address myself such attention as is due to the sedulous instructor of youth and the careful performer of my sabbath duties i will forbear to hold up a candle to the daylight or to point out to the judicious those recommendations of my labours which they must necessarily anticipate from the perusal of the titlepage nevertheless i am not unaware that as envy always dogs merit at the heels there may be those who will whisper that albeit my learning and good principles cannot lauded be the heavens be denied by any one yet that my situation at gandercleugh hath been more favourable to my acquisitions in learning than to the enlargement of my views of the ways and works of the present generation to the which objection if peradventure any such shall be started my answer shall be threefold  first gandercleugh is as it were the central partthe navel si fas sit dicere of this our native realm of scotland so that men from every corner thereof when travelling on their concernments of business either towards our metropolis of law by which i mean edinburgh or towards our metropolis and mart of gain whereby i insinuate glasgow are frequently led to make gandercleugh their abiding stage and place of rest for the night and it must be acknowledged by the most sceptical that i who have sat in the leathern armchair on the lefthand side of the fire in the common room of the wallace inn winter and summer for every evening in my life during forty years bypast the christian sabbaths only excepted must have seen more of the manners and customs of various tribes and people than if i had sought them out by my own painful travel and bodily labour even so doth the tollman at the wellfrequented turnpike on the wellbraehead sitting at his ease in his own dwelling gather more receipt of custom than if moving forth upon the road he were to require a contribution from each person whom he chanced to meet in his journey when according to the vulgar adage he might possibly be greeted with more kicks than halfpence  but secondly supposing it again urged that ithacus the most wise of the greeks acquired his renown as the roman poet hath assured us by visiting states and men i reply to the zoilus who shall adhere to this objection  that de facto i have seen states and men also for i have visited the famous cities of edinburgh and glasgow the former twice and the latter three times in the course of my earthly pilgrimage and moreover i had the honour to sit in the general assembly meaning as an auditor in the galleries thereof and have heard as much goodly speaking on the law of patronage as with the fructification thereof in mine own understanding hath made me be considered as an oracle upon that doctrine ever since my safe and happy return to gandercleugh  againand thirdly if it be nevertheless pretended that my information and knowledge of mankind however extensive and however painfully acquired by constant domestic enquiry and by foreign travel is natheless incompetent to the task of recording the pleasant narratives of my landlord i will let these critics know to their own eternal shame and confusion as well as to the abashment and discomfiture of all who shall rashly take up a song against me that i am not the writer redacter or compiler of the tales of my landlord nor am i in one single iota answerable for their contents more or less and now ye generation of critics who raise yourselves up as if it were brazen serpents to hiss with your tongues and to smite with your stings bow yourselves down to your native dust and acknowledge that yours have been the thoughts of ignorance and the words of vain foolishness lo ye are caught in your own snare and your own pit hath yawned for you turn then aside from the task that is too heavy for you destroy not your teeth by gnawing a file waste not your strength by spurning against a castle wall nor spend your breath in contending in swiftness with a fleet steed and let those weigh the tales of my landlord who shall bring with them the scales of candour cleansed from the rust of prejudice by the hands of intelligent modesty for these alone they were compiled as will appear from a brief narrative which my zeal for truth compelled me to make supplementary to the present proem  it is well known that my landlord was a pleasing and a facetious man acceptable unto all the parish of gandercleugh excepting only the laird the exciseman and those for whom he refused to draw liquor upon trust their causes of dislike i will touch separately adding my own refutation thereof  his honour the laird accused our landlord deceased of having encouraged in various times and places the destruction of hares rabbits fowls black and grey partridges moorpouts roedeer and other birds and quadrupeds at unlawful seasons and contrary to the laws of this realm which have secured in their wisdom the slaughter of such animals for the great of the earth whom i have remarked to take an uncommon though to me an unintelligible pleasure therein now in humble deference to his honour and in justifiable defence of my friend deceased i reply to this charge that howsoever the form of such animals might appear to be similar to those so protected by the law yet it was a mere deceptio visus for what resembled hares were in fact hillkids and those partaking of the appearance of moorfowl were truly wood pigeons and consumed and eaten eo nomine and not otherwise again the exciseman pretended that my deceased landlord did encourage that species of manufacture called distillation without having an especial permission from the great technically called a license for doing so now i stand up to confront this falsehood and in defiance of him his gaugingstick and pen and inkhorn i tell him that i never saw or tasted a glass of unlawful aqua vitae in the house of my landlord nay that on the contrary we needed not such devices in respect of a pleasing and somewhat seductive liquor which was vended and consumed at the wallace inn under the name of mountain dew if there is a penalty against manufacturing such a liquor let him show me the statute and when he does ill tell him if i will obey it or no concerning those who came to my landlord for liquor and went thirsty away for lack of present coin or future credit i cannot but say it has grieved my bowels as if the case had been mine own nevertheless my landlord considered the necessities of a thirsty soul and would permit them in extreme need and when their soul was impoverished for lack of moisture to drink to the full value of their watches and wearing apparel exclusively of their inferior habiliments which he was uniformly inexorable in obliging them to retain for the credit of the house as to mine own part i may well say that he never refused me that modicum of refreshment with which i am wont to recruit nature after the fatigues of my school it is true i taught his five sons english and latin writing bookkeeping with a tincture of mathematics and that i instructed his daughter in psalmody nor do i remember me of any fee or honorarium received from him on account of these my labours except the compotations aforesaid nevertheless this compensation suited my humour well since it is a hard sentence to bid a dry throat wait till quarterday  but truly were i to speak my simple conceit and belief i think my landlord was chiefly moved to waive in my behalf the usual requisition of a symbol or reckoning from the pleasure he was wont to take in my conversation which though solid and edifying in the main was like a wellbuilt palace decorated with facetious narratives and devices tending much to the enhancement and ornament thereof and so pleased was my landlord of the wallace in his replies during such colloquies that there was no district in scotland yea and no peculiar and as it were distinctive custom therein practised but was discussed betwixt us insomuch that those who stood by were wont to say it was worth a bottle of ale to hear us communicate with each other and not a few travellers from distant parts as well as from the remote districts of our kingdom were wont to mingle in the conversation and to tell news that had been gathered in foreign lands or preserved from oblivion in this our own now i chanced to have contracted for teaching the lower classes with a young person called peter or patrick pattieson who had been educated for our holy kirk yea had by the license of presbytery his voice opened therein as a preacher who delighted in the collection of olden tales and legends and in garnishing them with the flowers of poesy whereof he was a vain and frivolous professor for he followed not the example of those strong poets whom i proposed to him as a pattern but formed versification of a flimsy and modern texture to the compounding whereof was necessary small pains and less thought and hence i have chid him as being one of those who bring forward the fatal revolution prophesied by mr robert carey in his vaticination on the death of the celebrated dr john donne            now thou art gone and thy strict laws will be           too hard for libertines in poetry           till verse by thee refined in this last age           turn ballad rhyme  i had also disputations with him touching his indulging rather a flowing and redundant than a concise and stately diction in his prose exercitations but notwithstanding these symptoms of inferior taste and a humour of contradicting his betters upon passages of dubious construction in latin authors i did grievously lament when peter pattieson was removed from me by death even as if he had been the offspring of my own loins and in respect his papers had been left in my care to answer funeral and deathbed expenses i conceived myself entitled to dispose of one parcel thereof entitled tales of my landlord to one cunning in the trade as it is called of book selling he was a mirthful man of small stature cunning in counterfeiting of voices and in making facetious tales and responses and whom i have to laud for the truth of his dealings towards me now therefore the world may see the injustice that charges me with incapacity to write these narratives seeing that though i have proved that i could have written them if i would yet not having done so the censure will deservedly fall if at all due upon the memory of mr peter pattieson whereas i must be justly entitled to the praise when any is due seeing that as the dean of st patricks wittily and logically expresseth it                 that without which a thing is not                is causa sine qua non  the work therefore is unto me as a child is to a parent in the which child if it proveth worthy the parent hath honour and praise but if otherwise the disgrace will deservedly attach to itself alone  i have only further to intimate that mr peter pattieson in arranging these tales for the press hath more consulted his own fancy than the accuracy of the narrative nay that he hath sometimes blended two or three stories together for the mere grace of his plots of which infidelity although i disapprove and enter my testimony against it yet i have not taken upon me to correct the same in respect it was the will of the deceased that his manuscript should be submitted to the press without diminution or alteration a fanciful nicety it was on the part of my deceased friend who if thinking wisely ought rather to have conjured me by all the tender ties of our friendship and common pursuits to have carefully revised altered and augmented at my judgment and discretion but the will of the dead must be scrupulously obeyed even when we weep over their pertinacity and selfdelusion so gentle reader i bid you farewell recommending you to such fare as the mountains of your own country produce and i will only farther premise that each tale is preceded by a short introduction mentioning the persons by whom and the circumstances under which the materials thereof were collected                                    jedediah cleishbotham      introduction to old mortality  the remarkable person called by the title of old mortality was well known in scotland about the end of the last century his real name was robert paterson he was a native it is said of the parish of closeburn in dumfriesshire and probably a mason by professionat least educated to the use of the chisel whether family dissensions or the deep and enthusiastic feeling of supposed duty drove him to leave his dwelling and adopt the singular mode of life in which he wandered like a palmer through scotland is not known it could not be poverty however which prompted his journeys for he never accepted anything beyond the hospitality which was willingly rendered him and when that was not proffered he always had money enough to provide for his own humble wants his personal appearance and favourite or rather sole occupation are accurately described in the preliminary chapter of the following work  it is about thirty years since or more that the author met this singular person in the churchyard of dunnottar when spending a day or two with the late learned and excellent clergyman mr walker the minister of that parish for the purpose of a close examination of the ruins of the castle of dunnottar and other subjects of antiquarian research in that neighbourhood old mortality chanced to be at the same place on the usual business of his pilgrimage for the castle of dunnottar though lying in the anticovenanting district of the mearns was with the parish churchyard celebrated for the oppressions sustained there by the cameronians in the time of james ii  it was in 1685 when argyle was threatening a descent upon scotland and monmouth was preparing to invade the west of england that the privy council of scotland with cruel precaution made a general arrest of more than a hundred persons in the southern and western provinces supposed from their religious principles to be inimical to government together with many women and children these captives were driven northward like a flock of bullocks but with less precaution to provide for their wants and finally penned up in a subterranean dungeon in the castle of dunnottar having a window opening to the front of a precipice which overhangs the german ocean they had suffered not a little on the journey and were much hurt both at the scoffs of the northern prelatists and the mocks gibes and contemptuous tunes played by the fiddlers and pipers who had come from every quarter as they passed to triumph over the revilers of their calling the repose which the melancholy dungeon afforded them was anything but undisturbed the guards made them pay for every indulgence even that of water and when some of the prisoners resisted a demand so unreasonable and insisted on their right to have this necessary of life untaxed their keepers emptied the water on the prison floor saying if they were obliged to bring water for the canting whigs they were not bound to afford them the use of bowls or pitchers gratis  in this prison which is still termed the whigs vault several died of the diseases incidental to such a situation and others broke their limbs and incurred fatal injury in desperate attempts to escape from their stern prisonhouse over the graves of these unhappy persons their friends after the revolution erected a monument with a suitable inscription  this peculiar shrine of the whig martyrs is very much honoured by their descendants though residing at a great distance from the land of their captivity and death my friend the rev mr walker told me that being once upon a tour in the south of scotland probably about forty years since he had the bad luck to involve himself in the labyrinth of passages and tracks which cross in every direction the extensive waste called lochar moss near dumfries out of which it is scarcely possible for a stranger to extricate himself and there was no small difficulty in procuring a guide since such people as he saw were engaged in digging their peatsa work of paramount necessity which will hardly brook interruption mr walker could therefore only procure unintelligible directions in the southern brogue which differs widely from that of the mearns he was beginning to think himself in a serious dilemma when he stated his case to a farmer of rather the better class who was employed as the others in digging his winter fuel the old man at first made the same excuse with those who had already declined acting as the travellers guide but perceiving him in great perplexity and paying the respect due to his profession you are a clergyman sir he said mr walker assented and i observe from your speech that you are from the northyou are right my good friend was the reply and may i ask if you have ever heard of a place called dunnottari ought to know something about it my friend said mr walker since i have been several years the minister of the parishi am glad to hear it said the dumfriesian for one of my near relations lies buried there and there is i believe a monument over his grave i would give half of what i am aught to know if it is still in existencehe was one of those who perished in the whigs vault at the castle said the minister for there are few southlanders besides lying in our churchyard and none i think having monumentseven saeeven sae said the old cameronian for such was the farmer he then laid down his spade cast on his coat and heartily offered to see the minister out of the moss if he should lose the rest of the days dargue mr walker was able to requite him amply in his opinion by reciting the epitaph which he remembered by heart the old man was enchanted with finding the memory of his grandfather or greatgrandfather faithfully recorded amongst the names of brother sufferers and rejecting all other offers of recompense only requested after he had guided mr walker to a safe and dry road that he would let him have a written copy of the inscription  it was whilst i was listening to this story and looking at the monument referred to that i saw old mortality engaged in his daily task of cleaning and repairing the ornaments and epitaphs upon the tomb his appearance and equipment were exactly as described in the novel i was very desirous to see something of a person so singular and expected to have done so as he took up his quarters with the hospitable and liberalspirited minister but though mr walker invited him up after dinner to partake of a glass of spirits and water to which he was supposed not to be very averse yet he would not speak frankly upon the subject of his occupation he was in bad humour and had according to his phrase no freedom for conversation with us  his spirit had been sorely vexed by hearing in a certain aberdonian kirk the psalmody directed by a pitchpipe or some similar instrument which was to old mortality the abomination of abominations perhaps after all he did not feel himself at ease with his company he might suspect the questions asked by a northcountry minister and a young barrister to savour more of idle curiosity than profit at any rate in the phrase of john bunyan old mortality went on his way and i saw him no more  the remarkable figure and occupation of this ancient pilgrim was recalled to my memory by an account transmitted by my friend mr joseph train supervisor of excise at dumfries to whom i owe many obligations of a similar nature from this besides some other circumstances among which are those of the old mans death i learned the particulars described in the text i am also informed that the old palmers family in the third generation survives and is highly respected both for talents and worth while these sheets were passing through the press i received the following communication from mr train whose undeviating kindness had during the intervals of laborious duty collected its materials from an indubitable source       in the course of my periodical visits to the glenkens i have      become intimately acquainted with robert paterson a son of old      mortality who lives in the little village of balmaclellan and      although he is now in the 70th year of his age preserves all the      vivacity of youthhas a most retentive memory and a mind stored      with information far above what could be expected from a person in      his station of life to him i am indebted for the following      particulars relative to his father and his descendants down to the      present time       robert paterson alias old mortality was the son of walter      paterson and margaret scott who occupied the farm of ilaggisha in      the parish of hawick during nearly the first half of the eighteenth      century here robert was born in the memorable year 1715       being the youngest son of a numerous family he at an early age      went to serve with an elder brother named francis who rented from      sir john jardine of applegarth a small tract in comcockle moor      near lochmaben during his residence there he became acquainted      with elizabeth gray daughter of robert gray gardener to sir john      jardine whom he afterwards married his wife had been for a      considerable time a cookmaid to sir thomas kirkpatrick of      closeburn who procured for her husband from the duke of      queensberry an advantageous lease of the freestone quarry of      gatelowbrigg in the parish of morton here he built a house and      had as much land as kept a horse and cow my informant cannot say      with certainty the year in which his father took up his residence      at gatelowbrigg but he is sure it must have been only a short time      prior to the year 1746 as during the memorable frost in 1740 he      says his mother still resided in the service of sir thomas      kirkpatrick when the highlanders were returning from england on      their route to glasgow in the year 17456 they plundered mr      patersons house at gatelowbrigg and carried him a prisoner as far      as glenbuck merely because he said to one of the straggling army      that their retreat might have been easily foreseen as the strong      arm of the lord was evidently raised not only against the bloody      and wicked house of stewart but against all who attempted to      support the abominable heresies of the church of rome from this      circumstance it appears that old mortality had even at that early      period of his life imbibed the religious enthusiasm by which he      afterwards became so much distinguished       the religious sect called hillmen or cameronians was at that      time much noted for austerity and devotion in imitation of cameron      their founder of whose tenets old mortality became a most strenuous      supporter he made frequent journeys into galloway to attend their      conventicles and occasionally carried with him gravestones from his      quarry at gatelowbrigg to keep in remembrance the righteous whose      dust had been gathered to their fathers old mortality was not one      of those religious devotees who although one eye is seemingly      turned towards heaven keep the other steadfastly fixed on some      sublunary object as his enthusiasm increased his journeys into      galloway became more frequent and he gradually neglected even the      common prudential duty of providing for his offspring from about      the year 1758 he neglected wholly to return from galloway to his      wife and five children at gatelowbrigg which induced her to send      her eldest son walter then only twelve years of age to galloway      in search of his father after traversing nearly the whole of that      extensive district from the nick of benncorie to the fell of      barullion he found him at last working on the cameronian monuments      in the old kirkyard of kirkchrist on the west side of the dee      opposite the town of kirkcudbright the little wanderer used all the      influence in his power to induce his father to return to his family      but in vain mrs paterson sent even some of her female children      into galloway in search of their father for the same purpose of      persuading him to return home but without any success at last in      the summer of 1768 she removed to the little upland village of      balmaclellan in the glenkens of galloway where upon the small      pittance derived from keeping a little school she supported her      numerous family in a respectable manner       there is a small monumental stone in the farm of the caldon near      the house of the hill in wigtonshire which is highly venerated as      being the first erected by old mortality to the memory of several      persons who fell at that place in defence of their religious tenets      in the civil war in the reign of charles second       from the caldon the labours of old mortality in the course of      time spread over nearly all the lowlands of scotland there are few      churchyards in ayrshire galloway or dumfriesshire where the work      of his chisel is not yet to be seen it is easily distinguished from      the work of any other artist by the primitive rudeness of the      emblems of death and of the inscriptions which adorn the illformed      blocks of his erection this task of repairing and erecting      gravestones practised without fee or reward was the only      ostensible employment of this singular person for upwards of forty      years the door of every cameronians house was indeed open to him      at all times when he chose to enter and he was gladly received as      an inmate of the family but he did not invariably accept of these      civilities as may be seen by the following account of his frugal      expenses found amongst other little papers some of which i have      likewise in my possession in his pocketbook after his death            gatehouse of fleet 4th february 1796           robert paterbon debtor to margaret chrystale           to drye lodginge for seven weeks 0  4  1           to four auchlet of ait

name      of old keelybags who deals in the keel or chalk with which farmers      mark their flocks  this statement shows the religious wanderer to have been very poor in his old age but he was so more by choice than through necessity as at the period here alluded to his children were all comfortably situated and were most anxious to keep their father at home but no entreaty could induce him to alter his erratic way of life he travelled from one churchyard to another mounted on his old white pony till the last day of his existence and died as you have described at bankhill near lockerby on the 14th february 1801 in the 86th year of his age as soon as his body was found intimation was sent to his sons at balmaclellan but from the great depth of the snow at that time the letter communicating the particulars of his death was so long detained by the way that the remains of the pilgrim were interred before any of his relations could arrive at bankhill  the following is an exact copy of the account of his funeral expensesthe original of which i have in my possession            memorandum of the funral charges of robert paterson           who dyed at bankhill on the 14th day

account is authenticated by the son of the deceased  my friend was prevented by indisposition from even going to bankhill to attend the funeral of his father which i regret very much as he is not aware in what churchyard he was interred  for the purpose of erecting a small monument to his memory i have made every possible enquiry wherever i thought there was the least chance of finding out where old mortality was laid but i have done so in vain as his death is not registered in the sessionbook of any of the neighbouring parishes i am sorry to think that in all probability this singular person who spent so many years of his lengthened existence in striving with his chisel and mallet to perpetuate the memory of many less deserving than himself must remain even without a single stone to mark out the resting place of his mortal remains  old mortality had three sons robert walter and john the former as has been already mentioned lives in the village of balmaclellan in comfortable circumstances and is much respected by his neighbours walter died several years ago leaving behind him a family now respectably situated in this point john went to america in the year 1776 and after various turns of fortune settled at baltimore  old nol himself is said to have loved an innocent jest see captain hodgsons memoirs old mortality somewhat resembled the protector in this turn to festivity like master silence he had been merry twice and once in his time but even his jests were of a melancholy and sepulchral nature and sometimes attended with inconvenience to himself as will appear from the following anecdote  the old man was at one time following his wonted occupation of repairing the tombs of the martyrs in the churchyard of girthon and the sexton of the parish was plying his kindred task at no small distance some roguish urchins were sporting near them and by their noisy gambols disturbing the old men in their serious occupation the most petulant of the juvenile party were two or three boys grandchildren of a person well known by the name of cooper climent this artist enjoyed almost a monopoly in girthon and the neighbouring parishes for making and selling ladles caups bickers bowls spoons cogues and trenchers formed of wood for the use of the country people it must be noticed that notwithstanding the excellence of the coopers vessels they were apt when new to impart a reddish tinge to whatever liquor was put into them a circumstance not uncommon in like cases  the grandchildren of this dealer in wooden work took it into their head to ask the sexton what use he could possibly make of the numerous fragments of old coffins which were thrown up in opening new graves do you not know said old mortality that he sells them to your grandfather who makes them into spoons trenchers bickers bowies and so forth at this assertion the youthful group broke up in great confusion and disgust on reflecting how many meals they had eaten out of dishes which by old mortalitys account were only fit to be used at a banquet of witches or of ghoules they carried the tidings home when many a dinner was spoiled by the loathing which the intelligence imparted for the account of the materials was supposed to explain the reddish tinge which even in the days of the coopers fame had seemed somewhat suspicious the ware of cooper climent was rejected in horror much to the benefit of his rivals the muggers who dealt in earthenware the man of cuttyspoon and ladle saw his trade interrupted and learned the reason by his quondam customers coming upon him in wrath to return the goods which were composed of such unhallowed materials and demand repayment of their money in this disagreeable predicament the forlorn artist cited old mortality into a court of justice where he proved that the wood he used in his trade was that of the staves of old winepipes bought from smugglers with whom the country then abounded a circumstance which fully accounted for their imparting a colour to their contents old mortality himself made the fullest declaration that he had no other purpose in making the assertion than to check the petulance of the children but it is easier to take away a good name than to restore it cooper climents business continued to languish and he died in a state of poverty   illustration frontispiece     volume i     chapter i  preliminary                      why seeks he with unwearied toil                     through deaths dim walks to urge his way                     reclaim his longasserted spoil                     and lead oblivion into day                                         langhorne  most readers says the manuscript of mr pattieson must have witnessed with delight the joyous burst which attends the dismissing of a villageschool on a fine summer evening the buoyant spirit of childhood repressed with so much difficulty during the tedious hours of discipline may then be seen to explode as it were in shout and song and frolic as the little urchins join in groups on their playground and arrange their matches of sport for the evening but there is one individual who partakes of the relief afforded by the moment of dismission whose feelings are not so obvious to the eye of the spectator or so apt to receive his sympathy i mean the teacher himself who stunned with the hum and suffocated with the closeness of his schoolroom has spent the whole day himself against a host in controlling petulance exciting indifference to action striving to enlighten stupidity and labouring to soften obstinacy and whose very powers of intellect have been confounded by hearing the same dull lesson repeated a hundred times by rote and only varied by the various blunders of the reciters even the flowers of classic genius with which his solitary fancy is most gratified have been rendered degraded in his imagination by their connexion with tears with errors and with punishment so that the eclogues of virgil and odes of horace are each inseparably allied in association with the sullen figure and monotonous recitation of some blubbering schoolboy if to these mental distresses are added a delicate frame of body and a mind ambitious of some higher distinction than that of being the tyrant of childhood the reader may have some slight conception of the relief which a solitary walk in the cool of a fine summer evening affords to the head which has ached and the nerves which have been shattered for so many hours in plying the irksome task of public instruction  to me these evening strolls have been the happiest hours of an unhappy life and if any gentle reader shall hereafter find pleasure in perusing these lucubrations i am not unwilling he should know that the plan of them has been usually traced in those moments when relief from toil and clamour combined with the quiet scenery around me has disposed my mind to the task of composition  my chief haunt in these hours of golden leisure is the banks of the small stream which winding through a lone vale of green bracken passes in front of the village schoolhouse of gandercleugh for the first quarter of a mile perhaps i may be disturbed from my meditations in order to return the scrape or doffed bonnet of such stragglers among my pupils as fish for trouts or minnows in the little brook or seek rushes and wildflowers by its margin but beyond the space i have mentioned the juvenile anglers do not after sunset voluntarily extend their excursions the cause is that farther up the narrow valley and in a recess which seems scooped out of the side of the steep heathy bank there is a deserted burialground which the little cowards are fearful of approaching in the twilight to me however the place has an inexpressible charm it has been long the favourite termination of my walks and if my kind patron forgets not his promise will and probably at no very distant day be my final restingplace after my mortal pilgrimage note note by mr jedediah cleishbothamthat i kept my plight in this melancholy matter with my deceased and lamented friend appeareth from a handsome headstone erected at my proper charges in this spot bearing the name and calling of peter pattieson with the date of his nativity and sepulture together also with a testimony of his merits attested by myself as his superior and patronj c  it is a spot which possesses all the solemnity of feeling attached to a burialground without exciting those of a more unpleasing description having been very little used for many years the few hillocks which rise above the level plain are covered with the same short velvet turf the monuments of which there are not above seven or eight are half sunk in the ground and overgrown with moss no newlyerected tomb disturbs the sober serenity of our reflections by reminding us of recent calamity and no rankspringing grass forces upon our imagination the recollection that it owes its dark luxuriance to the foul and festering remnants of mortality which ferment beneath the daisy which sprinkles the sod and the harebell which hangs over it derive their pure nourishment from the dew of heaven and their growth impresses us with no degrading or disgusting recollections death has indeed been here and its traces are before us but they are softened and deprived of their horror by our distance from the period when they have been first impressed those who sleep beneath are only connected with us by the reflection that they have once been what we now are and that as their relics are now identified with their mother earth ours shall at some future period undergo the same transformation  yet although the moss has been collected on the most modern of these humble tombs during four generations of mankind the memory of some of those who sleep beneath them is still held in reverent remembrance it is true that upon the largest and to an antiquary the most interesting monument of the group which bears the effigies of a doughty knight in his hood of mail with his shield hanging on his breast the armorial bearings are defaced by time and a few wornout letters may be read at the pleasure of the decipherer dns johande hamelor johande lameland it is also true that of another tomb richly sculptured with an ornamental cross mitre and pastoral staff tradition can only aver that a certain nameless bishop lies interred there but upon other two stones which lie beside may still be read in rude prose and ruder rhyme the history of those who sleep beneath them they belong we are assured by the epitaph to the class of persecuted presbyterians who afforded a melancholy subject for history in the times of charles ii and his successor note james seventh king of scotland of that name and second according to the numeration of the kings of englandj c in returning from the battle of pentland hills a party of the insurgents had been attacked in this glen by a small detachment of the kings troops and three or four either killed in the skirmish or shot after being made prisoners as rebels taken with arms in their hands the peasantry continued to attach to the tombs of those victims of prelacy an honour which they do not render to more splendid mausoleums and when they point them out to their sons and narrate the fate of the sufferers usually conclude by exhorting them to be ready should times call for it to resist to the death in the cause of civil and religious liberty like their brave forefathers  although i am far from venerating the peculiar tenets asserted by those who call themselves the followers of those men and whose intolerance and narrowminded bigotry are at least as conspicuous as their devotional zeal yet it is without depreciating the memory of those sufferers many of whom united the independent sentiments of a hampden with the suffering zeal of a hooper or latimer on the other hand it would be unjust to forget that many even of those who had been most active in crushing what they conceived the rebellious and seditious spirit of those unhappy wanderers displayed themselves when called upon to suffer for their political and religious opinions the same daring and devoted zeal tinctured in their case with chivalrous loyalty as in the former with republican enthusiasm it has often been remarked of the scottish character that the stubbornness with which it is moulded shows most to advantage in adversity when it seems akin to the native sycamore of their hills which scorns to be biassed in its mode of growth even by the influence of the prevailing wind but shooting its branches with equal boldness in every direction shows no weatherside to the storm and may be broken but can never be bended it must be understood that i speak of my countrymen as they fall under my own observation when in foreign countries i have been informed that they are more docile but it is time to return from this digression  one summer evening as in a stroll such as i have described i approached this deserted mansion of the dead i was somewhat surprised to hear sounds distinct from those which usually soothe its solitude the gentle chiding namely of the brook and the sighing of the wind in the boughs of three gigantic ashtrees which mark the cemetery the clink of a hammer was on this occasion distinctly heard and i entertained some alarm that a marchdike long meditated by the two proprietors whose estates were divided by my favourite brook was about to be drawn up the glen in order to substitute its rectilinear deformity for the graceful winding of the natural boundary note i deem it fitting that the reader should be apprised that this limitary boundary between the conterminous heritable property of his honour the laird of gandercleugh and his honour the laird of gusedub was to have been in fashion an agger or rather murus of uncemented granite called by the vulgar a drystane dyke surmounted or coped cespite viridi ie with a sodturf truly their honours fell into discord concerning two roods of marshy ground near the cove called the bedrals beild and the controversy having some years bygone been removed from before the judges of the land with whom it abode long even unto the great city of london and the assembly of the nobles therein is as i may say adhuc in pendentej c as i approached i was agreeably undeceived an old man was seated upon the monument of the slaughtered presbyterians and busily employed in deepening with his chisel the letters of the inscription which announcing in scriptural language the promised blessings of futurity to be the lot of the slain anathematized the murderers with corresponding violence a blue bonnet of unusual dimensions covered the grey hairs of the pious workman his dress was a large oldfashioned coat of the coarse cloth called hoddingrey usually worn by the elder peasants with waistcoat and breeches of the same and the whole suit though still in decent repair had obviously seen a train of long service strong clouted shoes studded with hobnails and gramoches or leggins made of thick black cloth completed his equipment beside him fed among the graves a pony the companion of his journey whose extreme whiteness as well as its projecting bones and hollow eyes indicated its antiquity it was harnessed in the most simple manner with a pair of branks a hair tether or halter and a sunk or cushion of straw instead of bridle and saddle a canvass pouch hung around the neck of the animal for the purpose probably of containing the riders tools and any thing else he might have occasion to carry with him although i had never seen the old man before yet from the singularity of his employment and the style of his equipage i had no difficulty in recognising a religious itinerant whom i had often heard talked of and who was known in various parts of scotland by the title of old mortality   illustration the graveyard006   where this man was born or what was his real name i have never been able to learn nor are the motives which made him desert his home and adopt the erratic mode of life which he pursued known to me except very generally according to the belief of most people he was a native of either the county of dumfries or galloway and lineally descended from some of those champions of the covenant whose deeds and sufferings were his favourite theme he is said to have held at one period of his life a small moorland farm but whether from pecuniary losses or domestic misfortune he had long renounced that and every other gainful calling in the language of scripture he left his house his home and his kindred and wandered about until the day of his death a period of nearly thirty years  during this long pilgrimage the pious enthusiast regulated his circuit so as annually to visit the graves of the unfortunate covenanters who suffered by the sword or by the executioner during the reigns of the two last monarchs of the stewart line these are most numerous in the western districts of ayr galloway and dumfries but they are also to be found in other parts of scotland wherever the fugitives had fought or fallen or suffered by military or civil execution their tombs are often apart from all human habitation in the remote moors and wilds to which the wanderers had fled for concealment but wherever they existed old mortality was sure to visit them when his annual round brought them within his reach in the most lonely recesses of the mountains the moorfowl shooter has been often surprised to find him busied in cleaning the moss from the grey stones renewing with his chisel the halfdefaced inscriptions and repairing the emblems of death with which these simple monuments are usually adorned motives of the most sincere though fanciful devotion induced the old man to dedicate so many years of existence to perform this tribute to the memory of the deceased warriors of the church he considered himself as fulfilling a sacred duty while renewing to the eyes of posterity the decaying emblems of the zeal and sufferings of their forefathers and thereby trimming as it were the beaconlight which was to warn future generations to defend their religion even unto blood  in all his wanderings the old pilgrim never seemed to need or was known to accept pecuniary assistance it is true his wants were very few for wherever he went he found ready quarters in the house of some cameronian of his own sect or of some other religious person the hospitality which was reverentially paid to him he always acknowledged by repairing the gravestones if there existed any belonging to the family or ancestors of his host as the wanderer was usually to be seen bent on this pious task within the precincts of some country churchyard or reclined on the solitary tombstone among the heath disturbing the plover and the blackcock with the clink of his chisel and mallet with his old white pony grazing by his side he acquired from his converse among the dead the popular appellation of old mortality  the character of such a man could have in it little connexion even with innocent gaiety yet among those of his own religious persuasion he is reported to have been cheerful the descendants of persecutors or those whom he supposed guilty of entertaining similar tenets and the scoffers at religion by whom he was sometimes assailed he usually termed the generation of vipers conversing with others he was grave and sententious not without a cast of severity but he is said never to have been observed to give way to violent passion excepting upon one occasion when a mischievous truantboy defaced with a stone the nose of a cherubs face which the old man was engaged in retouching i am in general a sparer of the rod notwithstanding the maxim of solomon for which schoolboys have little reason to thank his memory but on this occasion i deemed it proper to show that i did not hate the childbut i must return to the circumstances attending my first interview with this interesting enthusiast  in accosting old mortality i did not fail to pay respect to his years and his principles beginning my address by a respectful apology for interrupting his labours the old man intermitted the operation of the chisel took off his spectacles and wiped them then replacing them on his nose acknowledged my courtesy by a suitable return encouraged by his affability i intruded upon him some questions concerning the sufferers on whose monument he was now employed to talk of the exploits of the covenanters was the delight as to repair their monuments was the business of his life he was profuse in the communication of all the minute information which he had collected concerning them their wars and their wanderings one would almost have supposed he must have been their contemporary and have actually beheld the passages which he related so much had he identified his feelings and opinions with theirs and so much had his narratives the circumstantiality of an eyewitness  we he said in a tone of exultationwe are the only true whigs carnal men have assumed that triumphant appellation following him whose kingdom is of this world which of them would sit six hours on a wet hillside to hear a godly sermon i trow an hour ot wad staw them they are neer a hair better than them that shamena to take upon themsells the persecuting name of bludethirsty tories selfseekers all of them strivers after wealth power and worldly ambition and forgetters alike of what has been dreed and done by the mighty men who stood in the gap in the great day of wrath nae wonder they dread the accomplishment of what was spoken by the mouth of the worthy mr peden that precious servant of the lord none of whose words fell to the ground that the french monzies note probably monsieurs it would seem that this was spoken during the apprehensions of invason from francepublishers sall rise as fast in the glens of ayr and the kenns of galloway as ever the highlandmen did in 1677 and now they are gripping to the bow and to the spear when they suld be mourning for a sinfu land and a broken covenant  soothing the old man by letting his peculiar opinions pass without contradiction and anxious to prolong conversation with so singular a character i prevailed upon him to accept that hospitality which mr cleishbotham is always willing to extend to those who need it in our way to the schoolmasters house we called at the wallace inn where i was pretty certain i should find my patron about that hour of the evening after a courteous interchange of civilities old mortality was with difficulty prevailed upon to join his host in a single glass of liquor and that on condition that he should be permitted to name the pledge which he prefaced with a grace of about five minutes and then with bonnet doffed and eyes uplifted drank to the memory of those heroes of the kirk who had first uplifted her banner upon the mountains as no persuasion could prevail on him to extend his conviviality to a second cup my patron accompanied him home and accommodated him in the prophets chamber as it is his pleasure to call the closet which holds a spare bed and which is frequently a place of retreat for the poor traveller note he might have added and for the rich also since i laud my stars the great of the earth have also taken harbourage in my poor domicile and during the service of my handmaiden dorothy who was buxom and comely of aspect his honour the laird of smackawa in his peregrinations to and from the metropolis was wont to prefer my prophets chamber even to the sanded chamber of dais in the wallace inn and to bestow a mutchkin as he would jocosely say to obtain the freedom of the house but in reality to assure himself of my company during the eveningj c  the next day i took leave of old mortality who seemed affected by the unusual attention with which i had cultivated his acquaintance and listened to his conversation after he had mounted not without difficulty the old white pony he took me by the hand and said the blessing of our master be with you young man my hours are like the ears of the latter harvest and your days are yet in the spring and yet you may be gathered into the garner of mortality before me for the sickle of death cuts down the green as oft as the ripe and there is a colour in your cheek that like the bud of the rose serveth oft to hide the worm of corruption wherefore labour as one who knoweth not when his master calleth and if it be my lot to return to this village after ye are gane hame to your ain place these auld withered hands will frame a stane of memorial that your name may not perish from among the people  i thanked old mortality for his kind intentions in my behalf and heaved a sigh not i think of regret so much as of resignation to think of the chance that i might soon require his good offices but though in all human probability he did not err in supposing that my span of life may be abridged in youth he had overestimated the period of his own pilgrimage on earth it is now some years since he has been missed in all his usual haunts while moss lichen and deerhair are fast covering those stones to cleanse which had been the business of his life about the beginning of this century he closed his mortal toils being found on the highway near lockerby in dumfriesshire exhausted and just expiring the old white pony the companion of all his wanderings was standing by the side of his dying master there was found about his person a sum of money sufficient for his decent interment which serves to show that his death was in no ways hastened by violence or by want the common people still regard his memory with great respect and many are of opinion that the stones which he repaired will not again require the assistance of the chisel they even assert that on the tombs where the manner of the martyrs murder is recorded their names have remained indelibly legible since the death of old mortality while those of the persecutors sculptured on the same monuments have been entirely defaced it is hardly necessary to say that this is a fond imagination and that since the time of the pious pilgrim the monuments which were the objects of his care are hastening like all earthly memorials into ruin or decay  my readers will of course understand that in embodying into one compressed narrative many of the anecdotes which i had the advantage of deriving from old mortality i have been far from adopting either his style his opinions or even his facts so far as they appear to have been distorted by party prejudice i have endeavoured to correct or verify them from the most authentic sources of tradition afforded by the representatives of either party  on the part of the presbyterians i have consulted such moorland farmers from the western districts as by the kindness of their landlords or otherwise have been able during the late general change of property to retain possession of the grazings on which their grandsires fed their flocks and herds i must own that of late days i have found this a limited source of information i have therefore called in the supplementary aid of those modest itinerants whom the scrupulous civility of our ancestors denominated travelling merchants but whom of late accommodating ourselves in this as in more material particulars to the feelings and sentiments of our more wealthy neighbours we have learned to call packmen or pedlars to country weavers travelling in hopes to get rid of their winter web but more especially to tailors who from their sedentary profession and the necessity in our country of exercising it by temporary residence in the families by whom they are employed may be considered as possessing a complete register of rural traditions i have been indebted for many illustrations of the narratives of old mortality much in the taste and spirit of the original  i had more difficulty in finding materials for correcting the tone of partiality which evidently pervaded those stores of traditional learning in order that i might be enabled to present an unbiassed picture of the manners of that unhappy period and at the same time to do justice to the merits of both parties but i have been enabled to qualify the narratives of old mortality and his cameronian friends by the reports of more than one descendant of ancient and honourable families who themselves decayed into the humble vale of life yet look proudly back on the period when their ancestors fought and fell in behalf of the exiled house of stewart i may even boast right reverend authority on the same score for more than one nonjuring bishop whose authority and income were upon as apostolical a scale as the greatest abominator of episcopacy could well desire have deigned while partaking of the humble cheer of the wallace inn to furnish me with information corrective of the facts which i learned from others there are also here and there a laird or two who though they shrug their shoulders profess no great shame in their fathers having served in the persecuting squadrons of earlshall and claverhouse from the gamekeepers of these gentlemen an office the most apt of any other to become hereditary in such families i have also contrived to collect much valuable information  upon the whole i can hardly fear that at this time in describing the operation which their opposite principles produced upon the good and bad men of both parties i can be suspected of meaning insult or injustice to either if recollection of former injuries extraloyalty and contempt and hatred of their adversaries produced rigour and tyranny in the one party it will hardly be denied on the other hand that if the zeal for gods house did not eat up the conventiclers it devoured at least to imitate the phrase of dryden no small portion of their loyalty sober sense and good breeding we may safely hope that the souls of the brave and sincere on either side have long looked down with surprise and pity upon the illappreciated motives which caused their mutual hatred and hostility while in this valley of darkness blood and tears peace to their memory let us think of them as the heroine of our only scottish tragedy entreats her lord to think of her departed sire                 o rake not up the ashes of our fathers                implacable resentment was their crime                and grievous has the expiation been      chapter ii                 summon an hundred horse by break of day                to wait our pleasure at the castle gates                                                   douglas  under the reign of the last stewarts there was an anxious wish on the part of government to counteract by every means in their power the strict or puritanical spirit which had been the chief characteristic of the republican government and to revive those feudal institutions which united the vassal to the liege lord and both to the crown frequent musters and assemblies of the people both for military exercise and for sports and pastimes were appointed by authority the interference in the latter case was impolitic to say the least for as usual on such occasions the consciences which were at first only scrupulous became confirmed in their opinions instead of giving way to the terrors of authority and the youth of both sexes to whom the pipe and tabor in england or the bagpipe in scotland would have been in themselves an irresistible temptation were enabled to set them at defiance from the proud consciousness that they were at the same time resisting an act of council to compel men to dance and be merry by authority has rarely succeeded even on board of slaveships where it was formerly sometimes attempted by way of inducing the wretched captives to agitate their limbs and restore the circulation during the few minutes they were permitted to enjoy the fresh air upon deck the rigour of the strict calvinists increased in proportion to the wishes of the government that it should be relaxed a judaical observance of the sabbatha supercilious condemnation of all manly pastimes and harmless recreations as well as of the profane custom of promiscuous dancing that is of men and women dancing together in the same party for i believe they admitted that the exercise might be inoffensive if practised by the parties separatelydistinguishing those who professed a more than ordinary share of sanctity they discouraged as far as lay in their power even the ancient wappenschaws as they were termed when the feudal array of the county was called out and each crownvassal was required to appear with such muster of men and armour as he was bound to make by his fief and that under high statutory penalties the covenanters were the more jealous of those assemblies as the lord lieutenants and sheriffs under whom they were held had instructions from the government to spare no pains which might render them agreeable to the young men who were thus summoned together upon whom the military exercise of the morning and the sports which usually closed the evening might naturally be supposed to have a seductive effect  the preachers and proselytes of the more rigid presbyterians laboured therefore by caution remonstrance and authority to diminish the attendance upon these summonses conscious that in doing so they lessened not only the apparent but the actual strength of the government by impeding the extension of that esprit de corps which soon unites young men who are in the habit of meeting together for manly sport or military exercise they therefore exerted themselves earnestly to prevent attendance on these occasions by those who could find any possible excuse for absence and were especially severe upon such of their hearers as mere curiosity led to be spectators or love of exercise to be partakers of the array and the sports which took place such of the gentry as acceded to these doctrines were not always however in a situation to be ruled by them the commands of the law were imperative and the privy council who administered the executive power in scotland were severe in enforcing the statutory penalties against the crownvassals who did not appear at the periodical wappenschaw the landholders were compelled therefore to send their sons tenants and vassals to the rendezvous to the number of horses men and spears at which they were rated and it frequently happened that notwithstanding the strict charge of their elders to return as soon as the formal inspection was over the young menatarms were unable to resist the temptation of sharing in the sports which succeeded the muster or to avoid listening to the prayers read in the churches on these occasions and thus in the opinion of their repining parents meddling with the accursed thing which is an abomination in the sight of the lord  the sheriff of the county of lanark was holding the wappenschaw of a wild district called the upper ward of clydesdale on a haugh or level plain near to a royal borough the name of which is no way essential to my story on the morning of the 5th of may 1679 when our narrative commences when the musters had been made and duly reported the young men as was usual were to mix in various sports of which the chief was to shoot at the popinjay an ancient game formerly practised with archery but at this period with firearms       note festival of the popinjay the festival of the popinjay is      still i believe practised at maybole in ayrshire the following      passage in the history of the somerville family suggested the      scenes in the text the author of that curious manuscript thus      celebrates his fathers demeanour at such an assembly       having now passed his infancie in the tenth year of his age he      was by his grandfather putt to the grammar school ther being then      att the toune of delserf a very able master that taught the grammar      and fitted boyes for the colledge dureing his educating in this      place they had then a custome every year to solemnize the first      sunday of may with danceing about a maypole fyreing of pieces and      all manner of ravelling then in use ther being at that tyme feu or      noe merchants in this pettie village to furnish necessaries for the      schollars sports this youth resolves to provide himself elsewhere      so that he may appear with the bravest in order to this by break      of day he ryses and goes to hamiltoune and there bestowes all the      money that for a long tyme before he had gotten from his freinds or      had otherwayes purchased upon ribbones of diverse coloures a new      hatt and gloves but in nothing he bestowed his money more      liberallie than upon gunpowder a great quantitie whereof he buyes      for his owne use and to supplie the wantes of his comerades thus      furnished with these commodities but ane empty purse he returnes      to delserf by seven a clock haveing travelled that sabbath morning      above eight myles puttes on his cloathes and new hatt flying with      ribbones of all culloures and in this equipage with his little      phizie fusee upon his shoulder he marches to the church yaird      where the maypole was sett up and the solemnitie of that day was      to be kept there first at the football he equalled any one that      played but in handleing his piece in chargeing and dischargeing      he was so ready and shott so near the marke that he farre      surpassed all his fellow schollars and became a teacher of that art      to them before the thretteenth year of his oune age and really i      have often admired his dexterity in this both at the exercizeing of      his soulders and when for recreatione i have gone to the gunning      with him when i was but a stripeling myself and albeit that      passetyme was the exercize i delighted most in yet could i never      attaine to any perfectione comparable to him this dayes sport being      over he had the applause of all the spectatores the kyndnesse of      his fellowcondisciples and the favour of the whole inhabitants of      that little village  this was the figure of a bird decked with partycoloured feathers so as to resemble a popinjay or parrot it was suspended to a pole and served for a mark at which the competitors discharged their fusees and carabines in rotation at the distance of sixty or seventy paces he whose ball brought down the mark held the proud title of captain of the popinjay for the remainder of the day and was usually escorted in triumph to the most reputable changehouse in the neighbourhood where the evening was closed with conviviality conducted under his auspices and if he was able to sustain it at his expense  it will of course be supposed that the ladies of the country assembled to witness this gallant strife those excepted who held the stricter tenets of puritanism and would therefore have deemed it criminal to afford countenance to the profane gambols of the malignants landaus barouches or tilburies there were none in those simple days the lord lieutenant of the county a personage of ducal rank alone pretended to the magnificence of a wheelcarriage a thing covered with tarnished gilding and sculpture in shape like the vulgar picture of noahs ark dragged by eight longtailed flanders mares bearing eight insides and six outsides the insides were their graces in person two maids of honour two children a chaplain stuffed into a sort of lateral recess formed by a projection at the door of the vehicle and called from its appearance the boot and an equerry to his grace ensconced in the corresponding convenience on the opposite side a coachman and three postilions who wore short swords and tiewigs with three tails had blunderbusses slung behind them and pistols at their saddlebow conducted the equipage on the footboard behind this moving mansionhouse stood or rather hung in triple file six lacqueys in rich liveries armed up to the teeth the rest of the gentry men and women old and young were on horseback followed by their servants but the company for the reasons already assigned was rather select than numerous  near to the enormous leathern vehicle which we have attempted to describe vindicating her title to precedence over the untitled gentry of the country might be seen the sober palfrey of lady margaret bellenden bearing the erect and primitive form of lady margaret herself decked in those widows weeds which the good lady had never laid aside since the execution of her husband for his adherence to montrose  her granddaughter and only earthly care the fairhaired edith who was generally allowed to be the prettiest lass in the upper ward appeared beside her aged relative like spring placed close to winter her black spanish jennet which she managed with much grace her gay ridingdress and laced sidesaddle had been anxiously prepared to set her forth to the best advantage but the clustering profusion of ringlets which escaping from under her cap were only confined by a green ribbon from wantoning over her shoulders her cast of features soft and feminine yet not without a certain expression of playful archness which redeemed their sweetness from the charge of insipidity sometimes brought against blondes and blueeyed beautiesthese attracted more admiration from the western youth than either the splendour of her equipments or the figure of her palfrey  the attendance of these distinguished ladies was rather inferior to their birth and fashion in those times as it consisted only of two servants on horseback the truth was that the good old lady had been obliged to make all her domestic servants turn out to complete the quota which her barony ought to furnish for the muster and in which she would not for the universe have been found deficient the old steward who in steel cap and jackboots led forth her array had as he said sweated blood and water in his efforts to overcome the scruples and evasions of the moorland farmers who ought to have furnished men horse and harness on these occasions at last their dispute came near to an open declaration of hostilities the incensed episcopalian bestowing on the recusants the whole thunders of the commination and receiving from them in return the denunciations of a calvinistic excommunication what was to be done to punish the refractory tenants would have been easy enough the privy council would readily have imposed fines and sent a troop of horse to collect them but this would have been calling the huntsman and hounds into the garden to kill the hare  for said harrison to himself the carles have little eneugh gear at ony rate and if i call in the redcoats and take away what little they have how is my worshipful lady to get her rents paid at candlemas which is but a difficult matter to bring round even in the best of times  so he armed the fowler and falconer the footman and the ploughman at the home farm with an old drunken cavaliering butler who had served with the late sir richard under montrose and stunned the family nightly with his exploits at kilsythe and tippermoor and who was the only man in the party that had the smallest zeal for the work in hand in this manner and by recruiting one or two latitudinarian poachers and blackfishers mr harrison completed the quota of men which fell to the share of lady margaret bellenden as liferentrix of the barony of tillietudlem and others but when the steward on the morning of the eventful day had mustered his troupe dore before the iron gate of the tower the mother of cuddie headrigg the ploughman appeared loaded with the jackboots buff coat and other accoutrements which had been issued forth for the service of the day and laid them before the steward demurely assuring him that whether it were the colic or a qualm of conscience she couldna tak upon her to decide but sure it was cuddie had been in sair straits a night and she couldna say he was muckle better this morning the finger of heaven she said was in it and her bairn should gang on nae sic errands pains penalties and threats of dismission were denounced in vain the mother was obstinate and cuddie who underwent a domiciliary visitation for the purpose of verifying his state of body could or would answer only by deep groans mause who had been an ancient domestic in the family was a sort of favourite with lady margaret and presumed accordingly lady margaret had herself set forth and her authority could not be appealed to in this dilemma the good genius of the old butler suggested an expedient  he had seen mony a braw callant far less than guse gibbie fight brawly under montrose what for no tak guse gibbie  this was a halfwitted lad of very small stature who had a kind of charge of the poultry under the old henwife for in a scottish family of that day there was a wonderful substitution of labour this urchin being sent for from the stubblefield was hastily muffled in the buff coat and girded rather to than with the sword of a fullgrown man his little legs plunged into jackboots and a steel cap put upon his head which seemed from its size as if it had been intended to extinguish him thus accoutred he was hoisted at his own earnest request upon the quietest horse of the party and prompted and supported by old gudyill the butler as his front file he passed muster tolerably enough the sheriff not caring to examine too closely the recruits of so wellaffected a person as lady margaret bellenden  to the above cause it was owing that the personal retinue of lady margaret on this eventful day amounted only to two lacqueys with which diminished train she would on any other occasion have been much ashamed to appear in public but for the cause of royalty she was ready at any time to have made the most unreserved personal sacrifices she had lost her husband and two promising sons in the civil wars of that unhappy period but she had received her reward for on his route through the west of scotland to meet cromwell in the unfortunate field of worcester charles the second had actually breakfasted at the tower of tillietudlem an incident which formed from that moment an important era in the life of lady margaret who seldom afterwards partook of that meal either at home or abroad without detailing the whole circumstances of the royal visit not forgetting the salutation which his majesty conferred on each side of her face though she sometimes omitted to notice that he bestowed the same favour on two buxom servingwenches who appeared at her back elevated for the day into the capacity of waiting gentlewomen   illustration tillietudlem castle128   these instances of royal favour were decisive and if lady margaret had not been a confirmed royalist already from sense of high birth influence of education and hatred to the opposite party through whom she had suffered such domestic calamity the having given a breakfast to majesty and received the royal salute in return were honours enough of themselves to unite her exclusively to the fortunes of the stewarts these were now in all appearance triumphant but lady margarets zeal had adhered to them through the worst of times and was ready to sustain the same severities of fortune should their scale once more kick the beam at present she enjoyed in full extent the military display of the force which stood ready to support the crown and stifled as well as she could the mortification she felt at the unworthy desertion of her own retainers  many civilities passed between her ladyship and the representatives of sundry ancient loyal families who were upon the ground by whom she was held in high reverence and not a young man of rank passed by them in the course of the muster but he carried his body more erect in the saddle and threw his horse upon its haunches to display his own horsemanship and the perfect bitting of his steed to the best advantage in the eyes of miss edith bellenden but the young cavaliers distinguished by high descent and undoubted loyalty attracted no more attention from edith than the laws of courtesy peremptorily demanded and she turned an indifferent ear to the compliments with which she was addressed most of which were little the worse for the wear though borrowed for the nonce from the laborious and longwinded romances of calprenede and scuderi the mirrors in which the youth of that age delighted to dress themselves ere folly had thrown her ballast overboard and cut down her vessels of the firstrate such as the romances of cyrus cleopatra and others into small craft drawing as little water or to speak more plainly consuming as little time as the little cockboat in which the gentle reader has deigned to embark it was however the decree of fate that miss bellenden should not continue to evince the same equanimity till the conclusion of the day      chapter iii                 horseman and horse confessd the bitter pang                and arms and warrior fell with heavy clang                                              pleasures of hope  when the military evolutions had been gone through tolerably well allowing for the awkwardness of men and of horses a loud shout announced that the competitors were about to step forth for the game of the popinjay already described the mast or pole having a yard extended across it from which the mark was displayed was raised amid the acclamations of the assembly and even those who had eyed the evolutions of the feudal militia with a sort of malignant and sarcastic sneer from disinclination to the royal cause in which they were professedly embodied could not refrain from taking considerable interest in the strife which was now approaching they crowded towards the goal and criticized the appearance of each competitor as they advanced in succession discharged their pieces at the mark and had their good or bad address rewarded by the laughter or applause of the spectators but when a slender young man dressed with great simplicity yet not without a certain air of pretension to elegance and gentility approached the station with his fusee in his hand his darkgreen cloak thrown back over his shoulder his laced ruff and feathered cap indicating a superior rank to the vulgar there was a murmur of interest among the spectators whether altogether favourable to the young adventurer it was difficult to discover  ewhow sirs to see his fathers son at the like o thae fearless follies was the ejaculation of the elder and more rigid puritans whose curiosity had so far overcome their bigotry as to bring them to the playground but the generality viewed the strife less morosely and were contented to wish success to the son of a deceased presbyterian leader without strictly examining the propriety of his being a competitor for the prize  their wishes were gratified at the first discharge of his piece the green adventurer struck the popinjay being the first palpable hit of the day though several balls had passed very near the mark a loud shout of applause ensued but the success was not decisive it being necessary that each who followed should have his chance and that those who succeeded in hitting the mark should renew the strife among themselves till one displayed a decided superiority over the others two only of those who followed in order succeeded in hitting the popinjay the first was a young man of low rank heavily built and who kept his face muffled in his grey cloak the second a gallant young cavalier remarkable for a handsome exterior sedulously decorated for the day he had been since the muster in close attendance on lady margaret and miss bellenden and had left them with an air of indifference when lady margaret had asked whether there was no young man of family and loyal principles who would dispute the prize with the two lads who had been successful in half a minute young lord evandale threw himself from his horse borrowed a gun from a servant and as we have already noticed hit the mark great was the interest excited by the renewal of the contest between the three candidates who had been hitherto successful the state equipage of the duke was with some difficulty put in motion and approached more near to the scene of action the riders both male and female turned their horses heads in the same direction and all eyes were bent upon the issue of the trial of skill  it was the etiquette in the second contest that the competitors should take their turn of firing after drawing lots the first fell upon the young plebeian who as he took his stand halfuncloaked his rustic countenance and said to the gallant in green ye see mr henry if it were ony other day i could hae wished to miss for your sake but jenny dennison is looking at us sae i maun do my best  he took his aim and his bullet whistled past the mark so nearly that the pendulous object at which it was directed was seen to shiver still however he had not hit it and with a downcast look he withdrew himself from further competition and hastened to disappear from the assembly as if fearful of being recognised the green chasseur next advanced and his ball a second time struck the popinjay all shouted and from the outskirts of the assembly arose a cry of the good old cause for ever  while the dignitaries bent their brows at these exulting shouts of the disaffected the young lord evandale advanced again to the hazard and again was successful the shouts and congratulations of the wellaffected and aristocratical part of the audience attended his success but still a subsequent trial of skill remained  the green marksman as if determined to bring the affair to a decision took his horse from a person who held him having previously looked carefully to the security of his girths and the fitting of his saddle vaulted on his back and motioning with his hand for the bystanders to make way set spurs passed the place from which he was to fire at a gallop and as he passed threw up the reins turned sideways upon his saddle discharged his carabine and brought down the popinjay lord evandale imitated his example although many around him said it was an innovation on the established practice which he was not obliged to follow but his skill was not so perfect or his horse was not so well trained the animal swerved at the moment his master fired and the ball missed the popinjay those who had been surprised by the address of the green marksman were now equally pleased by his courtesy he disclaimed all merit from the last shot and proposed to his antagonist that it should not be counted as a hit and that they should renew the contest on foot  i would prefer horseback if i had a horse as well bitted and probably as well broken to the exercise as yours said the young lord addressing his antagonist  will you do me the honour to use him for the next trial on condition you will lend me yours said the young gentleman  lord evandale was ashamed to accept this courtesy as conscious how much it would diminish the value of victory and yet unable to suppress his wish to redeem his reputation as a marksman he added that although he renounced all pretensions to the honour of the day which he said somewhat scornfully yet if the victor had no particular objection he would willingly embrace his obliging offer and change horses with him for the purpose of trying a shot for love  as he said so he looked boldly towards miss bellenden and tradition says that the eyes of the young tirailleur travelled though more covertly in the same direction the young lords last trial was as unsuccessful as the former and it was with difficulty that he preserved the tone of scornful indifference which he had hitherto assumed but conscious of the ridicule which attaches itself to the resentment of a losing party he returned to his antagonist the horse on which he had made his last unsuccessful attempt and received back his own giving at the same time thanks to his competitor who he said had reestablished his favourite horse in his good opinion for he had been in great danger of transferring to the poor nag the blame of an inferiority which every one as well as himself must now be satisfied remained with the rider having made this speech in a tone in which mortification assumed the veil of indifference he mounted his horse and rode off the ground  as is the usual way of the world the applause and attention even of those whose wishes had favoured lord evandale were upon his decisive discomfiture transferred to his triumphant rival  who is he what is his name ran from mouth to mouth among the gentry who were present to few of whom he was personally known his style and title having soon transpired and being within that class whom a great man might notice without derogation four of the dukes friends with the obedient start which poor malvolio ascribes to his imaginary retinue made out to lead the victor to his presence as they conducted him in triumph through the crowd of spectators and stunned him at the same time with their compliments on his success he chanced to pass or rather to be led immediately in front of lady margaret and her granddaughter the captain of the popinjay and miss bellenden coloured like crimson as the latter returned with embarrassed courtesy the low inclination which the victor made even to the saddlebow in passing her  do you know that young person said lady margaret  iihave seen him madam at my uncles andand elsewhere occasionally stammered miss edith bellenden  i hear them say around me said lady margaret that the young spark is the nephew of old milnwood  the son of the late colonel morton of milnwood who commanded a regiment of horse with great courage at dunbar and inverkeithing said a gentleman who sate on horseback beside lady margaret  ay and who before that fought for the covenanters both at marstonmoor and philiphaugh said lady margaret sighing as she pronounced the last fatal words which her husbands death gave her such sad reason to remember  your ladyships memory is just said the gentleman smiling but it were well all that were forgot now  he ought to remember it gilbertscleugh returned lady margaret and dispense with intruding himself into the company of those to whom his name must bring unpleasing recollections  you forget my dear lady said her nomenclator that the young gentleman comes here to discharge suit and service in name of his uncle i would every estate in the country sent out as pretty a fellow  his uncle as well as his umquhile father is a roundhead i presume said lady margaret  he is an old miser said gilbertscleugh with whom a broad piece would at any time weigh down political opinions and therefore although probably somewhat against the grain he sends the young gentleman to attend the muster to save pecuniary pains and penalties as for the rest i suppose the youngster is happy enough to escape here for a day from the dulness of the old house at milnwood where he sees nobody but his hypochondriac uncle and the favourite housekeeper  do you know how many men and horse the lands of milnwood are rated at said the old lady continuing her enquiry  two horsemen with complete harness answered gilbertscleugh  our land said lady margaret drawing herself up with dignity has always furnished to the muster eight men cousin gilbertscleugh and often a voluntary aid of thrice the number i remember his sacred majesty king charles when he took his disjune at tillietudlem was particular in enquiringi see the dukes carriage in motion said gilbertscleugh partaking at the moment an alarm common to all lady margarets friends when she touched upon the topic of the royal visit at the family mansioni see the dukes carriage in motion i presume your ladyship will take your right of rank in leaving the field may i be permitted to convoy your ladyship and miss bellenden homeparties of the wild whigs have been abroad and are said to insult and disarm the wellaffected who travel in small numbers  we thank you cousin gilbertscleugh said lady margaret but as we shall have the escort of my own people i trust we have less need than others to be troublesome to our friends will you have the goodness to order harrison to bring up our people somewhat more briskly he rides them towards us as if he were leading a funeral procession  the gentleman in attendance communicated his ladys orders to the trusty steward  honest harrison had his own reasons for doubting the prudence of this command but once issued and received there was a necessity for obeying it he set off therefore at a handgallop followed by the butler in such a military attitude as became one who had served under montrose and with a look of defiance rendered sterner and fiercer by the inspiring fumes of a gill of brandy which he had snatched a moment to bolt to the kings health and confusion to the covenant during the intervals of military duty unhappily this potent refreshment wiped away from the tablets of his memory the necessity of paying some attention to the distresses and difficulties of his rearfile goose gibbie no sooner had the horses struck a canter than gibbies jackboots which the poor boys legs were incapable of steadying began to play alternately against the horses flanks and being armed with longrowelled spurs overcame the patience of the animal which bounced and plunged while poor gibbies entreaties for aid never reached the ears of the too heedless butler being drowned partly in the concave of the steel cap in which his head was immersed and partly in the martial tune of the gallant grames which mr gudyill whistled with all his power of lungs  the upshot was that the steed speedily took the matter into his own hands and having gambolled hither and thither to the great amusement of all spectators set off at full speed towards the huge familycoach already described gibbies pike escaping from its sling had fallen to a level direction across his hands which i grieve to say were seeking dishonourable safety in as strong a grasp of the mane as their muscles could manage his casque too had slipped completely over his face so that he saw as little in front as he did in rear indeed if he could it would have availed him little in the circumstances for his horse as if in league with the disaffected ran full tilt towards the solemn equipage of the duke which the projecting lance threatened to perforate from window to window at the risk of transfixing as many in its passage as the celebrated thrust of orlando which according to the italian epic poet broached as many moors as a frenchman spits frogs  on beholding the bent of this misdirected career a panic shout of mingled terror and wrath was set up by the whole equipage insides and outsides at once which had the happy effect of averting the threatened misfortune the capricious horse of goose gibbie was terrified by the noise and stumbling as he turned short round kicked and plunged violently as soon as he recovered the jackboots the original cause of the disaster maintaining the reputation they had acquired when worn by better cavaliers answered every plunge by a fresh prick of the spurs and by their ponderous weight kept their place in the stirrups not so goose gibbie who was fairly spurned out of those wide and ponderous greaves and precipitated over the horses head to the infinite amusement of all the spectators his lance and helmet had forsaken him in his fall and for the completion of his disgrace lady margaret bellenden not perfectly aware that it was one of her warriors who was furnishing so much entertainment came up in time to see her diminutive manatarms stripped of his lions hideof the buffcoat that is in which he was muffled  as she had not been made acquainted with this metamorphosis and could not even guess its cause her surprise and resentment were extreme nor were they much modified by the excuses and explanations of her steward and butler she made a hasty retreat homeward extremely indignant at the shouts and laughter of the company and much disposed to vent her displeasure on the refractory agriculturist whose place goose gibbie had so unhappily supplied the greater part of the gentry now dispersed the whimsical misfortune which had befallen the gens darmerie of tillietudlem furnishing them with huge entertainment on their road homeward the horsemen also in little parties as their road lay together diverged from the place of rendezvous excepting such as having tried their dexterity at the popinjay were by ancient custom obliged to partake of a gracecup with their captain before their departure      chapter iv            at fairs he playd before the spearmen           and gaily graithed in their gear then           steel bonnets pikes and swords shone clear then           as ony bead  now wha sall play before sic weir men                     since habbies dead                                         elegy on habbie simpson  the cavalcade of horsemen on their road to the little boroughtown were preceded by niel blane the townpiper mounted on his white galloway armed with his dirk and broadsword and bearing a chanter streaming with as many ribbons as would deck out six country belles for a fair or preaching niel a clean tight welltimbered longwinded fellow had gained the official situation of townpiper ofby his merit with all the emoluments thereof namely the pipers croft as it is still called a field of about an acre in extent five merks and a new liverycoat of the towns colours yearly some hopes of a dollar upon the day of the election of magistrates providing the provost were able and willing to afford such a gratuity and the privilege of paying at all the respectable houses in the neighbourhood an annual visit at springtime to rejoice their hearts with his music to comfort his own with their ale and brandy and to beg from each a modicum of seedcorn  in addition to these inestimable advantages niels personal or professional accomplishments won the heart of a jolly widow who then kept the principal changehouse in the borough her former husband having been a strict presbyterian of such note that he usually went among his sect by the name of gaius the publican many of the more rigid were scandalized by the profession of the successor whom his relict had chosen for a second helpmate as the browst or brewing of the howff retained nevertheless its unrivalled reputation most of the old customers continued to give it a preference the character of the new landlord indeed was of that accommodating kind which enabled him by close attention to the helm to keep his little vessel pretty steady amid the contending tides of faction he was a goodhumoured shrewd selfish sort of fellow indifferent alike to the disputes about church and state and only anxious to secure the goodwill of customers of every description but his character as well as the state of the country will be best understood by giving the reader an account of the instructions which he issued to his daughter a girl about eighteen whom he was initiating in those cares which had been faithfully discharged by his wife until about six months before our story commences when the honest woman had been carried to the kirkyard  jenny said niel blane as the girl assisted to disencumber him of his bagpipes this is the first day that ye are to take the place of your worthy mother in attending to the public a douce woman she was civil to the customers and had a good name wi whig and

blane and the cidevant laird once his patron but now glad to be his trenchercompanion sate down to enjoy themselves for the remainder of the evening remote from the bustle of the public room  all in jennys department was in full activity the knights of the popinjay received and requited the hospitable entertainment of their captain who though he spared the cup himself took care it should go round with due celerity among the rest who might not have otherwise deemed themselves handsomely treated their numbers melted away by degrees and were at length diminished to four or five who began to talk of breaking up their party at another table at some distance sat two of the dragoons whom niel blane had mentioned a sergeant and a private in the celebrated john grahame of claverhouses regiment of lifeguards even the noncommissioned officers and privates in these corps were not considered as ordinary mercenaries but rather approached to the rank of the french mousquetaires being regarded in the light of cadets who performed the duties of rankandfile with the prospect of obtaining commissions in case of distinguishing themselves  many young men of good families were to be found in the ranks a circumstance which added to the pride and selfconsequence of these troops a remarkable instance of this occurred in the person of the noncommissioned officer in question his real name was francis stewart but he was universally known by the appellation of bothwell being lineally descended from the last earl of that name not the infamous lover of the unfortunate queen mary but francis stewart earl of bothwell whose turbulence and repeated conspiracies embarrassed the early part of james sixths reign and who at length died in exile in great poverty the son of this earl had sued to charles i for the restitution of part of his fathers forfeited estates but the grasp of the nobles to whom they had been allotted was too tenacious to be unclenched the breaking out of the civil wars utterly ruined him by intercepting a small pension which charles i had allowed him and he died in the utmost indigence his son after having served as a soldier abroad and in britain and passed through several vicissitudes of fortune was fain to content himself with the situation of a noncommissioned officer in the lifeguards although lineally descended from the royal family the father of the forfeited earl of bothwell having been a natural son of james vi       note sergeant bothwell the history of the restless and ambitious      francis stewart earl of bothwell makes a considerable figure in      the reign of james vi of scotland and first of england after      being repeatedly pardoned for acts of treason he was at length      obliged to retire abroad where he died in great misery great part      of his forfeited estate was bestowed on walter scott first lord of      buccleuch and on the first earl of roxburghe       francis stewart son of the forfeited earl obtained from the favour      of charles i a decreetarbitral appointing the two noblemen      grantees of his fathers estate to restore the same or make some      compensation for retaining it the barony of crichton with its      beautiful castle was surrendered by the curators of francis earl      of buccleuch but he retained the far more extensive property in      liddesdale james stewart also as appears from writings in the      authors possession made an advantageous composition with the earl      of roxburghe but says the satirical scotstarvet male parta      pejus dilabuntur for he never brooked them enjoyed them nor was      any thing the richer since they accrued to his creditors and are      now in the possession of dr seaton his eldest son francis became a      trooper in the late war as for the other brother john who was      abbot of coldingham he also disposed all that estate and now has      nothing but lives on the charity of his friends the staggering      state of the scots statesmen for one hundred years by sir john      scot of scotstarvet edinburgh 1754 p 154       francis stewart who had been a trooper during the great civil war      seems to have received no preferment after the restoration suited      to his high birth though in fact third cousin to charles ii      captain crichton the friend of dean swift who published his      memoirs found him a private gentleman in the kings lifeguards at      the same time this was no degrading condition for fountainhall      records a duel fought between a lifeguardsman and an officer in the      militia because the latter had taken upon him to assume superior      rank as an officer to a gentleman private in the lifeguards the      lifeguards man was killed in the rencontre and his antagonist was      executed for murder       the character of bothwell except in relation to the name is      entirely ideal  great personal strength and dexterity in the use of his arms as well as the remarkable circumstances of his descent had recommended this man to the attention of his officers but he partook in a great degree of the licentiousness and oppressive disposition which the habit of acting as agents for government in levying fines exacting free quarters and otherwise oppressing the presbyterian recusants had rendered too general among these soldiers they were so much accustomed to such missions that they conceived themselves at liberty to commit all manner of license with impunity as if totally exempted from all law and authority excepting the command of their officers on such occasions bothwell was usually the most forward  it is probable that bothwell and his companions would not so long have remained quiet but for respect to the presence of their cornet who commanded the small party quartered in the borough and who was engaged in a game at dice with the curate of the place but both of these being suddenly called from their amusement to speak with the chief magistrate upon some urgent business bothwell was not long of evincing his contempt for the rest of the company  is it not a strange thing halliday he said to his comrade to see a set of bumpkins sit carousing here this whole evening without having drank the kings health  they have drank the kings health said halliday i heard that green kailworm of a lad name his majestys health  did he said bothwell then tom well have them drink the archbishop of st andrews health and do it on their knees too  so we will by g said halliday and he that refuses it well have him to the guardhouse and teach him to ride the colt foaled of an acorn with a brace of carabines at each foot to keep him steady  right tom continued bothwell and to do all things in order ill begin with that sulky bluebonnet in the inglenook  he rose accordingly and taking his sheathed broadsword under his arm to support the insolence which he meditated placed himself in front of the stranger noticed by niel blane in his admonitions to his daughter as being in all probability one of the hillfolk or refractory presbyterians  i make so bold as to request of your precision beloved said the trooper in a tone of affected solemnity and assuming the snuffle of a country preacher that you will arise from your seat beloved and having bent your hams until your knees do rest upon the floor beloved that you will turn over this measure called by the profane a gill of the comfortable creature which the carnal denominate brandy to the health and glorification of his grace the archbishop of st andrews the worthy primate of all scotland  all waited for the strangers answerhis features austere even to ferocity with a cast of eye which without being actually oblique approached nearly to a squint and which gave a very sinister expression to his countenance joined to a frame square strong and muscular though something under the middle size seemed to announce a man unlikely to understand rude jesting or to receive insults with impunity  and what is the consequence said he if i should not be disposed to comply with your uncivil request  the consequence thereof beloved said bothwell in the same tone of raillery will be firstly that i will tweak thy proboscis or nose secondly beloved that i will administer my fist to thy distorted visual optics and will conclude beloved with a practical application of the flat of my sword to the shoulders of the recusant  is it even so said the stranger then give me the cup and taking it in his hand he said with a peculiar expression of voice and manner the archbishop of st andrews and the place he now worthily holdsmay each prelate in scotland soon be as the right reverend james sharpe  he has taken the test said halliday exultingly  but with a qualification said bothwell i dont understand what the devil the cropeared whig means  come gentlemen said morton who became impatient of their insolence we are here met as good subjects and on a merry occasion and we have a right to expect we shall not be troubled with this sort of discussion  bothwell was about to make a surly answer but halliday reminded him in a whisper that there were strict injunctions that the soldiers should give no offence to the men who were sent out to the musters agreeably to the councils orders so after honouring morton with a broad and fierce stare he said well mr popinjay i shall not disturb your reign i reckon it will be out by twelve at nightis it not an odd thing halliday he continued addressing his companion that they should make such a fuss about cracking off their birdingpieces at a mark which any woman or boy could hit at a days practice if captain popinjay now or any of his troop would try a bout either with the broadsword backsword single rapier or rapier and dagger for a gold noble the firstdrawn blood there would be some soul in itor zounds would the bumpkins but wrestle or pitch the bar or putt the stone or throw the axletree if touching the end of mortons sword scornfully with his toe they carry things about them that they are afraid to draw  mortons patience and prudence now gave way entirely and he was about to make a very angry answer to bothwells insolent observations when the stranger stepped forward  this is my quarrel he said and in the name of the good cause i will see it out myselfhark thee friend to bothwell wilt thou wrestle a fall with me  with my whole spirit beloved answered bothwell yea i will strive with thee to the downfall of one or both  then as my trust is in him that can help retorted his antagonist i will forthwith make thee an example to all such railing rabshakehs  with that he dropped his coarse grey horsemans coat from his shoulders and extending his strong brawny arms with a look of determined resolution he offered himself to the contest the soldier was nothing abashed by the muscular frame broad chest square shoulders and hardy look of his antagonist but whistling with great composure unbuckled his belt and laid aside his military coat the company stood round them anxious for the event  in the first struggle the trooper seemed to have some advantage and also in the second though neither could be considered as decisive but it was plain he had put his whole strength too suddenly forth against an antagonist possessed of great endurance skill vigour and length of wind in the third close the countryman lifted his opponent fairly from the floor and hurled him to the ground with such violence that he lay for an instant stunned and motionless his comrade halliday immediately drew his sword you have killed my sergeant he exclaimed to the victorious wrestler and by all that is sacred you shall answer it  stand back cried morton and his companions it was all fair play your comrade sought a fall and he has got it  that is true enough said bothwell as he slowly rose put up your bilbo tom i did not think there was a cropear of them all could have laid the best cap and feather in the kings lifeguards on the floor of a rascally changehousehark ye friend give me your hand the stranger held out his hand i promise you said bothwell squeezing his hand very hard that the time will come when we shall meet again and try this game over in a more earnest manner  and ill promise you said the stranger returning the grasp with equal firmness that when we next meet i will lay your head as low as it lay even now when you shall lack the power to lift it up again  well beloved answered bothwell if thou best a whig thou art a stout and a brave one and so good even to theehadst best take thy nag before the cornet makes the round for i promise thee he has stayd less suspiciouslooking persons  the stranger seemed to think that the hint was not to be neglected he flung down his reckoning and going into the stable saddled and brought out a powerful black horse now recruited by rest and forage and turning to morton observed i ride towards milnwood which i hear is your home will you give me the advantage and protection of your company  certainly said morton although there was something of gloomy and relentless severity in the mans manner from which his mind recoiled his companions after a courteous goodnight broke up and went off in different directions some keeping them company for about a mile until they dropped off one by one and the travellers were left alone  the company had not long left the howff as blanes publichouse was called when the trumpets and kettledrums sounded the troopers got under arms in the marketplace at this unexpected summons while with faces of anxiety and earnestness cornet grahame a kinsman of claverhouse and the provost of the borough followed by halfadozen soldiers and townofficers with halberts entered the apartment of niel blane  guard the doors were the first words which the cornet spoke let no man leave the houseso bothwell how comes this did you not hear them sound boot and saddle  he was just going to quarters sir said his comrade he has had a bad fall  in a fray i suppose said grahame if you neglect duty in this way your royal blood will hardly protect you  how have i neglected duty said bothwell sulkily  you should have been at quarters sergeant bothwell replied the officer you have lost a golden opportunity here are news come that the archbishop of st andrews has been strangely and foully assassinated by a body of the rebel whigs who pursued and stopped his carriage on magusmuir near the town of st andrews dragged him out and dispatched him with their swords and daggers note the general account of this act of assassination is to be found in all histories of the period a more particular narrative may be found in the words of one of the actors james russell in the appendix to kirktons history of the church of scotland published by charles kirkpatrick sharpe esquire 4to edinburgh 1817  all stood aghast at the intelligence  here are their descriptions continued the cornet pulling out a proclamation the reward of a thousand merks is on each of their heads  the test the test and the qualification said bothwell to halliday i know the meaning nowzounds that we should not have stopt him go saddle our horses hallidaywas there one of the men cornet very stout and squaremade doublechested thin in the flanks hawknosed  stay stay said cornet grahame let me look at the paperhackston of rathillet tall thin blackhaired  that is not my man said bothwell  john balfour called burley aquiline nose redhaired five feet eight inches in heightit is heit is the very man said bothwellskellies fearfully with one eye  right continued grahame rode a strong black horse taken from the primate at the time of the murder  the very man exclaimed bothwell and the very horse he was in this room not a quarter of an hour since  a few hasty enquiries tended still more to confirm the opinion that the reserved and stern stranger was balfour of burley the actual commander of the band of assassins who in the fury of misguided zeal had murdered the primate whom they accidentally met as they were searching for another person against whom they bore enmity note one carmichael sheriffdepute in fife who had been active in enforcing the penal measures against nonconformists he was on the moors hunting but receiving accidental information that a party was out in quest of him he returned home and escaped the fate designed for him which befell his patron the archbishop in their excited imagination the casual rencounter had the appearance of a providential interference and they put to death the archbishop with circumstances of great and coldblooded cruelty under the belief that the lord as they expressed it had delivered him into their hands       note  murderers of archbishop sharpe the leader of this party was      david hackston of rathillet a gentleman of ancient birth and good      estate he had been profligate in his younger days but having been      led from curiosity to attend the conventicles of the nonconforming      clergy he adopted their principles in the fullest extent it      appears that hackston had some personal quarrel with archbishop      sharpe which induced him to decline the command of the party when      the slaughter was determined upon fearing his acceptance might be      ascribed to motives of personal enmity he felt himself free in      conscience however to be present and when the archbishop dragged      from his carriage crawled towards him on his knees for protection      he replied coldly sir i will never lay a finger on you it is      remarkable that hackston as well as a shepherd who was also      present but passive on the occasion were the only two of the      party of assassins who suffered death by the hands of the      executioner       on hackston refusing the command it was by universal suffrage      conferred on john balfour of kinloch called burley who was      hackstons brotherinlaw he is described as a little man

                                  james duff  morton and his companion had attained some distance from the town before either of them addressed the other there was something as we have observed repulsive in the manner of the stranger which prevented morton from opening the conversation and he himself seemed to have no desire to talk until on a sudden he abruptly demanded what has your fathers son to do with such profane mummeries as i find you this day engaged in  i do my duty as a subject and pursue my harmless recreations according to my own pleasure replied morton somewhat offended  is it your duty think you or that of any christian young man to bear arms in their cause who have poured out the blood of gods saints in the wilderness as if it had been water or is it a lawful recreation to waste time in shooting at a bunch of feathers and close your evening with winebibbing in publichouses and markettowns when he that is mighty is come into the land with his fan in his hand to purge the wheat from the chaff  i suppose from your style of conversation said morton that you are one of those who have thought proper to stand out against the government i must remind you that you are unnecessarily using dangerous language in the presence of a mere stranger and that the times do not render it safe for me to listen to it  thou canst not help it henry morton said his companion thy master has his uses for thee and when he calls thou must obey well wot i thou hast not heard the call of a true preacher or thou hadst ere now been what thou wilt assuredly one day become  we are of the presbyterian persuasion like yourself said morton for his uncles family attended the ministry of one of those numerous presbyterian clergymen who complying with certain regulations were licensed to preach without interruption from the government this indulgence as it was called made a great schism among the presbyterians and those who accepted of it were severely censured by the more rigid sectaries who refused the proffered terms the stranger therefore answered with great disdain to mortons profession of faith  that is but an equivocationa poor equivocation ye listen on the sabbath to a cold worldly timeserving discourse from one who forgets his high commission so much as to hold his apostleship by the favour of the courtiers and the false prelates and ye call that hearing the word of all the baits with which the devil has fished for souls in these days of blood and darkness that black indulgence has been the most destructive an awful dispensation it has been a smiting of the shepherd and a scattering of the sheep upon the mountainsan uplifting of one christian banner against another and a fighting of the wars of darkness with the swords of the children of light  my uncle said morton is of opinion that we enjoy a reasonable freedom of conscience under the indulged clergymen and i must necessarily be guided by his sentiments respecting the choice of a place of worship for his family  your uncle said the horseman is one of those to whom the least lamb in his own folds at milnwood is dearer than the whole christian flock he is one that could willingly bend down to the goldencalf of bethel and would have fished for the dust thereof when it was ground to powder and cast upon the waters thy father was a man of another stamp  my father replied morton was indeed a brave and gallant man and you may have heard sir that he fought for that royal family in whose name i was this day carrying arms  ay and had he lived to see these days he would have cursed the hour he ever drew sword in their cause but more of this hereafteri promise thee full surely that thy hour will come and then the words thou hast now heard will stick in thy bosom like barbed arrows my road lies there  he pointed towards a pass leading up into a wild extent of dreary and desolate hills but as he was about to turn his horses head into the rugged path which led from the highroad in that direction an old woman wrapped in a red cloak who was sitting by the crossway arose and approaching him said in a mysterious tone of voice if ye be of our ain folk gangna up the pass the night for your lives there is a lion in the path that is there the curate of brotherstane and ten soldiers hae beset the pass to hae the lives of ony of our puir wanderers that venture that gate to join wi hamilton and dingwall  have the persecuted folk drawn to any head among themselves demanded the stranger  about sixty or seventy horse and foot said the old dame but ewhow they are puirly armed and warse fended wi victual  god will help his own said the horseman which way shall i take to join them  its a mere impossibility this night said the woman the troopers keep sae strict a guard and they say theres strange news come frae the east that makes them rage in their cruelty mair fierce than everye maun take shelter somegate for the night before ye get to the muirs and keep yoursell in hiding till the grey o the morning and then you may find your way through the drake moss when i heard the awfu threatenings o the oppressors i een took my cloak about me and sate down by the wayside to warn ony of our puir scattered remnant that chanced to come this gate before they fell into the nets of the spoilers  have you a house near this said the stranger and can you give me hiding there  i have said the old woman a hut by the wayside it may be a mile from hence but four men of belial called dragoons are lodged therein to spoil my household goods at their pleasure because i will not wait upon the thowless thriftless fissenless ministry of that carnal man john halftext the curate  good night good woman and thanks for thy counsel said the stranger as he rode away  the blessings of the promise upon you returned the old dame may he keep you that can keep you  amen said the traveller for where to hide my head this night mortal skill cannot direct me  i am very sorry for your distress said morton and had i a house or place of shelter that could be called my own i almost think i would risk the utmost rigour of the law rather than leave you in such a strait but my uncle is so alarmed at the pains and penalties denounced by the laws against such as comfort receive or consort with intercommuned persons that he has strictly forbidden all of us to hold any intercourse with them  it is no less than i expected said the stranger nevertheless i might be received without his knowledgea barn a hayloft a cartshedany place where i could stretch me down would be to my habits like a tabernacle of silver set about with planks of cedar  i assure you said morton much embarrassed that i have not the means of receiving you at milnwood without my uncles consent and knowledge nor if i could do so would i think myself justifiable in engaging him unconsciously in danger which most of all others he fears and deprecates  well said the traveller i have but one word to say did you ever hear your father mention john balfour of burley  his ancient friend and comrade who saved his life with almost the loss of his own in the battle of longmarstonmooroften very often  i am that balfour said his companion yonder stands thy uncles house i see the light among the trees the avenger of blood is behind me and my death certain unless i have refuge there now make thy choice young man to shrink from the side of thy fathers friend like a thief in the night and to leave him exposed to the bloody death from which he rescued thy father or to expose thine uncles wordly goods to such peril as in this perverse generation attends those who give a morsel of bread or a draught of cold water to a christian man when perishing for lack of refreshment  a thousand recollections thronged on the mind of morton at once his father whose memory he idolized had often enlarged upon his obligations to this man and regretted that after having been long comrades they had parted in some unkindness at the time when the kingdom of scotland was divided into resolutioners and protesters the former of whom adhered to charles ii after his fathers death upon the scaffold while the protesters inclined rather to a union with the triumphant republicans the stern fanaticism of burley had attached him to this latter party and the comrades had parted in displeasure never as it happened to meet again these circumstances the deceased colonel morton had often mentioned to his son and always with an expression of deep regret that he had never in any manner been enabled to repay the assistance which on more than one occasion he had received from burley  to hasten mortons decision the nightwind as it swept along brought from a distance the sullen sound of a kettledrum which seeming to approach nearer intimated that a body of horse were upon their march towards them  it must be claverhouse with the rest of his regiment what can have occasioned this nightmarch if you go on you fall into their handsif you turn back towards the boroughtown you are in no less danger from cornet grahames partythe path to the hill is beset i must shelter you at milnwood or expose you to instant deathbut the punishment of the law shall fall upon myself as in justice it should not upon my unclefollow me  burley who had awaited his resolution with great composure now followed him in silence  the house of milnwood built by the father of the present proprietor was a decent mansion suitable to the size of the estate but since the accession of this owner it had been suffered to go considerably into disrepair at some little distance from the house stood the court of offices here morton paused  i must leave you here for a little while he whispered until i can provide a bed for you in the house  i care little for such delicacy said burley for thirty years this head has rested oftener on the turf or on the next grey stone than upon either wool or down a draught of ale a morsel of bread to say my prayers and to stretch me upon dry hay were to me as good as a painted chamber and a princes table  it occurred to morton at the same moment that to attempt to introduce the fugitive within the house would materially increase the danger of detection accordingly having struck a light with implements left in the stable for that purpose and having fastened up their horses he assigned burley for his place of repose a wooden bed placed in a loft halffull of hay which an outofdoor domestic had occupied until dismissed by his uncle in one of those fits of parsimony which became more rigid from day to day in this untenanted loft morton left his companion with a caution so to shade his light that no reflection might be seen from the window and a promise that he would presently return with such refreshments as he might be able to procure at that late hour this last indeed was a subject on which he felt by no means confident for the power of obtaining even the most ordinary provisions depended entirely upon the humour in which he might happen to find his uncles sole confidant the old housekeeper if she chanced to be abed which was very likely or out of humour which was not less so morton well knew the case to be at least problematical  cursing in his heart the sordid parsimony which pervaded every part of his uncles establishment he gave the usual gentle knock at the bolted door by which he was accustomed to seek admittance when accident had detained him abroad beyond the early and established hours of rest at the house of milnwood it was a sort of hesitating tap which carried an acknowledgment of transgression in its very sound and seemed rather to solicit than command attention after it had been repeated again and again the housekeeper grumbling betwixt her teeth as she rose from the chimney corner in the hall and wrapping her checked handkerchief round her head to secure her from the cold air paced across the stonepassage and repeated a careful whas there at this time o night more than once before she undid the bolts and bars and cautiously opened the door  this is a fine time o night mr henry said the old dame with the tyrannic insolence of a spoilt and favourite domestica braw time o night and a bonny to disturb a peaceful house in and to keep quiet folk out o their beds waiting for you your uncles been in his maist three hours syne and robins ill o the rheumatize and hes to his bed too and sae i had to sit up for ye mysell for as sair a hoast as i hae  here she coughed once or twice in further evidence of the egregious inconvenience which she had sustained  much obliged to you alison and many kind thanks  hegh sirs sae fairfashioned as we are mony folk ca me mistress wilson and milnwood himsell is the only ane about this town thinks o caing me alison and indeed he as aften says mrs alison as ony other thing  well then mistress alison said morton i really am sorry to have kept you up waiting till i came in  and now that you are come in mr henry said the cross old woman what for do you no tak up your candle and gang to your bed and mind ye dinna let the candle sweal as ye gang alang the wainscot parlour and haud a the house scouring to get out the grease again  but alison i really must have something to eat and a draught of ale before i go to bed  eatand ale mr henrymy certie yere ill to

majoring to the pipers howff wi a the idle loons in the country and sitting there birling at your poor uncles cost nae doubt wi a the scaff and raff o the waterside till sundown and then coming hame and crying for ale as if ye were maister and mair  extremely vexed yet anxious on account of his guest to procure refreshments if possible morton suppressed his resentment and goodhumouredly assured mrs wilson that he was really both hungry and thirsty and as for the shooting at the popinjay i have heard you say you have been there yourself mrs wilsoni wish you had come to look at us  ah maister henry said the old dame i wish ye binna beginning to learn the way of blawing in a womans lug wi a your whillywhas aweel sae ye dinna practise them but on auld wives like me the less matter but tak heed o the young queans ladpopinjayye think yoursell a braw fellow enow and troth surveying him with the candle theres nae fault to find wi the outside if the inside be conforming but i mind when i was a gilpy of a lassock seeing the duke that was him that lost his head at londonfolk said it wasna a very gude ane but it was aye a sair loss to him puir gentlemanaweel he wan the popinjay for few cared to win it ower his graces headweel he had a comely presence and when a the gentles mounted to show their capers his grace was as near to me as i am to you and he said to me tak tent o yoursell my bonny lassie these were his very words for my horse is not very chancyand now as ye say ye had sae little to eat or drink ill let you see that i havena been sae unmindfu o you for i dinna think its safe for young folk to gang to their bed on an empty stamach  to do mrs wilson justice her nocturnal harangues upon such occasions not unfrequently terminated with this sage apophthegm which always prefaced the producing of some provision a little better than ordinary such as she now placed before him in fact the principal object of her maundering was to display her consequence and love of power for mrs wilson was not at the bottom an illtempered woman and certainly loved her old and young master both of whom she tormented extremely better than any one else in the world she now eyed mr henry as she called him with great complacency as he partook of her good cheer  muckle gude may it do ye my bonny man i trow ye dinna get sic a skirlinthepan as that at niel blanes his wife was a canny body and could dress things very weel for ane in her line o business but no like a gentlemans housekeeper to be sure but i doubt the daughters a silly thingan unco cockernony she had busked on her head at the kirk last sunday i am doubting that there will be news o a thae braws but my auld eens drawing thegitherdinna hurry yoursell my bonny man tak mind about the putting out the candle and theres a horn of ale and a glass of clowgillieflower water i dinna gie ilka body that i keep it for a pain i hae whiles in my ain stamach and its better for your young blood than brandy sae gudenight to ye mr henry and see that ye tak gude care o the candle  morton promised to attend punctually to her caution and requested her not to be alarmed if she heard the door opened as she knew he must again as usual look to his horse and arrange him for the night mrs wilson then retreated and morton folding up his provisions was about to hasten to his guest when the nodding head of the old housekeeper was again thrust in at the door with an admonition to remember to take an account of his ways before he laid himself down to rest and to pray for protection during the hours of darkness  such were the manners of a certain class of domestics once common in scotland and perhaps still to be found in some old manorhouses in its remote counties they were fixtures in the family they belonged to and as they never conceived the possibility of such a thing as dismissal to be within the chances of their lives they were of course sincerely attached to every member of it note a masculine retainer of this kind having offended his master extremely was commanded to leave his service instantly in troth and that will i not answered the domestic if your honour disna ken when ye hae a gude servant i ken when i hae a gude master and go away i will not on another occasion of the same nature the master said john you and i shall never sleep under the same roof again to which john replied with much whare the deil can your honour be ganging on the other hand when spoiled by the indulgence or indolence of their superiors they were very apt to become illtempered selfsufficient and tyrannical so much so that a mistress or master would sometimes almost have wished to exchange their crossgrained fidelity for the smooth and accommodating duplicity of a modern menial      chapter vi                 yea this mans brow like to a tragic leaf                foretells the nature of a tragic volume                                                   shakspeare  being at length rid of the housekeepers presence morton made a collection of what he had reserved from the provisions set before him and prepared to carry them to his concealed guest he did not think it necessary to take a light being perfectly acquainted with every turn of the road and it was lucky he did not do so for he had hardly stepped beyond the threshold ere a heavy trampling of horses announced that the body of cavalry whose kettledrums note regimental music is never played at night but who can assure us that such was not the custom in charles the seconds time till i am well informed on this point the kettledrums shall clash on as adding something to the picturesque effect of the night march they had before heard were in the act of passing along the highroad which winds round the foot of the bank on which the house of milnwood was placed he heard the commanding officer distinctly give the word halt a pause of silence followed interrupted only by the occasional neighing or pawing of an impatient charger  whose house is this said a voice in a tone of authority and command  milnwood if it like your honour was the reply  is the owner well affected said the enquirer  he complies with the orders of government and frequents an indulged minister was the response  hum ay indulged a mere mask for treason very impolitically allowed to those who are too great cowards to wear their principles barefaced had we not better send up a party and search the house in case some of the bloody villains concerned in this heathenish butchery may be concealed in it  ere morton could recover from the alarm into which this proposal had thrown him a third speaker rejoined i cannot think it at all necessary milnwood is an infirm hypochondriac old man who never meddles with politics and loves his moneybags and bonds better than any thing else in the world his nephew i hear was at the wappenschaw today and gained the popinjay which does not look like a fanatic i should think they are all gone to bed long since and an alarm at this time of night might kill the poor old man  well rejoined the leader if that be so to search the house would be lost time of which we have but little to throw away gentlemen of the lifeguards forwardmarch  a few notes on the trumpet mingled with the occasional boom of the kettledrum to mark the cadence joined with the tramp of hoofs and the clash of arms announced that the troop had resumed its march the moon broke out as the leading files of the column attained a hill up which the road winded and showed indistinctly the glittering of the steelcaps and the dark figures of the horses and riders might be imperfectly traced through the gloom they continued to advance up the hill and sweep over the top of it in such long succession as intimated a considerable numerical force  when the last of them had disappeared young morton resumed his purpose of visiting his guest upon entering the place of refuge he found him seated on his humble couch with a pocket bible open in his hand which he seemed to study with intense meditation his broadsword which he had unsheathed in the first alarm at the arrival of the dragoons lay naked across his knees and the little taper that stood beside him upon the old chest which served the purpose of a table threw a partial and imperfect light upon those stern and harsh features in which ferocity was rendered more solemn and dignified by a wild cast of tragic enthusiasm his brow was that of one in whom some strong oermastering principle has overwhelmed all other passions and feelings like the swell of a high springtide when the usual cliffs and breakers vanish from the eye and their existence is only indicated by the chasing foam of the waves that burst and wheel over them he raised his head after morton had contemplated him for about a minute  i perceive said morton looking at his sword that you heard the horsemen ride by their passage delayed me for some minutes  i scarcely heeded them said balfour my hour is not yet come that i shall one day fall into their hands and be honourably associated with the saints whom they have slaughtered i am full well aware and i would young man that the hour were come it should be as welcome to me as ever wedding to bridegroom but if my master has more work for me on earth i must not do his labour grudgingly  eat and refresh yourself said morton tomorrow your safety requires you should leave this place in order to gain the hills so soon as you can see to distinguish the track through the morasses  young man returned balfour you are already weary of me and would be yet more so perchance did you know the task upon which i have been lately put and i wonder not that it should be so for there are times when i am weary of myself think you not it is a sore trial for flesh and blood to be called upon to execute the righteous judgments of heaven while we are yet in the body and continue to retain that blinded sense and sympathy for carnal suffering which makes our own flesh thrill when we strike a gash upon the body of another and think you that when some prime tyrant has been removed from his place that the instruments of his punishment can at all times look back on their share in his downfall with firm and unshaken nerves must they not sometimes even question the truth of that inspiration which they have felt and acted under must they not sometimes doubt the origin of that strong impulse with which their prayers for heavenly direction under difficulties have been inwardly answered and confirmed and confuse in their disturbed apprehensions the responses of truth itself with some strong delusion of the enemy  these are subjects mr balfour on which i am ill qualified to converse with you answered morton but i own i should strongly doubt the origin of any inspiration which seemed to dictate a line of conduct contrary to those feelings of natural humanity which heaven has assigned to us as the general law of our conduct  balfour seemed somewhat disturbed and drew himself hastily up but immediately composed himself and answered coolly it is natural you should think so you are yet in the dungeonhouse of the law a pit darker than that into which jeremiah was plunged even the dungeon of malcaiah the son of hamelmelech where there was no water but mire yet is the seal of the covenant upon your forehead and the son of the righteous who resisted to blood where the banner was spread on the mountains shall not be utterly lost as one of the children of darkness trow ye that in this day of bitterness and calamity nothing is required at our hands but to keep the moral law as far as our carnal frailty will permit think ye our conquests must be only over our corrupt and evil affections and passions no we are called upon when we have girded up our loins to run the race boldly and when we have drawn the sword we are enjoined to smite the ungodly though he be our neighbour and the man of power and cruelty though he were of our own kindred and the friend of our own bosom  these are the sentiments said morton that your enemies impute to you and which palliate if they do not vindicate the cruel measures which the council have directed against you they affirm that you pretend to derive your rule of action from what you call an inward light rejecting the restraints of legal magistracy of national law and even of common humanity when in opposition to what you call the spirit within you  they do us wrong answered the covenanter it is they perjured as they are who have rejected all law both divine and civil and who now persecute us for adherence to the solemn league and covenant between god and the kingdom of scotland to which all of them save a few popish malignants have sworn in former days and which they now burn in the marketplaces and tread under foot in derision when this charles stewart returned to these kingdoms did the malignants bring him back they had tried it with strong hand but they failed i trow could james grahame of montrose and his highland caterans have put him again in the place of his father i think their heads on the westport told another tale for many a long day it was the workers of the glorious workthe reformers of the beauty of the tabernacle that called him again to the high place from which his father fell and what has been our reward in the words of the prophet we looked for peace but no good came and for a time of health and behold troublethe snorting of his horses was heard from dan the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones for they are come and have devoured the land and all that is in it  mr balfour answered morton i neither undertake to subscribe to or refute your complaints against the government i have endeavoured to repay a debt due to the comrade of my father by giving you shelter in your distress but you will excuse me from engaging myself either in your cause or in controversy i will leave you to repose and heartily wish it were in my power to render your condition more comfortable  but i shall see you i trust in the morning ere i departi am not a man whose bowels yearn after kindred and friends of this world when i put my hand to the plough i entered into a covenant with my worldly affections that i should not look back on the things i left behind me yet the son of mine ancient comrade is to me as mine own and i cannot behold him without the deep and firm belief that i shall one day see him gird on his sword in the dear and precious cause for which his father fought and bled  with a promise on mortons part that he would call the refugee when it was time for him to pursue his journey they parted for the night  morton retired to a few hours rest but his imagination disturbed by the events of the day did not permit him to enjoy sound repose there was a blended vision of horror before him in which his new friend seemed to be a principal actor the fair form of edith bellenden also mingled in his dream weeping and with dishevelled hair and appearing to call on him for comfort and assistance which he had not in his power to render he awoke from these unrefreshing slumbers with a feverish impulse and a heart which foreboded disaster there was already a tinge of dazzling lustre on the verge of the distant hills and the dawn was abroad in all the freshness of a summer morning  i have slept too long he exclaimed to himself and must now hasten to forward the journey of this unfortunate fugitive  he dressed himself as fast as possible opened the door of the house with as little noise as he could and hastened to the place of refuge occupied by the covenanter morton entered on tiptoe for the determined tone and manner as well as the unusual language and sentiments of this singular individual had struck him with a sensation approaching to awe balfour was still asleep a ray of light streamed on his uncurtained couch and showed to morton the working of his harsh features which seemed agitated by some strong internal cause of disturbance he had not undressed both his arms were above the bedcover the right hand strongly clenched and occasionally making that abortive attempt to strike which usually attends dreams of violence the left was extended and agitated from time to time by a movement as if repulsing some one the perspiration stood on his brow like bubbles in a late disturbed stream and these marks of emotion were accompanied with broken words which escaped from him at intervalsthou art taken judasthou art takencling not to my kneescling not to my kneeshew him downa priest ay a priest of baal to be bound and slain even at the brook kishonfire arms will not prevail against himstrikethrust with the cold ironput him out of painput him out of pain were it but for the sake of his grey hairs  much alarmed at the import of these expressions which seemed to burst from him even in sleep with the stern energy accompanying the perpetration of some act of violence morton shook his guest by the shoulder in order to awake him the first words he uttered were bear me where ye will i will avouch the deed  his glance around having then fully awakened him he at once assumed all the stern and gloomy composure of his ordinary manner and throwing himself on his knees before speaking to morton poured forth an ejaculatory prayer for the suffering church of scotland entreating that the blood of her murdered saints and martyrs might be precious in the sight of heaven and that the shield of the almighty might be spread over the scattered remnant who for his names sake were abiders in the wilderness vengeancespeedy and ample vengeance on the oppressors was the concluding petition of his devotions which he expressed aloud in strong and emphatic language rendered more impressive by the orientalism of scripture  when he had finished his prayer he arose and taking morton by the arm they descended together to the stable where the wanderer to give burley a title which was often conferred on his sect began to make his horse ready to pursue his journey when the animal was saddled and bridled burley requested morton to walk with him a gunshot into the wood and direct him to the right road for gaining the moors morton readily complied and they walked for some time in silence under the shade of some fine old trees pursuing a sort of natural path which after passing through woodland for about half a mile led into the bare and wild country which extends to the foot of the hills  there was little conversation between them until at length burley suddenly asked morton whether the words he had spoken overnight had borne fruit in his mind  morton answered that he remained of the same opinion which he had formerly held and was determined at least as far and as long as possible to unite the duties of a good christian with those of a peaceful subject  in other words replied burley you are desirous to serve both god and mammonto be one day professing the truth with your lips and the next day in arms at the command of carnal and tyrannic authority to shed the blood of those who for the truth have forsaken all things think ye he continued to touch pitch and remain undefiled to mix in the ranks of malignants papists papaprelatists latitudinarians and scoffers to partake of their sports which are like the meat offered unto idols to hold intercourse perchance with their daughters as the sons of god with the daughters of men in the world before the floodthink you i say to do all these things and yet remain free from pollution i say unto you that all communication with the enemies of the church is the accursed thing which god hateth touch nottaste nothandle not and grieve not young man as if you alone were called upon to subdue your carnal affections and renounce the pleasures which are a snare to your feeti say to you that the son of david hath denounced no better lot on the whole generation of mankind  he then mounted his horse and turning to morton repeated the text of scripture an heavy yoke was ordained for the sons of adam from the day they go out of their mothers womb till the day that they return to the mother of all things from him who is clothed in blue silk and weareth a crown even to him who weareth simple linenwrath envy trouble and unquietness rigour strife and fear of death in the time of rest  having uttered these words he set his horse in motion and soon disappeared among the boughs of the forest  farewell stern enthusiast said morton looking after him in some moods of my mind how dangerous would be the society of such a companion if i am unmoved by his zeal for abstract doctrines of faith or rather for a peculiar mode of worship such was the purport of his reflections can i be a man and a scotchman and look with indifference on that persecution which has made wise men mad was not the cause of freedom civil and religious that for which my father fought and shall i do well to remain inactive or to take the part of an oppressive government if there should appear any rational prospect of redressing the insufferable wrongs to which my miserable countrymen are subjected and yet who shall warrant me that these people rendered wild by persecution would not in the hour of victory be as cruel and as intolerant as those by whom they are now hunted down what degree of moderation or of mercy can be expected from this burley so distinguished as one of their principal champions and who seems even now to be reeking from some recent deed of violence and to feel stings of remorse which even his enthusiasm cannot altogether stifle i am weary of seeing nothing but violence and fury around menow assuming the mask of lawful authority now taking that of religious zeal i am sick of my countryof myselfof my dependent situationof my repressed feelingsof these woodsof that riverof that houseof all butedith and she can never be mine why should i haunt her walkswhy encourage my own delusion and perhaps hersshe can never be mine her grandmothers pridethe opposite principles of our familiesmy wretched state of dependencea poor miserable slave for i have not even the wages of a servantall circumstances give the lie to the vain hope that we can ever be united why then protract a delusion so painful  but i am no slave he said aloud and drawing himself up to his full statureno slave in one respect surely i can change my abodemy fathers sword is mine and europe lies open before me as before him and hundreds besides of my countrymen who have filled it with the fame of their exploits perhaps some lucky chance may raise me to a rank with our ruthvens our lesleys our monroes the chosen leaders of the famous protestant champion gustavus adolphus or if not a soldiers life or a soldiers grave  when he had formed this determination he found himself near the door of his uncles house and resolved to lose no time in making him acquainted with it  another glance of ediths eye another walk by ediths side and my resolution would melt away i will take an irrevocable step therefore and then see her for the last time  in this mood he entered the wainscotted parlour in which his uncle was already placed at his mornings refreshment a huge plate of oatmeal porridge with a corresponding allowance of buttermilk the favourite housekeeper was in attendance half standing half resting on the back of a chair in a posture betwixt freedom and respect the old gentleman had been remarkably tall in his earlier days an advantage which he now lost by stooping to such a degree that at a meeting where there was some dispute concerning the sort of arch which should be thrown over a considerable brook a facetious neighbour proposed to offer milnwood a handsome sum for his curved backbone alleging that he would sell any thing that belonged to him splay feet of unusual size long thin hands garnished with nails which seldom felt the steel a wrinkled and puckered visage the length of which corresponded with that of his person together with a pair of little sharp bargainmaking grey eyes that seemed eternally looking out for their advantage completed the highly unpromising exterior of mr morton of milnwood as it would have been very injudicious to have lodged a liberal or benevolent disposition in such an unworthy cabinet nature had suited his person with a mind exactly in conformity with it that is to say mean selfish and covetous  when this amiable personage was aware of the presence of his nephew he hastened before addressing him to swallow the spoonful of porridge which he was in the act of conveying to his mouth and as it chanced to be scalding hot the pain occasioned by its descent down his throat and into his stomach inflamed the illhumour with which he was already prepared to meet his kinsman  the deil take them that made them was his first ejaculation apostrophizing his mess of porridge  theyre gude parritch eneugh said mrs wilson if ye wad but take time to sup them i made them mysell but if folk winna hae patience they should get their thrapples causewayed  haud your peace alison i was speaking to my nevoyhow is this sir and what sort o scampering gates are these o going on ye were not at hame last night till near midnight  thereabouts sir i believe answered morton in an indifferent tone  thereabouts sirwhat sort of an answer is that sir why came ye na hame when other folk left the grund  i suppose you know the reason very well sir said morton i had the fortune to be the best marksman of the day and remained as is usual to give some little entertainment to the other young men  the deevil ye did sir and ye come to tell me that to my face you pretend to gie entertainments that canna come by a dinner except by sorning on a carefu man like me but if ye put me to charges ise work it out oye i seena why ye shouldna haud the pleugh now that the pleughman has left us it wad set ye better than wearing thae green duds and wasting your siller on powther and lead it wad put ye in an honest calling and wad keep ye in bread without being behadden to ony ane  i am very ambitious of learning such a calling sir but i dont understand driving the plough  and what for no its easier than your gunning and archery that ye like sae weel auld davie is caing it een now and ye may be goadsman for the first twa or three days and tak tent ye dinna oerdrive the owsen and then ye will be fit to gang betweeu the stilts yell neer learn younger ill be your caution haggieholm is heavy land and davie is ower auld to keep the coulter down now  i beg pardon for interrupting you sir but i have formed a scheme for myself which will have the same effect of relieving you of the burden and charge attending my company  ay indeed a scheme o yours that must be a denty ane said the uncle with a very peculiar sneer lets hear about it lad  it is said in two words sir i intend to leave this country and serve abroad as my father did before these unhappy troubles broke out at home his name will not be so entirely forgotten in the countries where he served but that it will procure his son at least the opportunity of trying his fortune as a soldier  gude be gracious to us exclaimed the housekeeper our young mr harry gang abroad na na eh na that maun never be  milnwood entertaining no thought or purpose of parting with his nephew who was moreover very useful to him in many respects was thunderstruck at this abrupt declaration of independence from a person whose deference to him had hitherto been unlimited he recovered himself however immediately  and wha do you think is to give you the means young man for such a wildgoose chase not i i am sure i can hardly support you at hame and ye wad be marrying ise warrant as your father did afore ye too and sending your uncle hame a pack o weans to be fighting and skirling through the house in my auld days and to take wing and flee aff like yoursell whenever they were asked to serve a turn about the town  i have no thoughts of ever marrying answered henry  hear till him now said the housekeeper its a shame to hear a douce young lad speak in that way since a the warld kens that they maun either marry or do waur  haud your peace alison said her master and you harry he added more mildly put this nonsense out o your headthis comes o letting ye gang asodgering for a daymind ye hae nae siller lad for ony sic nonsense plans  i beg your pardon sir my wants shall be very few and would you please to give me the gold chain which the margrave gave to my father after the battle of lutzenmercy on us the gowd chain exclaimed his uncle  the chain of gowd reechoed the housekeeper both aghast with astonishment at the audacity of the proposal  i will keep a few links continued the young man to remind me of him by whom it was won and the place where he won it continued morton the rest shall furnish me the means of following the same career in which my father obtained that mark of distinction  mercifu powers exclaimed the governante my master wears it every sunday  sunday and saturday added old milnwood whenever i put on my black velvet coat and wylie mactrickit is partly of opinion its a kind of heirloom that rather belangs to the head of the house than to the immediate descendant it has three thousand links i have counted them a thousand times its worth three hundred pounds sterling  that is more than i want sir if you choose to give me the third part of the money and five links of the chain it will amply serve my purpose and the rest will be some slight atonement for the expense and trouble i have put you to  the laddies in a creel exclaimed his uncle o sirs what will become o the rigs o milnwood when i am dead and gane he would fling the crown of scotland awa if he had it  hout sir said the old housekeeper i maun een say its partly your ain faut ye maunna curb his head ower sair in neither and to be sure since he has gane doun to the howff ye maun just een pay the lawing  if it be not abune twa dollars alison said the old gentleman very reluctantly  ill settle it myself winiel blane the first time i gang down to the clachan said alison cheaper than your honour or mr harry can do and then whispered to henry dinna vex him onymair ill pay the lave out o the butter siller and nae mair words about it then proceeding aloud and ye maunna speak o the young gentleman hauding the pleugh theres puir distressed whigs enow about the country will be glad to do that for a bite and a soupit sets them far better than the like o him  and then well hae the dragoons on us said milnwood for comforting and entertaining intercommuned rebels a bonny strait ye wad put us in but take your breakfast harry and then lay by your new green coat and put on your raploch grey its a mair mensfu and thrifty dress and a mair seemly sight than thae dangling slops and ribbands  morton left the room perceiving plainly that he had at present no chance of gaining his purpose and perhaps not altogether displeased at the obstacles which seemed to present themselves to his leaving the neighbourhood of tillietudlem the housekeeper followed him into the next room patting him on the back and bidding him be a gude bairn and pit by his braw things  and ill loop doun your hat and lay by the band and ribband said the officious dame and ye maun never at no hand speak o leaving the land or of selling the gowd chain for your uncle has an unco pleasure in looking on you and in counting the links of the chainzie and ye ken auld folk canna last for ever sae the chain and the lands and a will be your ain ae day and ye may marry ony leddy in the countryside ye like and keep a braw house at milnwood for theres enow o means and is not that worth waiting for my dow  there was something in the latter part of the prognostic which sounded so agreeably in the ears of morton that he shook the old dame cordially by the hand and assured her he was much obliged by her good advice and would weigh it carefully before he proceeded to act upon his former resolution      chapter vii                 from seventeen years till now almost fourscore                here lived i but now live here no more                at seventeen years many their fortunes seek                but at fourscore it is too late a week                                                   as you like it  we must conduct our readers to the tower of tillietudlem to which lady margaret bellenden had returned in romantic phrase malecontent and full of heaviness at the unexpected and as she deemed it indelible affront which had been brought upon her dignity by the public miscarriage of goose gibbie that unfortunate manatarms was forthwith commanded to drive his feathered charge to the most remote parts of the common moor and on no account to awaken the grief or resentment of his lady by appearing in her presence while the sense of the affront was yet recent  the next proceeding of lady margaret was to hold a solemn court of justice to which harrison and the butler were admitted partly on the footing of witnesses partly as assessors to enquire into the recusancy of cuddie headrigg the ploughman and the abetment which he had received from his motherthese being regarded as the original causes of the disaster which had befallen the chivalry of tillietudlem the charge being fully made out and substantiated lady margaret resolved to reprimand the culprits in person and if she found them impenitent to extend the censure into a sentence of expulsion from the barony miss bellenden alone ventured to say any thing in behalf of the accused but her countenance did not profit them as it might have done on any other occasion for so soon as edith had heard it ascertained that the unfortunate cavalier had not suffered in his person his disaster had affected her with an irresistible disposition to laugh which in spite of lady margarets indignation or rather irritated as usual by restraint had broke out repeatedly on her return homeward until her grandmother in no shape imposed upon by the several fictitious causes which the young lady assigned for her illtimed risibility upbraided her in very bitter terms with being insensible to the honour of her family miss bellendens intercession therefore had on this occasion little or no chance to be listened to  as if to evince the rigour of her disposition lady margaret on this solemn occasion exchanged the ivoryheaded cane with which she commonly walked for an immense goldheaded staff which had belonged to her father the deceased earl of torwood and which like a sort of mace of office she only made use of on occasions of special solemnity supported by this awful baton of command lady margaret bellenden entered the cottage of the delinquents  there was an air of consciousness about old mause as she rose from her wicker chair in the chimneynook not with the cordial alertness of visage which used on other occasions to express the honour she felt in the visit of her lady but with a certain solemnity and embarrassment like an accused party on his first appearance in presence of his judge before whom he is nevertheless determined to assert his innocence her arms were folded her mouth primmed into an expression of respect mingled with obstinacy her whole mind apparently bent up to the solemn interview with her best curtsey to the ground and a mute motion of reverence mause pointed to the chair which on former occasions lady margaret for the good lady was somewhat of a gossip had deigned to occupy for half an hour sometimes at a time hearing the news of the county and of the borough but at present her mistress was far too indignant for such condescension she rejected the mute invitation with a haughty wave of her hand and drawing herself up as she spoke she uttered the following interrogatory in a tone calculated to overwhelm the culprit  is it true mause as i am informed by harrison gudyill and others of my people that you hae taen it upon you contrary to the faith you owe to god and the king and to me your natural lady and mistress to keep back your son frae the wappenschaw held by the order of the sheriff and to return his armour and abulyiements at a moment when it was impossible to find a suitable delegate in his stead whereby the barony of tullietudlem baith in the person of its mistress and indwellers has incurred sic a disgrace and dishonour as hasna befaen the family since the days of malcolm canmore  mauses habitual respect for her mistress was extreme she hesitated and one or two short coughs expressed the difficulty she had in defending herself  i am suremy leddyhem hemi am sure i am sorryvery sorry that ony cause of displeasure should hae occurredbut my sons illness dinna tell me of your sons illness mause had he been sincerely unweel ye would hae been at the tower by daylight to get something that wad do him gude there are few ailments that i havena medical recipes for and that ye ken fu weel  o ay my leddy i am sure ye hae wrought wonderful cures the last thing ye sent cuddie when he had the batts een wrought like a charm  why then woman did ye not apply to me if there was only real needbut there was none ye fausehearted vassal that ye are  your leddyship never cad me sic a word as that before ohon that i suld live to be cad sae she continued bursting into tears and me a born servant o the house o tillietudlem i am sure they belie baith cuddie and me sair if they said he wadna fight ower the boots in blude for your leddyship and miss edith and the auld toweray suld he and i would rather see him buried beneath it than he suld gie waybut thir ridings and wappenschawings my leddy i hae nae broo o them ava i can find nae warrant for them whatsoever  nae warrant for them cried the highborn dame do ye na ken woman that ye are bound to be liege vassals in all hunting hosting watching and warding when lawfully summoned thereto in my name your service is not gratuitous i trow ye hae land for ityere kindly tenants hae a cothouse a kaleyard and a cows grass on the commonfew hae been brought farther ben and ye grudge your son suld gie me a days service in the field  na my leddyna my leddy its no that exclaimed mause greatly embarrassed but ane canna serve twa maisters and if the truth maun een come out theres ane abune whase commands i maun obey before your leddyships i am sure i would put neither kings nor kaisars nor ony earthly creatures afore them  how mean ye by that ye auld fule womandye think that i order ony thing against conscience  i dinna pretend to say that my leddy in regard o your leddyships conscience which has been brought up as it were wi prelatic principles but ilka ane maun walk by the light o their ain and mine said mause waxing bolder as the conference became animated tells me that i suld leave acot kaleyard and cows grassand suffer a rather than that i or mine should put on harness in an unlawfu cause  unlawfu exclaimed her mistress the cause to which you are called by your lawful leddy and mistressby the command of the kingby the writ of the privy councilby the order of the lordlieutenantby the warrant of the sheriff  ay my leddy nae doubt but no to displeasure your leddyship yell mind that there was ance a king in scripture they cad nebuchadnezzar and he set up a golden image in the plain o dura as it might be in the haugh yonder by the waterside where the array were warned to meet yesterday and the princes and the governors and the captains and the judges themsells forby the treasurers the counsellors and the sheriffs were warned to the dedication thereof and commanded to fall down and worship at the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and all kinds of music  and what o a this ye fule wife or what had nebuchadnezzar to do with the wappenschaw of the upper ward of clydesdale  only just thus far my leddy continued mause firmly that prelacy is like the great golden image in the plain of dura and that as shadrach meshach and abednego were borne out in refusing to bow down and worship so neither shall cuddy headrigg your leddyships poor pleughman at least wi his auld mithers consent make murgeons or jennyflections as they ca them in the house of the prelates and curates nor gird him wi armour to fight in their cause either at the sound of kettledrums organs bagpipes or ony other kind of music whatever  lady margaret bellenden heard this exposition of scripture with the greatest possible indignation as well as surprise  i see which way the wind blaws she exclaimed after a pause of astonishment the evil spirit of the year sixteen hundred and fortytwa is at wark again as merrily as ever and ilka auld wife in the chimleyneuck will be for knapping doctrine wi doctors o divinity and the godly fathers o the church  if your leddyship means the bishops and curates im sure they hae been but stepfathers to the kirk o scotland and since your leddyship is pleased to speak o parting wi us i am free to tell you a piece o my mind in another article your leddyship and the steward hae been pleased to propose that my son cuddie suld work in the barn wi a newfangled machine note probably something similar to the barnfanners now used for winnowing corn which were not however used in their present shape until about 1730 they were objected to by the more rigid sectaries on their first introduction upon such reasoning as that of honest mause in the text for dighting the corn frae the chaff thus impiously thwarting the will of divine providence by raising wind for your leddyships ain particular use by human art instead of soliciting it by prayer or waiting patiently for whatever dispensation of wind providence was pleased to send upon the sheelinghill now my leddythe woman would drive ony reasonable being daft said lady margaret then resuming her tone of authority and indifference she concluded weel mause ill just end where i sud hae begunyere ower learned and ower godly for me to dispute wi sae i have just this to sayeither cuddie must attend musters when hes lawfully warned by the ground officer or the sooner he and you flit and quit my bounds the better theres nae scarcity o auld wives or ploughmen but if there were i had rather that the rigs of tillietudlem bare naething but windlestraes and sandy lavrocks note bentgrass and sandlarks than that they were ploughed by rebels to the king  aweel my leddy said mause i was born here and thought to die where my father died and your leddyship has been a kind mistress ill neer deny that and ise neer cease to pray for you and for miss edith and that ye may be brought to see the error of your ways but stillthe error of my ways interrupted lady margaret much incensedthe error of my ways ye uncivil woman  ou ay my leddy we are blinded that live in this valley of tears and darkness and hae a ower mony errors grit folks as weel as smabut as i said my puir bennison will rest wi you and yours wherever i am i will be wae to hear o your affliction and blithe to hear o your prosperity temporal and spiritual but i canna prefer the commands of an earthly mistress to those of a heavenly master and sae i am een ready to suffer for righteousness sake  it is very well said lady margaret turning her back in great displeasure ye ken my will mause in the matter ill hae nae whiggery in the barony of tillietudlemthe next thing wad be to set up a conventicle in my very withdrawing room  having said this she departed with an air of great dignity and mause giving way to feelings which she had suppressed during the interviewfor she like her mistress had her own feeling of pridenow lifted up her voice and wept aloud  cuddie whose malady real or pretended still detained him in bed lay perdu during all this conference snugly ensconced within his boarded bedstead and terrified to death lest lady margaret whom he held in hereditary reverence should have detected his presence and bestowed on him personally some of those bitter reproaches with which she loaded his mother but as soon as he thought her ladyship fairly out of hearing he bounced up in his nest  the foul fa ye that i suld say sae he cried out to his mother for a langtongued clavering wife as my father honest man aye cad ye couldna ye let the leddy alane wi your whiggery and i was een as great a gomeral to let ye persuade me to lie up here amang the blankets like a hurcheon instead o gaun to the wappenschaw like other folk odd but i put a trick on ye for i was out at the windowbole when your auld back was turned and awa down by to hae a baff at the popinjay and i shot within twa ont i cheated the leddy for your clavers but i wasna gaun to cheat my joe but she may marry whae she likes now for im clean dung ower this is a waur dirdum than we got frae mr gudyill when ye garrd me refuse to eat the plumporridge on yuleeve as if it were ony matter to god or man whether a pleughman had suppit on minched pies or sour sowens  o whisht my bairn whisht replied mause thou kensna about thae thingsit was forbidden meat things dedicated to set days and holidays which are inhibited to the use of protestant christians  and now continued her son ye hae brought the leddy hersell on our handsan i could but hae gotten some decent claes in i wad hae spanged out o bed and tauld her i wad ride where she liked night or day an she wad but leave us the free house and the yaird that grew the best early kale in the haill country and the cows grass  o wow my winsome bairn cuddie continued the old dame murmur not at the dispensation never grudge suffering in the gude cause  but what ken i if the cause is gude or no mither rejoined cuddie for a ye bleeze out sae muckle doctrine about it its clean beyond my comprehension athegither i see nae sae muckle difference atween the twa ways ot as a the folk pretend its very true the curates read aye the same words ower again and if they be right words what for no a gude tales no the waur o being twice tauld i trow and a body has aye the better chance to understand it every bodys no sae gleg at the uptake as ye are yoursell mither  o my dear cuddie this is the sairest distress of a said the anxious mothero how aften have i shown ye the difference between a pure evangelical doctrine and ane thats

the zealous mause forbear sic carnal selfseeking language whilk is just a misdoubting o providencei have not seen the son of the righteous begging his bread sae says the text and your father was a douce honest man though somewhat warldly in his dealings and cumbered about earthly things een like yoursell my jo  aweel said cuddie after a little consideration i see but ae gate fort and thats a

                     twelfth night  it was evening when mr henry morton perceived an old woman wrapped in her tartan plaid supported by a stout stupidlooking fellow in hoddingrey approach the house of milnwood old mause made her courtesy but cuddie took the lead in addressing morton indeed he had previously stipulated with his mother that he was to manage matters his own way for though he readily allowed his general inferiority of understanding and filially submitted to the guidance of his mother on most ordinary occasions yet he said for getting a service or getting forward in the warld he could somegate gar the wee pickle sense he had gang muckle farther than hers though she could crack like ony minister o them a  accordingly he thus opened the conversation with young morton a braw night this for the rye your honour the west park will be breering bravely this een  i do not doubt it cuddie but what can have brought your motherthis is your mother is it not cuddie nodded what can have brought your mother and you down the water so late  troth stir just what gars the auld wives trotneshessity stirim seeking for service stir  for service cuddie and at this time of the year how comes that  mause could forbear no longer proud alike of her cause and her sufferings she commenced with an affected humility of tone it has pleased heaven an it like your honour to distinguish us by a visitationdeils in the wife and nae gude whispered cuddie to his mother an ye come out wi your whiggery theyll no daur open a door to us through the haill country then aloud and addressing morton my mothers auld stir and she has rather forgotten hersell in speaking to my leddy that canna weel bide to be contradickit as i ken naebody likes it if they could help themsells especially by her ain folkand mr harrison the steward and gudyill the butler theyre no very fond o us and its ill sitting at rome and striving wi the pope sae i thought it best to flit before ill came to waurand heres a wee bit line to your honour frae a friend will maybe say some mair about it  morton took the billet and crimsoning up to the ears between joy and surprise read these words if you can serve these poor helpless people you will oblige e b  it was a few instants before he could attain composure enough to ask and what is your object cuddie and how can i be of use to you  wark stir wark and a service is my objecta bit beild for my mither and mysellwe hae gude plenishing o our ain if we had the cast o a cart to bring it downand milk and meal and greens enow for im gay gleg at mealtime and sae is my mither lang may it be saeand for the pennyfee and a that ill just leave it to the laird and you i ken yell no see a poor lad wranged if ye can help it  morton shook his head for the meat and lodging cuddie i think i can promise something but the pennyfee will be a hard chapter i doubt  ill tak my chance ot stir replied the candidate for service rather than gang down about hamilton or ony sic far country  well step into the kitchen cuddie and ill do what i can for you  the negotiation was not without difficulties morton had first to bring over the housekeeper who made a thousand objections as usual in order to have the pleasure of being besought and entreated but when she was gained over it was comparatively easy to induce old milnwood to accept of a servant whose wages were to be in his own option an outhouse was therefore assigned to mause and her son for their habitation and it was settled that they were for the time to be admitted to eat of the frugal fare provided for the family until their own establishment should be completed as for morton he exhausted his own very slender stock of money in order to make cuddie such a present under the name of arles as might show his sense of the value of the recommendation delivered to him  and now were settled ance mair said cuddie to his mother and if were no sae bien and comfortable as we were up yonder yet lifes life ony gate and were wi decent kirkganging folk o your ain persuasion mither there will be nae quarrelling about that  of my persuasion hinnie said the tooenlightened mause waes me for thy blindness and theirs o cuddie they are but in the court of the gentiles and will neer win farther ben i doubt they are but little better than the prelatists themsells they wait on the ministry of that blinded man peter poundtext ance a precious teacher of the word but now a backsliding pastor that has for the sake of stipend and family maintenance forsaken the strict path and gane astray after the black indulgence o my son had ye but profited by the gospel doctrines ye hae heard in the glen of bengonnar frae the dear richard rumbleberry that sweet youth who suffered martyrdom in the grassmarket afore candlemas didna ye hear him say that erastianism was as bad as prelacy and that the indulgence was as bad as erastianism  heard ever ony body the like o this interrupted cuddie well be driven out o house and ha again afore we ken where to turn oursells weej mither i hae just ae word mairan i hear ony mair o your dinafore folk that is for i dinna mind your clavers mysell they aye set me sleepingbut if i hear ony mair din afore folk as i was saying about poundtexts and rumbleberries and doctrines and malignants ise een turn a single sodger mysell or maybe a sergeant or a captain if ye plague me the mair and let rumbleberry and you gang to the deil thegither i neer gat ony gude by his doctrine as ye cat but a sour fit o the batts wi sitting amang the wat mosshags for four hours at a yoking and the leddy cured me wi some hickerypickery mair by token an she had kend how i came by the disorder she wadna hae been in sic a hurry to mend it  although groaning in spirit over the obdurate and impenitent state as she thought it of her son cuddie mause durst neither urge him farther on the topic nor altogether neglect the warning he had given her she knew the disposition of her deceased helpmate whom this surviving pledge of their union greatly resembled and remembered that although submitting implicitly in most things to her boast of superior acuteness he used on certain occasions when driven to extremity to be seized with fits of obstinacy which neither remonstrance flattery nor threats were capable of overpowering trembling therefore at the very possibility of cuddies fulfilling his threat she put a guard over her tongue and even when poundtext was commended in her presence as an able and fructifying preacher she had the good sense to suppress the contradiction which thrilled upon her tongue and to express her sentiments no otherwise than by deep groans which the hearers charitably construed to flow from a vivid recollection of the more pathetic parts of his homilies how long she could have repressed her feelings it is difficult to say an unexpected accident relieved her from the necessity  the laird of milnwood kept up all old fashions which were connected with economy it was therefore still the custom in his house as it had been universal in scotland about fifty years before that the domestics after having placed the dinner on the table sate down at the lower end of the board and partook of the share which was assigned to them in company with their masters on the day therefore after cuddies arrival being the third from the opening of this narrative old robin who was butler valetdechambre footman gardener and what not in the house of milnwood placed on the table an immense charger of broth thickened with oatmeal and colewort in which ocean of liquid was indistinctly discovered by close observers two or three short ribs of lean mutton sailing to and fro two huge baskets one of bread made of barley and pease and one of oatcakes flanked this standing dish a large boiled salmon would nowadays have indicated more liberal housekeeping but at that period salmon was caught in such plenty in the considerable rivers in scotland that instead of being accounted a delicacy it was generally applied to feed the servants who are said sometimes to have stipulated that they should not be required to eat a food so luscious and surfeiting in its quality above five times aweek the large black jack filled with very small beer of milnwoods own brewing was allowed to the company at discretion as were the bannocks cakes and broth but the mutton was reserved for the heads of the family mrs wilson included and a measure of ale somewhat deserving the name was set apart in a silver tankard for their exclusive use a huge kebbock a cheese that is made with ewemilk mixed with cows milk and a jar of salt butter were in common to the company  to enjoy this exquisite cheer was placed at the head of the table the old laird himself with his nephew on the one side and the favourite housekeeper on the other at a long interval and beneath the salt of course sate old robin a meagre halfstarved servingman rendered cross and cripple by rheumatism and a dirty drab of a housemaid whom use had rendered callous to the daily exercitations which her temper underwent at the hands of her master and mrs wilson a barnman a whiteheaded cowherd boy with cuddie the new ploughman and his mother completed the party the other labourers belonging to the property resided in their own houses happy at least in this that if their cheer was not more delicate than that which we have described they could eat their fill unwatched by the sharp envious grey eyes of milnwood which seemed to measure the quantity that each of his dependents swallowed as closely as if their glances attended each mouthful in its progress from the lips to the stomach this close inspection was unfavourable to cuddie who sustained much prejudice in his new masters opinion by the silent celerity with which he caused the victuals to disappear before him and ever and anon milnwood turned his eyes from the huge feeder to cast indignant glances upon his nephew whose repugnance to rustic labour was the principal cause of his needing a ploughman and who had been the direct means of his hiring this very cormorant  pay thee wages quotha said milnwood to himselfthou wilt eat in a week the value of mair than thou canst work for in a month  these disagreeable ruminations were interrupted by a loud knocking at the outergate it was a universal custom in scotland that when the family was at dinner the outergate of the courtyard if there was one and if not the door of the house itself was always shut and locked and only guests of importance or persons upon urgent business sought or received admittance at that time       note  locking the door during dinner the custom of keeping the      door of a house or chateau locked during the time of dinner      probably arose from the family being anciently assembled in the hall      at that meal and liable to surprise but it was in many instances      continued as a point of high etiquette of which the following is an      example       a considerable landed proprietor in dumfriesshire being a      bachelor without near relations and determined to make his will      resolved previously to visit his two nearest kinsmen and decide      which should be his heir according to the degree of kindness with      which he should be received like a good clansman he first visited      his own chief a baronet in rank descendant and representative of      one of the oldest families in scotland unhappily the dinnerbell      had rung and the door of the castle had been locked before his      arrival the visitor in vain announced his name and requested      admittance but his chief adhered to the ancient etiquette and      would on no account suffer the doors to be unbarred irritated at      this cold reception the old laird rode on to sanquhar castle then      the residence of the duke of queensberry who no sooner heard his      name than knowing well he had a will to make the drawbridge      dropped and the gates flew openthe table was covered anewhis      graces bachelor and intestate kinsman was received with the utmost      attention and respect and it is scarcely necessary to add that      upon his death some years after the visitors considerable landed      property went to augment the domains of the ducal house of      queensberry this happened about the end of the seventeenth      century  the family of milnwood were therefore surprised and in the unsettled state of the times something alarmed at the earnest and repeated knocking with which the gate was now assailed mrs wilson ran in person to the door and having reconnoitred those who were so clamorous for admittance through some secret aperture with which most scottish doorways were furnished for the express purpose she returned wringing her hands in great dismay exclaiming the redcoats the redcoats  robinploughmanwhat ca they yebarnsmannevoy harryopen the door open the door exclaimed old milnwood snatching up and slipping into his pocket the two or three silver spoons with which the upper end of the table was garnished those beneath the salt being of goodly horn speak them fair sirslord love ye speak them fairthey winna bide thrawingwere a harriedwere a harried  while the servants admitted the troopers whose oaths and threats already indicated resentment at the delay they had been put to cuddie took the opportunity to whisper to his mother now ye daft auld carline mak yoursell deafye hae made us a deaf ere nowand let me speak for ye i wad like ill to get my neck raxed for an auld wifes clashes though ye be our mither  o hinny ay ise be silent or thou sall come to ill was the corresponding whisper of mause but bethink ye my dear them that deny the word the word will denyher admonition was cut short by the entrance of the lifeguardsmen a party of four troopers commanded by bothwell  in they tramped making a tremendous clatter upon the stonefloor with the ironshod heels of their large jackboots and the clash and clang of their long heavy baskethilted broadswords milnwood and his housekeeper trembled from wellgrounded apprehensions of the system of exaction and plunder carried on during these domiciliary visits henry morton was discomposed with more special cause for he remembered that he stood answerable to the laws for having harboured burley the widow mause headrigg between fear for her sons life and an overstrained and enthusiastic zeal which reproached her for consenting even tacitly to belie her religious sentiments was in a strange quandary the other servants quaked for they knew not well what cuddie alone with the look of supreme indifference and stupidity which a scottish peasant can at times assume as a mask for considerable shrewdness and craft continued to swallow large spoonfuls of his broth to command which he had drawn within his sphere the large vessel that contained it and helped himself amid the confusion to a sevenfold portion  what is your pleasure here gentlemen said milnwood humbling himself before the satellites of power  we come in behalf of the king answered bothwell why the devil did you keep us so long standing at the door  we were at dinner answered milnwood and the door was locked as is usual in landward towns note the scots retain the use of the word town in its comprehensive saxon meaning as a place of habitation a mansion or a farm house though solitary is called the town a landward town is a dwelling situated in the country in this country i am sure gentlemen if i had kend ony servants of our gude king had stood at the doorbut wad ye please to drink some aleor some brandyor a cup of canary sack or claret wine making a pause between each offer as long as a stingy bidder at an auction who is loath to advance his offer for a favourite lot  claret for me said one fellow  i like ale better said another provided it is right juice of john barleycorn  better never was malted said milnwood i can hardly say sae muckle for the claret its thin and cauld gentlemen  brandy will cure that said a third fellow a glass of brandy to three glasses of wine prevents the curmurring in the stomach  brandy ale sack and claretwell try them all said bothwell and stick to that which is best theres good sense in that if the damndest whig in scotland had said it  hastily yet with a reluctant quiver of his muscles milnwood lugged out two ponderous keys and delivered them to the governante  the housekeeper said bothwell taking a seat and throwing himself upon it is neither so young nor so handsome as to tempt a man to follow her to the gauntrees and devil a one here is there worth sending in her placewhats thismeat searching with a fork among the broth and fishing up a cutlet of muttoni think i could eat a bitwhy its as tough as if the devils dam had hatched it  if there is any thing better in the house sir said milnwood alarmed at these symptoms of disapprobationno no said bothwell its not worth while i must proceed to businessyou attend poundtext the presbyterian parson i understand mr morton  mr morton hastened to slide in a confession and apology  by the indulgence of his gracious majesty and the government for i wad do nothing out of lawi hae nae objection whatever to the establishment of a moderate episcopacy but only that i am a countrybred man and the ministers are a hamelier kind of folk and i can follow their doctrine better and with reverence sir its a mair frugal establishment for the country  well i care nothing about that said bothwell they are indulged and theres an end of it but for my part if i were to give the law never a cropeard cur of the whole pack should bark in a scotch pulpit however i am to obey commandsthere comes the liquor put it down my good old lady  he decanted about onehalf of a quart bottle of claret into a wooden quaigh or bicker and took it off at a draught  you did your good wine injustice my friendits better than your brandy though thats good too will you pledge me to the kings health  with pleasure said milnwood in alebut i never drink claret and keep only a very little for some honoured friends  like me i suppose said bothwell and then pushing the bottle to henry he said here young man pledge you the kings health  henry filled a moderate glass in silence regardless of the hints and pushes of his uncle which seemed to indicate that he ought to have followed his example in preferring beer to wine  well said bothwell have ye all drank the toastwhat is that old wife about give her a glass of brandy she shall drink the kings health byif your honour pleases said cuddie with great stolidity of aspect this is my mither stir and shes as deaf as corralinn we canna mak her hear day nor door but if your honour pleases i am ready to drink the kings health for her in as mony glasses of brandy as ye think neshessary  i dare swear you are answered bothwell you look like a fellow that would stick to brandyhelp thyself man alls free whereer i come tom help the maid to a comfortable cup though shes but a dirty jilt neither fill round once moreheres to our noble commander colonel graham of claverhousewhat the devil is the old woman groaning for she looks as very a whig as ever sate on a hillsidedo you renounce the covenant good woman  whilk covenant is your honour meaning is it the covenant of works or the covenant of grace said cuddie interposing  any covenant all covenants that ever were hatched answered the trooper  mither cried cuddie affecting to speak as to a deaf person the gentleman wants to ken if ye will renunce the covenant of works  with all my heart cuddie said mause and pray that my feet may be delivered from the snare thereof  come said bothwell the old dame has come more frankly off than i expected another cup round and then well proceed to businessyou have all heard i suppose of the horrid and barbarous murder committed upon the person of the archbishop of st andrews by ten or eleven armed fanatics  all started and looked at each other at length milnwood himself answered they had heard of some such misfortune but were in hopes it had not been true  there is the relation published by government old gentleman what do you think of it  think sir whwhwhatever the council please to think of it stammered milnwood  i desire to have your opinion more explicitly my friend said the dragoon authoritatively  milnwoods eyes hastily glanced through the paper to pick out the strongest expressions of censure with which it abounded in gleaning which he was greatly aided by their being printed in italics  i think it abloody and execrablemurder and parricidedevised by hellish and implacable crueltyutterly abominable and a scandal to the land  well said old gentleman said the queristheres to thee and i wish you joy of your good principles you owe me a cup of thanks for having taught you them nay thou shalt pledge me in thine own sacksour ale sits ill upon a loyal stomachnow comes your turn young man what think you of the matter in hand  i should have little objection to answer you said henry if i knew what right you had to put the question  the lord preserve us said the old housekeeper to ask the like o that at a trooper when a folk ken they do whatever they like through the haill country wi man and woman beast and body  the old gentleman exclaimed in the same horror at his nephews audacity hold your peace sir or answer the gentleman discreetly do you mean to affront the kings authority in the person of a sergeant of the lifeguards  silence all of you exclaimed bothwell striking his hand fiercely on the tablesilence every one of you and hear meyou ask me for my right to examine you sir to henry my cockade and my broadsword are my commission and a better one than ever old nol gave to his roundheads and if you want to know more about it you may look at the act of council empowering his majestys officers and soldiers to search for examine and apprehend suspicious persons and therefore once more i ask you your opinion of the death of archbishop sharpeits a new touchstone we have got for trying peoples metal  henry had by this time reflected upon the useless risk to which he would expose the family by resisting the tyrannical power which was delegated to such rude hands he therefore read the narrative over and replied composedly i have no hesitation to say that the perpetrators of this assassination have committed in my opinion a rash and wicked action which i regret the more as i foresee it will be made the cause of proceedings against many who are both innocent of the deed and as far from approving it as myself  while henry thus expressed himself bothwell who bent his eyes keenly upon him seemed suddenly to recollect his features  aha my friend captain popinjay i think i have seen you before and in very suspicious company  i saw you once answered henry in the publichouse of the town of  and with whom did you leave that publichouse youngsterwas it not with john balfour of burley one of the murderers of the archbishop  i did leave the house with the person you have named answered henry i scorn to deny it but so far from knowing him to be a murderer of the primate i did not even know at the time that such a crime had been committed  lord have mercy on me i am ruinedutterly ruined and undone exclaimed milnwood that callants tongue will rin the head aff his ain shoulders and waste my gudes to the very grey cloak on my back  but you knew burley continued bothwell still addressing henry and regardless of his uncles interruption to be an intercommuned rebel and traitor and you knew the prohibition to deal with such persons you knew that as a loyal subject you were prohibited to reset supply or intercommune with this attainted traitor to correspond with him by word writ or message or to supply him with meat drink house harbour or victual under the highest painsyou knew all this and yet you broke the law henry was silent where did you part from him continued bothwell was it in the highway or did you give him harbourage in this very house  in this house said his uncle he dared not for his neck bring ony traitor into a house of mine  dare he deny that he did so said bothwell  as you charge it to me as a crime said henry you will excuse my saying any thing that will criminate myself  o the lands of milnwoodthe bonny lands of milnwood that have been in the name of morton twa hundred years exclaimed his uncle they are barking and fleeing outfield and infield haugh and holme  no sir said henry you shall not suffer on my accounti own he continued addressing bothwell i did give this man a nights lodging as to an old military comrade of my father but it was not only without my uncles knowledge but contrary to his express general orders i trust if my evidence is considered as good against myself it will have some weight in proving my uncles innocence  come young man said the soldier in a somewhat milder tone youre a smart spark enough and i am sorry for you and your uncle here is a fine old trojan kinder i see to his guests than himself for he gives us wine and drinks his own thin aletell me all you know about this burley what he said when you parted from him where he went and where he is likely now to be found and dn it ill wink as hard on your share of the business as my duty will permit theres a thousand merks on the murdering whigamores head an i could but light on itcome out with itwhere did you part with him  you will excuse my answering that question sir said morton the same cogent reasons which induced me to afford him hospitality at considerable risk to myself and my friends would command me to respect his secret if indeed he had trusted me with any  so you refuse to give me an answer said bothwell  i have none to give returned henry  perhaps i could teach you to find one by tying a piece of lighted match betwixt your fingers answered bothwell  o for pitys sake sir said old alison apart to her master gie them sillerits siller theyre seekingtheyll murder mr henry and yoursell next  milnwood groaned in perplexity and bitterness of spirit and with a tone as if he was giving up the ghost exclaimed if twenty pppunds would make up this unhappy mattermy master insinuated alison to the sergeant would gie twenty punds sterlingpunds scotch ye bh interrupted milnwood for the agony of his avarice overcame alike his puritanic precision and the habitual respect he entertained for his housekeeper  punds sterling insisted the housekeeper if ye wad hae the gudeness to look ower the lads misconduct hes that dour ye might tear him to pieces and ye wad neer get a word out o him and it wad do ye little gude im sure to burn his bonny fingerends  why said bothwell hesitating i dont knowmost of my cloth would have the money and take off the prisoner too but i bear a conscience and if your master will stand to your offer and enter into a bond to produce his nephew and if all in the house will take the testoath i do not know buto ay ay sir cried mrs wilson ony test ony oaths ye please and then aside to her master haste ye away sir and get the siller or they will burn the house about our lugs  old milnwood cast a rueful look upon his adviser and moved off like a piece of dutch clockwork to set at liberty his imprisoned angels in this dire emergency meanwhile sergeant bothwell began to put the testoath with such a degree of solemn reverence as might have been expected being just about the same which is used to this day in his majestys customhouse  youwhats your name woman  alison wilson sir  you alison wilson solemnly swear certify and declare that you judge it unlawful for subjects under pretext of reformation or any other pretext whatsoever to enter into leagues and covenantshere the ceremony was interrupted by a strife between cuddie and his mother which long conducted in whispers now became audible  oh whisht mither whisht theyre upon a communingoh whisht and theyll agree weel eneuch eenow  i will not whisht cuddie replied his mother i will uplift my voice and spare noti will confound the man of sin even the scarlet man

admonitiondiv ye think to come here wi your soulkilling saintseducing conscienceconfounding oaths and tests and bandsyour snares and your traps and your ginssurely it is in vain that a net is spread

 curse the old hag said one of the dragoons gag her and take her to headquarters  for shame andrews said bothwell remember the good lady belongs to the fair sex and uses only the privilege of her tonguebut hark ye good woman every bull of bashan and red dragon will not be so civil as i am or be contented to leave you to the charge of the constable and duckingstool in the meantime i must necessarily carry off this young man to headquarters i cannot answer to my commandingofficer to leave him in a house where i have heard so much treason and fanaticism  se now mither what ye hae dune whispered cuddie theres the philistines as ye ca them are gaun to whirry awa mr henry and a wi your nashgab deil be ont  haud yere tongue ye cowardly loon said the mother and layna the wyte on me if you and thae thowless gluttons that are sitting staring like cows bursting on clover wad testify wi your hands as i have testified wi my tongue they should never harle the precious young lad awa to captivity  while this dialogue passed the soldiers had already bound and secured their prisoner milnwood returned at this instant and alarmed at the preparations he beheld hastened to proffer to bothwell though with many a grievous groan the purse of gold which he had been obliged to rummage out as ransom for his nephew the trooper took the purse with an air of indifference weighed it in his hand chucked it up into the air and caught it as it fell then shook his head and said theres many a merry night in this nest of yellow boys but dn me if i dare venture for themthat old woman has spoken too loud and before all the men toohark ye old gentleman to milnwood i must take your nephew to headquarters so i cannot in conscience keep more than is my due as civilitymoney then opening the purse he gave a gold piece to each of the soldiers and took three to himself now said he you have the comfort to know that your kinsman young captain popinjay will be carefully looked after and civilly used and the rest of the money i return to you  milnwood eagerly extended his hand  only you know said bothwell still playing with the purse that every landholder is answerable for the conformity and loyalty of his household and that these fellows of mine are not obliged to be silent on the subject of the fine sermon we have had from that old puritan in the tartan plaid there and i presume you are aware that the consequences of delation will be a heavy fine before the council  good sergeantworthy captain exclaimed the terrified miser i am sure there is no person in my house to my knowledge would give cause of offence  nay answered bothwell you shall hear her give her testimony as she calls it herselfyou fellow to cuddie stand back and let your mother speak her mind i see shes primed and loaded again since her first discharge  lord noble sir said cuddie an auld wifes tongues but a feckless matter to mak sic a fash about neither my father nor me ever minded muckle what our mither said  hold your peace my lad while you are well said bothwell i promise you i think you are slyer than you would like to be supposedcome good dame you see your master will not believe that you can give us so bright a testimony  mauses zeal did not require this spur to set her again on full career  woe to the compliers and carnal selfseekers she said that daub over and drown their consciences by complying with wicked exactions and giving mammon of unrighteousness to the sons of belial that it may make their peace with them it is a sinful compliance a base confederacy with the enemy it is the evil that menahem did in the sight of the lord when he gave a thousand talents to pul king of assyria that his hand might be with him second kings feifteen chapter nineteen verse it is the evil deed of ahab when he sent money to tiglathpeleser see the saame second kings saxteen and aught and if it was accounted a backsliding even in godly hezekiah that he complied with sennacherib giving him money and offering to bear that which was put upon him see the saame second kings aughteen chapter fourteen and feifteen verses even so it is with them that in this contumacious and backsliding generation pays localities and fees and cess and fines to greedy and unrighteous publicans and extortions and stipends to hireling curates dumb dogs which bark not sleeping lying down loving to slumber and gives gifts to be helps and hires to our oppressors and destroyers they are all like the casters of a lot with themlike the preparing of a table for the troop and the furnishing a drinkoffering to the number  theres a fine sound of doctrine for you mr morton how like you that said bothwell or how do you think the council will like it i think we can carry the greatest part of it in our heads without a kylevine pen and a pair of tablets such as you bring to conventicles she denies paying cess i think andrews  yes by g said andrews and she swore it was a sin to give a trooper a pot of ale or ask him to sit down to a table  you hear said bothwell addressing milnwood but its your own affair and he proffered back the purse with its diminished contents with an air of indifference  milnwood whose head seemed stunned by the accumulation of his misfortunes extended his hand mechanically to take the purse  are ye mad said his housekeeper in a whisper tell them to keep itthey will keep it either by fair means or foul and its our only chance to make them quiet  i canna do it ailiei canna do it said milnwood in the bitterness of his heart i canna part wi the siller i hae counted sae often ower to thae blackguards  then i maun do it mysell milnwood said the housekeeper or see a gang wrang thegithermy master sir she said addressing bothwell canna think o taking back ony thing at the hand of an honourable gentleman like you he implores ye to pit up the siller and be as kind to his nephew as ye can and be favourable in reporting our dispositions to government and let us tak nae wrang for the daft speeches of an auld jaud here she turned fiercely upon mause to indulge herself for the effort which it cost her to assume a mild demeanour to the soldiers a daft

there is a respectable sponsible moneybroking heritor like mr morton of milnwood who has the means of atoning her trespasses let the old mother fly to raise another brood shes too tough to be made any thing of herselfhere he cried one other round to milnwood and his rooftree and to our next merry meeting with himwhich i think will not be far distant if he keeps such a fanatical family  he then ordered the party to take their horses and pressed the best in milnwoods stable into the kings service to carry the prisoner mrs wilson with weeping eyes made up a small parcel of necessaries for henrys compelled journey and as she bustled about took an opportunity unseen by the party to slip into his hand a small sum of money bothwell and his troopers in other respects kept their promise and were civil they did not bind their prisoner but contented themselves with leading his horse between a file of men they then mounted and marched off with much mirth and laughter among themselves leaving the milnwood family in great confusion the old laird himself overpowered by the loss of his nephew and the unavailing outlay of twenty pounds sterling did nothing the whole evening but rock himself backwards and forwards in his great leathern easychair repeating the same lamentation of ruined on a sides ruined on a sidesharried and undoneharried and undonebody and gudes body and gudes  mrs alison wilsons grief was partly indulged and partly relieved by the torrent of invectives with which she accompanied mause and cuddies expulsion from milnwood  ill luck be in the graning corse o

worst that will happen will be strapping up for it and that is many an honest fellows lot i tell you fairly your lifes within the compass of the law unless you make submission and get off by a round fine upon your uncles estate he can well afford it  that vexes me more than the rest said henry he parts with his money with regret and as he had no concern whatever with my having given this person shelter for a night i wish to heaven if i escape a capital punishment that the penalty may be of a kind i could bear in my own person  why perhaps said bothwell they will propose to you to go into one of the scotch regiments that are serving abroad its no bad line of service if your friends are active and there are any knocks going you may soon get a commission  i am by no means sure answered morton that such a sentence is not the best thing that can happen to me  why then you are no real whig after all said the sergeant  i have hitherto meddled with no party in the state said henry but have remained quietly at home and sometimes i have had serious thoughts of joining one of our foreign regiments  have you replied bothwell why i honour you for it i have served in the scotch french guards myself many a long day its the place for learning discipline dn me they never mind what you do when you are off duty but miss you the rollcall and see how theyll arrange youdn me if old captain montgomery didnt make me mount guard upon the arsenal in my steelback and breast platesleeves and headpiece for six hours at once under so burning a sun that gad i was baked like a turtle at port royale i swore never to miss answering to francis stewart again though i should leave my hand of cards upon the drumheadah discipline is a capital thing  in other respects you liked the service said morton  par excellence said bothwell women wine and wassail all to be had for little but the asking and if you find it in your conscience to let a fat priest think he has some chance to convert you gad hell help you to these comforts himself just to gain a little ground in your good affection where will you find a cropeared whig parson will be so civil  why nowhere i agree with you said henry but what was your chief duty  to guard the kings person said bothwell to look after the safety of louis le grand my boy and now and then to take a turn among the huguenots protestants that is and there we had fine scope it brought my hand pretty well in for the service in this country but come as you are to be a bon camerado as the spaniards say i must put you in cash with some of your old uncles broadpieces this is cutters law we must not see a pretty fellow want if we have cash ourselves  thus speaking he pulled out his purse took out some of the contents and offered them to henry without counting them young morton declined the favour and not judging it prudent to acquaint the sergeant notwithstanding his apparent generosity that he was actually in possession of some money he assured him he should have no difficulty in getting a supply from his uncle  well said bothwell in that case these yellow rascals must serve to ballast my purse a little longer i always make it a rule never to quit the tavern unless ordered on duty while my purse is so weighty that i can chuck it over the signpost note a highland laird whose peculiarities live still in the recollection of his countrymen used to regulate his residence at edinburgh in the following manner every day he visited the watergate as it is called of the canongate over which is extended a wooden arch specie being then the general currency he threw his purse over the gate and as long as it was heavy enough to be thrown over he continued his round of pleasure in the metropolis when it was too light he thought it time to retire to the highlands queryhow often would he have repeated this experiment at temple bar when it is so light that the wind blows it back then boot and saddlewe must fall on some way of replenishingbut what tower is that before us rising so high upon the steep bank out of the woods that surround it on every side  it is the tower of tillietudlem said one of the soldiers old lady margaret bellenden lives there shes one of the best affected women in the country and one thats a soldiers friend when i was hurt by one of the dd whig dogs that shot at me from behind a faulddike i lay a month there and would stand such another wound to be in as good quarters again  if that be the case said bothwell i will pay my respects to her as we pass and request some refreshment for men and horses i am as thirsty already as if i had drunk nothing at milnwood but it is a good thing in these times he continued addressing himself to henry that the kings soldier cannot pass a house without getting a refreshment in such houses as tilliewhat dye call it you are served for love in the houses of the avowed fanatics you help yourself by force and among the moderate presbyterians and other suspicious persons you are well treated from fear so your thirst is always quenched on some terms or other  and you purpose said henry anxiously to go upon that errand up to the tower younder  to be sure i do answered bothwell how should i be able to report favourably to my officers of the worthy ladys sound principles unless i know the taste of her sack for sack she will producethat i take for granted it is the favourite consoler of your old dowager of quality as small claret is the potation of your country laird  then for heavens sake said henry if you are determined to go there do not mention my name or expose me to a family that i am acquainted with let me be muffled up for the time in one of your soldiers cloaks and only mention me generally as a prisoner under your charge  with all my heart said bothwell i promised to use you civilly and i scorn to break my wordhere andrews wrap a cloak round the prisoner and do not mention his name nor where we caught him unless you would have a trot on a horse of wood       note  wooden mare the punishment of riding the wooden mare was      in the days of charles and long after one of the various and cruel      modes of enforcing military discipline in front of the old      guardhouse in the high street of edinburgh a large horse of this      kind was placed on which now and then in the more ancient times a      veteran might be seen mounted with a firelock tied to each foot      atoning for some small offence       there is a singular work entitled memoirs of prince william henry      duke of gloucester son of queen anne from his birth to his ninth      year in which jenkin lewis an honest welshman in attendance on the      royal infants person is pleased to record that his royal highness      laughed cried crowd and said gig and dy very like a babe of      plebeian descent he had also a premature taste for the discipline      as well as the show of war and had a corps of twentytwo boys      arrayed with paper caps and wooden swords for the maintenance of      discipline in this juvenile corps a wooden horse was established in      the presencechamber and was sometimes employed in the punishment      of offences not strictly military hughes the dukes tailor having      made him a suit of clothes which were too tight was appointed in      an order of the day issued by the young prince to be placed on this      penal steed the man of remnants by dint of supplication and      mediation escaped from the penance which was likely to equal the      inconveniences of his brother artists equestrian trip to brentford      but an attendant named weatherly who had presumed to bring the      young prince a toy after he had discarded the use of them was      actually mounted on the wooden horse without a saddle with his face      to the tail while he was plied by four servants of the household      with syringes and squirts till he had a thorough wetting he was a      waggish fellow says lewis and would not lose any thing for the      jokes sake when he was putting his tricks upon others so he was      obliged to submit cheerfully to what was inflicted upon him being      at our mercy to play him off well which we did accordingly amid      much such nonsense lewiss book shows that this poor child the      heir of the british monarchy who died when he was eleven years old      was in truth of promising parts and of a good disposition the      volume which rarely occurs is an octavo published in 1789 the      editor being dr philip hayes of oxford  they were at this moment at an arched gateway battlemented and flanked with turrets one whereof was totally ruinous excepting the lower story which served as a cowhouse to the peasant whose family inhabited the turret that remained entire the gate had been broken down by monks soldiers during the civil war and had never been replaced therefore presented no obstacle to bothwell and his party the avenue very steep and narrow and causewayed with large round stones ascended the side of the precipitous bank in an oblique and zigzag course now showing now hiding a view of the tower and its exterior bulwarks which seemed to rise almost perpendicularly above their heads the fragments of gothic defences which it exhibited were upon such a scale of strength as induced bothwell to exclaim its well this place is in honest and loyal hands egad if the enemy had it a dozen of old whigamore wives with their distaffs might keep it against a troop of dragoons at least if they had half the spunk of the old girl we left at milnwood upon my life he continued as they came in front of the large double tower and its surrounding defences and flankers it is a superb place founded says the worn inscription over the gateunless the remnant of my latin has given me the slipby sir ralph de bellenden in 1350a respectable antiquity i must greet the old lady with due honour though it should put me to the labour of recalling some of the compliments that i used to dabble in when i was wont to keep that sort of company  as he thus communed with himself the butler who had reconnoitred the soldiers from an arrowslit in the wall announced to his lady that a commanded party of dragoons or as he thought lifeguardsmen waited at the gate with a prisoner under their charge  i am certain said gudyill and positive that the sixth man is a prisoner for his horse is led and the two dragoons that are before have their carabines out of their budgets and rested upon their thighs it was aye the way we guarded prisoners in the days of the great marquis  kings soldiers said the lady probably in want of refreshment go gudyill make them welcome and let them be accommodated with what provision and forage the tower can affordand stay tell my gentlewoman to bring my black scarf and manteau i will go down myself to receive them one cannot show the kings lifeguards too much respect in times when they are doing so much for royal authority and dye hear gudyill let jenny dennison slip on her pearlings to walk before my niece and me and the three women to walk behind and bid my niece attend me instantly  fully accoutred and attended according to her directions lady margaret now sailed out into the courtyard of her tower with great courtesy and dignity sergeant bothwell saluated the grave and reverend lady of the manor with an assurance which had something of the light and careless address of the dissipated men of fashion in charles the seconds time and did not at all savour of the awkward or rude manners of a noncommissioned officer of dragoons his language as well as his manners seemed also to be refined for the time and occasion though the truth was that in the fluctuations of an adventurous and profligate life bothwell had sometimes kept company much better suited to his ancestry than to his present situation of life to the ladys request to know whether she could be of service to them he answered with a suitable bow that as they had to march some miles farther that night they would be much accommodated by permission to rest their horses for an hour before continuing their journey  with the greatest pleasure answered lady margaret and i trust that my people will see that neither horse nor men want suitable refreshment  we are well aware madam continued bothwell that such has always been the reception within the walls of tillietudlem of those who served the king  we have studied to discharge our duty faithfully and loyally on all occasions sir answered lady margaret pleased with the compliment both to our monarchs and to their followers particularly to their faithful soldiers it is not long ago and it probably has not escaped the recollection of his sacret majesty now on the throne since he himself honoured my poor house with his presence and breakfasted in a room in this castle mr sergeant which my waitinggentlewoman shall show you we still call it the kings room  bothwell had by this time dismounted his party and committed the horses to the charge of one file and the prisoner to that of another so that he himself was at liberty to continue the conversation which the lady had so condescendingly opened  since the king my master had the honour to experience your hospitality i cannot wonder that it is extended to those that serve him and whose principal merit is doing it with fidelity and yet i have a nearer relation to his majesty than this coarse red coat would seem to indicate  indeed sir probably said lady margaret you have belonged to his household  not exactly madam to his household but rather to his house a connexion through which i may claim kindred with most of the best families in scotland not i believe exclusive of that of tillietudlem  sir said the old lady drawing herself up with dignity at hearing what she conceived an impertinent jest i do not understand you  its but a foolish subject for one in my situation to talk of madam answered the trooper but you must have heard of the history and misfortunes of my grandfather francis stewart to whom james i his cousingerman gave the title of bothwell as my comrades give me the nickname it was not in the long run more advantageous to him than it is to me  indeed said lady margaret with much sympathy and surprise i have indeed always understood that the grandson of the last earl was in necessitous circumstances but i should never have expected to see him so low in the service with such connexions what ill fortune could have reduced you  nothing much out of the ordinary course i believe madam said bothwell interrupting and anticipating the question i have had my moments of good luck like my neighbourshave drunk my bottle with rochester thrown a merry main with buckingham and fought at tangiers side by side with sheffield but my luck never lasted i could not make useful friends out of my jolly companionsperhaps i was not sufficiently aware he continued with some bitterness how much the descendant of the scottish stewarts was honoured by being admitted into the convivialities of wilmot and villiers  but your scottish friends mr stewart your relations here so numerous and so powerful  why ay my lady replied the sergeant i believe some of them might have made me their gamekeeper for i am a tolerable shotsome of them would have entertained me as their bravo for i can use my sword welland here and there was one who when better company was not to be had would have made me his companion since i can drink my three bottles of winebut i dont know how it isbetween service and service among my kinsmen i prefer that of my cousin charles as the most creditable of them all although the pay is but poor and the livery far from splendid  it is a shame it is a burning scandal said lady margaret why do you not apply to his most sacred majesty he cannot but be surprised to hear that a scion of his august family  i beg your pardon madam interrupted the sergeant i am but a blunt soldier and i trust you will excuse me when i say his most sacred majesty is more busy in grafting scions of his own than with nourishing those which were planted by his grandfathers grandfather  well mr stewart said lady margaret one thing you must promise meremain at tillietudlem tonight tomorrow i expect your commandingofficer the gallant claverhouse to whom king and country are so much obliged for his exertions against those who would turn the world upside down i will speak to him on the subject of your speedy promotion and i am certain he feels too much both what is due to the blood which is in your veins and to the request of a lady so highly distinguished as myself by his most sacred majesty not to make better provision for you than you have yet received  i am much obliged to your ladyship and i certainly will remain her with my prisoner since you request it especially as it will be the earliest way of presenting him to colonel grahame and obtaining his ultimate orders about the young spark  who is your prisoner pray you said lady margaret  a young fellow of rather the better class in this neighbourhood who has been so incautious as to give countenance to one of the murderers of the primate and to facilitate the dogs escape  o fie upon him said lady margaret i am but too apt to forgive the injuries i have received at the hands of these rogues though some of them mr stewart are of a kind not like to be forgotten but those who would abet the perpetrators of so cruel and deliberate a homicide on a single man an old man and a man of the archbishops sacred professiono fie upon him if you wish to make him secure with little trouble to your people i will cause harrison or gudyill look for the key of our pit or principal dungeon it has not been open since the week after the victory of kilsythe when my poor sir arthur bellenden put twenty whigs into it but it is not more than two stories beneath ground so it cannot be unwholesome especially as i rather believe there is somewhere an opening to the outer air  i beg your pardon madam answered the sergeant i daresay the dungeon is a most admirable one but i have promised to be civil to the lad and i will take care he is watched so as to render escape impossible ill set those to look after him shall keep him as fast as if his legs were in the boots or his fingers in the thumbikins  well mr stewart rejoined the lady you best know your own duty i heartily wish you good evening and commit you to the care of my steward harrison i would ask you to keep ourselves company but aaa  o madam it requires no apology i am sensible the coarse red coat of king charles ii does and ought to annihilate the privileges of the red blood of king james v  not with me i do assure you mr stewart you do me injustice if you think so i will speak to your officer tomorrow and i trust you shall soon find yourself in a rank where there shall be no anomalies to be reconciled  i believe madam said bothwell your goodness will find itself deceived but i am obliged to you for your intention and at all events i will have a merry night with mr harrison  lady margaret took a ceremonious leave with all the respect which she owed to royal blood even when flowing in the veins of a sergeant of the lifeguards again assuring mr stewart that whatever was in the tower of tillietudlem was heartily at his service and that of his attendants  sergeant bothwell did not fail to take the lady at her word and readily forgot the height from which his family had descended in a joyous carousal during which mr harrison exerted himself to produce the best wine in the cellar and to excite his guest to be merry by that seducing example which in matters of conviviality goes farther than precept old gudyill associated himself with a party so much to his taste pretty much as davy in the second part of henry the fourth mingles in the revels of his master justice shallow he ran down to the cellar at the risk of breaking his neck to ransack some private catacomb known as he boasted only to himself and which never either had or should during his superintendence renden forth a bottle of its contents to any one but a real kings friend  when the duke dined here said the butler seating himself at a distance from the table being somewhat overawed by bothwells genealogy but yet hitching his seat half a yard nearer at every clause of his speech my leddy was importunate to have a bottle of that burgundyhere he advanced his seat a littlebut i dinna ken how it was mr stewart i misdoubted him i jaloused him sir no to be the friend to government he pretends the family are not to lippen to that auld duke james lost his heart before he lost his head and the worcester man was but wersh parritch neither gude to fry boil nor sup cauld with this witty observation he completed his first parallel and commenced a zigzag after the manner of an experienced engineer in order to continue his approaches to the table sae sir the faster my leddy cried burgundy to his gracethe auld burgundythe choice burgundythe burgundy that came ower in the thirtyninethe mair did i say to mysell deil a drap gangs down his hause unless i was mair sensible o his principles sack and claret may serve him na na gentlemen as lang as i hae the trust obutler in this house otillietudlem ill tak it upon me to see that nae disloyal or doubtfu person is the better o our binns but when i can find a true friend to the king and his cause and a moderate episcopacy when i find a man as i say that will stand by church and crown as i did mysell in my masters life and all through montroses time i think theres naething in the cellar ower gude to be spared on him  by this time he had completed a lodgment in the body of the place or in other words advanced his seat close to the table  and now mr francis stewart of bothwell i have the honour to drink your gude health and a commission tye and much luck may ye have in raking this country clear owhigs and roundheads fanatics and covenanters  bothwell who it may well be believed had long ceased to be very scrupulous in point of society which he regulated more by his convenience and station in life than his ancestry readily answered the butlers pledge acknowledging at the same time the excellence of the wine and mr gudyill thus adopted a regular member of the company continued to furnish them with the means of mirth until an early hour in the next morning      chapter x                 did i but purpose to embark with thee                on the smooth surface of a summer sea                and would forsake the skiff and make the shore                when the winds whistle and the tempests roar                                                   prior  while lady margaret held with the highdescended sergeant of dragoons the conference which we have detailed in the preceding pages her granddaughter partaking in a less degree her ladyships enthusiasm for all who were sprung of the bloodroyal did not honour sergeant bothwell with more attention than a single glance which showed her a tall powerful person and a set of hardy weatherbeaten features to which pride and dissipation had given an air where discontent mingled with the reckless gaiety of desperation the other soldiers offered still less to detach her consideration but from the prisoner muffled and disguised as he was she found it impossible to withdraw her eyes yet she blamed herself for indulging a curiosity which seemed obviously to give pain to him who was its object  i wish she said to jenny dennison who was the immediate attendant on her person i wish we knew who that poor fellow is  i was just thinking sae mysell miss edith said the waiting woman but it canna be cuddie headrigg because hes taller and no sae stout  yet continued miss bellenden it may be some poor neigbour for whom we might have cause to interest ourselves  i can sune learn wha he is said the enterprising jenny if the sodgers were anes settled and at leisure for i ken ane o them very weelthe bestlooking and the youngest o them  i think you know all the idle young fellows about the country answered her mistress  na miss edith i am no sae free o my acquaintance as that answered the filledechambre to be sure folk canna help kenning the folk by headmark that they see aye glowring and looking at them at kirk and market but i ken few lads to speak to unless it be them o the family and the three steinsons and tam rand and the young miller and the five howisons in nethersheils and lang tam gilry and  pray cut short a list of exceptions which threatens to be a long one and tell me how you come to know this young soldier said miss bellenden  lord miss edith its tam halliday trooper tam as they ca him that was wounded by the hillfolk at the conventicle at outerside muir and lay here while he was under cure i can ask him ony thing and tam will no refuse to answer me ill be caution for him  try then said miss edith if you can find an opportunity to ask him the name of his prisoner and come to my room and tell me what he says  jenny dennison proceeded on her errand but soon returned with such a face of surprise and dismay as evinced a deep interest in the fate of the prisoner  what is the matter said edith anxiously does it prove to be cuddie after all poor fellow  cuddie miss edith na na its nae cuddie blubbered out the faithful filledechambre sensible of the pain which her news were about to inflict on her young mistress o dear miss edith its young milnwood himsell  young milnwood exclaimed edith aghast in her turn it is impossibletotally impossiblehis uncle attends the clergyman indulged by law and has no connexion whatever with the refractory people and he himself has never interfered in this unhappy dissension he must be totally innocent unless he has been standing up for some invaded right  o my dear miss edith said her attendant these are not days to ask whats right or whats wrang if he were as innocent as the newborn infant they would find some way of making him guilty if they liked but tam halliday says it will touch his life for he has been resetting ane o the fife gentlemen that killed that auld carle of an archbishop  his life exclaimed edith starting hastily up and speaking with a hurried and tremulous accentthey cannotthey shall noti will speak for himthey shall not hurt him  o my dear young leddy think on your grandmother think on the danger and the difficulty added jenny for hes kept under close confinement till claverhouse comes up in the morning and if he doesna gie him full satisfaction tam halliday says there will be brief wark wi himkneel downmak readypresentfirejust as they did wi auld deaf john macbriar that never understood a single question they pat till him and sae lost his life for lack o hearing  jenny said the young lady if he should die i will die with him there is no time to talk of danger or difficultyi will put on a plaid and slip down with you to the place where they have kept himi will throw myself at the feet of the sentinel and entreat him as he has a soul to be saved  eh guide us interrupted the maid our young leddy at the feet o trooper tam and speaking to him about his soul when the puir chield hardly kens whether he has ane or no unless that he whiles swears by itthat will never do but what maun be maun be and ill never desert a truelove causeand sae if ye maun see young milnwood though i ken nae gude it will do but to make baith your hearts the sairer ill een tak the risk ot and try to manage tam halliday but ye maun let me hae my ain gate and no speak ae wordhes keeping guard oer milnwood in the easter round of the tower  go go fetch me a plaid said edith let me but see him and i will find some remedy for his dangerhaste ye jenny as ever ye hope to have good at my hands  jenny hastened and soon returned with a plaid in which edith muffled herself so as completely to screen her face and in part to disguise her person this was a mode of arranging the plaid very common among the ladies of that century and the earlier part of the succeeding one so much so indeed that the venerable sages of the kirk conceiving that the mode gave tempting facilities for intrigue directed more than one act of assembly against this use of the mantle but fashion as usual proved too strong for authority and while plaids continued to be worn women of all ranks occasionally employed them as a sort of muffler or veil note concealment of an individual while in public or promiscuous society was then very common in england where no plaids were worn the ladies used vizard masks for the same purpose and the gallants drew the skirts of their cloaks over the right shoulder so as to cover part of the face this is repeatedly alluded to in pepyss diary her face and figure thus concealed edith holding by her attendants arm hastened with trembling steps to the place of mortons confinement  this was a small study or closet in one of the turrets opening upon a gallery in which the sentinel was pacing to and fro for sergeant bothwell scrupulous in observing his word and perhaps touched with some compassion for the prisoners youth and genteel demeanour had waved the indignity of putting his guard into the same apartment with him halliday therefore with his carabine on his arm walked up and down the gallery occasionally solacing himself with a draught of ale a huge flagon of which stood upoon the table at one end of the apartment and at other times humming the lively scottish air  between saint johnstone and bonny dundee ill gar ye be fain to follow me  jenny dennison cautioned her mistress once more to let her take her own way  i can manage the trooper weel eneugh she said for as rough as he isi ken their nature weel but ye maunna say a single word  she accordingly opened the door of the gallery just as the sentinel had turned his back from it and taking up the tune which he hummed she sung in a coquettish tone of rustic raillery  if i were to follow a poor sodger lad my friends wad be angry my minnie be mad a laird or a lord they were fitter for me sae ill never be fain to follow thee  a fair challenge by jove cried the sentinel turning round and from two at once but its not easy to bang the soldier with his bandoleers then taking up the song where the damsel had stopt  to follow me ye weel may be glad a share of my supper a share of my bed to the sound of the drum to range fearless and free ill gar ye be fain to follow me  come my pretty lass and kiss me for my song  i should not have thought of that mr halliday answered jenny with a look and tone expressing just the necessary degree of contempt at the proposal and ise assure ye yell hae but little o my company unless ye show gentler havingsit wasna to hear that sort ononsense that brought me here wi my friend and ye should think shame o yoursell at should ye  umph and what sort of nonsense did bring you here then mrs dennison  my kinswoman has some particular business with your prisoner young mr harry morton and i am come wi her to speak till him  the devil you are answered the sentinel and pray mrs dennison how do your kinswoman and you propose to get in you are rather too plump to whisk through a keyhole and opening the door is a thing not to be spoke of  its no a thing to be spoken o but a thing to be dune replied the persevering damsel  well see about that my bonny jenny and the soldier resumed his march humming as he walked to and fro along the gallery  keek into the drawwell janet janet then yell see your bonny sell my joe janet  so yere no thinking to let us in mr halliday weel weel gude een to youye hae seen the last o me and o this bonny die too said jenny holding between her finger and thumb a splendid silver dollar  give him gold give him gold whispered the agitated young lady  silvers een ower gude for the like o him replied jenny that disna care for the blink o a bonny lassies eeand whats waur he wad think there was something mair int than a kinswoman o mine my certy sillers no sae plenty wi us let alane gowd having addressed this advice aside to her mistress she raised her voice and said my cousin winna stay ony langer mr halliday sae if ye please gude een tye  halt a bit halt a bit said the trooper rein up and parley jenny if i let your kinswoman in to speak to my prisoner you must stay here and keep me company till she come out again and then well all be well pleased you know  the fiend be in my feet then said jenny dye think my kinswoman and me are gaun to lose our gude name wi cracking clavers wi the like o you or your prisoner either without somebody by to see fair play hegh hegh sirs to see sic a difference between folks promises and performance ye were aye willing to slight puir cuddie but an i had asked him to oblige me in a thing though it had been to cost his hanging he wadna hae stude twice about it  dn cuddie retorted the dragoon hell be hanged in good earnest i hope i saw him today at milnwood with his old puritanical bof a mother and if i had thought i was to have had him cast in my dish i would have brought him up at my horses tailwe had law enough to bear us out  very weel very weelsee if cuddie winna hae a lang shot at you ane o thae days if ye gar him tak the muir wi sae mony honest folk he can hit a mark brawly he was third at the popinjay and hes as true of his promise as of ee and hand though he disna mak sic a phrase about it as some acquaintance o yoursbut its a ane to mecome cousin well awa  stay jenny dn me if i hang fire more than another when i have said a thing said the soldier in a hesitating tone where is the sergeant  drinking and driving ower quoth jenny wi the steward and john gudyill  so sohes safe enoughand where are my comrades asked halliday  birling the brown bowl wi the fowler and the falconer and some o the serving folk  have they plenty of ale  sax gallons as gude as eer was masked said the maid  well then my pretty jenny said the relenting sentinel they are fast till the hour of relieving guard and perhaps something later and so if you will promise to come alone the next timemaybe i will and maybe i winna said jenny but if ye get the dollar yell like that just as weel  ill be dnd if i do said halliday taking the money howeve but its always something for my risk for if claverhouse hears what i have done he will build me a horse as high as the tower of tillietudlem but every one in the regiment takes what they can come by i am sure bothwell and his bloodroyal shows us a good example and if i were trusting to you you little jilting devil i should lose both pains and powder whereas this fellow looking at the piece will be good as far as he goes so come there is the door open for you do not stay groaning and praying with the young whig now but be ready when i call at the door to start as if they were sounding horse and away  so speaking halliday unlocked the door of the closet admitted jenny and her pretended kinswoman locked it behind them and hastily reassumed the indifferent measured step and timekilling whistle of a sentinel upon his regular duty  the door which slowly opened discovered morton with both arms reclined upon a table and his head resting upon them in a posture of deep dejection he raised his face as the door opened and perceiving the female figures which it admitted started up in great surprise edith as if modesty had quelled the courage which despair had bestowed stood about a yard from the door without having either the power to speak or to advance all the plans of aid relief or comfort which she had proposed to lay before her lover seemed at once to have vanished from her recollection and left only a painful chaos of ideas with which was mingled a fear that she had degraded herself in the eyes of morton by a step which might appear precipitate and unfeminine she hung motionless and almost powerless upon the arm of her attendant who in vain endeavoured to reassure and inspire her with courage by whispering we are in now madam and we maun mak the best o our time for doubtless the corporal or the sergeant will gang the rounds and it wad be a pity to hae the poor lad halliday punished for his civility  morton in the meantime was timidly advancing suspecting the truth for what other female in the house excepting edith herself was likely to take an interest in his misfortunes and yet afraid owing to the doubtful twilight and the muffled dress of making some mistake which might be prejudicial to the object of his affections jenny whose ready wit and forward manners well qualified her for such an office hastened to break the ice  mr morton miss ediths very sorry for your present situation and  it was needless to say more he was at her side almost at her feet pressing her unresisting hands and loading her with a profusion of thanks and gratitude which would be hardly intelligible from the mere broken words unless we could describe the tone the gesture the impassioned and hurried indications of deep and tumultuous feeling with which they were accompanied  for two or three minutes edith stood as motionless as the statue of a saint which receives the adoration of a worshipper and when she recovered herself sufficiently to withdraw her hands from henrys grasp she could at first only faintly articulate i have taken a strange step mr mortona step she continued with more coherence as her ideas arranged themselves in consequence of a strong effort that perhaps may expose me to censure in your eyesbut i have long permitted you to use the language of friendshipperhaps i might say moretoo long to leave you when the world seems to have left you how or why is this imprisonment what can be done can my uncle who thinks so highly of youcan your own kinsman milnwood be of no use are there no means and what is likely to be the event  be what it will answered henry contriving to make himself master of the hand that had escaped from him but which was now again abandoned to his clasp be what it will it is to me from this moment the most welcome incident of a weary life to you dearest edithforgive me i should have said miss bellenden but misfortune claims strange privilegesto you i have owed the few happy moments which have gilded a gloomy existence and if i am now to lay it down the recollection of this honour will be my happiness in the last hour of suffering  but is it even thus mr morton said miss bellenden have you who used to mix so little in these unhappy feuds become so suddenly and deeply implicated that nothing short of  she paused unable to bring out the word which should have come next  nothing short of my life you would say replied morton in a calm but melancholy tone i believe that will be entirely in the bosoms of my judges my guards spoke of a possibility of exchanging the penalty for entry into foreign service i thought i could have embraced the alternative and yet miss bellenden since i have seen you once more i feel that exile would be more galling than death  and is it then true said edith that you have been so desperately rash as to entertain communication with any of those cruel wretches who assassinated the primate  i knew not even that such a crime had been committed replied morton when i gave unhappily a nights lodging and concealment to one of those rash and cruel men the ancient friend and comrade of my father but my ignorance will avail me little for who miss bellenden save you will believe it and what is worse i am at least uncertain whether even if i had known the crime i could have brought my mind under all the circumstances to refuse a temporary refuge to the fugitive  and by whom said edith anxiously or under what authority will the investigation of your conduct take place  under that of colonel grahame of claverhouse i am given to understand said morton one of the military commission to whom it has pleased our king our privy council and our parliament that used to be more tenacious of our liberties to commit the sole charge of our goods and of our lives  to claverhouse said edith faintly merciful heaven you are lost ere you are tried he wrote to my grandmother that he was to be here tomorrow morning on his road to the head of the county where some desperate men animated by the presence of two or three of the actors in the primates murder are said to have assembled for the purpose of making a stand against the government his expressions made me shudder even when i could not guess thatthata friend  do not be too much alarmed on my account my dearest edith said henry as he supported her in his arms claverhouse though stern and relentless is by all accounts brave fair and honourable i am a soldiers son and will plead my cause like a soldier he will perhaps listen more favourably to a blunt and unvarnished defence than a truckling and timeserving judge might do and indeed in a time when justice is in all its branches so completely corrupted i would rather lose my life by open military violence than be conjured out of it by the hocuspocus of some arbitrary lawyer who lends the knowledge he has of the statutes made for our protection to wrest them to our destruction  you are lostyou are lost if you are to plead your cause with claverhouse sighed edith root and branchwork is the mildest of his expressions the unhappy primate was his intimate friend and early patron no excuse no subterfuge said his letter shall save either those connected with the deed or such as have given them countenance and shelter from the ample and bitter penalty of the law until i shall have taken as many lives in vengeance of this atrocious murder as the old man had grey hairs upon his venerable head there is neither ruth nor favour to be found with him  jenny dennison who had hitherto remained silent now ventured in the extremity of distress which the lovers felt but for which they were unable to devise a remedy to offer her own advice  wi your leddyships pardon miss edith and young mr mortons we maunna waste time let milnwood take my plaid and gown ill slip them aff in the dark corner if hell promise no to look about and he may walk past tam halliday who is half blind with his ale and i can tell him a canny way to get out o the tower and your leddyship will gang quietly to your ain room and ill row mysell in his grey cloak and pit on his hat and play the prisoner till the coasts clear and then ill cry in tam halliday and gar him let me out  let you out said morton theyll make your life answer it  neer a bit replied jenny tam daurna tell he let ony body in for his ain sake and ill gar him find some other gate to account for the escape  will you by g said the sentinel suddenly opening the door of the apartment if i am half blind i am not deaf and you should not plan an escape quite so loud if you expect to go through with it come come mrs janetmarch troopquick timetrot dn meand you madam kinswomani wont ask your real name though you were going to play me so rascally a trickbut i must make a clear garrison so beat a retreat unless you would have me turn out the guard  i hope said morton very anxiously you will not mention this circumstance my good friend and trust to my honour to acknowledge your civility in keeping the secret if you overheard our conversation you must have observed that we did not accept of or enter into the hasty proposal made by this goodnatured girl  oh devilish goodnatured to be sure said halliday as for the rest i guess how it is and i scorn to bear malice or tell tales as much as another but no thanks to that little jilting devil jenny dennison who deserves a tight skelping for trying to lead an honest lad into a scrape just because he was so silly as to like her goodforlittle chit face  jenny had no better means of justification than the last apology to which her sex trust and usually not in vain she pressed her handkerchief to her face sobbed with great vehemence and either wept or managed as halliday might have said to go through the motions wonderfully well  and now continued the soldier somewhat mollified if you have any thing to say say it in two minutes and let me see your backs turned for if bothwell take it into his drunken head to make the rounds half an hour too soon it will be a black business to us all  farewell edith whispered morton assuming a firmness he was far from possessing do not remain hereleave me to my fateit cannot be beyond endurance since you are interested in itgood night good nightdo not remain here till you are discovered  thus saying he resigned her to her attendant by whom she was quietly led and partly supported out of the apartment  every one has his taste to be sure said halliday but dn me if i would have vexed so sweet a girl as that is for all the whigs that ever swore the covenant  when edith had regained her apartment she gave way to a burst of grief which alarmed jenny dennison who hastened to administer such scraps of consolation as occurred to her  dinna vex yoursell sae muckle miss edith said that faithful attendant wha kens what may happen to help young milnwood hes a brave lad and a bonny and a gentleman of a good fortune and

against goose gibbies safe arrival at the end of his pilgrimage all risks must be run unless you can find a better messengergo bid the boy get ready and get him out of the tower as secretly as you can if he meets any one let him say he is carrying a letter to major bellenden of charnwood but without mentioning any names  i understand madam said jenny dennison i warrant the callant will do weel eneugh and tib the henwife will tak care o the geese for a word o my mouth and ill tell gibbie your leddyship will mak his peace wi lady margaret and well gie him a dollar  two if he does his errand well said edith  jenny departed to rouse goose gibbie out of his slumbers to which he was usually consigned at sundown or shortly after he keeping the hours of the birds under his charge during her absence edith took her writing materials and prepared against her return the following letter superscribed for the hands of major bellenden of charnwood my much honoured uncle these my dear unclethis will serve to inform you i am desirous to know how your gout is as we did not see you at the wappenschaw which made both my grandmother and myself very uneasy and if it will permit you to travel we shall be happy to see you at our poor house tomorrow at the hour of breakfast as colonel grahame of claverhouse is to pass this way on his march and we would willingly have your assistance to receive and entertain a military man of such distinction who probably will not be much delighted with the company of women also my dear uncle i pray you to let mrs carefort your housekeeper send me my doubletrimmed paduasoy with the hanging sleeves which she will find in the third drawer of the walnut press in the green room which you are so kind as to call mine also my dear uncle i pray you to send me the second volume of the grand cyrus as i have only read as far as the imprisonment of philidaspes upon the seven hundredth and thirtythird page but above all i entreat you to come to us tomorrow before eight of the clock which as your pacing nag is so good you may well do without rising before your usual hour so praying to god to preserve your health i rest your dutiful and loving niece  edith bellenden  postscriptum a party of soldiers have last night brought your friend young mr henry morton of milnwood hither as a prisoner i conclude you will be sorry for the young gentleman and therefore let you know this in case you may think of speaking to colonel grahame in his behalf i have not mentioned his name to my grandmother knowing her prejudice against the family  this epistle being duly sealed and delivered to jenny that faithful confidant hastened to put the same in the charge of goose gibbie whom she found in readiness to start from the castle she then gave him various instructions touching the road which she apprehended he was likely to mistake not having travelled it above five or six times and possessing only the same slender proportion of memory as of judgment lastly she smuggled him out of the garrison through the pantry window into the branchy yewtree which grew close beside it and had the satisfaction to see him reach the bottom in safety and take the right turn at the commencement of his journey she then returned to persuade her young mistress to go to bed and to lull her to rest if possible with assurances of gibbies success in his embassy only qualified by a passing regret that the trusty cuddie with whom the commission might have been more safely reposed was no longer within reach of serving her  more fortunate as a messenger than as a cavalier it was gibbies good hap rather than his good management which after he had gone astray not oftener than nine times and given his garments a taste of the variation of each bog brook and slough between tillietudlem and charnwood placed him about daybreak before the gate of major bellendens mansion having completed a walk of ten miles for the bittock as usual amounted to four in little more than the same number of hours      chapter xi                 at last comes the troop by the word of command                drawn up in our court where the captain cries                stand                                              swift  major bellendens ancient valet gideon pike as he adjusted his masters clothes by his bedside preparatory to the worthy veterans toilet acquainted him as an apology for disturbing him an hour earlier than his usual time of rising that there was an express from tillietudlem  from tillietudlem said the old gentleman rising hastily in his bed and sitting bolt uprightopen the shutters pikei hope my sisterinlaw is wellfurl up the bedcurtainwhat have we all here glancing at ediths note the gout why she knows i have not had a fit since candlemasthe wappenschaw i told her a month since i was not to be therepaduasoy and hanging sleeves why hang the gipsy herselfgrand cyrus and philipdastusphilip devilis the wench gone crazy all at once was it worth while to send an express and wake me at five in the morning for all this trashbut what says her postscriptummercy on us he exclaimed on perusing itpike saddle old kilsythe instantly and another horse for yourself  i hope nae ill news frae the tower sir said pike astonished at his masters sudden emotion  yesnoyesthat is i must meet claverhouse there on some express business so boot and saddle pike as fast as you cano lord what times are thesethe poor ladmy old cronies sonand the silly wench sticks it into her postscriptum as she calls it at the tail of all this trumpery about old gowns and new romances  in a few minutes the good old officer was fully equipped and having mounted upon his armgaunt charger as soberly as mark antony himself could have done he paced forth his way to the tower of tillietudlem  on the road he formed the prudent resolution to say nothing to the old lady whose dislike to presbyterians of all kinds he knew to be inveterate of the quality and rank of the prisoner detained within her walls but to try his own influence with claverhouse to obtain mortons liberation  being so loyal as he is he must do something for so old a cavalier as i am said the veteran to himself and if he is so good a soldier as the world speaks of why he will be glad to serve an old soldiers son i never knew a real soldier that was not a frankhearted honest fellow and i think the execution of the laws though its a pity they find it necessary to make them so severe may be a thousand times better intrusted with them than with peddling lawyers and thickskulled country gentlemen  such were the ruminations of major miles bellenden which were terminated by john gudyill not more than halfdrunk taking hold of his bridle and assisting him to dismount in the roughpaved court of tillietudlem  why john said the veteran what devil of a discipline is this you have been keeping you have been reading geneva print this morning already  i have been reading the litany said john shaking his head with a look of drunken gravity and having only caught one word of the majors address to him life is short sir we are flowers of the field sirhiccupand lilies of the valley  flowers and lilies why man such carles as thou and i can hardly be called better than old hemlocks decayed nettles or withered ragweed but i suppose you think that we are still worth watering  i am an old soldier sir i thank heavenhiccup  an old skinker you mean john but come never mind show me the way to your mistress old lad  john gudyill led the way to the stone hall where lady margaret was fidgeting about superintending arranging and reforming the preparations made for the reception of the celebrated claverhouse whom one party honoured and extolled as a hero and another execrated as a bloodthirsty oppressor  did i not tell you said lady margaret to her principal female attendantdid i not tell you mysie that it was my especial pleasure on this occasion to have every thing in the precise order wherein it was upon that famous morning when his most sacred majesty partook of his disjune at tillietudlem  doubtless such were your leddyships commands and to the best of my remembrancewas mysie answering when her ladyship broke in with then wherefore is the venison pasty placed on the left side of the throne and the stoup of claret upon the right when ye may right weel remember mysie that his most sacred majesty with his ain hand shifted the pasty to the same side with the flagon and said they were too good friends to be parted  i mind that weel madam said mysie and if i had forgot i have heard your leddyship often speak about that grand morning sin syne but i thought every thing was to be placed just as it was when his majesty god bless him came into this room looking mair like an angel than a man if he hadna been sae blackavised  then ye thought nonsense mysie for in whatever way his most sacred majesty ordered the position of the trenchers and flagons that as weel as his royal pleasure in greater matters should be a law to his subjects and shall ever be to those of the house of tillietudlem  weel madam said mysie making the alterations required its easy mending the error but if every thing is just to be as his majesty left it there should be an unco hole in the venison pasty  at this moment the door opened  who is that john gudyill exclaimed the old lady i can speak to no one just nowis it you my dear brother she continued in some surprise as the major entered this is a right early visit  not more early than welcome i hope replied major bellenden as he saluted the widow of his deceased brother but i heard by a note which edith sent to charnwood about some of her equipage and books that you were to have claverse here this morning so i thought like an old firelock as i am that i should like to have a chat with this rising soldier i caused pike saddle kilsythe and here we both are  and most kindly welcome you are said the old lady it is just what i should have prayed you to do if i had thought there was time you see i am busy in preparation all is to be in the same order as whenthe king breakfasted at tillietudlem said the major who like all lady margarets friends dreaded the commencement of that narrative and was desirous to cut it shorti remember it well you know i was waiting on his majesty  you were brother said lady margaret and perhaps you can help me to remember the order of the entertainment  nay good sooth said the major the damnable dinner that noll gave us at worcester a few days afterwards drove all your good cheer out of my memorybut hows thisyou have even the great turkeyleather elbowchair with the tapestry cushions placed in state  the throne brother if you please said lady margaret gravely  well the throne be it then continued the major is that to be claverses post in the attack upon the pasty  no brother said the lady as these cushions have been once honoured by accommodating the person of our most sacred monarch they shall never please heaven during my lifetime be pressed by any less dignified weight  you should not then said the old soldier put them in the way of an honest old cavalier who has ridden ten miles before breakfast for to confess the truth they look very inviting but where is edith  on the battlements of the warders turret answered the old lady looking out for the approach of our guests  why ill go there too and so should you lady margaret as soon as you have your line of battle properly formed in the hall here its a pretty thing i can tell you to see a regiment of horse upon the march  thus speaking he offered his arm with an air of oldfashioned gallantry which lady margaret accepted with such a courtesy of acknowledgment as ladies were wont to make in holyroodhouse before the year 1642 which for one while drove both courtesies and courts out of fashion  upon the bartizan of the turret to which they ascended by many a winding passage and uncouth staircase they found edith not in the attitude of a young lady who watches with fluttering curiosity the approach of a smart regiment of dragoons but pale downcast and evincing by her countenance that sleep had not during the preceding night been the companion of her pillow the good old veteran was hurt at her appearance which in the hurry of preparation her grandmother had omitted to notice  what is come over you you silly girl he said why you look like an officers wife when she opens the newsletter after an action and expects to find her husband among the killed and wounded but i know the reasonyou will persist in reading these nonsensical romances day and night and whimpering for distresses that never existed why how the devil can you believe that artamines or what dye call him fought singlehanded with a whole battalion one to three is as great odds as ever fought and won and i never knew any body that cared to take that except old corporal raddlebanes but these dd books put all pretty mens actions out of countenance i daresay you would think very little of raddlebanes if he were alongside of artaminesi would have the fellows that write such nonsense brought to the picquet for leasingmaking       note  romances of the seventeenth century as few in the present      age are acquainted with the ponderous folios to which the age of      louis xiv gave rise we need only say that they combine the      dulness of the metaphysical courtship with all the improbabilities      of the ancient romance of chivalry their character will be most      easily learned from boileaus dramatic satire or mrs lennoxs      female quixote  lady margaret herself somewhat attached to the perusal of romances took up the cudgels monsieur scuderi she said is a soldier brother and as i have heard a complete one and so is the sieur durfe  more shame for them they should have known better what they were writing about for my part i have not read a book these twenty years except my bible the whole duty of man and of late days turners pallas armata or treatise on the ordering of the pike exercise and i dont like his discipline much neither       note  sir james turner sir james turner was a soldier of fortune      bred in the civil wars he was intrusted with a commission to levy      the fines imposed by the privy council for nonconformity in the      district of dumfries and galloway in this capacity he vexed the      country so much by his exactions that the people rose and made him      prisoner and then proceeded in arms towards midlothian where they      were defeated at pentland hills in 1666 besides his treatise on      the military art sir james turner wrote several other works the      most curious of which is his memoirs of his own life and times      which has just been printed under the charge of the bannatyne      club  he wants to draw up the cavalry in front of a stand of pikes instead of being upon the wings sure am i if we had done so at kilsythe instead of having our handful of horse on the flanks the first discharge would have sent them back among our highlandersbut i hear the kettledrums  all heads were now bent from the battlements of the turret which commanded a distant prospect down the vale of the river the tower of tillietudlem stood or perhaps yet stands upon the angle of a very precipitous bank formed by the junction of a considerable brook with the clyde       note the castle of tillietudlem is imaginary but the ruins of      craignethan castle situated on the nethan about three miles from      its junction with the clyde have something of the character of the      description in the text  there was a narrow bridge of one steep arch across the brook near its mouth over which and along the foot of the high and broken bank winded the public road and the fortalice thus commanding both bridge and pass had been in times of war a post of considerable importance the possession of which was necessary to secure the communication of the upper and wilder districts of the country with those beneath where the valley expands and is more capable of cultivation the view downwards is of a grand woodland character but the level ground and gentle slopes near the river form cultivated fields of an irregular shape interspersed with hedgerowtrees and copses the enclosures seeming to have been individually cleared out of the forest which surrounds them and which occupies in unbroken masses the steeper declivities and more distant banks the stream in colour a clear and sparkling brown like the hue of the cairngorm pebbles rushes through this romantic region in bold sweeps and curves partly visible and partly concealed by the trees which clothe its banks with a providence unknown in other parts of scotland the peasants have in most places planted orchards around their cottages and the general blossom of the appletrees at this season of the year gave all the lower part of the view the appearance of a flowergarden  looking up the river the character of the scene was varied considerably for the worse a hilly waste and uncultivated country approached close to the banks the trees were few and limited to the neighbourhood of the stream and the rude moors swelled at a little distance into shapeless and heavy hills which were again surmounted in their turn by a range of lofty mountains dimly seen on the horizon thus the tower commanded two prospects the one richly cultivated and highly adorned the other exhibiting the monotonous and dreary character of a wild and inhospitable moorland  the eyes of the spectators on the present occasion were attracted to the downward view not alone by its superior beauty but because the distant sounds of military music began to be heard from the public highroad which winded up the vale and announced the approach of the expected body of cavalry their glimmering ranks were shortly afterwards seen in the distance appearing and disappearing as the trees and the windings of the road permitted them to be visible and distinguished chiefly by the flashes of light which their arms occasionally reflected against the sun the train was long and imposing for there were about two hundred and fifty horse upon the march and the glancing of the swords and waving of their banners joined to the clang of their trumpets and kettledrums had at once a lively and awful effect upon the imagination as they advanced still nearer and nearer they could distinctly see the files of those chosen troops following each other in long succession completely equipped and superbly mounted  its a sight that makes me thirty years younger said the old cavalier and yet i do not much like the service that these poor fellows are to be engaged in although i had my share of the civil war i cannot say i had ever so much real pleasure in that sort of service as when i was employed on the continent and we were hacking at fellows with foreign faces and outlandish dialect its a hard thing to hear a hamely scotch tongue cry quarter and be obliged to cut him down just the same as if he called out misricordeso there they come through the netherwood haugh upon my word finelooking fellows and capitally mountedhe that is gallopping from the rear of the column must be claverse himselfay he gets into the front as they cross the bridge and now they will be with us in less than five minutes   illustration edith on the battlementsfrontispiece   at the bridge beneath the tower the cavalry divided and the greater part moving up the left bank of the brook and crossing at a ford a little above took the road of the grange as it was called a large set of farmoffices belonging to the tower where lady margaret had ordered preparation to be made for their reception and suitable entertainment the officers alone with their colours and an escort to guard them were seen to take the steep road up to the gate of the tower appearing by intervals as they gained the ascent and again hidden by projections of the bank and of the huge old trees with which it is covered when they emerged from this narrow path they found themselves in front of the old tower the gates of which were hospitably open for their reception lady margaret with edith and her brotherinlaw having hastily descended from their post of observation appeared to meet and to welcome their guests with a retinue of domestics in as good order as the orgies of the preceding evening permitted the gallant young cornet a relation as well as namesake of claverhouse with whom the reader has been already made acquainted lowered the standard amid the fanfare of the trumpets in homage to the rank of lady margaret and the charms of her granddaughter and the old walls echoed to the flourish of the instruments and the stamp and neigh of the chargers       note  john grahame of claverhouse this remarkable person united      the seemingly inconsistent qualities of courage and cruelty a      disinterested and devoted loyalty to his prince with a disregard of      the rights of his fellowsubjects he was the unscrupulous agent of      the scottish privy council in executing the merciless severities of      the government in scotland during the reigns of charles ii and      james ii but he redeemed his character by the zeal with which he      asserted the cause of the latter monarch after the revolution the      military skill with which he supported it at the battle of      killiecrankie and by his own death in the arms of victory       it is said by tradition that he was very desirous to see and be      introduced to a certain lady elphinstoun who had reached the      advanced age of one hundred years and upwards the noble matron      being a stanch whig was rather unwilling to receive claverse as      he was called from his title but at length consented after the      usual compliments the officer observed to the lady that having      lived so much beyond the usual term of humanity she must in her      time have seen many strange changes hout na sir said lady      elphinstoun the world is just to end with me as it began when i      was entering life there was ane knox deaving us a wi his clavers      and now i am ganging out there is ane claverse deaving us a wi      his knocks       clavers signifying in common parlance idle chat the double pun      does credit to the ingenuity of a lady of a hundred years old  claverhouse himself alighted from a black horse the most beautiful perhaps in scotland he had not a single white hair upon his whole body a circumstance which joined to his spirit and fleetness and to his being so frequently employed in pursuit of the presbyterian recusants caused an opinion to prevail among them that the steed had been presented to his rider by the great enemy of mankind in order to assist him in persecuting the fugitive wanderers when claverhouse had paid his respects to the ladies with military politeness had apologized for the trouble to which he was putting lady margarets family and had received the corresponding assurances that she could not think any thing an inconvenience which brought within the walls of tillietudlem so distinguished a soldier and so loyal a servant of his sacred majesty when in short all forms of hospitable and polite ritual had been duly complied with the colonel requested permission to receive the report of bothwell who was now in attendance and with whom he spoke apart for a few minutes major bellenden took that opportunity to say to his niece without the hearing of her grandmother what a trifling foolish girl you are edith to send me by express a letter crammed with nonsense about books and gowns and to slide the only thing i cared a marvedie about into the postscript  i did not know said edith hesitating very much whether it would be quitequite proper for me toi know what you would saywhether it would be right to take any interest in a presbyterian but i knew this lads father well he was a brave soldier and if he was once wrong he was once right too i must commend your caution edith for having said nothing of this young gentlemans affair to your grandmotheryou may rely on it i shall noti will take an opportunity to speak to claverse come my love they are going to breakfast let us follow them      chapter xii                 their breakfast so warm to be sure they did eat                a custom in travellers mighty discreet                                                   prior  the breakfast of lady margaret bellenden no more resembled a modern dejune than the great stonehall at tillietudlem could brook comparison with a modern drawingroom no tea no coffee no variety of rolls but solid and substantial viandsthe priestly ham the knightly sirloin the noble baron of beef the princely venison pasty while silver flagons saved with difficulty from the claws of the covenanters now mantled some with ale some with mead and some with generous wine of various qualities and descriptions the appetites of the guests were in correspondence to the magnificence and solidity of the preparationno piddlingno boysplay but that steady and persevering exercise of the jaws which is best learned by early morning hours and by occasional hard commons  lady margaret beheld with delight the cates which she had provided descending with such alacrity into the persons of her honoured guests and had little occasion to exercise with respect to any of the company saving claverhouse himself the compulsory urgency of pressing to eat to which as to the peine forte et dure the ladies of that period were in the custom of subjecting their guests  but the leader himself more anxious to pay courtesy to miss bellenden next whom he was placed than to gratify his appetite appeared somewhat negligent of the good cheer set before him edith heard without reply many courtly speeches addressed to her in a tone of voice of that happy modulation which could alike melt in the low tones of interesting conversation and rise amid the din of battle loud as a trumpet with a silver sound the sense that she was in the presence of the dreadful chief upon whose fiat the fate of henry morton must dependthe recollection of the terror and awe which were attached to the very name of the commander deprived her for some time not only of the courage to answer but even of the power of looking upon him but when emboldened by the soothing tones of his voice she lifted her eyes to frame some reply the person on whom she looked bore in his appearance at least none of the terrible attributes in which her apprehensions had arrayed him  grahame of claverhouse was in the prime of life rather low of stature and slightly though elegantly formed his gesture language and manners were those of one whose life had been spent among the noble and the gay his features exhibited even feminine regularity an oval face a straight and wellformed nose dark hazel eyes a complexion just sufficiently tinged with brown to save it from the charge of effeminacy a short upper lip curved upward like that of a grecian statue and slightly shaded by small mustachios of light brown joined to a profusion of long curled locks of the same colour which fell down on each side of his face contributed to form such a countenance as limners love to paint and ladies to look upon  the severity of his character as well as the higher attributes of undaunted and enterprising valour which even his enemies were compelled to admit lay concealed under an exterior which seemed adapted to the court or the saloon rather than to the field the same gentleness and gaiety of expression which reigned in his features seemed to inspire his actions and gestures and on the whole he was generally esteemed at first sight rather qualified to be the votary of pleasure than of ambition but under this soft exterior was hidden a spirit unbounded in daring and in aspiring yet cautious and prudent as that of machiavel himself profound in politics and embued of course with that disregard for individual rights which its intrigues usually generate this leader was cool and collected in danger fierce and ardent in pursuing success careless of facing death himself and ruthless in inflicting it upon others such are the characters formed in times of civil discord when the highest qualities perverted by party spirit and inflamed by habitual opposition are too often combined with vices and excesses which deprive them at once of their merit and of their lustre  in endeavouring to reply to the polite trifles with which claverhouse accosted her edith showed so much confusion that her grandmother thought it necessary to come to her relief  edith bellenden said the old lady has from my retired mode of living seen so little of those of her own sphere that truly she can hardly frame her speech to suitable answers a soldier is so rare a sight with us colonel grahame that unless it be my young lord evandale we have hardly had an opportunity of receiving a gentleman in uniform and now i talk of that excellent young nobleman may i enquire if i was not to have had the honour of seeing him this morning with the regiment  lord evandale madam was on his march with us answered the leader but i was obliged to detach him with a small party to disperse a conventicle of those troublesome scoundrels who have had the impudence to assemble within five miles of my headquarters  indeed said the old lady that is a height of presumption to which i would have thought no rebellious fanatics would have ventured to aspire but these are strange times there is an evil spirit in the land colonel grahame that excites the vassals of persons of rank to rebel against the very house that holds and feeds them there was one of my ablebodied men the other day who plainly refused to attend the wappenschaw at my bidding is there no law for such recusancy colonel grahame  i think i could find one said claverhouse with great composure if your ladyship will inform me of the name and residence of the culprit  his name said lady margaret is cuthbert headrigg i can say nothing of his domicile for ye may weel believe colonel grahame he did not dwell long in tillietudlem but was speedily expelled for his contumacy i wish the lad no severe bodily injury but incarceration or even a few stripes would be a good example in this neighbourhood his mother under whose influence i doubt he acted is an ancient domestic of this family which makes me incline to mercy although continued the old lady looking towards the pictures of her husband and her sons with which the wall was hung and heaving at the same time a deep sigh i colonel grahame have in my ain person but little right to compassionate that stubborn and rebellious generation they have made me a childless widow and but for the protection of our sacred sovereign and his gallant soldiers they would soon deprive me of lands and goods of hearth and altar seven of my tenants whose joint rentmail may mount to wellnigh a hundred merks have already refused to pay either cess or rent and had the assurance to tell my steward that they would acknowledge neither king nor landlord but who should have taken the covenant  i will take a course with themthat is with your ladyships permission answered claverhouse it would ill become me to neglect the support of lawful authority when it is lodged in such worthy hands as those of lady margaret bellenden but i must needs say this country grows worse and worse daily and reduces me to the necessity of taking measures with the recusants that are much more consonant with my duty than with my inclinations and speaking of this i must not forget that i have to thank your ladyship for the hospitality you have been pleased to extend to a party of mine who have brought in a prisoner charged with having resetted note resetted ie received or harboured the murdering villain balfour of burley  the house of tillietudlem answered the lady hath ever been open to the servants of his majesty and i hope that the stones of it will no longer rest on each other when it surceases to be as much at their command as at ours and this reminds me colonel grahame that the gentleman who commands the party can hardly be said to be in his proper place in the army considering whose blood flows in his veins and if i might flatter myself that any thing would be granted to my request i would presume to entreat that he might be promoted on some favourable opportunity  your ladyship means sergeant francis stewart whom we call bothwell said claverhouse smiling the truth is he is a little too rough in the country and has not been uniformly so amenable to discipline as the rules of the service require but to instruct me how to oblige lady margaret bellenden is to lay down the law to mebothwell he continued addressing the sergeant who just then appeared at the door go kiss lady margaret bellendens hand who interests herself in your promotion and you shall have a commission the first vacancy  bothwell went through the salutation in the manner prescribed but not without evident marks of haughty reluctance and when he had done so said aloud to kiss a ladys hand can never disgrace a gentleman but i would not kiss a mans save the kings to be made a general  you hear him said claverhouse smiling theres the rock he splits upon he cannot forget his pedigree  i know my noble colonel said bothwell in the same tone that you will not forget your promise and then perhaps you may permit cornet stewart to have some recollection of his grandfather though the sergeant must forget him  enough of this sir said claverhouse in the tone of command which was familiar to him and let me know what you came to report to me just now  my lord evandale and his party have halted on the highroad with some prisoners said bothwell  my lord evandale said lady margaret surely colonel grahame you will permit him to honour me with his society and to take his poor disjune here especially considering that even his most sacred majesty did not pass the tower of tillietudlem without halting to partake of some refreshment  as this was the third time in the course of the conversation that lady margaret had adverted to this distinguished event colonel grahame as speedily as politeness would permit took advantage of the first pause to interrupt the farther progress of the narrative by saying we are already too numerous a party of guests but as i know what lord evandale will suffer looking towards edith if deprived of the pleasure which we enjoy i will run the risk of overburdening your ladyships hospitalitybothwell let lord evandale know that lady margaret bellenden requests the honour of his company  and let harrison take care added lady margaret that the people and their horses are suitably seen to  ediths heart sprung to her lips during this conversation for it instantly occurred to her that through her influence over lord evandale she might find some means of releasing morton from his present state of danger in case her uncles intercession with claverhouse should prove ineffectual at any other time she would have been much averse to exert this influence for however inexperienced in the world her native delicacy taught her the advantage which a beautiful young woman gives to a young man when she permits him to lay her under an obligation and she would have been the farther disinclined to request any favour of lord evandale because the voice of the gossips in clydesdale had for reasons hereafter to be made known assigned him to her as a suitor and because she could not disguise from herself that very little encouragement was necessary to realize conjectures which had hitherto no foundation this was the more to be dreaded that in the case of lord evandales making a formal declaration he had every chance of being supported by the influence of lady margaret and her other friends and that she would have nothing to oppose to their solicitations and authority except a predilection to avow which she knew would be equally dangerous and unavailing she determined therefore to wait the issue of her uncles intercession and should it fail which she conjectured she should soon learn either from the looks or language of the openhearted veteran she would then as a last effort make use in mortons favour of her interest with lord evandale her mind did not long remain in suspense on the subject of her uncles application  major bellenden who had done the honours of the table laughing and chatting with the military guests who were at that end of the board was now by the conclusion of the repast at liberty to leave his station and accordingly took an opportunity to approach claverhouse requesting from his niece at the same time the honour of a particular introduction as his name and character were well known the two military men met with expressions of mutual regard and edith with a beating heart saw her aged relative withdraw from the company together with his new acquaintance into a recess formed by one of the arched windows of the hall she watched their conference with eyes almost dazzled by the eagerness of suspense and with observation rendered more acute by the internal agony of her mind could guess from the pantomimic gestures which accompanied the conversation the progress and fate of the intercession in behalf of henry morton  the first expression of the countenance of claverhouse betokened that open and willing courtesy which ere it requires to know the nature of the favour asked seems to say how happy the party will be to confer an obligation on the suppliant but as the conversation proceeded the brow of that officer became darker and more severe and his features though still retaining the expression of the most perfect politeness assumed at least to ediths terrified imagination a harsh and inexorable character his lip was now compressed as if with impatience now curled slightly upward as if in civil contempt of the arguments urged by major bellenden the language of her uncle as far as expressed in his manner appeared to be that of earnest intercession urged with all the affectionate simplicity of his character as well as with the weight which his age and reputation entitled him to use but it seemed to have little impression upon colonel grahame who soon changed his posture as if about to cut short the majors importunity and to break up their conference with a courtly expression of regret calculated to accompany a positive refusal of the request solicited this movement brought them so near edith that she could distinctly hear claverhouse say it cannot be major bellenden lenity in his case is altogether beyond the bounds of my commission though in any thing else i am heartily desirous to oblige youand here comes evandale with news as i thinkwhat tidings do you bring us evandale he continued addressing the young lord who now entered in complete uniform but with his dress disordered and his boots spattered as if by riding hard   illustration claverhouse176   unpleasant news sir was his reply a large body of whigs are in arms among the hills and have broken out into actual rebellion they have publicly burnt the act of supremacy that which established episcopacy that for observing the martyrdom of charles i and some others and have declared their intention to remain together in arms for furthering the covenanted work of reformation  this unexpected intelligence struck a sudden and painful surprise into the minds of all who heard it excepting claverhouse  unpleasant news call you them replied colonel grahame his dark eyes flashing fire they are the best i have heard these six months now that the scoundrels are drawn into a body we will make short work with them when the adder crawls into daylight he added striking the heel of his boot upon the floor as if in the act of crushing a noxious reptile i can trample him to death he is only safe when he remains lurking in his den or morasswhere are these knaves he continued addressing lord evandale  about ten miles off among the mountains at a place called loudonhill was the young noblemans reply i dispersed the conventicle against which you sent me and made prisoner an old trumpeter of rebellionan intercommuned minister that is to saywho was in the act of exhorting his hearers to rise and be doing in the good cause as well as one or two of his hearers who seemed to be particularly insolent and from some country people and scouts i learned what i now tell you  what may be their strength asked his commander  probably a thousand men but accounts differ widely  then said claverhouse it is time for us to be up and be doing alsobothwell bid them sound to horse  bothwell who like the warhorse of scripture snuffed the battle afar off hastened to give orders to six negroes in white dresses richly laced and having massive silver collars and armlets these sable functionaries acted as trumpeters and speedily made the castle and the woods around it ring with their summons  must you then leave us said lady margaret her heart sinking under recollection of former unhappy times had ye not better send to learn the force of the rebelso how many a fair face hae i heard these fearfu sounds call away frae the tower of tillietudlem that my auld een were neer to see return to it  it is impossible for me to stop said claverhouse there are rogues enough in this country to make the rebels five times their strength if they are not checked at once  many said evandale are flocking to them already and they give out that they expect a strong body of the indulged presbyterians headed by young milnwood as they call him the son of the famous old roundhead colonel silas morton  this speech produced a very different effect upon the hearers edith almost sunk from her seat with terror while claverhouse darted a glance of sarcastic triumph at major bellenden which seemed to implyyou see what are the principles of the young man you are pleading for  its a lieits a dd lie of these rascally fanatics said the major hastily i will answer for henry morton as i would for my own son he is a lad of as good churchprinciples as any gentleman in the lifeguards i mean no offence to any one he has gone to church service with me fifty times and i never heard him miss one of the responses in my life edith bellenden can bear witness to it as well as i he always read on the same prayerbook with her and could look out the lessons as well as the curate himself call him up let him be heard for himself  there can be no harm in that said claverhouse whether he be innocent or guiltymajor allan he said turning to the officer next in command take a guide and lead the regiment forward to loudonhill by the best and shortest road move steadily and do not let the men blow the horses lord evandale and i will overtake you in a quarter of an hour leave bothwell with a party to bring up the prisoners  allan bowed and left the apartment with all the officers excepting claverhouse and the young nobleman in a few minutes the sound of the military music and the clashing of hoofs announced that the horsemen were leaving the castle the sounds were presently heard only at intervals and soon died away entirely  while claverhouse endeavoured to soothe the terrors of lady margaret and to reconcile the veteran major to his opinion of morton evandale getting the better of that conscious shyness which renders an ingenuous youth diffident in approaching the object of his affections drew near to miss bellenden and accosted her in a tone of mingled respect and interest  we are to leave you he said taking her hand which he pressed with much emotionto leave you for a scene which is not without its dangers farewell dear miss bellendenlet me say for the first and perhaps the last time dear edith we part in circumstances so singular as may excuse some solemnity in bidding farewell to one whom i have known so long and whom irespect so highly  the manner differing from the words seemed to express a feeling much deeper and more agitating than was conveyed in the phrase he made use of it was not in woman to be utterly insensible to his modest and deepfelt expression of tenderness although borne down by the misfortunes and imminent danger of the man she loved edith was touched by the hopeless and reverential passion of the gallant youth who now took leave of her to rush into dangers of no ordinary description  i hopei sincerely trust she said there is no danger i hope there is no occasion for this solemn ceremonialthat these hasty insurgents will be dispersed rather by fear than force and that lord evandale will speedily return to be what he must always be the dear and valued friend of all in this castle  of all he repeated with a melancholy emphasis upon the word but be it sowhatever is near you is dear and valued to me and i value their approbation accordingly of our success i am not sanguine our numbers are so few that i dare not hope for so speedy so bloodless or so safe an end of this unhappy disturbance these men are enthusiastic resolute and desperate and have leaders not altogether unskilled in military matters i cannot help thinking that the impetuosity of our colonel is hurrying us against them rather prematurely but there are few that have less reason to shun danger than i have  edith had now the opportunity she wished to bespeak the young noblemans intercession and protection for henry morton and it seemed the only remaining channel of interest by which he could be rescued from impending destruction yet she felt at that moment as if in doing so she was abusing the partiality and confidence of the lover whose heart was as open before her as if his tongue had made an express declaration could she with honour engage lord evandale in the service of a rival or could she with prudence make him any request or lay herself under any obligation to him without affording ground for hopes which she could never realize but the moment was too urgent for hesitation or even for those explanations with which her request might otherwise have been qualified  i will but dispose of this young fellow said claverhouse from the other side of the hall and then lord evandalei am sorry to interrupt again your conversationbut then we must mountbothwell why do not you bring up the prisoner and hark ye let two files load their carabines  in these words edith conceived she heard the deathwarrant of her lover she instantly broke through the restraint which had hitherto kept her silent  my lord evandale she said this young gentleman is a particular friend of my unclesyour interest must be great with your colonellet me request your intercession in his favourit will confer on my uncle a lasting obligation  you overrate my interest miss bellenden said lord evandale i have been often unsuccessful in such applications when i have made them on the mere score of humanity  yet try once again for my uncles sake  and why not for your own said lord evandale will you not allow me to think i am obliging you personally in this matterare you so diffident of an old friend that you will not allow him even the satisfaction of thinking that he is gratifying your wishes  surelysurely replied edith you will oblige me infinitelyi am interested in the young gentleman on my uncles accountlose no time for gods sake  she became bolder and more urgent in her entreaties for she heard the steps of the soldiers who were entering with their prisoner  by heaven then said evandale he shall not die if i should die in his placebut will not you he said resuming the hand which in the hurry of her spirits she had not courage to withdraw will not you grant me one suit in return for my zeal in your service  any thing you can ask my lord evandale that sisterly affection can give  and is this all he continued all you can grant to my affection living or my memory when dead  do not speak thus my lord said edith you distress me and do injustice to yourself there is no friend i esteem more highly or to whom i would more readily grant every mark of regardprovidingbuta deep sigh made her turn her head suddenly ere she had well uttered the last word and as she hesitated how to frame the exception with which she meant to close the sentence she became instantly aware she had been overheard by morton who heavily ironed and guarded by soldiers was now passing behind her in order to be presented to claverhouse as their eyes met each other the sad and reproachful expression of mortons glance seemed to imply that he had partially heard and altogether misinterpreted the conversation which had just passed there wanted but this to complete ediths distress and confusion her blood which rushed to her brow made a sudden revulsion to her heart and left her as pale as death this change did not escape the attention of evandale whose quick glance easily discovered that there was between the prisoner and the object of his own attachment some singular and uncommon connexion he resigned the hand of miss bellenden again surveyed the prisoner with more attention again looked at edith and plainly observed the confusion which she could no longer conceal  this he said after a moments gloomy silence is i believe the young gentleman who gained the prize at the shooting match  i am not sure hesitated edithyeti rather think not scarce knowing what she replied  it is he said evandale decidedly i know him well a victor he continued somewhat haughtily ought to have interested a fair spectator more deeply  he then turned from edith and advancing towards the table at which claverhouse now placed himself stood at a little distance resting on his sheathed broadsword a silent but not an unconcerned spectator of that which passed      chapter xiii                      o my lord beware of jealousy                                         othello  to explain the deep effect which the few broken passages of the conversation we have detailed made upon the unfortunate prisoner by whom they were overheard it is necessary to say something of his previous state of mind and of the origin of his acquaintance with edith  henry morton was one of those gifted characters which possess a force of talent unsuspected by the owner himself he had inherited from his father an undaunted courage and a firm and uncompromising detestation of oppression whether in politics or religion but his enthusiasm was unsullied by fanatic zeal and unleavened by the sourness of the puritanical spirit from these his mind had been freed partly by the active exertions of his own excellent understanding partly by frequent and long visits at major bellendens where he had an opportunity of meeting with many guests whose conversation taught him that goodness and worth were not limited to those of any single form of religious observance  the base parsimony of his uncle had thrown many obstacles in the way of his education but he had so far improved the opportunities which offered themselves that his instructors as well as his friends were surprised at his progress under such disadvantages still however the current of his soul was frozen by a sense of dependence of poverty above all of an imperfect and limited education these feelings impressed him with a diffidence and reserve which effectually concealed from all but very intimate friends the extent of talent and the firmness of character which we have stated him to be possessed of the circumstances of the times had added to this reserve an air of indecision and of indifference for being attached to neither of the factions which divided the kingdom he passed for dull insensible and uninfluenced by the feeling of religion or of patriotism no conclusion however could be more unjust and the reasons of the neutrality which he had hitherto professed had root in very different and most praiseworthy motives he had formed few congenial ties with those who were the objects of persecution and was disgusted alike by their narrowminded and selfish partyspirit their gloomy fanaticism their abhorrent condemnation of all elegant studies or innocent exercises and the envenomed rancour of their political hatred but his mind was still more revolted by the tyrannical and oppressive conduct of the government the misrule license and brutality of the soldiery the executions on the scaffold the slaughters in the open field the free quarters and exactions imposed by military law which placed the lives and fortunes of a free people on a level with asiatic slaves condemning therefore each party as its excesses fell under his eyes disgusted with the sight of evils which he had no means of alleviating and hearing alternate complaints and exultations with which he could not sympathize he would long ere this have left scotland had it not been for his attachment to edith bellenden  the earlier meetings of these young people had been at charnwood when major bellenden who was as free from suspicion on such occasions as uncle toby himself had encouraged their keeping each other constant company without entertaining any apprehension of the natural consequences love as usual in such cases borrowed the name of friendship used her language and claimed her privileges when edith bellenden was recalled to her mothers castle it was astonishing by what singular and recurring accidents she often met young morton in her sequestered walks especially considering the distance of their places of abode yet it somehow happened that she never expressed the surprise which the frequency of these rencontres ought naturally to have excited and that their intercourse assumed gradually a more delicate character and their meetings began to wear the air of appointments books drawings letters were exchanged between them and every trifling commission given or executed gave rise to a new correspondence love indeed was not yet mentioned between them by name but each knew the situation of their own bosom and could not but guess at that of the other unable to desist from an intercourse which possessed such charms for both yet trembling for its too probable consequences it had been continued without specific explanation until now when fate appeared to have taken the conclusion into its own hands  it followed as a consequence of this state of things as well as of the diffidence of mortons disposition at this period that his confidence in ediths return of his affection had its occasional cold fits her situations was in every respect so superior to his own her worth so eminent her accomplishments so many her face so beautiful and her manners so bewitching that he could not but entertain fears that some suitor more favoured than himself by fortune and more acceptable to ediths family than he durst hope to be might step in between him and the object of his affections common rumour had raised up such a rival in lord evandale whom birth fortune connexions and political principles as well as his frequent visits at tillietudlem and his attendance upon lady bellenden and her niece at all public places naturally pointed out as a candidate for her favour it frequently and inevitably happened that engagements to which lord evandale was a party interfered with the meeting of the lovers and henry could not but mark that edith either studiously avoided speaking of the young nobleman or did so with obvious reserve and hesitation  these symptoms which in fact arose from the delicacy of her own feelings towards morton himself were misconstrued by his diffident temper and the jealousy which they excited was fermented by the occasional observations of jenny dennison this truebred servingdamsel was in her own person a complete country coquette and when she had no opportunity of teasing her own lovers used to take some occasional opportunity to torment her young ladys this arose from no illwill to henry morton who both on her mistresss account and his own handsome form and countenance stood high in her esteem but then lord evandale was also handsome he was liberal far beyond what mortons means could afford and he was a lord moreover and if miss edith bellenden should accept his hand she would become a barons lady and what was more little jenny dennison whom the awful housekeeper at tillietudlem huffed about at her pleasure would be then mrs dennison lady evandales own woman or perhaps her ladyships ladyinwaiting the impartiality of jenny dennison therefore did not like that of mrs quickly extend to a wish that both the handsome suitors could wed her young lady for it must be owned that the scale of her regard was depressed in favour of lord evandale and her wishes in his favour took many shapes extremely tormenting to morton being now expressed as a friendly caution now as an article of intelligence and anon as a merry jest but always tending to confirm the idea that sooner or later his romantic intercourse with her young mistress must have a close and that edith bellenden would in spite of summer walks beneath the greenwood tree exchange of verses of drawings and of books end in becoming lady evandale  these hints coincided so exactly with the very point of his own suspicions and fears that morton was not long of feeling that jealousy which every one has felt who has truly loved but to which those are most liable whose love is crossed by the want of friends consent or some other envious impediment of fortune edith herself unwittingly and in the generosity of her own frank nature contributed to the error into which her lover was in danger of falling their conversation once chanced to turn upon some late excesses committed by the soldiery on an occasion when it was said inaccurately however that the party was commanded by lord evandale edith as true in friendship as in love was somewhat hurt at the severe strictures which escaped from morton on this occasion and which perhaps were not the less strongly expressed on account of their supposed rivalry she entered into lord evandales defence with such spirit as hurt morton to the very soul and afforded no small delight to jenny dennison the usual companion of their walks edith perceived her error and endeavoured to remedy it but the impression was not so easily erased and it had no small effect in inducing her lover to form that resolution of going abroad which was disappointed in the manner we have already mentioned  the visit which he received from edith during his confinement the deep and devoted interest which she had expressed in his fate ought of themselves to have dispelled his suspicions yet ingenious in tormenting himself even this he thought might be imputed to anxious friendship or at most to a temporary partiality which would probably soon give way to circumstances the entreaties of her friends the authority of lady margaret and the assiduities of lord evandale  and to what do i owe it he said that i cannot stand up like a man and plead my interest in her ere i am thus cheated out of itto what but to the allpervading and accursed tyranny which afflicts at once our bodies souls estates and affections and is it to one of the pensioned cutthroats of this oppressive government that i must yield my pretensions to edith bellendeni will not by heavenit is a just punishment on me for being dead to public wrongs that they have visited me with their injuries in a point where they can be least brooked or borne  as these stormy resolutions boiled in his bosom and while he ran over the various kinds of insult and injury which he had sustained in his own cause and in that of his country bothwell entered the tower followed by two dragoons one of whom carried handcuffs  you must follow me young man said he but first we must put you in trim  in trim said morton what do you mean  why we must put on these rough bracelets i durst notnay dn it i durst do any thingbut i would not for three hours plunder of a stormed town bring a whig before my colonel without his being ironed come come young man dont look sulky about it  he advanced to put on the irons but seizing the oakenseat upon which he had rested morton threatened to dash out the brains of the first who should approach him  i could manage you in a moment my youngster said bothwell but i had rather you would strike sail quietly  here indeed he spoke the truth not from either fear or reluctance to adopt force but because he dreaded the consequences of a noisy scuffle through which it might probably be discovered that he had contrary to express orders suffered his prisoner to pass the night without being properly secured  you had better be prudent he continued in a tone which he meant to be conciliatory and dont spoil your own sport they say here in the castle that lady margarets niece is immediately to marry our young captain lord evandale i saw them close together in the hall yonder and i heard her ask him to intercede for your pardon she looked so devilish handsome and kind upon him that on my soulbut what the devils the matter with youyou are as pale as a sheetwill you have some brandy  miss bellenden ask my life of lord evandale said the prisoner faintly  ay ay theres no friend like the womentheir interest carries all in court and campcome you are reasonable noway i thought you would come round  here he employed himself in putting on the fetters against which morton thunderstruck by this intelligence no longer offered the least resistance  my life begged of him and by herayayput on the ironsmy limbs shall not refuse to bear what has entered into my very soulmy life begged by edith and begged of evandale  ay and he has power to grant it too said bothwellhe can do more with the colonel than any man in the regiment  and as he spoke he and his party led their prisoner towards the hall in passing behind the seat of edith the unfortunate prisoner heard enough as he conceived of the broken expressions which passed between edith and lord evandale to confirm all that the soldier had told him that moment made a singular and instantaneous revolution in his character the depth of despair to which his love and fortunes were reduced the peril in which his life appeared to stand the transference of ediths affections her intercession in his favour which rendered her fickleness yet more galling seemed to destroy every feeling for which he had hitherto lived but at the same time awakened those which had hitherto been smothered by passions more gentle though more selfish desperate himself he determined to support the rights of his country insulted in his person his character was for the moment as effectually changed as the appearance of a villa which from being the abode of domestic quiet and happiness is by the sudden intrusion of an armed force converted into a formidable post of defence  we have already said that he cast upon edith one glance in which reproach was mingled with sorrow as if to bid her farewell for ever his next motion was to walk firmly to the table at which colonel grahame was seated  by what right is it sir said he firmly and without waiting till he was questionedby what right is it that these soldiers have dragged me from my family and put fetters on the limbs of a free man  by my commands answered claverhouse and i now lay my commands on you to be silent and hear my questions  i will not replied morton in a determined tone while his boldness seemed to electrify all around him i will know whether i am in lawful custody and before a civil magistrate ere the charter of my country shall be forfeited in my person  a pretty springald this upon my honour said claverhouse  are you mad said major bellenden to his young friend for gods sake henry morton he continued in a tone between rebuke and entreaty remember you are speaking to one of his majestys officers high in the service  it is for that very reason sir returned henry firmly that i desire to know what right he has to detain me without a legal warrant were he a civil officer of the law i should know my duty was submission  your friend here said claverhouse to the veteran coolly is one of those scrupulous gentlemen who like the madman in the play will not tie his cravat without the warrant of mr justice overdo but i will let him see before we part that my shoulderknot is as legal a badge of authority as the mace of the justiciary so waving this discussion you will be pleased young man to tell me directly when you saw balfour of burley  as i know no right you have to ask such a question replied morton i decline replying to it  you confessed to my sergeant said claverhouse that you saw and entertained him knowing him to be an intercommuned traitor why are you not so frank with me  because replied the prisoner i presume you are from education taught to understand the rights upon which you seem disposed to trample and i am willing you should be aware there are yet scotsmen who can assert the liberties of scotland  and these supposed rights you would vindicate with your sword i presume said colonel grahame  were i armed as you are and we were alone upon a hillside you should not ask me the question twice  it is quite enough answered claverhouse calmly your language corresponds with all i have heard of youbut you are the son of a soldier though a rebellious one and you shall not die the death of a dog i will save you that indignity  die in what manner i may replied morton i will die like the son of a brave man and the ignominy you mention shall remain with those who shed innocent blood  make your peace then with heaven in five minutes spacebothwell lead him down to the courtyard and draw up your party  the appalling nature of this conversation and of its result struck the silence of horror into all but the speakers but now those who stood round broke forth into clamour and expostulation old lady margaret who with all the prejudices of rank and party had not laid aside the feelings of her sex was loud in her intercession  o colonel grahame she exclaimed spare his young blood leave him to the lawdo not repay my hospitality by shedding mens blood on the threshold of my doors  colonel grahame said major bellenden you must answer this violence dont think though i am old and feckless that my friends son shall be murdered before my eyes with impunity i can find friends that shall make you answer it  be satisfied major bellenden i will answer it replied claverhouse totally unmoved and you madam might spare me the pain the resisting this passionate intercession for a traitor when you consider the noble blood your own house has lost by such as he is  colonel grahame answered the lady her aged frame trembling with anxiety i leave vengeance to god who calls it his own the shedding of this young mans blood will not call back the lives that were dear to me and how can it comfort me to think that there has maybe been another widowed mother made childless like mysell by a deed done at my very doorstane  this is stark madness said claverhouse i must do my duty to church and state here are a thousand villains hard by in open rebellion and you ask me to pardon a young fanatic who is enough of himself to set a whole kingdom in a blaze it cannot beremove him bothwell  she who was most interested in this dreadful decision had twice strove to speak but her voice had totally failed her her mind refused to suggest words and her tongue to utter them she now sprung up and attempted to rush forward but her strength gave way and she would have fallen flat upon the pavement had she not been caught by her attendant  help cried jennyhelp for gods sake my young lady is dying  at this exclamation evandale who during the preceding part of the scene had stood motionless leaning upon his sword now stepped forward and said to his commandingofficer colonel grahame before proceeding in this matter will you speak a word with me in private  claverhouse looked surprised but instantly rose and withdrew with the young nobleman into a recess where the following brief dialogue passed between them  i think i need not remind you colonel that when our family interest was of service to you last year in that affair in the privycouncil you considered yourself as laid under some obligation to us  certainly my dear evandale answered claverhouse i am not a man who forgets such debts you will delight me by showing how i can evince my gratitude  i will hold the debt cancelled said lord evandale if you will spare this young mans life  evandale replied grahame in great surprise you are madabsolutely madwhat interest can you have in this young spawn of an old roundheadhis father was positively the most dangerous man in all scotland cool resolute soliderly and inflexible in his cursed principles his son seems his very model you cannot conceive the mischief he may do i know mankind evandalewere he an insignificant fanatical country booby do you think i would have refused such a trifle as his life to lady margaret and this family but this is a lad of fire zeal and educationand these knaves want but such a leader to direct their blind enthusiastic hardiness i mention this not as refusing your request but to make you fully aware of the possible consequencesi will never evade a promise or refuse to return an obligationif you ask his life he shall have it  keep him close prisoner answered evandale but do not be surprised if i persist in requesting you will not put him to death i have most urgent reasons for what i ask  be it so then replied grahamebut young man should you wish in your future life to rise to eminence in the service of your king and country let it be your first task to subject to the public interest and to the discharge of your duty your private passions affections and feelings these are not times to sacrifice to the dotage of greybeards or the tears of silly women the measures of salutary severity which the dangers around compel us to adopt and remember that if i now yield this point in compliance with your urgency my present concession must exempt me from future solicitations of the same nature  he then stepped forward to the table and bent his eyes keenly on morton as if to observe what effect the pause of awful suspense between death and life which seemed to freeze the bystanders with horror would produce upon the prisoner himself morton maintained a degree of firmness which nothing but a mind that had nothing left upon earth to love or to hope could have supported at such a crisis  you see him said claverhouse in a half whisper to lord evandale he is tottering on the verge between time and eternity a situation more appalling than the most hideous certainty yet his is the only cheek unblenched the only eye that is calm the only heart that keeps its usual time the only nerves that are not quivering look at him well evandaleif that man shall ever come to head an army of rebels you will have much to answer for on account of this mornings work he then said aloud young man your life is for the present safe through the intercession of your friendsremove him bothwell and let him be properly guarded and brought along with the other prisoners  if my life said morton stung with the idea that he owed his respite to the intercession of a favoured rival if my life be granted at lord evandales request  take the prisoner away bothwell said colonel grahame interrupting him i have neither time to make nor to hear fine speeches  bothwell forced off morton saying as he conducted him into the courtyard have you three lives in your pocket besides the one in your body my lad that you can afford to let your tongue run away with them at this rate come come ill take care to keep you out of the colonels way for egad you will not be five minutes with him before the next tree or the next ditch will be the word so come along to your companions in bondage  thus speaking the sergeant who in his rude manner did not altogether want sympathy for a gallant young man hurried morton down to the courtyard where three other prisoners two men and a woman who had been taken by lord evandale remained under an escort of dragoons  meantime claverhouse took his leave of lady margaret but it was difficult for the good lady to forgive his neglect of her intercession  i have thought till now she said that the tower of tillietudlem might have been a place of succour to those that are ready to perish even if they werena sae deserving as they should have beenbut i see auld fruit has little savourour suffering and our services have been of an ancient date  they are never to be forgotten by me let me assure your ladyship said claverhouse nothing but what seemed my sacred duty could make me hesitate to grant a favour requested by you and the major come my good lady let me hear you say you have forgiven me and as i return tonight i will bring a drove of two hundred whigs with me and pardon fifty head of them for your sake  i shall be happy to hear of your success colonel said major bellenden but take an old soldiers advice and spare blood when battles overand once more let me request to enter bail for young morton  we will settle that when i return said claverhouse meanwhile be assured his life shall be safe  during this conversation evandale looked anxiously around for edith but the precaution of jenny dennison had occasioned her mistress being transported to her own apartment  slowly and heavily he obeyed the impatient summons of claverhouse who after taking a courteous leave of lady margaret and the major had hastened to the courtyard the prisoners with their guard were already on their march and the officers with their escort mounted and followed all pressed forward to overtake the main body as it was supposed they would come in sight of the enemy in little more than two hours      chapter xiv                      my hounds may a rin masterless                     my hawks may fly frae tree to tree                     my lord may grip my vassal lands                     for there again maun i never be                     old ballad  we left morton along with three companions in captivity travelling in the custody of a small body of soldiers who formed the rearguard of the column under the command of claverhouse and were immediately under the charge of sergeant bothwell their route lay towards the hills in which the insurgent presbyterians were reported to be in arms they had not prosecuted their march a quarter of a mile ere claverhouse and evandale galloped past them followed by their orderlymen in order to take their proper places in the column which preceded them no sooner were they past than bothwell halted the body which he commanded and disencumbered morton of his irons  kings blood must keep word said the dragoon i promised you should be civilly treated as far as rested with mehere corporal inglis let this gentleman ride alongside of the other young fellow who is prisoner and you may permit them to converse together at their pleasure under their breath but take care they are guarded by two files with loaded carabines if they attempt an escape blow their brains outyou cannot call that using you uncivilly he continued addressing himself to morton its the rules of war you knowand inglis couple up the parson and the old woman they are fittest company for each other dn me a single file may guard them well enough if they speak a word of cant or fanatical nonsense let them have a strapping with a shoulderbelt theres some hope of choking a silenced parson if he is not allowed to hold forth his own treason will burst him  having made this arrangement bothwell placed himself at the head of the party and inglis with six dragoons brought up the rear the whole then set forward at a trot with the purpose of overtaking the main body of the regiment  morton overwhelmed with a complication of feelings was totally indifferent to the various arrangements made for his secure custody and even to the relief afforded him by his release from the fetters he experienced that blank and waste of the heart which follows the hurricane of passion and no longer supported by the pride and conscious rectitude which dictated his answers to claverhouse he surveyed with deep dejection the glades through which he travelled each turning of which had something to remind him of past happiness and disappointed love the eminence which they now ascended was that from which he used first and last to behold the ancient tower when approaching or retiring from it and it is needless to add that there he was wont to pause and gaze with a lovers delight on the battlements which rising at a distance out of the lofty wood indicated the dwelling of her whom he either hoped soon to meet or had recently parted from instinctively he turned his head back to take a last look of a scene formerly so dear to him and no less instinctively he heaved a deep sigh it was echoed by a loud groan from his companion in misfortune whose eyes moved perchance by similar reflections had taken the same direction this indication of sympathy on the part of the captive was uttered in a tone more coarse than sentimental it was however the expression of a grieved spirit and so far corresponded with the sigh of morton in turning their heads their eyes met and morton recognised the stolid countenance of cuddie headrigg bearing a rueful expression in which sorrow for his own lot was mixed with sympathy for the situation of his companion  hegh sirs was the expression of the cidevant ploughman of the mains of tillietudlem its an unco thing that decent folk should be harled through the country this gate as if they were a warlds wonder  i am sorry to see you here cuddie said morton who even in his own distress did not lose feeling for that of others  and sae am i mr henry answered cuddie baith for mysell and you but neither of our sorrows will do muckle gude that i can see to be sure for me continued the captive agriculturist relieving his heart by talking though he well knew it was to little purposeto be sure for my part i hae nae right to be here ava for i never did nor said a word against either king or curate but my mither puir body couldna haud the auld tongue o her and we maun baith pay fort its like  your mother is their prisoner likewise said morton hardly knowing what he said  in troth is she riding ahint ye there like a bride wi that auld carle o a minister that they ca gabriel kettledrummledeil that he had been in the inside of a drum or a kettle either for my share o him ye see we were nae sooner chased out o the doors o milnwood and your uncle and the housekeeper banging them to and barring them ahint us as if we had had the plague on our bodies that i says to my mother what are we to do neist for every hole and bore in the country will be steekit against us now that ye hae affronted my auld leddy and gart the troopers tak up young milnwood sae she says to me binna cast doun but gird yoursell up to the great task o the day and gie your testimony like a man upon the mount o the covenant  and so i suppose you went to a conventicle said morton  ye sall hear continued cuddieaweel i kendna muckle better what to do sae i een gaed wi her to an auld daft carline like hersell and we got some waterbroo and bannocks and mony a weary grace they said and mony a psalm they sang or they wad let me win to for i was amaist famished wi vexation aweel they had me up in the grey o the morning and i behoved to whig awa wi them reason or nane to a great gathering o their folk at the mirysikes and there this chield gabriel kettledrummle was blasting awa to them on the hillside about lifting up their testimony nae doubt and ganging down to the battle of roman gilead or some sic place eh mr henry but the carle gae them a screed o doctrine ye might hae heard him a mile down the windhe routed like a cow in a fremd loaningweel thinks i theres nae place in this country they ca roman gileadit will be some gate in the west muirlands and or we win there ill see to slip awa wi this mither o mine for i winna rin my neck into a tether for ony kettledrummle in the country sideaweel continued cuddie relieving himself by detailing his misfortunes without being scrupulous concerning the degree of attention which his companion bestowed on his narrative just as i was wearying for the tail of the preaching cam word that the dragoons were upon ussome ran and some cried stand and some cried down wi the philistinesi was at my mither to get her awa sting and ling or the redcoats cam up but i might as weel hae tried to drive our auld foreahand ox without the goaddeil a step wad she budgeweel after a the cleugh we were in was strait and the mist cam thick and there was good hope the dragoons wad hae missed us if we could hae held our tongues but as if auld kettledrummle himsell hadna made din eneugh to waken the very dead they behoved a to skirl up a psalm that ye wad hae heard as far as lanrickaweel to mak a lang tale short up cam my young lord evandale skelping as fast as his horse could trot and twenty redcoats at his back twa or three chields wad needs fight wi the pistol and the whinger in the tae hand and the bible in the tother and they got their crouns weel cloured but there wasna muckle skaith dune for evandale aye cried to scatter us but to spare life  and did you not resist said morton who probably felt that at that moment he himself would have encountered lord evandale on much slighter grounds  na truly answered cuddie i keepit aye before the auld woman and cried for mercy to life and limb but twa o the redcoats cam up and ane o them was gaun to strike my mither wi the side o his broadswordso i got up my kebbie at them and said i wad gie them as gude weel they turned on me and clinked at me wi their swords and i garrd my hand keep my head as weel as i could till lord evandale came up and then i cried out i was a servant at tillietudlemye ken yoursell he was aye judged to hae a look after the young leddyand he bade me fling down my kent and sae me and my mither yielded oursells prisoners im thinking we wad hae been letten slip awa but kettledrummle was taen near usfor andrew wilsons naig that he was riding on had been a dragooner lang syne and the sairer kettledrummle spurred to win awa the readier the dour beast ran to the dragoons when he saw them draw upaweel when my mother and him forgathered they set till the sodgers and i think they gae them their kale through the reek bastards o the hure o babylon was the best words in their wame sae then the kiln was in a bleeze again and they brought us a three on wi them to mak us an example as they cat  it is most infamous and intolerable oppression said morton half speaking to himself here is a poor peaceable fellow whose only motive for joining the conventicle was a sense of filial piety and he is chained up like a thief or murderer and likely to die the death of one but without the privilege of a formal trial which our laws indulge to the worst malefactor even to witness such tyranny and still more to suffer under it is enough to make the blood of the tamest slave boil within him  to be sure said cuddie hearing and partly understanding what had broken from morton in resentment of his injuries it is no right to speak evil o dignitiesmy auld leddy aye said that as nae doubt she had a gude right to do being in a place o dignity hersell and troth i listened to her very patiently for she aye ordered a dram or a sowp kale or something to us after she had gien us a hearing on our duties but deil a dram or kale or ony thing elseno sae muckle as a cup o cauld waterdo thae lords at edinburgh gie us and yet they are heading and hanging amang us and trailing us after thae blackguard troopers and taking our goods and gear as if we were outlaws i canna say i tak it kind at their hands  it would be very strange if you did answered morton with suppressed emotion  and what i like warst o a continued poor cuddie is thae ranting redcoats coming amang the lasses and taking awa our joes i had a sair heart o my ain when i passed the mains down at tillietudlem this morning about parritchtime and saw the reek comin out at my ain lumhead and kend there was some ither body than my auld mither sitting by the ingleside but i think my heart was een sairer when i saw that hellicat trooper tam halliday kissing jenny dennison afore my face i wonder women can hae the impudence to do sic things but they are a for the redcoats whiles i hae thought o being a trooper mysell when i thought naething else wad gae down wi jennyand yet ill no blame her ower muckle neither for maybe it was a for my sake that she loot tam touzle her tapknots that gate  for your sake said morton unable to refrain from taking some interest in a story which seemed to bear a singular coincidence with his own  een sae milnwood replied cuddie for the puir quean gat leave to come near me wi speaking the loun fair dn him that i suld say sae and sae she bade me god speed and she wanted to stap siller into my handise warrant it was the tae half o her fee and bountith for she wared the ither half on pinners and pearlings to gang to see us shoot yon day at the popinjay  and did you take it cuddie said morton  troth did i no milnwood i was sic a fule as to fling it back to hermy heart was ower grit to be behadden to her when i had seen that loon slavering and kissing at her but i was a great fule for my pains it wad hae dune my mither and me some gude and shell waret a on duds and nonsense  there was here a deep and long pause cuddie was probably engaged in regretting the rejection of his mistresss bounty and henry morton in considering from what motives or upon what conditions miss bellenden had succeeded in procuring the interference of lord evandale in his favour  was it not possible suggested his awakening hopes that he had construed her influence over lord evandale hastily and unjustly ought he to censure her severely if submitting to dissimulation for his sake she had permitted the young nobleman to entertain hopes which she had no intention to realize or what if she had appealed to the generosity which lord evandale was supposed to possess and had engaged his honour to protect the person of a favoured rival  still however the words which he had overheard recurred ever and anon to his remembrance with a pang which resembled the sting of an adder  nothing that she could refuse himwas it possible to make a more unlimited declaration of predilection the language of affection has not within the limits of maidenly delicacy a stronger expression she is lost to me wholly and for ever and nothing remains for me now but vengeance for my own wrongs and for those which are hourly inflicted on my country  apparently cuddie though with less refinement was following out a similar train of ideas for he suddenly asked morton in a low whisperwad there be ony ill in getting out o thae chields hands an ane could compass it  none in the world said morton and if an opportunity occurs of doing so depend on it i for one will not let it slip  im blythe to hear ye say sae answered cuddie im but a puir silly fallow but i canna think there wad be muckle ill in breaking out by strength o hand if ye could mak it ony thing feasible i am the lad that will neer fear to lay on if it were come to that but our auld leddy wad hae cad that a resisting o the kings authority  i will resist any authority on earth said morton that invades tyrannically my chartered rights as a freeman and i am determined i will not be unjustly dragged to a jail or perhaps a gibbet if i can possibly make my escape from these men either by address or force  weel thats just my mind too aye supposing we hae a feasible opportunity o breaking loose but then ye speak o a charter now these are things that only belang to the like o you that are a gentleman and it mightna bear me through that am but a husbandman  the charter that i speak of said morton is common to the meanest scotchman it is that freedom from stripes and bondage which was claimed as you may read in scripture by the apostle paul himself and which every man who is freeborn is called upon to defend for his own sake and that of his countrymen  hegh sirs replied cuddie it wad hae been lang or my leddy margaret or my mither either wad hae fund out sic a wiselike doctrine in the bible the tane was aye graning about giving tribute to caesar and the tither is as daft wi her whiggery i hae been clean spoilt just wi listening to twa blethering auld wives but if i could get a gentleman that wad let me tak on to be his servant i am confident i wad be a clean contrary creature and i hope your honour will think on what i am saying if ye were ance fairly delivered out o this house of bondage and just take me to be your ain wallydeshamble  my valet cuddie answered morton alas that would be sorry preferment even if we were at liberty  i ken what yere thinkingthat because i am landwardbred i wad be bringing ye to disgrace afore folk but ye maun ken im gay gleg at the uptak there was never ony thing dune wi hand but i learned gay readily septing reading writing and ciphering but theres no the like o me at the fitba and i can play wi the broadsword as weel as corporal inglis there i hae broken his head or now for as massy as hes riding ahint usand then yell no be gaun to stay in this countrysaid he stopping and interrupting himself  probably not replied morton  weel i carena a boddle ye see i wad get my mither bestowed wi her auld graning tittie auntie meg in the gallowgate o glasgow and then i trust they wad neither burn her for a witch or let her fail for faut o fude or hang her up for an auld whig wife for the provost they say is very regardfu o sic puir bodies and then you and me wad gang and pouss our fortunes like the folk i the daft auld tales about jock the giantkiller and valentine and orson and we wad come back to merry scotland as the sang says and i wad tak to the stilts again and turn sic furs on the bonny rigs o milnwood holms that it wad be worth a pint but to look at them  i fear said morton there is very little chance my good friend cuddie of our getting back to our old occupation  hout stirhout stir replied cuddie its aye gude to keep up a hardy heartas broken a ships come to landbut whats that i hear never stir if my auld mither isna at the preaching again i ken the sough o her texts that sound just like the wind blawing through the spence and theres kettledrummle setting to wark toolordsake if the sodgers anes get angry theyll murder them baith and us for company  their farther conversation was in fact interrupted by a blatant noise which rose behind them in which the voice of the preacher emitted in unison with that of the old woman tones like the grumble of a bassoon combined with the screaking of a cracked fiddle at first the aged pair of sufferers had been contented to condole with each other in smothered expressions of complaint and indignation but the sense of their injuries became more pungently aggravated as they communicated with each other and they became at length unable to suppress their ire  woe woe and a threefold woe unto you ye bloody and violent persecutors exclaimed the reverend gabriel kettledrummlewoe and threefold woe unto you even to the breaking of seals the blowing of trumpets and the pouring forth of vials  ayaya black cast to a their illfaurd faces and the outside o the loof to them at the last day echoed the shrill countertenor of mause falling in like the second part of a catch  i tell you continued the divine that your rankings and your ridingsyour neighings and your prancingsyour bloody barbarous and inhuman crueltiesyour benumbing deadening and debauching the conscience of poor creatures by oaths souldamning and selfcontradictory have arisen from earth to heaven like a foul and hideous outcry of perjury for hastening the wrath to comehugh hugh hugh  and i say cried mause in the same tune and nearly at the same time that wi this auld breath o mine and its sair taen down wi the asthmatics and this rough trot  deil gin they would gallop said cuddie wad it but gar her haud her tongue  wi this auld and brief breath continued mause will i testify against the backslidings defections defalcations and declinings of the landagainst the grievances and the causes of wrath  peace i prytheepeace good woman said the preacher who had just recovered from a violent fit of coughing and found his own anathema borne down by mauses better wind peace and take not the word out of the mouth of a servant of the altari say i uplift my voice and tell you that before the play is played outay before this very sun gaes down ye sall learn that neither a desperate judas like your prelate sharpe thats gane to his place nor a sanctuarybreaking holofernes like bloodyminded claverhouse nor an ambitious diotrephes like the lad evandale nor a covetous and warldfollowing demas like him they ca sergeant bothwell that makes every wifes plack and her mealark his ain neither

of small cords knotted for the chastisement of those wha like their warldly gudes and gear better than the cross or the covenant but when that warks done only meet to mak latchets to the deils brogues  fiend hae me said cuddie addressing himself to morton if i dinna think our mither preaches as weel as the ministerbut its a sair pity o his hoast for it aye comes on just when hes at the best ot and that lang routing he made air this morning is sair again him toodeil an i care if he wad roar her dumb and then he wad haet a to answer for himsellits lucky the roads rough and the troopers are no taking muckle tent to what they say wi the rattling o the horses feet but an we were anes on saft grund well hear news o a this  cuddies conjecture were but too true the words of the prisoners had not been much attended to while drowned by the clang of horses hoofs on a rough and stony road but they now entered upon the moorlands where the testimony of the two zealous captives lacked this saving accompaniment and accordingly no sooner had their steeds begun to tread heath and green sward and gabriel kettledrummle had again raised his voice with also i uplift my voice like that of a pelican in the wilderness  and i mine had issued from mause like a sparrow on the housetops  when hollo ho cried the corporal from the rear rein up your tongues the devil blister them or ill clap a martingale on them  i will not peace at the commands of the profane said gabriel  nor i neither said mause for the bidding of no earthly potsherd though it be painted as red as a brick from the tower of babel and ca itsell a corporal  halliday cried the corporal hast got never a gag about thee manwe must stop their mouths before they talk us all dead  ere any answer could be made or any measure taken in consequence of the corporals motion a dragoon galloped towards sergeant bothwell who was considerably ahead of the party he commanded on hearing the orders which he brought bothwell instantly rode back to the head of his party ordered them to close their files to mend their pace and to move with silence and precaution as they would soon be in presence of the enemy      chapter xv                 quantum in nobis weve thought good                to save the expense of christian blood                and try if we by mediation                of treaty and accommodation                can end the quarrel and compose                this bloody duel without blows                                              butler  the increased pace of the party of horsemen soon took away from their zealous captives the breath if not the inclination necessary for holding forth they had now for more than a mile got free of the woodlands whose broken glades had for some time accompanied them after they had left the woods of tillietudlem a few birches and oaks still feathered the narrow ravines or occupied in dwarfclusters the hollow plains of the moor but these were gradually disappearing and a wide and waste country lay before them swelling into bare hills of dark heath intersected by deep gullies being the passages by which torrents forced their course in winter and during summer the disproportioned channels for diminutive rivulets that winded their puny way among heaps of stones and gravel the effects and tokens of their winter furylike so many spendthrifts dwindled down by the consequences of former excesses and extravagance this desolate region seemed to extend farther than the eye could reach without grandeur without even the dignity of mountain wildness yet striking from the huge proportion which it seemed to bear to such more favoured spots of the country as were adapted to cultivation and fitted for the support of man and thereby impressing irresistibly the mind of the spectator with a sense of the omnipotence of nature and the comparative inefficacy of the boasted means of amelioration which man is capable of opposing to the disadvantages of climate and soil  it is a remarkable effect of such extensive wastes that they impose an idea of solitude even upon those who travel through them in considerable numbers so much is the imagination affected by the disproportion between the desert around and the party who are traversing it thus the members of a caravan of a thousand souls may feel in the deserts of africa or arabia a sense of loneliness unknown to the individual traveller whose solitary course is through a thriving and cultivated country  it was not therefore without a peculiar feeling of emotion that morton beheld at the distance of about half a mile the body of the cavalry to which his escort belonged creeping up a steep and winding path which ascended from the more level moor into the hills their numbers which appeared formidable when they crowded through narrow roads and seemed multiplied by appearing partially and at different points among the trees were now apparently diminished by being exposed at once to view and in a landscape whose extent bore such immense proportion to the columns of horses and men which showing more like a drove of black cattle than a body of soldiers crawled slowly along the face of the hill their force and their numbers seeming trifling and contemptible  surely said morton to himself a handful of resolute men may defend any defile in these mountains against such a small force as this is providing that their bravery is equal to their enthusiasm  while he made these reflections the rapid movement of the horsemen who guarded him soon traversed the space which divided them from their companions and ere the front of claverhouses column had gained the brow of the hill which they had been seen ascending bothwell with his rearguard and prisoners had united himself or nearly so with the main body led by his commander the extreme difficulty of the road which was in some places steep and in others boggy retarded the progress of the column especially in the rear for the passage of the main body in many instances poached up the swamps through which they passed and rendered them so deep that the last of their followers were forced to leave the beaten path and find safer passage where they could  on these occasions the distresses of the reverend gabriel kettledrummle and of mause headrigg were considerably augmented as the brutal troopers by whom they were guarded compelled them at all risks which such inexperienced riders were likely to incur to leap their horses over drains and gullies or to push them through morasses and swamps  through the help of the lord i have luppen ower a wall cried poor mause as her horse was by her rude attendants brought up to leap the turf enclosure of a deserted fold in which feat her curch flew off leaving her grey hairs uncovered  i am sunk in deep mire where there is no standingi am come into deep waters where the floods overflow me exclaimed kettledrummle as the charger on which he was mounted plunged up to the saddlegirths in a wellhead as the springs are called which supply the marshes the sable streams beneath spouting over the face and person of the captive preacher  these exclamations excited shouts of laughter among their military attendants but events soon occurred which rendered them all sufficiently serious  the leading files of the regiment had nearly attained the brow of the steep hill we have mentioned when two or three horsemen speedily discovered to be a part of their own advanced guard who had acted as a patrol appeared returning at full gallop their horses much blown and the men apparently in a disordered flight they were followed upon the spur by five or six riders well armed with sword and pistol who halted upon the top of the hill on observing the approach of the lifeguards one or two who had carabines dismounted and taking a leisurely and deliberate aim at the foremost rank of the regiment discharged their pieces by which two troopers were wounded one severely they then mounted their horses and disappeared over the ridge of the hill retreating with so much coolness as evidently showed that on the one hand they were undismayed by the approach of so considerable a force as was moving against them and conscious on the other that they were supported by numbers sufficient for their protection this incident occasioned a halt through the whole body of cavalry and while claverhouse himself received the report of his advanced guard which had been thus driven back upon the main body lord evandale advanced to the top of the ridge over which the enemys horsemen had retired and major allan cornet grahame and the other officers employed themselves in extricating the regiment from the broken ground and drawing them up on the side of the hill in two lines the one to support the other  the word was then given to advance and in a few minutes the first lines stood on the brow and commanded the prospect on the other side the second line closed upon them and also the rearguard with the prisoners so that morton and his companions in captivity could in like manner see the form of opposition which was now offered to the farther progress of their captors  the brow of the hill on which the royal lifeguards were now drawn up sloped downwards on the side opposite to that which they had ascended with a gentle declivity for more than a quarter of a mile and presented ground which though unequal in some places was not altogether unfavourable for the manoeuvres of cavalry until near the bottom when the slope terminated in a marshy level traversed through its whole length by what seemed either a natural gully or a deep artificial drain the sides of which were broken by springs trenches filled with water out of which peats and turf had been dug and here and there by some straggling thickets of alders which loved the moistness so well that they continued to live as bushes although too much dwarfed by the sour soil and the stagnant bogwater to ascend into trees beyond this ditch or gully the ground arose into a second heathy swell or rather hill near to the foot of which and as if with the object of defending the broken ground and ditch that covered their front the body of insurgents appeared to be drawn up with the purpose of abiding battle  their infantry was divided into three lines the first tolerably provided with firearms were advanced almost close to the verge of the bog so that their fire must necessarily annoy the royal cavalry as they descended the opposite hill the whole front of which was exposed and would probably be yet more fatal if they attempted to cross the morass behind this first line was a body of pikemen designed for their support in case the dragoons should force the passage of the marsh in their rear was their third line consisting of countrymen armed with scythes set straight on poles hayforks spits clubs goads fishspears and such other rustic implements as hasty resentment had converted into instruments of war on each flank of the infantry but a little backward from the bog as if to allow themselves dry and sound ground whereon to act in case their enemies should force the pass there was drawn up a small body of cavalry who were in general but indifferently armed and worse mounted but full of zeal for the cause being chiefly either landholders of small property or farmers of the better class whose means enabled them to serve on horseback a few of those who had been engaed in driving back the advanced guard of the royalists might now be seen returning slowly towards their own squadrons these were the only individuals of the insurgent army which seemed to be in motion all the others stood firm and motionless as the grey stones that lay scattered on the heath around them  the total number of the insurgents might amount to about a thousand men but of these there were scarce a hundred cavalry nor were the half of them even tolerably armed the strength of their position however the sense of their having taken a desperate step the superiority of their numbers but above all the ardour of their enthusiasm were the means on which their leaders reckoned for supplying the want of arms equipage and military discipline  on the side of the hill that rose above the array of battle which they had adopted were seen the women and even the children whom zeal opposed to persecution had driven into the wilderness they seemed stationed there to be spectators of the engagement by which their own fate as well as that of their parents husbands and sons was to be decided like the females of the ancient german tribes the shrill cries which they raised when they beheld the glittering ranks of their enemy appear on the brow of the opposing eminence acted as an incentive to their relatives to fight to the last in defence of that which was dearest to them such exhortations seemed to have their full and emphatic effect for a wild halloo which went from rank to rank on the appearance of the soldiers intimated the resolution of the insurgents to fight to the uttermost  as the horsemen halted their lines on the ridge of the hill their trumpets and kettledrums sounded a bold and warlike flourish of menace and defiance that rang along the waste like the shrill summons of a destroying angel the wanderers in answer united their voices and sent forth in solemn modulation the two first verses of the seventysixth psalm according to the metrical version of the scottish kirk                      in judahs land god is well known                     his names in israel great                     in salem is his tabernacle                     in zion is his seat                     there arrows of the bow he brake                     the shield the sword the war                     more glorious thou than hills of prey                     more excellent art far  a shout or rather a solemn acclamation attended the close of the stanza and after a dead pause the second verse was resumed by the insurgents who applied the destruction of the assyrians as prophetical of the issue of their own impending contest                 those that were stout of heart are spoild                they slept their sleep outright                and none of those their hands did find                that were the men of might                 when thy rebuke o jacobs god                had forth against them past                their horses and their chariots both                were in a deep sleep cast  there was another acclamation which was followed by the most profound silence  while these solemn sounds accented by a thousand voices were prolonged amongst the waste hills claverhouse looked with great attention on the ground and on the order of battle which the wanderers had adopted and in which they determined to await the assault  the churls he said must have some old soldiers with them it was no rustic that made choice of that ground  burley is said to be with them for certain answered lord evandale and also hackston of rathillet paton of meadowhead cleland and some other men of military skill  i judged as much said claverhouse from the style in which these detached horsemen leapt their horses over the ditch as they returned to their position it was easy to see that there were a few roundheaded troopers amongst them the true spawn of the old covenant we must manage this matter warily as well as boldly evandale let the officers come to this knoll  he moved to a small mossgrown cairn probably the restingplace of some celtic chief of other times and the call of officers to the front soon brought them around their commander  i do not call you around me gentlemen said claverhouse in the formal capacity of a council of war for i will never turn over on others the responsibility which my rank imposes on myself i only want the benefit of your opinions reserving to myself as most men do when they ask advice the liberty of following my ownwhat say you cornet grahame shall we attack these fellows who are bellowing younder you are youngest and hottest and therefore will speak first whether i will or no  then said cornet grahame while i have the honour to carry the standard of the lifeguards it shall never with my will retreat before rebels i say charge in gods name and the kings  and what say you allan continued claverhouse for evandale is so modest we shall never get him to speak till you have said what you have to say  these fellows said major allan an old cavalier officer of experience are three or four to onei should not mind that much upon a fair field but they are posted in a very formidable strength and show no inclination to quit it i therefore think with deference to cornet grahames opinion that we should draw back to tillietudlem occupy the pass between the hills and the open country and send for reinforcements to my lord ross who is lying at glasgow with a regiment of infantry in this way we should cut them off from the strath of clyde and either compel them to come out of their stronghold and give us battle on fair terms or if they remain here we will attack them so soon as our infantry has joined us and enabled us to act with effect among these ditches bogs and quagmires  pshaw said the young cornet what signifies strong ground when it is only held by a crew of canting psalmsinging old women  a man may fight never the worse retorted major allan for honouring both his bible and psalter these fellows will prove as stubborn as steel i know them of old  their nasal psalmody said the cornet reminds our major of the race of dunbar  had you been at that race young man retorted allan you would have wanted nothing to remind you of it for the longest day you have to live  hush hush gentlemen said claverhouse these are untimely reparteesi should like your advice well major allan had our rascally patrols whom i will see duly punished brought us timely notice of the enemys numbers and position but having once presented ourselves before them in line the retreat of the lifeguards would argue gross timidity and be the general signal for insurrection throughout the west in which case so far from obtaining any assistance from my lord ross i promise you i should have great apprehensions of his being cut off before we can join him or he us a retreat would have quite the same fatal effect upon the kings cause as the loss of a battleand as to the difference of risk or of safety it might make with respect to ourselves that i am sure no gentleman thinks a moment about there must be some gorges or passes in the morass through which we can force our way and were we once on firm ground i trust there is no man in the lifeguards who supposes our squadrons though so weak in numbers are unable to trample into dust twice the number of these unpractised clownswhat say you my lord evandale  i humbly think said lord evandale that go the day how it will it must be a bloody one and that we shall lose many brave fellows and probably be obliged to slaughter a great number of these misguided men who after all are scotchmen and subjects of king charles as well as we are  rebels rebels and undeserving the name either of scotchmen or of subjects said claverhouse but come my lord what does your opinion point at  to enter into a treaty with these ignorant and misled men said the young nobleman  a treaty and with rebels having arms in their hands never while i live answered his commander  at least send a trumpet and flag of truce summoning them to lay down their weapons and disperse said lord evandale upon promise of a free pardoni have always heard that had that been done before the battle of pentland hills much blood might have been saved  well said claverhouse and who the devil do you think would carry a summons to these headstrong and desperate fanatics they acknowledge no laws of war their leaders who have been all most active in the murder of the archbishop of st andrews fight with a rope round their necks and are likely to kill the messenger were it but to dip their followers in loyal blood and to make them as desperate of pardon as themselves  i will go myself said evandale if you will permit me i have often risked my blood to spill that of others let me do so now in order to save human lives  you shall not go on such an errand my lord said claverhouse your rank and situation render your safety of too much consequence to the country in an age when good principles are so rareheres my brothers son dick grahame who fears shot or steel as little as if the devil had given him armour of proof against it as the fanatics say he has given to his uncle       note  cornet grahame there was actually a young cornet of the      lifeguards named grahame and probably some relation of      claverhouse slain in the skirmish of drumclog in the old ballad on      the battle of bothwell bridge claverhouse is said to have continued      the slaughter of the fugitives in revenge of this gentlemans death       haud up your hand then monmouth said gie quarters to these men      for me but bloody claverse swore an oath his kinsmans death      avenged should be       the body of this young man was found shockingly mangled after the      battle his eyes pulled out and his features so much defaced that      it was impossible to recognise him the tory writers say that this      was done by the whigs because finding the name grahame wrought in      the young gentlemans neckcloth they took the corpse for that of      claverse himself the whig authorities give a different account      from tradition of the cause of cornet grahames body being thus      mangled he had say they refused his own dog any food on the      morning of the battle affirming with an oath that he should have      no breakfast but upon the flesh of the whigs the ravenous animal      it is said flew at his master as soon as he fell and lacerated his      face and throat       these two stories are presented to the reader leaving it to him to      judge whether it is most likely that a party of persecuted and      insurgent fanatics should mangle a body supposed to be that of their      chief enemy in the same manner as several persons present at      drumclog had shortly before treated the person of archbishop sharpe      or that a domestic dog should for want of a single breakfast      become so ferocious as to feed on his own master selecting his body      from scores that were lying around equally accessible to his      ravenous appetite  he shall take a flag of truce and a trumpet and ride down to the edge of the morass to summon them to lay down their arms and disperse  with all my soul colonel answered the cornet and ill tie my cravat on a pike to serve for a white flagthe rascals never saw such a pennon of flanders lace in their lives before  colonel grahame said evandale while the young officer prepared for his expedition this young gentleman is your nephew and your apparent heir for gods sake permit me to go it was my counsel and i ought to stand the risk  were he my only son said claverhouse this is no cause and no time to spare him i hope my private affections will never interfere with my public duty if dick grahame falls the loss is chiefly mine were your lordship to die the king and country would be the suffererscome gentlemen each to his post if our summons is unfavourably received we will instantly attack and as the old scottish blazon has it god shaw the right      chapter xvi                 with many a stout thwack and many a bang                hard crabtree and old iron rang                                              hudibras  cornet richard grahame descended the hill bearing in his hand the extempore flag of truce and making his managed horse keep time by bounds and curvets to the tune which he whistled the trumpeter followed five or six horsemen having something the appearance of officers detached themselves from each flank of the presbyterian army and meeting in the centre approached the ditch which divided the hollow as near as the morass would permit towards this group but keeping the opposite side of the swamp cornet grahame directed his horse his motions being now the conspicuous object of attention to both armies and without disparagement to the courage of either it is probable there was a general wish on both sides that this embassy might save the risks and bloodshed of the impending conflict  when he had arrived right opposite to those who by their advancing to receive his message seemed to take upon themselves as the leaders of the enemy cornet grahame commanded his trumpeter to sound a parley the insurgents having no instrument of martial music wherewith to make the appropriate reply one of their number called out with a loud strong voice demanding to know why he approached their leaguer  to summon you in the kings name and in that of colonel john grahame of claverhouse specially commissioned by the right honourable privy council of scotland answered the cornet to lay down your arms and dismiss the followers whom ye have led into rebellion contrary to the laws of god of the king and of the country  return to them that sent thee said the insurgent leader and tell them that we are this day in arms for a broken covenant and a persecuted kirk tell them that we renounce the licentious and perjured charles stewart whom you call king even as he renounced the covenant after having once and again sworn to prosecute to the utmost of his power all the ends thereof really constantly and sincerely all the days of his life having no enemies but the enemies of the covenant and no friends but its friends whereas far from keeping the oath he had called god and angels to witness his first step after his incoming into these kingdoms was the fearful grasping at the prerogative of the almighty by that hideous act of supremacy together with his expulsing without summons libel or process of law hundreds of famous faithful preachers thereby wringing the bread of life out of the mouth of hungry poor creatures and forcibly cramming their throats with the lifeless saltless foisonless lukewarm drammock of the fourteen false prelates and their sycophantic formal carnal scandalous creaturecurates  i did not come to hear you preach answered the officer but to know in one word if you will disperse yourselves on condition of a free pardon to all but the murderers of the late archbishop of st andrews or whether you will abide the attack of his majestys forces which will instantly advance upon you  in one word then answered the spokesman we are here with our swords on our thighs as men that watch in the night we will take one part and portion together as brethren in righteousness whosoever assails us in our good cause his blood be on his own head so return to them that sent thee and god give them and thee a sight of the evil of your ways  is not your name said the cornet who began to recollect having seen the person whom he was now speaking with john balfour of burley  and if it be said the spokesman hast thou aught to say against it  only said the cornet that as you are excluded from pardon in the name of the king and of my commanding officer it is to these country people and not to you that i offer it and it is not with you or such as you that i am sent to treat  thou art a young soldier friend said burley and scant well learned in thy trade or thou wouldst know that the bearer of a flag of truce cannot treat with the army but through their officers and that if he presume to do otherwise he forfeits his safe conduct  while speaking these words burley unslung his carabine and held it in readiness  i am not to be intimidated from the discharge of my duty by the menaces of a murderer said cornet grahamehear me good people i proclaim in the name of the king and of my commanding officer full and free pardon to all excepting  i give thee fair warning said burley presenting his piece  a free pardon to all continued the young officer still addressing the body of the insurgentsto all but  then the lord grant grace to thy soulamen said burley  with these words he fired and cornet richard grahame dropped from his horse the shot was mortal the unfortunate young gentleman had only strength to turn himself on the ground and mutter forth my poor mother when life forsook him in the effort his startled horse fled back to the regiment at the gallop as did his scarce less affrighted attendant  what have you done said one of balfours brother officers  my duty said balfour firmly is it not written thou shalt be zealous even to slaying let those who dare now venture to speak of truce or pardon  claverhouse saw his nephew fall he turned his eye on evandale while a transitory glance of indescribable emotion disturbed for a seconds space the serenity of his features and briefly said you see the event  i will avenge him or die exclaimed evandale and putting his horse into motion rode furiously down the hill followed by his own troop and that of the deceased cornet which broke down without orders and each striving to be the foremost to revenge their young officer their ranks soon fell into confusion these forces formed the first line of the royalists it was in vain that claverhouse exclaimed halt halt this rashness will undo us it was all that he could accomplish by galloping along the second line entreating commanding and even menacing the men with his sword that he could restrain them from following an example so contagious  allan he said as soon as he had rendered the men in some degree more steady lead them slowly down the hill to support lord evandale who is about to need it very muchbothwell thou art a cool and a daring fellow  ay muttered bothwell you can remember that in a moment like this  lead ten file up the hollow to the right continued his commanding officer and try every means to get through the bog then form and charge the rebels in flank and rear while they are engaged with us in front  bothwell made a signal of intelligence and obedience and moved off with his party at a rapid pace  meantime the disaster which claverhouse had apprehended did not fail to take place the troopers who with lord evandale had rushed down upon the enemy soon found their disorderly career interrupted by the impracticable character of the ground some stuck fast in the morass as they attempted to struggle through some recoiled from the attempt and remained on the brink others dispersed to seek a more favourable place to pass the swamp in the midst of this confusion the first line of the enemy of which the foremost rank knelt the second stooped and the third stood upright poured in a close and destructive fire that emptied at least a score of saddles and increased tenfold the disorder into which the horsemen had fallen lord evandale in the meantime at the head of a very few wellmounted men had been able to clear the ditch but was no sooner across than he was charged by the left body of the enemys cavalry who encouraged by the small number of opponents that had made their way through the broken ground set upon them with the utmost fury crying woe woe to the uncircumcised philistines down with dagon and all his adherents  the young nobleman fought like a lion but most of his followers were killed and he himself could not have escaped the same fate but for a heavy fire of carabines which claverhouse who had now advanced with the second line near to the ditch poured so effectually upon the enemy that both horse and foot for a moment began to shrink and lord evandale disengaged from his unequal combat and finding himself nearly alone took the opportunity to effect his retreat through the morass but notwithstanding the loss they had sustained by claverhouses first fire the insurgents became soon aware that the advantage of numbers and of position were so decidedly theirs that if they could but persist in making a brief but resolute defence the lifeguards must necessarily be defeated their leaders flew through their ranks exhorting them to stand firm and pointing out how efficacious their fire must be where both men and horse were exposed to it for the troopers according to custom fired without having dismounted claverhouse more than once when he perceived his best men dropping by a fire which they could not effectually return made desperate efforts to pass the bog at various points and renew the battle on firm ground and fiercer terms but the close fire of the insurgents joined to the natural difficulties of the pass foiled his attempts in every point  we must retreat he said to evandale unless bothwell can effect a diversion in our favour in the meantime draw the men out of fire and leave skirmishers behind these patches of alderbushes to keep the enemy in check  these directions being accomplished the appearance of bothwell with his party was earnestly expected but bothwell had his own disadvantages to struggle with his detour to the right had not escaped the penetrating observation of burley who made a corresponding movement with the left wing of the mounted insurgents so that when bothwell after riding a considerable way up the valley found a place at which the bog could be passed though with some difficulty he perceived he was still in front of a superior enemy his daring character was in no degree checked by this unexpected opposition  follow me my lads he called to his men never let it be said that we turned our backs before these canting roundheads  with that as if inspired by the spirit of his ancestors he shouted bothwell bothwell and throwing himself into the morass he struggled through it at the head of his party and attacked that of burley with such fury that he drove them back above a pistolshot killing three men with his own hand burley perceiving the consequences of a defeat on this point and that his men though more numerous were unequal to the regulars in using their arms and managing their horses threw himself across bothwells way and attacked him hand to hand each of the combatants was considered as the champion of his respective party and a result ensued more usual in romance than in real story their followers on either side instantly paused and looked on as if the fate of the day were to be decided by the event of the combat between these two redoubted swordsmen the combatants themselves seemed of the same opinion for after two or three eager cuts and pushes had been exchanged they paused as if by joint consent to recover the breath which preceding exertions had exhausted and to prepare for a duel in which each seemed conscious he had met his match   illustration the duel230   you are the murdering villain burley said bothwell griping his sword firmly and setting his teeth closeyou escaped me once buthe swore an oath too tremendous to be written downthy head is worth its weight of silver and it shall go home at my saddlebow or my saddle shall go home empty for me  yes replied burley with stern and gloomy deliberation i am that john balfour who promised to lay thy head where thou shouldst never lift it again and god do so unto me and more also if i do not redeem my word  then a bed of heather or a thousand merks said bothwell striking at burley with his full force  the sword of the lord and of gideon answered balfour as he parried and returned the blow  there have seldom met two combatants more equally matched in strength of body skill in the management of their weapons and horses determined courage and unrelenting hostility after exchanging many desperate blows each receiving and inflicting several wounds though of no great consequence they grappled together as if with the desperate impatience of mortal hate and bothwell seizing his enemy by the shoulderbelt while the grasp of balfour was upon his own collar they came headlong to the ground the companions of burley hastened to his assistance but were repelled by the dragoons and the battle became again general but nothing could withdraw the attention of the combatants from each other or induce them to unclose the deadly clasp in which they rolled together on the ground tearing struggling and foaming with the inveteracy of thoroughbred bulldogs  several horses passed over them in the melee without their quitting hold of each other until the swordarm of bothwell was broken by the kick of a charger he then relinquished his grasp with a deep and suppressed groan and both combatants started to their feet bothwells right hand dropped helpless by his side but his left griped to the place where his dagger hung it had escaped from the sheath in the struggleand with a look of mingled rage and despair he stood totally defenceless as balfour with a laugh of savage joy flourished his sword aloft and then passed it through his adversarys body bothwell received the thrust without fallingit had only grazed on his ribs he attempted no farther defence but looking at burley with a grin of deadly hatred exclaimedbase peasant churl thou hast spilt the blood of a line of kings  die wretchdie said balfour redoubling the thrust with better aim and setting his foot on bothwells body as he fell he a third time transfixed him with his sworddie bloodthirsty dog die as thou hast liveddie like the beasts that perishhoping nothingbelieving nothing  and fearing nothing said bothwell collecting the last effort of respiration to utter these desperate words and expiring as soon as they were spoken  to catch a stray horse by the bridle throw himself upon it and rush to the assistance of his followers was with burley the affair of a moment and as the fall of bothwell had given to the insurgents all the courage of which it had deprived his comrades the issue of this partial contest did not remain long undecided several soldiers were slain the rest driven back over the morass and dispersed and the victorious burley with his party crossed it in their turn to direct against claverhouse the very manoeuvre which he had instructed bothwell to execute he now put his troop in order with the view of attacking the right wing of the royalists and sending news of his success to the main body exhorted them in the name of heaven to cross the marsh and work out the glorious work of the lord by a general attack upon the enemy  meanwhile claverhouse who had in some degree remedied the confusion occasioned by the first irregular and unsuccessful attack and reduced the combat in front to a distant skirmish with firearms chiefly maintained by some dismounted troopers whom he had posted behind the cover of the shrubby copses of alders which in some places covered the edge of the morass and whose close cool and wellaimed fire greatly annoyed the enemy and concealed their own deficiency of numbersclaverhouse while he maintained the contest in this manner still expecting that a diversion by bothwell and his party might facilitate a general attack was accosted by one of the dragoons whose bloody face and jaded horse bore witness he was come from hard service  what is the matter halliday said claverhouse for he knew every man in his regiment by namewhere is bothwell  bothwell is down replied halliday and many a pretty fellow with him  then the king said claverhouse with his usual composure has lost a stout soldierthe enemy have passed the marsh i suppose  with a strong body of horse commanded by the devil incarnate that killed bothwell answered the terrified soldier  hush hush said claverhouse putting his finger on his lips not a word to any one but melord evandale we must retreat the fates will have it so draw together the men that are dispersed in the skirmishing work let allan form the regiment and do you two retreat up the hill in two bodies each halting alternately as the other falls back ill keep the rogues in check with the rearguard making a stand and facing from time to time they will be over the ditch presently for i see their whole line in motion and preparing to cross therefore lose no time  where is bothwell with his party said lord evandale astonished at the coolness of his commander  fairly disposed of said claverhouse in his earthe king has lost a servant and the devil has got one but away to business evandaleply your spurs and get the men together allan and you must keep them steady this retreating is new work for us all but our turn will come round another day  evandale and allan betook themselves to their task but ere they had arranged the regiment for the purpose of retreating in two alternate bodies a considerable number of the enemy had crossed the marsh claverhouse who had retained immediately around his person a few of his most active and tried men charged those who had crossed in person while they were yet disordered by the broken ground some they killed others they repulsed into the morass and checked the whole so as to enable the main body now greatly diminished as well as disheartened by the loss they had sustained to commence their retreat up the hill  but the enemys van being soon reinforced and supported compelled claverhouse to follow his troops never did man however better maintain the character of a soldier than he did that day conspicuous by his black horse and white feather he was first in the repeated charges which he made at every favourable opportunity to arrest the progress of the pursuers and to cover the retreat of his regiment the object of aim to every one he seemed as if he were impassive to their shot the superstitious fanatics who looked upon him as a man gifted by the evil spirit with supernatural means of defence averred that they saw the bullets recoil from his jackboots and buffcoat like hailstones from a rock of granite as he galloped to and fro amid the storm of the battle many a whig that day loaded his musket with a dollar cut into slugs in order that a silver bullet such was their belief might bring down the persecutor of the holy kirk on whom lead had no power  try him with the cold steel was the cry at every renewed chargepowder is wasted on him ye might as weel shoot at the auld enemy himsell       note proof against shot given by satan the belief of the      covenanters that their principal enemies and claverhouse in      particular had obtained from the devil a charm which rendered them      proof against leaden bullets led them to pervert even the      circumstances of his death howie of lochgoin after giving some      account of the battle of killicrankie adds       the battle was very bloody and by mackays third fire claverhouse      fell of whom historians give little account but it has been said      for certain that his own waitingservant taking a resolution to      rid the world of this truculent bloody monster and knowing he had      proof of lead shot him with a silver button he had before taken off      his own coat for that purpose however he fell and with him      popery and king jamess interest in scotlandgods judgment on      persecutors p xxxix       original noteperhaps some may think this anent proof of a shot a      paradox and be ready to object here as formerly concerning bishop      sharpe and dalzielhow can the devil have or give a power to save      life without entering upon the thing in its reality i shall only      observe 1st that it is neither in his power or of his nature to      be a saviour of mens lives he is called apollyon the destroyer      2d that even in this case he is said only to give enchantment      against one kind of metal and this does not save life for the lead      would not take sharpe or claverhouses lives yet steel and silver      would do it and for dalziel though he died not on the field he      did not escape the arrows of the almightyibidem  but though this was loudly shouted yet the awe on the insurgents minds was such that they gave way before claverhouse as before a supernatural being and few men ventured to cross swords with him still however he was fighting in retreat and with all the disadvantages attending that movement the soldiers behind him as they beheld the increasing number of enemies who poured over the morass became unsteady and at every successive movement major allan and lord evandale found it more and more difficult to bring them to halt and form line regularly while on the other hand their motions in the act of retreating became by degrees much more rapid than was consistent with good order as the retiring soldiers approached nearer to the top of the ridge from which in so luckless an hour they had descended the panic began to increase every one became impatient to place the brow of the hill between him and the continued fire of the pursuers nor could any individual think it reasonable that he should be the last in the retreat and thus sacrifice his own safety for that of others in this mood several troopers set spurs to their horses and fled outright and the others became so unsteady in their movements and formations that their officers every moment feared they would follow the same example  amid this scene of blood and confusion the trampling of the horses the groans of the wounded the continued fire of the enemy which fell in a succession of unintermitted musketry while loud shouts accompanied each bullet which the fall of a trooper showed to have been successfully aimedamid all the terrors and disorders of such a scene and when it was dubious how soon they might be totally deserted by their dispirited soldiery evandale could not forbear remarking the composure of his commanding officer not at lady margarets breakfasttable that morning did his eye appear more lively or his demeanour more composed he had closed up to evandale for the purpose of giving some orders and picking out a few men to reinforce his rearguard  if this bout lasts five minutes longer he said in a whisper our rogues will leave you my lord old allan and myself the honour of fighting this battle with our own hands i must do something to disperse the musketeers who annoy them so hard or we shall be all shamed dont attempt to succour me if you see me go down but keep at the head of your men get off as you can in gods name and tell the king and the council i died in my duty  so saying and commanding about twenty stout men to follow him he gave with this small body a charge so desperate and unexpected that he drove the foremost of the pursuers back to some distance in the confusion of the assault he singled out burley and desirous to strike terror into his followers he dealt him so severe a blow on the head as cut through his steel headpiece and threw him from his horse stunned for the moment though unwounded a wonderful thing it was afterwards thought that one so powerful as balfour should have sunk under the blow of a man to appearance so slightly made as claverhouse and the vulgar of course set down to supernatural aid the effect of that energy which a determined spirit can give to a feebler arm claverhouse had in this last charge however involved himself too deeply among the insurgents and was fairly surrounded  lord evandale saw the danger of his commander his body of dragoons being then halted while that commanded by allan was in the act of retreating regardless of claverhouses disinterested command to the contrary he ordered the party which he headed to charge down hill and extricate their colonel some advanced with himmost halted and stood uncertainmany ran away with those who followed evandale he disengaged claverhouse his assistance just came in time for a rustic had wounded his horse in a most ghastly manner by the blow of a scythe and was about to repeat the stroke when lord evandale cut him down as they got out of the press they looked round them allans division had ridden clear over the hill that officers authority having proved altogether unequal to halt them evandales troop was scattered and in total confusion  what is to be done colonel said lord evandale  we are the last men in the field i think said claverhouse and when men fight as long as they can there is no shame in flying hector himself would say devil take the hindmost when there are but twenty against a thousandsave yourselves my lads and rally as soon as you cancome my lord we must een ride for it  so saying he put spurs to his wounded horse and the generous animal as if conscious that the life of his rider depended on his exertions pressed forward with speed unabated either by pain or loss of blood       note  claverhouses charger it appears from the letter of      claverhouse afterwards quoted that the horse on which he rode at      drumclog was not black but sorrel the author has been misled as to      the colour by the many extraordinary traditions current in scotland      concerning claverhouses famous black charger which was generally      believed to have been a gift to its rider from the author of evil      who is said to have performed the caesarean operation upon its dam      this horse was so fleet and its rider so expert that they are said      to have outstripped and coted or turned a hare upon the branlaw      near the head of moffat water where the descent is so precipitous      that no merely earthly horse could keep its feet or merely mortal      rider could keep the saddle       there is a curious passage in the testimony of john dick one of the      suffering presbyterians in which the author by describing each of      the persecutors by their predominant qualities or passions shows      how little their bestloved attributes would avail them in the great      day of judgment when he introduces claverhouse it is to reproach      him with his passion for horses in general and for that steed in      particular which was killed at drumclog in the manner described in      the text       as for that bloodthirsty wretch claverhouse how thinks he to      shelter himself that day is it possible the pitiful thing can be so      mad as to think to secure himself by the fleetness of his horse a      creature he has so much respect for that he regarded more the loss      of his horse at drumclog than all the men that fell there and sure      there fell prettier men on either side than himself no      surecould he fall upon a chemist that could extract the spirit      out of all the horses in

grahames death and the flight of claverhouse      from the following latin lines a part of a poem entitled bellum      bothuellianum by andrew guild which exists in manuscript in the      advocates library  a few officers and soldiers followed him but in a very irregular and tumultuary manner the flight of claverhouse was the signal for all the stragglers who yet offered desultory resistance to fly as fast as they could and yield up the field of battle to the victorious insurgents      chapter xvii            but see through the fastflashing lightnings of war           what steed to the desert flies frantic and far                                                   campbell  during the severe skirmish of which we have given the details morton together with cuddie and his mother and the reverend gabriel kettledrummle remained on the brow of the hill near to the small cairn or barrow beside which claverhouse had held his preliminary council of war so that they had a commanding view of the action which took place in the bottom they were guarded by corporal inglis and four soldiers who as may readily be supposed were much more intent on watching the fluctuating fortunes of the battle than in attending to what passed among their prisoners  if you lads stand to their tackle said cuddie well hae some chance o getting our necks out o the brecham again but i misdoubt themthey hae little skeel o arms  much is not necessary cuddie answered morton they have a strong position and weapons in their hands and are more than three times the number of their assailants if they cannot fight for their freedom now they and theirs deserve to lose it for ever  o sirs exclaimed mause heres a goodly spectacle indeed my spirit is like that of the blessed elihu it burns within memy bowels are as wine which lacketh ventthey are ready to burst like new bottles o that he may look after his ain people in this day of judgment and deliveranceand now what ailest thou precious mr gabriel kettledrummle i say what ailest thou that wert a nazarite purer than snow whiter than milk more ruddy than sulphur meaning perhaps sapphiresi say what ails thee now that thou art blacker than a coal that thy beauty is departed and thy loveliness withered like a dry potsherd surely it is time to be up and be doing to cry loudly and to spare not and to wrestle for the puir lads that are yonder testifying with their ain blude and that of their enemies  this expostulation implied a reproach on mr kettledrummle who though an absolute boanerges or son of thunder in the pulpit when the enemy were afar and indeed sufficiently contumacious as we have seen when in their power had been struck dumb by the firing shouts and shrieks which now arose from the valley andas many an honest man might have been in a situation where he could neither fight nor flywas too much dismayed to take so favourable an opportunity to preach the terrors of presbytery as the courageous mause had expected at his hand or even to pray for the successful event of the battle his presence of mind was not however entirely lost any more than his jealous respect for his reputation as a pure and powerful preacher of the word  hold your peace woman he said and do not perturb my inward meditations and the wrestlings wherewith i wrestlebut of a verity the shooting of the foemen doth begin to increase peradventure some pellet may attain unto us even here lo i will ensconce me behind the cairn as behind a strong wall of defence  hes but a coward body after a said cuddie who was himself by no means deficient in that sort of courage which consists in insensibility to danger hes but a daidling coward body hell never fill rumbleberrys bonnetodd rumbleberry fought and flyted like a fleeing dragon it

yons an awfu sight and yet ane canna keep their een aff frae it  accordingly strong curiosity on the part of morton and cuddie together with the heated enthusiasm of old mause detained them on the spot from which they could best hear and see the issue of the action leaving to kettledrummle to occupy alone his place of security the vicissitudes of combat which we have already described were witnessed by our spectators from the top of the eminence but without their being able positively to determine to what they tended that the presbyterians defended themselves stoutly was evident from the heavy smoke which illumined by frequent flashes of fire now eddied along the valley and hid the contending parties in its sulphureous shade on the other hand the continued firing from the nearer side of the morass indicated that the enemy persevered in their attack that the affair was fiercely disputed and that every thing was to be apprehended from a continued contest in which undisciplined rustics had to repel the assaults of regular troops so completely officered and armed  at length horses whose caparisons showed that they belonged to the lifeguards began to fly masterless out of the confusion dismounted soldiers next appeared forsaking the conflict and straggling over the side of the hill in order to escape from the scene of action as the numbers of these fugitives increased the fate of the day seemed no longer doubtful a large body was then seen emerging from the smoke forming irregularly on the hillside and with difficulty kept stationary by their officers until evandales corps also appeared in full retreat the result of the conflict was then apparent and the joy of the prisoners was corresponding to their approaching deliverance  they hae dune the job for anes said cuddie an they neer dot again  they fleethey flee exclaimed mause in ecstasy o the truculent tyrants they are riding now as they never rode before o the false egyptiansthe proud assyriansthe

the old dame transported to ecstasy by the success of her party fear naething for me i will stand like deborah on the tap o the cairn and tak up my sang o reproach against these men of harosheth of the gentiles whose horsehoofs are broken by their prancing  the enthusiastic old woman would in fact have accomplished her purpose of mounting on the cairn and becoming as she said a sign and a banner to the people had not cuddie with more filial tenderness than respect detained her by such force as his shackled arms would permit him to exert  eh sirs he said having accomplished this task look out

look ower their shouthers very aften as if they liked the road ahint them better than the road afore  cuddie was not mistaken for when the main tide of fugitives passed at a little distance from the spot where they were stationed the corporal and his party fired their carabines at random upon the advancing insurgents and abandoning all charge of their prisoners joined the retreat of their comrades morton and the old woman whose hands were at liberty lost no time in undoing the bonds of cuddie and of the clergyman both of whom had been secured by a cord tied round their arms above the elbows by the time this was accomplished the rearguard of the dragoons which still preserved some order passed beneath the hillock or rising ground which was surmounted by the cairn already repeatedly mentioned they exhibited all the hurry and confusion incident to a forced retreat but still continued in a body claverhouse led the van his naked sword deeply dyed with blood as were his face and clothes his horse was all covered with gore and now reeled with weakness lord evandale in not much better plight brought up the rear still exhorting the soldiers to keep together and fear nothing several of the men were wounded and one or two dropped from their horses as they surmounted the hill  mauses zeal broke forth once more at this spectacle while she stood on the heath with her head uncovered and her grey hairs streaming in the wind no bad representation of a superannuated bacchante or thessalian witch in the agonies of incantation she soon discovered claverhouse at the head of the fugitive party and exclaimed with bitter irony tarry tarry ye wha were aye sae blithe to be at the meetings of the saints and wad ride every muir in scotland to find a conventicle wilt thou not tarry now thou hast found ane wilt thou not stay for one word mair wilt thou na bide the afternoon preachingwae betide ye she said suddenly changing her tone and cut the houghs of the creature whase

winna be lang o oertaking ye ride as fast as ye will  claverhouse it may be easily supposed was too busy to attend to her reproaches but hastened over the hill anxious to get the remnant of his men out of gunshot in hopes of again collecting the fugitives round his standard but as the rear of his followers rode over the ridge a shot struck lord evandales horse which instantly sunk down dead beneath him two of the whig horsemen who were the foremost in the pursuit hastened up with the purpose of killing him for hitherto there had been no quarter given morton on the other hand rushed forward to save his life if possible in order at once to indulge his natural generosity and to requite the obligation which lord evandale had conferred on him that morning and under which circumstances had made him wince so acutely just as he had assisted evandale who was much wounded to extricate himself from his dying horse and to gain his feet the two horsemen came up and one of them exclaiming have at the redcoated tyrant made a blow at the young nobleman which morton parried with difficulty exclaiming to the rider who was no other than burley himself give quarter to this gentleman for my sakefor the sake he added observing that burley did not immediately recognise him of henry morton who so lately sheltered you  henry morton replied burley wiping his bloody brow with his bloodier hand did i not say that the son of silas morton would come forth out of the land of bondage nor be long an indweller in the tents of ham thou art a brand snatched out of the burningbut for this booted apostle of prelacy he shall die the deathwe must smite them hip and thigh even from the rising to the going down of the sun it is our commission to slay them like amalek and utterly destroy all they have and spare neither man nor woman infant nor suckling therefore hinder me not he continued endeavouring again to cut down lord evandale for this work must not be wrought negligently  you must not and you shall not slay him more especially while incapable of defence said morton planting himself before lord evandale so as to intercept any blow that should be aimed at him i owed my life to him this morningmy life which was endangered solely by my having sheltered you and to shed his blood when he can offer no effectual resistance were not only a cruelty abhorrent to god and man but detestable ingratitude both to him and to me  burley pausedthou art yet he said in the court of the gentiles and i compassionate thy human blindness and frailty strong meat is not fit for babes nor the mighty and grinding dispensation under which i draw my sword for those whose hearts are yet dwelling in huts of clay whose footsteps are tangled in the mesh of mortal sympathies and who clothe themselves in the righteousness that is as filthy rags but to gain a soul to the truth is better than to send one to tophet therefore i give quarter to this youth providing the grant is confirmed by the general council of gods army whom he hath this day blessed with so signal a deliverancethou art unarmedabide my return here i must yet pursue these sinners the amalekites and destroy them till they be utterly consumed from the face of the land even from havilah unto shur  so saying he set spurs to his horse and continued to pursue the chase  cuddie said morton for gods sake catch a horse as quickly as you can i will not trust lord evandales life with these obdurate menyou are wounded my lordare you able to continue your retreat he continued addressing himself to his prisoner who halfstunned by the fall was but beginning to recover himself  i think so replied lord evandale but is it possibledo i owe my life to mr morton  my interference would have been the same from common humanity replied morton to your lordship it was a sacred debt of gratitude  cuddie at this instant returned with a horse  godsake muntmunt and ride like a fleeing hawk my lord said the goodnatured fellow for neer be in me if they arena killing every ane o the wounded and prisoners  lord evandale mounted the horse while cuddie officiously held the stirrup  stand off good fellow thy courtesy may cost thy lifemr morton he continued addressing henry this makes us more than evenrely on it i will never forget your generosityfarewell  he turned his horse and rode swiftly away in the direction which seemed least exposed to pursuit  lord evandale had just rode off when several of the insurgents who were in the front of the pursuit came up denouncing vengeance on henry morton and cuddie for having aided the escape of a philistine as they called the young nobleman  what wad ye hae had us to do cried cuddie had we aught to stop a man wi that had twa pistols and a sword sudna ye hae come faster up yoursells instead of flyting at huz  this excuse would hardly have passed current but kettledrummle who now awoke from his trance of terror and was known to and reverenced by most of the wanderers together with mause who possessed their appropriate language as well as the preacher himself proved active and effectual intercessors  touch them not harm them not exclaimed kettledrummle in his very best doublebass tones this is the son of the famous silas morton by whom the lord wrought great things in this land at the breaking forth of the reformation from prelacy when there was a plentiful pouring forth of the word and a renewing of the covenant a hero and champion of those blessed days when there was power and efficacy and convincing and converting of sinners and heartexercises and fellowships of saints and a plentiful flowing forth of the spices of the garden of eden  and this is my son cuddie exclaimed mause in her turn the son of his father judden headrigg wha was a douce honest man and of me mause middlemas an unworthy professor and follower of the pure gospel and ane o your ain folk is it not written cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the kohathites from among the levites numbers fourth and aughteentho sirs dinna be standing here prattling wi honest folk when ye suld be following forth your victory with which providence has blessed ye  this party having passed on they were immediately beset by another to whom it was necessary to give the same explanation kettledrummle whose fear was much dissipated since the firing had ceased again took upon him to be intercessor and grown bold as he felt his good word necessary for the protection of his late fellowcaptives he laid claim to no small share of the merit of the victory appealing to morton and cuddie whether the tide of battle had not turned while he prayed on the mount of jehovahnissi like moses that israel might prevail over amalek but granting them at the same time the credit of holding up his hands when they waxed heavy as those of the prophet were supported by aaron and hur it seems probable that kettledrummle allotted this part in the success to his companions in adversity lest they should be tempted to disclose his carnal selfseeking and falling away in regarding too closely his own personal safety these strong testimonies in favour of the liberated captives quickly flew abroad with many exaggerations among the victorious army the reports on the subject were various but it was universally agreed that young morton of milnwood the son of the stout soldier of the covenant silas morton together with the precious gabriel kettledrummle and a singular devout christian woman whom many thought as good as himself at extracting a doctrine or an use whether of terror or consolation had arrived to support the good old cause with a reinforcement of a hundred wellarmed men from the middle ward       note skirmish at drumclog this affair the only one in which      claverhouse was defeated or the insurgent cameronians successful      was fought pretty much in the manner mentioned in the text the      royalists lost about thirty or forty men the commander of the      presbyterian or rather convenanting party was mr robert hamilton      of the honourable house of preston brother of sir william hamilton      to whose title and estate he afterwards succeeded but according to      his biographer howie of lochgoin he never took possession of      either as he could not do so without acknowledging the right of      king william an uncovenanted monarch to the crown hamilton had      been bred by bishop burnet while the latter lived at glasgow his      brother sir thomas having married a sister of that historian he      was then says the bishop a lively hopeful young man but      getting into that company and into their notions he became a      crackbrained enthusiast       several wellmeaning persons have been much scandalized at the      manner in which the victors are said to have conducted themselves      towards the prisoners at drumclog but the principle of these poor      fanatics i mean the highflying or cameronian party was to      obtain not merely toleration for their church but the same      supremacy which presbytery had acquired in scotland after the treaty      of rippon betwixt charles i and his scottish subjects in 1640       the fact is that they conceived themselves a chosen people sent      forth to extirpate the heathen like the jews of old and under a      similar charge to show no quarter       the historian of the insurrection of bothwell makes the following      explicit avowal of the principles on which their general acted       mr hamilton discovered a great deal of bravery and valour both in      the conflict with and pursuit of the enemy but when he and some      other were pursuing the enemy others flew too greedily upon the      spoil small as it was instead of pursuing the victory and some      without mr hamiltons knowledge and directly contrary to his      express command gave five of those bloody enemies quarter and then      let them go this greatly grieved mr hamilton when he saw some of      babels brats spared after that the lord had delivered them into      their hands that they might dash them against the stones psalm      cxxxvii 9 in his own account of this he reckons the sparing of      these enemies and letting them go to be among their first      steppings aside for which he feared that the lord would not honour      them to do much more for him and says that he was neither for      taking favours from nor giving favours to the lords enemies see      a true and impartial account of the persecuted presbyterians in      scotland their being in arms and defeat at

for somehow or other the      publisher of the last edition has omitted this remarkable part of      the narrative       sir robert hamilton himself felt neither remorse nor shame for      having put to death one of the prisoners after the battle with his      own hand which appears to have been a charge against him by some      whose fanaticism was less exalted than his own       as for that accusation they bring against me of killing that poor      man as they call him at drumclog i may easily guess that my      accusers can be no other but some of the house of saul or shimei or      some such risen again to espouse that poor gentleman saul his      quarrel against honest samuel for his offering to kill that poor      man agag after the kings giving him quarter but i being to      command that day gave out the word that no quarter should be given      and returning from pursuing claverhouse one or two of these fellows      were standing in the midst of a company of our friends and some      were debating for quarter others against it none could blame me to      decide the controversy and i bless the lord for it to this day      there were five more that without my knowledge got quarter who were      brought to me after we were a mile from the place as having got      quarter which i reckoned among the first steppings aside and      seeing that spirit amongst us at that time i then told it to some      that were with me to my best remembrance it was honest old john      nisbet that i feared the lord would not honour us to do much more      for him i shall only say

of those rogues but also ane      intercomend minister called king we had them at strevan about six      in the morning yesterday and resolving to convey them to this i      thought that we might make a little tour to see if we could fall      upon a conventicle which we did little to our advantage for when      we came in sight of them we found them drawn up in batell upon a      most adventageous ground to which there was no coming but through      mosses and lakes they wer not preaching and had got away all there      women and shildring they consisted of four battaillons of foot and      all well armed with fusils and pitchforks and three squadrons of      horse we sent both partys to skirmish they of foot and we of      dragoons they run for it and sent down a battaillon of foot      against them we sent threescore of dragoons who made them run      again shamfully but in end they percaiving that we had the better      of them in skirmish they resolved a generall engadgment and

picked men commanded by the first officer in scotland and one whose very name had long been a terror to them their success seemed even to have upon their spirits the effect of a sudden and violent surprise so much had their taking up arms been a measure of desperation rather than of hope their meeting was also casual and they had hastily arranged themselves under such commanders as were remarkable for zeal and courage without much respect to any other qualities it followed from this state of disorganization that the whole army appeared at once to resolve itself into a general committee for considering what steps were to be taken in consequence of their success and no opinion could be started so wild that it had not some favourers and advocates some proposed they should march to glasgow some to hamilton some to edinburgh some to london some were for sending a deputation of their number to london to convert charles ii to a sense of the error of his ways and others less charitable proposed either to call a new successor to the crown or to declare scotland a free republic a free parliament of the nation and a free assembly of the kirk were the objects of the more sensible and moderate of the party in the meanwhile a clamour arose among the soldiers for bread and other necessaries and while all complained of hardship and hunger none took the necessary measures to procure supplies in short the camp of the covenanters even in the very moment of success seemed about to dissolve like a rope of sand from want of the original principles of combination and union  burley who had now returned from the pursuit found his followers in this distracted state with the ready talent of one accustomed to encounter exigences he proposed that one hundred of the freshest men should be drawn out for dutythat a small number of those who had hitherto acted as leaders should constitute a committee of direction until officers should be regularly chosenand that to crown the victory gabriel kettledrummle should be called upon to improve the providential success which they had obtained by a word in season addressed to the army he reckoned very much and not without reason on this last expedient as a means of engaging the attention of the bulk of the insurgents while he himself and two or three of their leaders held a private council of war undisturbed by the discordant opinions or senseless clamour of the general body  kettledrummle more than answered the expectations of burley two mortal hours did he preach at a breathing and certainly no lungs or doctrine excepting his own could have kept up for so long a time the attention of men in such precarious circumstances but he possessed in perfection a sort of rude and familiar eloquence peculiar to the preachers of that period which though it would have been fastidiously rejected by an audience which possessed any portion of taste was a cake of the right leaven for the palates of those whom he now addressed his text was from the fortyninth chapter of isaiah even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered for i will contend with him that contendeth with thee and i will save thy children  and i will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh and they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine and all flesh shall know that i the lord am thy saviour and thy redeemer the mighty one of jacob  the discourse which he pronounced upon this subject was divided into fifteen heads each of which was garnished with seven uses of application two of consolation two of terror two declaring the causes of backsliding and of wrath and one announcing the promised and expected deliverance the first part of his text he applied to his own deliverance and that of his companions and took occasion to speak a few words in praise of young milnwood of whom as of a champion of the covenant he augured great things the second part he applied to the punishments which were about to fall upon the persecuting government at times he was familiar and colloquial now he was loud energetic and boisteroussome parts of his discourse might be called sublime and others sunk below burlesque occasionally he vindicated with great animation the right of every freeman to worship god according to his own conscience and presently he charged the guilt and misery of the people on the awful negligence of their rulers who had not only failed to establish presbytery as the national religion but had tolerated sectaries of various descriptions papists prelatists erastians assuming the name of presbyterians independents socinians and quakers all of whom kettledrummle proposed by one sweeping act to expel from the land and thus reedify in its integrity the beauty of the sanctuary he next handled very pithily the doctrine of defensive arms and of resistance to charles ii observing that instead of a nursing father to the kirk that monarch had been a nursing father to none but his own bastards he went at some length through the life and conversation of that joyous prince few parts of which it must be owned were qualified to stand the rough handling of so uncourtly an orator who conferred on him the hard names of jeroboam omri ahab shallum pekah and every other evil monarch recorded in the chronicles and concluded with a round application of the scripture tophet is ordained of old yea for the king it is provided he hath made it deep and large the pile thereof is fire and much wood the breath of the lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it  kettledrummle had no sooner ended his sermon and descended from the huge rock which had served him for a pulpit than his post was occupied by a pastor of a very different description the reverend gabriel was advanced in years somewhat corpulent with a loud voice a square face and a set of stupid and unanimated features in which the body seemed more to predominate over the spirit than was seemly in a sound divine the youth who succeeded him in exhorting this extraordinary convocation ephraim macbriar by name was hardly twenty years old yet his thin features already indicated that a constitution naturally hectic was worn out by vigils by fasts by the rigour of imprisonment and the fatigues incident to a fugitive life young as he was he had been twice imprisoned for several months and suffered many severities which gave him great influence with those of his own sect he threw his faded eyes over the multitude and over the scene of battle and a light of triumph arose in his glance his pale yet striking features were coloured with a transient and hectic blush of joy he folded his hands raised his face to heaven and seemed lost in mental prayer and thanksgiving ere he addressed the people when he spoke his faint and broken voice seemed at first inadequate to express his conceptions but the deep silence of the assembly the eagerness with which the ear gathered every word as the famished israelites collected the heavenly manna had a corresponding effect upon the preacher himself his words became more distinct his manner more earnest and energetic it seemed as if religious zeal was triumphing over bodily weakness and infirmity his natural eloquence was not altogether untainted with the coarseness of his sect and yet by the influence of a good natural taste it was freed from the grosser and more ludicrous errors of his contemporaries and the language of scripture which in their mouths was sometimes degraded by misapplication gave in macbriars exhortation a rich and solemn effect like that which is produced by the beams of the sun streaming through the storied representation of saints and martyrs on the gothic window of some ancient cathedral  he painted the desolation of the church during the late period of her distresses in the most affecting colours he described her like hagar watching the waning life of her infant amid the fountainless desert like judah under her palmtree mourning for the devastation of her temple like rachel weeping for her children and refusing comfort but he chiefly rose into rough sublimity when addressing the men yet reeking from battle he called on them to remember the great things which god had done for them and to persevere in the career which their victory had opened  your garments are dyedbut not with the juice of the winepress your swords are filled with blood he exclaimed but not with the blood of goats or lambs the dust of the desert on which ye stand is made fat with gore but not with the blood of bullocks for the lord hath a sacrifice in bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of idumea these were not the firstlings of the flock the small cattle of burntofferings whose bodies lie like dung on the ploughed field of the husbandman this is not the savour of myrrh of frankincense or of sweet herbs that is steaming in your nostrils but these bloody trunks are the carcasses of those who held the bow and the lance who were cruel and would show no mercy whose voice roared like the sea who rode upon horses every man in array as if to battlethey are the carcasses even of the mighty men of war that came against jacob in the day of his deliverance and the smoke is that of the devouring fires that have consumed them and those wild hills that surround you are not a sanctuary planked with cedar and plated with silver nor are ye ministering priests at the altar with censers and with torches but ye hold in your hands the sword and the bow and the weapons of death and yet verily i say unto you that not when the ancient temple was in its first glory was there offered sacrifice more acceptable than that which you have this day presented giving to the slaughter the tyrant and the oppressor with the rocks for your altars and the sky for your vaulted sanctuary and your own good swords for the instruments of sacrifice leave not therefore the plough in the furrowturn not back from the path in which you have entered like the famous worthies of old whom god raised up for the glorifying of his name and the deliverance of his afflicted peoplehalt not in the race you are running lest the latter end should be worse than the beginning wherefore set up a standard in the land blow a trumpet upon the mountains let not the shepherd tarry by his sheepfold or the seedsman continue in the ploughed field but make the watch strong sharpen the arrows burnish the shields name ye the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds of fifties and of tens call the footmen like the rushing of winds and cause the horsemen to come up like the sound of many waters for the passages of the destroyers are stopped their rods are burned and the face of their men of battle hath been turned to flight heaven has been with you and has broken the bow of the mighty then let every mans heart be as the heart of the valiant maccabeus every mans hand as the hand of the mighty sampson every mans sword as that of gideon which turned not back from the slaughter for the banner of reformation is spread abroad on the mountains in its first loveliness and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it  well is he this day that shall barter his house for a helmet and sell his garment for a sword and cast in his lot with the children of the covenant even to the fulfilling of the promise and woe woe unto him who for carnal ends and selfseeking shall withhold himself from the great work for the curse shall abide with him even the bitter curse of meroz because he came not to the help of the lord against the mighty up then and be doing the blood of martyrs reeking upon scaffolds is crying for vengeance the bones of saints which lie whitening in the highways are pleading for retribution the groans of innocent captives from desolate isles of the sea and from the dungeons of the tyrants high places cry for deliverance the prayers of persecuted christians sheltering themselves in dens and deserts from the sword of their persecutors famished with hunger starving with cold lacking fire food shelter and clothing because they serve god rather than manall are with you pleading watching knocking storming the gates of heaven in your behalf heaven itself shall fight for you as the stars in their courses fought against sisera then whoso will deserve immortal fame in this world and eternal happiness in that which is to come let them enter into gods service and take arles at the hand of his servanta blessing namely upon him and his household and his children to the ninth generation even the blessing of the promise for ever and ever amen  the eloquence of the preacher was rewarded by the deep hum of stern approbation which resounded through the armed assemblage at the conclusion of an exhortation so well suited to that which they had done and that which remained for them to do the wounded forgot their pain the faint and hungry their fatigues and privations as they listened to doctrines which elevated them alike above the wants and calamities of the world and identified their cause with that of the deity many crowded around the preacher as he descended from the eminence on which he stood and clasping him with hands on which the gore was not yet hardened pledged their sacred vow that they would play the part of heavens true soldiers exhausted by his own enthusiasm and by the animated fervour which he had exerted in his discourse the preacher could only reply in broken accentsgod bless you my brethrenit is his causestand strongly up and play the menthe worst that can befall us is but a brief and bloody passage to heaven  balfour and the other leaders had not lost the time which was employed in these spiritual exercises watchfires were lighted sentinels were posted and arrangements were made to refresh the army with such provisions as had been hastily collected from the nearest farmhouses and villages the present necessity thus provided for they turned their thoughts to the future they had dispatched parties to spread the news of their victory and to obtain either by force or favour supplies of what they stood most in need of in this they had succeeded beyond their hopes having at one village seized a small magazine of provisions forage and ammunition which had been provided for the royal forces this success not only gave them relief at the time but such hopes for the future that whereas formerly some of their number had begun to slacken in their zeal they now unanimously resolved to abide together in arms and commit themselves and their cause to the event of war  and whatever may be thought of the extravagance or narrowminded bigotry of many of their tenets it is impossible to deny the praise of devoted courage to a few hundred peasants who without leaders without money without magazines without any fixed plan of action and almost without arms borne out only by their innate zeal and a detestation of the oppression of their rulers ventured to declare open war against an established government supported by a regular army and the whole force of three kingdoms      chapter xix                 why then say an old man can do somewhat                                              henry iv part ii  we must now return to the tower of tillietudlem which the march of the lifeguards on the morning of this eventful day had left to silence and anxiety the assurances of lord evandale had not succeeded in quelling the apprehensions of edith she knew him generous and faithful to his word but it seemed too plain that he suspected the object of her intercession to be a successful rival and was it not expecting from him an effort above human nature to suppose that he was to watch over mortons safety and rescue him from all the dangers to which his state of imprisonment and the suspicions which he had incurred must repeatedly expose him she therefore resigned herself to the most heartrending apprehensions without admitting and indeed almost without listening to the multifarious grounds of consolation which jenny dennison brought forward one after another like a skilful general who charges with the several divisions of his troops in regular succession  first jenny was morally positive that young milnwood would come to no harmthen if he did there was consolation in the reflection that lord evandale was the better and more appropriate match of the twothen there was every chance of a battle in which the said lord evandale might be killed and there wad be nae mair fash about that jobthen if the whigs gat the better milnwood and cuddie might come to the castle and carry off the beloved of their hearts by the strong hand  for i forgot to tell ye madam continued the damsel putting her handkerchief to her eyes that puir cuddies in the hands of the philistines as weel as young milnwood and he was brought here a prisoner this morning and i was fain to speak tam halliday fair and fleech him to let me near the puir creature but cuddie wasna sae thankfu as he needed till hae been neither she added and at the same time changed her tone and briskly withdrew the handkerchief from her face so i will neer waste my een wi greeting about the matter there wad be aye enow o young men left if they were to hang the tae half o them  the other inhabitants of the castle were also in a state of dissatisfaction and anxiety lady margaret thought that colonel grahame in commanding an execution at the door of her house and refusing to grant a reprieve at her request had fallen short of the deference due to her rank and had even encroached on her seignorial rights  the colonel she said ought to have remembered brother that the barony of tillietudlem has the baronial privilege of pit and gallows and therefore if the lad was to be executed on my estate which i consider as an unhandsome thing seeing it is in the possession of females to whom such tragedies cannot be acceptable he ought at common law to have been delivered up to my bailie and justified at his sight  martial law sister answered major bellenden supersedes every other but i must own i think colonel grahame rather deficient in attention to you and i am not over and above preeminently flattered by his granting to young evandale i suppose because he is a lord and has interest with the privycouncil a request which he refused to so old a servant of the king as i am but so long as the poor young fellows life is saved i can comfort myself with the fagend of a ditty as old as myself and therewithal he hummed a stanza  and what though winter will pinch severe through locks of grey and a cloak thats old yet keep up thy heart bold cavalier for a cup of sack shall fence the cold  i must be your guest here today sister i wish to hear the issue of this gathering on loudonhill though i cannot conceive their standing a body of horse appointed like our guests this morningwoes me the time has been that i would have liked ill to have sate in biggit was waiting for the news of a skirmish to be fought within ten miles of me but as the old song goes                 for time will rust the brightest blade                and years will break the strongest bow                was ever wight so starkly made                but time and years would overthrow  we are well pleased you will stay brother said lady margaret i will take my old privilege to look after my household whom this collation has thrown into some disorder although it is uncivil to leave you alone  o i hate ceremony as i hate a stumbling horse replied the major besides your person would be with me and your mind with the cold meat and reversionary pastieswhere is edith  gone to her room a little evildisposed i am informed and laid down in her bed for a gliff said her grandmother as soon as she wakes she shall take some drops  pooh pooh shes only sick of the soldiers answered major bellenden shes not accustomed to see one acquaintance led out to be shot and another marching off to actual service with some chance of not finding his way back again she would soon be used to it if the civil war were to break out again  god forbid brother said lady margaret  ay heaven forbid as you sayand in the meantime ill take a hit at tricktrack with harrison  he has ridden out sir said gudyill to try if he can hear any tidings of the battle  dn the battle said the major it puts this family as much out of order as if there had never been such a thing in the country beforeand yet there was such a place as kilsythe john  ay and as tippermuir your honour replied gudyill where i was his honour my late masters rearrank man  and alford john pursued the major where i commanded the horse and innerlochy where i was the great marquiss aiddecamp and auld earn and brig o dee  and philiphaugh your honour said john  umph replied the major the less john we say about that matter the better  however being once fairly embarked on the subject of montroses campaigns the major and john gudyill carried on the war so stoutly as for a considerable time to keep at bay the formidable enemy called time with whom retired veterans during the quiet close of a bustling life usually wage an unceasing hostility  it has been frequently remarked that the tidings of important events fly with a celerity almost beyond the power of credibility and that reports correct in the general point though inaccurate in details precede the certain intelligence as if carried by the birds of the air such rumours anticipate the reality not unlike to the shadows of coming events which occupy the imagination of the highland seer harrison in his ride encountered some such report concerning the event of the battle and turned his horse back to tillietudlem in great dismay he made it his first business to seek out the major and interrupted him in the midst of a prolix account of the siege and storm of dundee with the ejaculation heaven send major that we do not see a siege of tillietudlem before we are many days older  how is that harrisonwhat the devil do you mean exclaimed the astonished veteran  troth sir there is strong and increasing belief that claverse is clean broken some say killed that the soldiers are all dispersed and that the rebels are hastening this way threatening death and devastation to a that will not take the covenant  i will never believe that said the major starting on his feeti will never believe that the lifeguards would retreat before rebelsand yet why need i say that he continued checking himself when i have seen such sights myselfsend out pike and one or two of the servants for intelligence and let all the men in the castle and in the village that can be trusted take up arms this old tower may hold them play a bit if it were but victualled and garrisoned and it commands the pass between the high and low countriesits lucky i chanced to be herego muster men harrisonyou gudyill look what provisions you have or can get brought in and be ready if the news be confirmed to knock down as many bullocks as you have salt forthe well never goes drythere are some oldfashioned guns on the battlements if we had but ammunition we should do well enough  the soldiers left some casks of ammunition at the grange this morning to bide their return said harrison  hasten then said the major and bring it into the castle with every pike sword pistol or gun that is within our reach dont leave so much as a bodkinlucky that i was herei will speak to my sister instantly  lady margaret bellenden was astounded at intelligence so unexpected and so alarming it had seemed to her that the imposing force which had that morning left her walls was sufficient to have routed all the disaffected in scotland if collected in a body and now her first reflection was upon the inadequacy of their own means of resistance to an army strong enough to have defeated claverhouse and such select troops woes me woes me said she what will all that we can do avail us brother what will resistance do but bring sure destruction on the house and on the bairn edith for god knows i thinkna on my ain auld life  come sister said the major you must not be cast down the place is strong the rebels ignorant and illprovided my brothers house shall not be made a den of thieves and rebels while old miles bellenden is in it my hand is weaker than it was but i thank my old grey hairs that i have some knowledge of war yet here comes pike with intelligencewhat news pike another philiphaugh job eh  ay ay said pike composedly a total scatteringi thought this morning little gude would come of their newfangled gate of slinging their carabines  whom did you seewho gave you the news asked the major  o mair than halfadozen dragoon fellows that are a on the spur whilk to get first to hamilton theyll win the race i warrant them win the battle wha like  continue your preparations harrison said the alert veteran get your ammunition in and the cattle killed send down to the boroughtown for what meal you can gather we must not lose an instanthad not edith and you sister better return to charnwood while we have the means of sending you there  no brother said lady margaret looking very pale but speaking with the greatest composure since the auld house is to be held out i will take my chance in it i have fled twice from it in my days and i have aye found it desolate of its bravest and its bonniest when i returned sae that i will een abide now and end my pilgrimage in it  it may on the whole be the safest course both for edith and you said the major for the whigs will rise all the way between this and glasgow and make your travelling there or your dwelling at charnwood very unsafe  so be it then said lady margaret and dear brother as the nearest bloodrelation of my deceased husband i deliver to you by this symbolhere she gave into his hand the venerable goldheaded staff of the deceased earl of torwoodthe keeping and government and seneschalship of my tower of tillietudlem and the appurtenances thereof with full power to kill slay and damage those who shall assail the same as freely as i might do myself and i trust you will so defend it as becomes a house in which his most sacred majesty has not disdained  pshaw sister interrupted the major we have no time to speak about the king and his breakfast just now  and hastily leaving the room he hurried with all the alertness of a young man of twentyfive to examine the state of his garrison and superintend the measures which were necessary for defending the place  the tower of tillietudlem having very thick walls and very narrow windows having also a very strong courtyard wall with flanking turrets on the only accessible side and rising on the other from the very verge of a precipice was fully capable of defence against any thing but a train of heavy artillery  famine or escalade was what the garrison had chiefly to fear for artillery the top of the tower was mounted with some antiquated wallpieces and small cannons which bore the oldfashioned names of culverins sakers demisakers falcons and falconets these the major with the assistance of john gudyill caused to be scaled and loaded and pointed them so as to command the road over the brow of the opposite hill by which the rebels must advance causing at the same time two or three trees to be cut down which would have impeded the effect of the artillery when it should be necessary to use it with the trunks of these trees and other materials he directed barricades to be constructed upon the winding avenue which rose to the tower along the highroad taking care that each should command the other the large gate of the courtyard he barricadoed yet more strongly leaving only a wicket open for the convenience of passage what he had most to apprehend was the slenderness of his garrison for all the efforts of the steward were unable to get more than nine men under arms himself and gudyill included so much more popular was the cause of the insurgents than that of the government major bellenden and his trusty servant pike made the garrison eleven in number of whom onehalf were old men the round dozen might indeed have been made up would lady margaret have consented that goose gibbie should again take up arms but she recoiled from the proposal when moved by gudyill with such abhorrent recollection of the former achievements of that luckless cavalier that she declared she would rather the castle were lost than that he were to be enrolled in the defence of it with eleven men however himself included major bellenden determined to hold out the place to the uttermost  the arrangements for defence were not made without the degree of fracas incidental to such occasions women shrieked cattle bellowed dogs howled men ran to and fro cursing and swearing without intermission the lumbering of the old guns backwards and forwards shook the battlements the court resounded with the hasty gallop of messengers who went and returned upon errands of importance and the din of warlike preparation was mingled with the sound of female laments  such a babel of discord might have awakened the slumbers of the very dead and therefore was not long ere it dispelled the abstracted reveries of edith bellenden she sent out jenny to bring her the cause of the tumult which shook the castle to its very basis but jenny once engaged in the bustling tide found so much to ask and to hear that she forgot the state of anxious uncertainty in which she had left her young mistress having no pigeon to dismiss in pursuit of information when her raven messenger had failed to return with it edith was compelled to venture in quest of it out of the ark of her own chamber into the deluge of confusion which overflowed the rest of the castle six voices speaking at once informed her in reply to her first enquiry that claverse and all his men were killed and that ten thousand whigs were marching to besiege the castle headed by john balfour of burley young milnwood and cuddie headrigg this strange association of persons seemed to infer the falsehood of the whole story and yet the general bustle in the castle intimated that danger was certainly apprehended  where is lady margaret was ediths second question  in her oratory was the reply a cell adjoining to the chapel in which the good old lady was wont to spend the greater part of the days destined by the rules of the episcopal church to devotional observances as also the anniversaries of those on which she had lost her husband and her children and finally those hours in which a deeper and more solemn address to heaven was called for by national or domestic calamity  where then said edith much alarmed is major bellenden  on the battlements of the tower madam pointing the cannon was the reply  to the battlements therefore she made her way impeded by a thousand obstacles and found the old gentleman in the midst of his natural military element commanding rebuking encouraging instructing and exercising all the numerous duties of a good governor  in the name of god what is the matter uncle exclaimed edith  the matter my love answered the major coolly as with spectacles on his nose he examined the position of a gunthe matter whyraise her breech a thought more john gudyillthe matter why claverse is routed my dear and the whigs are coming down upon us in force thats all the matter  gracious powers said edith whose eye at that instant caught a glance of the road which ran up the river and yonder they come  yonder where said the veteran and his eyes taking the same direction he beheld a large body of horsemen coming down the path stand to your guns my lads was the first exclamation well make them pay toll as they pass the heughbut stay stay these are certainly the lifeguards  o no uncle no replied edith see how disorderly they ride and how ill they keep their ranks these cannot be the fine soldiers who left us this morning  ah my dear girl answered the major you do not know the difference between men before a battle and after a defeat but the lifeguards it is for i see the red and blue and the kings colours i am glad they have brought them off however  his opinion was confirmed as the troopers approached nearer and finally halted on the road beneath the tower while their commanding officer leaving them to breathe and refresh their horses hastily rode up the hill  it is claverhouse sure enough said the major i am glad he has escaped but he has lost his famous black horse let lady margaret know john gudyill order some refreshments get oats for the soldiers horses and let us to the hall edith to meet him i surmise we shall hear but indifferent news      chapter xx                      with careless gesture mind unmoved                     on rade he north the plain                     his seem in thrang of fiercest strife                     when winner aye the same                                              hardyknute  colonel grahame of claverhouse met the family assembled in the hall of the tower with the same serenity and the same courtesy which had graced his manners in the morning he had even had the composure to rectify in part the derangement of his dress to wash the signs of battle from his face and hands and did not appear more disordered in his exterior than if returned from a morning ride  i am grieved colonel grahame said the reverend old lady the tears trickling down her face deeply grieved  and i am grieved my dear lady margaret replied claverhouse that this misfortune may render your remaining at tillietudlem dangerous for you especially considering your recent hospitality to the kings troops and your wellknown loyalty and i came here chiefly to request miss bellenden and you to accept my escort if you will not scorn that of a poor runaway to glasgow from whence i will see you safely sent either to edinburgh or to dunbarton castle as you shall think best  i am much obliged to you colonel grahame replied lady margaret but my brother major bellenden has taken on him the responsibility of holding out this house against the rebels and please god they shall never drive margaret bellenden from her ain hearthstane while theres a brave man that says he can defend it  and will major bellenden undertake this said claverhouse hastily a joyful light glancing from his dark eye as he turned it on the veteranyet why should i question it it is of a piece with the rest of his lifebut have you the means major  all but men and provisions with which we are ill supplied answered the major  as for men said claverhouse i will leave you a dozen or twenty fellows who will make good a breach against the devil it will be of the utmost service if you can defend the place but a week and by that time you must surely be relieved  i will make it good for that space colonel replied the major with twentyfive good men and store of ammunition if we should gnaw the soles of our shoes for hunger but i trust we shall get in provisions from the country  and colonel grahame if i might presume a request said lady margaret i would entreat that sergeant francis stewart might command the auxiliaries whom you are so good as to add to the garrison of our people it may serve to legitimate his promotion and i have a prejudice in favour of his noble birth  the sergeants wars are ended madam said grahame in an unaltered tone and he now needs no promotion that an earthly master can give  pardon me said major bellenden taking claverhouse by the arm and turning him away from the ladies but i am anxious for my friends i fear you have other and more important loss i observe another officer carries your nephews standard  you are right major bellenden answered claverhouse firmly my nephew is no more he has died in his duty as became him  great god exclaimed the major how unhappythe handsome gallant highspirited youth  he was indeed all you say answered claverhouse poor richard was to me as an eldest son the apple of my eye and my destined heir but he died in his duty and iimajor bellendenhe wrung the majors hand hard as he spokei live to avenge him  colonel grahame said the affectionate veteran his eyes filling with tears i am glad to see you bear this misfortune with such fortitude  i am not a selfish man replied claverhouse though the world will tell you otherwise i am not selfish either in my hopes or fears my joys or sorrows i have not been severe for myself or grasping for myself or ambitious for myself the service of my master and the good of the country are what i have tried to aim at i may perhaps have driven severity into cruelty but i acted for the best and now i will not yield to my own feelings a deeper sympathy than i have given to those of others  i am astonished at your fortitude under all the unpleasant circumstances of this affair pursued the major  yes replied claverhouse my enemies in the council will lay this misfortune to my chargei despise their accusations they will calumniate me to my sovereigni can repel their charge the public enemy will exult in my flighti shall find a time to show them that they exult too early this youth that has fallen stood betwixt a grasping kinsman and my inheritance for you know that my marriagebed is barren yet peace be with him the country can better spare him than your friend lord evandale who after behaving very gallantly has i fear also fallen  what a fatal day ejaculated the major i heard a report of this but it was again contradicted it was added that the poor young noblemans impetuosity had occasioned the loss of this unhappy field  not so major said grahame let the living officers bear the blame if there be any and let the laurels flourish untarnished on the grave of the fallen i do not however speak of lord evandales death as certain but killed or prisoner i fear he must be yet he was extricated from the tumult the last time we spoke together we were then on the point of leaving the field with a rearguard of scarce twenty men the rest of the regiment were almost dispersed  they have rallied again soon said the major looking from the window on the dragoons who were feeding their horses and refreshing themselves beside the brook  yes answered claverhouse my blackguards had little temptation either to desert or to straggle farther than they were driven by their first panic there is small friendship and scant courtesy between them and the boors of this country every village they pass is likely to rise on them and so the scoundrels are driven back to their colours by a wholesome terror of spits pikestaves hayforks and broomsticksbut now let us talk about your plans and wants and the means of corresponding with you to tell you the truth i doubt being able to make a long stand at glasgow even when i have joined my lord ross for this transient and accidental success of the fanatics will raise the devil through all the western counties  they then discussed major bellendens means of defence and settled a plan of correspondence in case a general insurrection took place as was to be expected claverhouse renewed his offer to escort the ladies to a place of safety but all things considered major bellenden thought they would be in equal safety at tillietudlem  the colonel then took a polite leave of lady margaret and miss bellenden assuring them that though he was reluctantly obliged to leave them for the present in dangerous circumstances yet his earliest means should be turned to the redemption of his character as a good knight and true and that they might speedily rely on hearing from or seeing him  full of doubt and apprehension lady margaret was little able to reply to a speech so much in unison with her usual expressions and feelings but contented herself with bidding claverhouse farewell and thanking him for the succours which he had promised to leave them edith longed to enquire the fate of henry morton but could find no pretext for doing so and could only hope that it had made a subject of some part of the long private communication which her uncle had held with claverhouse on this subject however she was disappointed for the old cavalier was so deeply immersed in the duties of his own office that he had scarce said a single word to claverhouse excepting upon military matters and most probably would have been equally forgetful had the fate of his own son instead of his friends lain in the balance  claverhouse now descended the bank on which the castle is founded in order to put his troops again in motion and major bellenden accompanied him to receive the detachment who were to be left in the tower  i shall leave inglis with you said claverhouse for as i am situated i cannot spare an officer of rank it is all we can do by our joint efforts to keep the men together but should any of our missing officers make their appearance i authorize you to detain them for my fellows can with difficulty be subjected to any other authority  his troops being now drawn up he picked out sixteen men by name and committed them to the command of corporal inglis whom he promoted to the rank of sergeant on the spot  and hark ye gentlemen was his concluding harangue i leave you to defend the house of a lady and under the command of her brother major bellenden a faithful servant to the king you are to behave bravely soberly regularly and obediently and each of you shall be handsomely rewarded on my return to relieve the garrison in case of mutiny cowardice neglect of duty or the slightest excess in the family the provostmarshal and cordyou know i keep my word for good and evil  he touched his hat as he bade them farewell and shook hands cordially with major bellenden  adieu he said my stouthearted old friend good luck be with you and better times to us both  the horsemen whom he commanded had been once more reduced to tolerable order by the exertions of major allan and though shorn of their splendour and with their gilding all besmirched made a much more regular and military appearance on leaving for the second time the tower of tillietudlem than when they returned to it after their rout  major bellenden now left to his own resources sent out several videttes both to obtain supplies of provisions and especially of meal and to get knowledge of the motions of the enemy all the news he could collect on the second subject tended to prove that the insurgents meant to remain on the field of battle for that night but they also had abroad their detachments and advanced guards to collect supplies and great was the doubt and distress of those who received contrary orders in the name of the king and in that of the kirk the one commanding them to send provisions to victual the castle of tillietudlem and the other enjoining them to forward supplies to the camp of the godly professors of true religion now in arms for the cause of covenanted reformation presently pitched at drumclog nigh to loudonhill each summons closed with a denunciation of fire and sword if it was neglected for neither party could confide so far in the loyalty or zeal of those whom they addressed as to hope they would part with their property upon other terms so that the poor people knew not what hand to

peaceful endeavoured like niel blane to make fair weather with both parties those who had more public or party spirit began to take arms on all sides the royalists in the country were not numerous but were respectable from their fortune and influence being chiefly landed proprietors of ancient descent who with their brothers cousins and dependents to the ninth generation as well as their domestic servants formed a sort of militia capable of defending their own peelhouses against detached bodies of the insurgents of resisting their demand of supplies and intercepting those which were sent to the presbyterian camp by others the news that the tower of tillietudlem was to be defended against the insurgents afforded great courage and support to these feudal volunteers who considered it as a stronghold to which they might retreat in case it should become impossible for them to maintain the desultory war they were now about to wage  on the other hand the towns the villages the farmhouses the properties of small heritors sent forth numerous recruits to the presbyterian interest these men had been the principal sufferers during the oppression of the time their minds were fretted soured and driven to desperation by the various exactions and cruelties to which they had been subjected and although by no means united among themselves either concerning the purpose of this formidable insurrection or the means by which that purpose was to be obtained most of them considered it as a door opened by providence to obtain the liberty of conscience of which they had been long deprived and to shake themselves free of a tyranny directed both against body and soul numbers of these men therefore took up arms and in the phrase of their time and party prepared to cast in their lot with the victors of loudonhill      chapter xxi            ananias i do not like the man he is a heathen           and speaks the language of canaan truly            tribulation you must await his calling and the coming           of the good spirit you did ill to upbraid him                                              the alchemist  we return to henry morton whom we left on the field of battle he was eating by one of the watchfires his portion of the provisions which had been distributed to the army and musing deeply on the path which he was next to pursue when burley suddenly came up to him accompanied by the young minister whose exhortation after the victory had produced such a powerful effect  henry morton said balfour abruptly the council of the army of the covenant confiding that the son of silas morton can never prove a lukewarm laodicean or an indifferent gallio in this great day have nominated you to be a captain of their host with the right of a vote in their council and all authority fitting for an officer who is to command christian men  mr balfour replied morton without hesitation i feel this mark of confidence and it is not surprising that a natural sense of the injuries of my country not to mention those i have sustained in my own person should make me sufficiently willing to draw my sword for liberty and freedom of conscience but i will own to you that i must be better satisfied concerning the principles on which you bottom your cause ere i can agree to take a command amongst you  and can you doubt of our principles answered burley since we have stated them to be the reformation both of church and state the rebuilding of the decayed sanctuary the gathering of the dispersed saints and the destruction of the man of sin  i will own frankly mr balfour replied morton much of this sort of language which i observe is so powerful with others is entirely lost on me it is proper you should be aware of this before we commune further together the young clergyman here groaned deeply i distress you sir said morton but perhaps it is because you will not hear me out i revere the scriptures as deeply as you or any christian can do i look into them with humble hope of extracting a rule of conduct and a law of salvation but i expect to find this by an examination of their general tenor and of the spirit which they uniformly breathe and not by wresting particular passages from their context or by the application of scriptural phrases to circumstances and events with which they have often very slender relation  the young divine seemed shocked and thunderstruck with this declaration and was about to remonstrate  hush ephraim said burley remember he is but as a babe in swaddling clotheslisten to me morton i will speak to thee in the worldly language of that carnal reason which is for the present thy blind and imperfect guide what is the object for which thou art content to draw thy sword is it not that the church and state should be reformed by the free voice of a free parliament with such laws as shall hereafter prevent the executive government from spilling the blood torturing and imprisoning the persons exhausting the estates and trampling upon the consciences of men at their own wicked pleasure  most certainly said morton such i esteem legitimate causes of warfare and for such i will fight while i can wield a sword  nay but said macbriar ye handle this matter too tenderly nor will my conscience permit me to fard or daub over the causes of divine wrath  peace ephraim macbriar again interrupted burley  i will not peace said the young man is it not the cause of my master who hath sent me is it not a profane and erastian destroying of his authority usurpation of his power denial of his name to place either king or parliament in his place as the master and governor of his household the adulterous husband of his spouse  you speak well said burley dragging him aside but not wisely your own ears have heard this night in council how this scattered remnant are broken and divided and would ye now make a veil of separation between them would ye build a wall with unslaked mortarif a fox go up it will breach it  i know said the young clergyman in reply that thou art faithful honest and zealous even unto slaying but believe me this worldly craft this temporizing with sin and with infirmity is in itself a falling away and i fear me heaven will not honour us to do much more for his glory when we seek to carnal cunning and to a fleshly arm the sanctified end must be wrought by sanctified means  i tell thee answered balfour thy zeal is too rigid in this matter we cannot yet do without the help of the laodiceans and the erastians we must endure for a space the indulged in the midst of the councilthe sons of zeruiah are yet too strong for us  i tell thee i like it not said macbriar god can work deliverance by a few as well as by a multitude the host of the faithful that was broken upon pentlandhills paid but the fitting penalty of acknowledging the carnal interest of that tyrant and oppressor charles stewart  well then said balfour thou knowest the healing resolution that the council have adoptedto make a comprehending declaration that may suit the tender consciences of all who groan under the yoke of our present oppressors return to the council if thou wilt and get them to recall it and send forth one upon narrower grounds but abide not here to hinder my gaining over this youth whom my soul travails for his name alone will call forth hundreds to our banners  do as thou wilt then said macbriar but i will not assist to mislead the youth nor bring him into jeopardy of life unless upon such grounds as will ensure his eternal reward  the more artful balfour then dismissed the impatient preacher and returned to his proselyte  that we may be enabled to dispense with detailing at length the arguments by which he urged morton to join the insurgents we shall take this opportunity to give a brief sketch of the person by whom they were used and the motives which he had for interesting himself so deeply in the conversion of young morton to his cause  john balfour of kinloch or burley for he is designated both ways in the histories and proclamations of that melancholy period was a gentleman of some fortune and of good family in the county of fife and had been a soldier from his youth upwards in the younger part of his life he had been wild and licentious but had early laid aside open profligacy and embraced the strictest tenets of calvinism unfortunately habits of excess and intemperance were more easily rooted out of his dark saturnine and enterprising spirit than the vices of revenge and ambition which continued notwithstanding his religious professions to exercise no small sway over his mind daring in design precipitate and violent in execution and going to the very extremity of the most rigid recusancy it was his ambition to place himself at the head of the presbyterian interest  to attain this eminence among the whigs he had been active in attending their conventicles and more than once had commanded them when they appeared in arms and beaten off the forces sent to disperse them at length the gratification of his own fierce enthusiasm joined as some say with motives of private revenge placed him at the head of that party who assassinated the primate of scotland as the author of the sufferings of the presbyterians the violent measures adopted by government to revenge this deed not on the perpetrators only but on the whole professors of the religion to which they belonged together with long previous sufferings without any prospect of deliverance except by force of arms occasioned the insurrection which as we have already seen commenced by the defeat of claverhouse in the bloody skirmish of loudonhill  but burley notwithstanding the share he had in the victory was far from finding himself at the summit which his ambition aimed at this was partly owing to the various opinions entertained among the insurgents concerning the murder of archbishop sharpe the more violent among them did indeed approve of this act as a deed of justice executed upon a persecutor of gods church through the immediate inspiration of the deity but the greater part of the presbyterians disowned the deed as a crime highly culpable although they admitted that the archbishops punishment had by no means exceeded his deserts the insurgents differed in another main point which has been already touched upon the more warm and extravagant fanatics condemned as guilty of a pusillanimous abandonment of the rights of the church those preachers and congregations who were contented in any manner to exercise their religion through the permission of the ruling government this they said was absolute erastianism or subjection of the church of god to the regulations of an earthly government and therefore but one degree better than prelacy or poperyagain the more moderate party were content to allow the kings title to the throne and in secular affairs to acknowledge his authority so long as it was exercised with due regard to the liberties of the subject and in conformity to the laws of the realm but the tenets of the wilder sect called from their leader richard cameron by the name of cameronians went the length of disowning the reigning monarch and every one of his successors who should not acknowledge the solemn league and covenant the seeds of disunion were therefore thickly sown in this illfated party and balfour however enthusiastic and however much attached to the most violent of those tenets which we have noticed saw nothing but ruin to the general cause if they were insisted on during this crisis when unity was of so much consequence hence he disapproved as we have seen of the honest downright and ardent zeal of macbriar and was extremely desirous to receive the assistance of the moderate party of presbyterians in the immediate overthrow of the government with the hope of being hereafter able to dictate to them what should be substituted in its place  he was on this account particularly anxious to secure the accession of henry morton to the cause of the insurgents the memory of his father was generally esteemed among the presbyterians and as few persons of any decent quality had joined the insurgents this young mans family and prospects were such as almost ensured his being chosen a leader through mortons means as being the son of his ancient comrade burley conceived he might exercise some influence over the more liberal part of the army and ultimately perhaps ingratiate himself so far with them as to be chosen commanderinchief which was the mark at which his ambition aimed he had therefore without waiting till any other person took up the subject exalted to the council the talents and disposition of morton and easily obtained his elevation to the painful rank of a leader in this disunited and undisciplined army  the arguments by which balfour pressed morton to accept of this dangerous promotion as soon as he had gotten rid of his less wary and uncompromising companion macbriar were sufficiently artful and urgent he did not affect either to deny or to disguise that the sentiments which he himself entertained concerning church government went as far as those of the preacher who had just left them but he argued that when the affairs of the nation were at such a desperate crisis minute difference of opinion should not prevent those who in general wished well to their oppressed country from drawing their swords in its behalf many of the subjects of division as for example that concerning the indulgence itself arose he observed out of circumstances which would cease to exist provided their attempt to free the country should be successful seeing that the presbytery being in that case triumphant would need to make no such compromise with the government and consequently with the abolition of the indulgence all discussion of its legality would be at once ended he insisted much and strongly upon the necessity of taking advantage of this favourable crisis upon the certainty of their being joined by the force of the whole western shires and upon the gross guilt which those would incur who seeing the distress of the country and the increasing tyranny with which it was governed should from fear or indifference withhold their active aid from the good cause  morton wanted not these arguments to induce him to join in any insurrection which might appear to have a feasible prospect of freedom to the country he doubted indeed greatly whether the present attempt was likely to be supported by the strength sufficient to ensure success or by the wisdom and liberality of spirit necessary to make a good use of the advantages that might be gained upon the whole however considering the wrongs he had personally endured and those which he had seen daily inflicted on his fellowsubjects meditating also upon the precarious and dangerous situation in which he already stood with relation to the government he conceived himself in every point of view called upon to join the body of presbyterians already in arms  but while he expressed to burley his acquiescence in the vote which had named him a leader among the insurgents and a member of their council of war it was not without a qualification  i am willing he said to contribute every thing within my limited power to effect the emancipation of my country but do not mistake me i disapprove in the utmost degree of the action in which this rising seems to have originated and no arguments should induce me to join it if it is to be carried on by such measures as that with which it has commenced  burleys blood rushed to his face giving a ruddy and dark glow to his swarthy brow  you mean he said in a voice which he designed should not betray any emotionyou mean the death of james sharpe  frankly answered morton such is my meaning  you imagine then said burley that the almighty in times of difficulty does not raise up instruments to deliver his church from her oppressors you are of opinion that the justice of an execution consists not in the extent of the sufferers crime or in his having merited punishment or in the wholesome and salutary effect which that example is likely to produce upon other evildoers but hold that it rests solely in the robe of the judge the height of the bench and the voice of the doomster is not just punishment justly inflicted whether on the scaffold or the moor and where constituted judges from cowardice or from having cast in their lot with transgressors suffer them not only to pass at liberty through the land but to sit in the high places and dye their garments in the blood of the saints is it not well done in any brave spirits who shall draw their private swords in the public cause  i have no wish to judge this individual action replied morton further than is necessary to make you fully aware of my principles i therefore repeat that the case you have supposed does not satisfy my judgment that the almighty in his mysterious providence may bring a bloody man to an end deservedly bloody does not vindicate those who without authority of any kind take upon themselves to be the instruments of execution and presume to call them the executors of divine vengeance  and were we not so said burley in a tone of fierce enthusiasm were not wewas not every one who owned the interest of the covenanted church of scotland bound by that covenant to cut off the judas who had sold the cause of god for fifty thousand merks ayear had we met him by the way as he came down from london and there smitten him with the edge of the sword we had done but the duty of men faithful to our cause and to our oaths recorded in heaven was not the execution itself a proof of our warrant did not the lord deliver him into our hands when we looked out but for one of his inferior tools of persecution did we not pray to be resolved how we should act and was it not borne in on our hearts as if it had been written on them with the point of a diamond ye shall surely take him and slay himwas not the tragedy full half an hour in acting ere the sacrifice was completed and that in an open heath and within the patrols of their garrisonsand yet who interrupted the great work what dog so much as bayed us during the pursuit the taking the slaying and the dispersing then who will saywho dare say that a mightier arm than ours was not herein revealed  you deceive yourself mr balfour said morton such circumstances of facility of execution and escape have often attended the commission of the most enormous crimesbut it is not mine to judge you i have not forgotten that the way was opened to the former liberation of scotland by an act of violence which no man can justifythe slaughter of cumming by the hand of robert bruce and therefore condemning this action as i do and must i am not unwilling to suppose that you may have motives vindicating it in your own eyes though not in mine or in those of sober reason i only now mention it because i desire you to understand that i join a cause supported by men engaged in open war which it is proposed to carry on according to the rules of civilized nations without in any respect approving of the act of violence which gave immediate rise to it  balfour bit his lip and with difficulty suppressed a violent answer he perceived with disappointment that upon points of principle his young brotherinarms possessed a clearness of judgment and a firmness of mind which afforded but little hope of his being able to exert that degree of influence over him which he had expected to possess after a moments pause however he said with coolness my conduct is open to men and angels the deed was not done in a corner i am here in arms to avow it and care not where or by whom i am called on to do so whether in the council the field of battle the place of execution or the day of the last great trial i will not now discuss it further with one who is yet on the other side of the veil but if you will cast in your lot with us as a brother come with me to the council who are still sitting to arrange the future march of the army and the means of improving our victory  morton arose and followed him in silence not greatly delighted with his associate and better satisfied with the general justice of the cause which he had espoused than either with the measures or the motives of many of those who were embarked in it   illustration abbotsford295        old mortality  by walter scott   illustration titlepage    volume ii   illustration bookcover   illustration spines

hollow of the hill about a quarter of a mile from the field of battle was a shepherds hut a miserable cottage which as the only enclosed spot within a moderate distance the leaders of the presbyterian army had chosen for their councilhouse towards this spot burley guided morton who was surprised as he approached it at the multifarious confusion of sounds which issued from its precincts the calm and anxious gravity which it might be supposed would have presided in councils held on such important subjects and at a period so critical seemed to have given place to discord wild and loud uproar which fell on the ear of their new ally as an evil augury of their future measures as they approached the door they found it open indeed but choked up with the bodies and heads of countrymen who though no members of the council felt no scruple in intruding themselves upon deliberations in which they were so deeply interested by expostulation by threats and even by some degree of violence burley the sternness of whose character maintained a sort of superiority over these disorderly forces compelled the intruders to retire and introducing morton into the cottage secured the door behind them against impertinent curiosity at a less agitating moment the young man might have been entertained with the singular scene of which he now found himself an auditor and a spectator  the precincts of the gloomy and ruinous hut were enlightened partly by some furze which blazed on the hearth the smoke whereof having no legal vent eddied around and formed over the heads of the assembled council a clouded canopy as opake as their metaphysical theology through which like stars through mist were dimly seen to twinkle a few blinking candles or rather rushes dipped in tallow the property of the poor owner of the cottage which were stuck to the walls by patches of wet clay this broken and dusky light showed many a countenance elated with spiritual pride or rendered dark by fierce enthusiasm and some whose anxious wandering and uncertain looks showed they felt themselves rashly embarked in a cause which they had neither courage nor conduct to bring to a good issue yet knew not how to abandon for very shame they were indeed a doubtful and disunited body the most active of their number were those concerned with burley in the death of the primate four or five of whom had found their way to loudonhill together with other men of the same relentless and uncompromising zeal who had in various ways given desperate and unpardonable offence to the government  with them were mingled their preachers men who had spurned at the indulgence offered by government and preferred assembling their flocks in the wilderness to worshipping in temples built by human hands if their doing the latter should be construed to admit any right on the part of their rulers to interfere with the supremacy of the kirk the other class of counsellors were such gentlemen of small fortune and substantial farmers as a sense of intolerable oppression had induced to take arms and join the insurgents these also had their clergymen with them and such divines having many of them taken advantage of the indulgence were prepared to resist the measures of their more violent brethren who proposed a declaration in which they should give testimony against the warrants and instructions for indulgence as sinful and unlawful acts this delicate question had been passed over in silence in the first draught of the manifestos which they intended to publish of the reasons of their gathering in arms but it had been stirred anew during balfours absence and to his great vexation he now found that both parties had opened upon it in full cry macbriar kettledrummle and other teachers of the wanderers being at the very springtide of polemical discussion with peter poundtext the indulged pastor of milnwoods parish who it seems had een girded himself with a broadsword but ere he was called upon to fight for the good cause of presbytery in the field was manfully defending his own dogmata in the council it was the din of this conflict maintained chiefly between poundtext and kettledrummle together with the clamour of their adherents which had saluted mortons ears upon approaching the cottage indeed as both the divines were men well gifted with words and lungs and each fierce ardent and intolerant in defence of his own doctrine prompt in the recollection of texts wherewith they battered each other without mercy and deeply impressed with the importance of the subject of discussion the noise of the debate betwixt them fell little short of that which might have attended an actual bodily conflict  burley scandalized at the disunion implied in this virulent strife of tongues interposed between the disputants and by some general remarks on the unseasonableness of discord a soothing address to the vanity of each party and the exertion of the authority which his services in that days victory entitled him to assume at length succeeded in prevailing upon them to adjourn farther discussion of the controversy but although kettledrummle and poundtext were thus for the time silenced they continued to eye each other like two dogs who having been separated by the authority of their masters while fighting have retreated each beneath the chair of his owner still watching each others motions and indicating by occasional growls by the erected bristles of the back and ears and by the red glance of the eye that their discord is unappeased and that they only wait the first opportunity afforded by any general movement or commotion in the company to fly once more at each others throats  balfour took advantage of the momentary pause to present to the council mr henry morton of milnwood as one touched with a sense of the evils of the times and willing to peril goods and life in the precious cause for which his father the renowned silas morton had given in his time a soulstirring testimony morton was instantly received with the right hand of fellowship by his ancient pastor poundtext and by those among the insurgents who supported the more moderate principles the others muttered something about erastianism and reminded each other in whispers that silas morton once a stout and worthy servant of the covenant had been a backslider in the day when the resolutioners had led the way in owning the authority of charles stewart thereby making a gap whereat the present tyrant was afterwards brought in to the oppression both of kirk and country they added however that on this great day of calling they would not refuse society with any who should put hand to the plough and so morton was installed in his office of leader and counsellor if not with the full approbation of his colleagues at least without any formal or avowed dissent they proceeded on burleys motion to divide among themselves the command of the men who had assembled and whose numbers were daily increasing in this partition the insurgents of poundtexts parish and congregation were naturally placed under the command of morton an arrangement mutually agreeable to both parties as he was recommended to their confidence as well by his personal qualities as his having been born among them  when this task was accomplished it became necessary to determine what use was to be made of their victory mortons heart throbbed high when he heard the tower of tillietudlem named as one of the most important positions to be seized upon it commanded as we have often noticed the pass between the more wild and the more fertile country and must furnish it was plausibly urged a stronghold and place of rendezvous to the cavaliers and malignants of the district supposing the insurgents were to march onward and leave it uninvested this measure was particularly urged as necessary by poundtext and those of his immediate followers whose habitations and families might be exposed to great severities if this strong place were permitted to remain in possession of the royalists  i opine said poundtextfor like the other divines of the period he had no hesitation in offering his advice upon military matters of which he was profoundly ignoranti opine that we should take in and raze that stronghold of the woman lady margaret bellenden even though we should build a fort and raise a mount against it for the race is a rebellious and a bloody race and their hand has been heavy on the children of the covenant both in the former and the latter times their hook hath been in our noses and their bridle betwixt our jaws  what are their means and men of defence said burley the place is strong but i cannot conceive that two women can make it good against a host  there is also said poundtext harrison the steward and john gudyill even the ladys chief butler who boasteth himself a man of war from his youth upward and who spread the banner against the good cause with that man of belial james grahame of montrose  pshaw returned burley scornfully a butler  also there is that ancient malignant replied poundtext miles bellenden of charnwood whose hands have been dipped in the blood of the saints  if that said burley be miles bellenden the brother of sir arthur he is one whose sword will not turn back from battle but he must now be stricken in years  there was word in the country as i rode along said another of the council that so soon as they heard of the victory which has been given to us they caused shut the gates of the tower and called in men and collected ammunition they were ever a fierce and a malignant house  we will not with my consent said burley engage in a siege which may consume time we must rush forward and follow our advantage by occupying glasgow for i do not fear that the troops we have this day beaten even with the assistance of my lord rosss regiment will judge it safe to await our coming  howbeit said poundtext we may display a banner before the tower and blow a trumpet and summon them to come forth it may be that they will give over the place into our mercy though they be a rebellious people and we will summon the women to come forth of their stronghold that is lady margaret bellenden and her granddaughter and jenny dennison which is a girl of an ensnaring eye and the other maids and we will give them a safe conduct and send them in peace to the city even to the town of edinburgh but john gudyill and hugh harrison and miles bellenden we will restrain with fetters of iron even as they in times bypast have done to the martyred saints  who talks of safe conduct and of peace said a shrill broken and overstrained voice from the crowd  peace brother habakkuk said macbriar in a soothing tone to the speaker  i will not hold my peace reiterated the strange and unnatural voice is this a time to speak of peace when the earth quakes and the mountains are rent and the rivers are changed into blood and the twoedged sword is drawn from the sheath to drink gore as if it were water and devour flesh as the fire devours dry stubble  while he spoke thus the orator struggled forward to the inner part of the circle and presented to mortons wondering eyes a figure worthy of such a voice and such language the rags of a dress which had once been black added to the tattered fragments of a shepherds plaid composed a covering scarce fit for the purposes of decency much less for those of warmth or comfort a long beard as white as snow hung down on his breast and mingled with bushy uncombed grizzled hair which hung in elflocks around his wild and staring visage the features seemed to be extenuated by penury and famine until they hardly retained the likeness of a human aspect the eyes grey wild and wandering evidently betokened a bewildered imagination he held in his hand a rusty sword clotted with blood as were his long lean hands which were garnished at the extremity with nails like eagles claws  in the name of heaven who is he said morton in a whisper to poundtext surprised shocked and even startled at this ghastly apparition which looked more like the resurrection of some cannibal priest or druid red from his human sacrifice than like an earthly mortal  it is habakkuk mucklewrath answered poundtext in the same tone whom the enemy have long detained in captivity in forts and castles until his understanding hath departed from him and as i fear an evil demon hath possessed him nevertheless our violent brethren will have it that he speaketh of the spirit and that they fructify by his pouring forth  here he was interrupted by mucklewrath who cried in a voice that made the very beams of the roof quiverwho talks of peace and safe conduct who speaks of mercy to the bloody house of the malignants i say take the infants and dash them against the stones take the daughters and the mothers of the house and hurl them from the battlements of their trust that the dogs may fatten on their blood as they did on that of jezabel the spouse of ahab and that their carcasses may be dung to the face of the field even in the portion of their fathers  he speaks right said more than one sullen voice from behind we will be honoured with little service in the great cause if we already make fair weather with heavens enemies  this is utter abomination and daring impiety said morton unable to contain his indignation  what blessing can you expect in a cause in which you listen to the mingled ravings of madness and atrocity  hush young man said kettledrummle and reserve thy censure for that for which thou canst render a reason it is not for thee to judge into what vessels the spirit may be poured  we judge of the tree by the fruit said poundtext and allow not that to be of divine inspiration that contradicts the divine laws  you forget brother poundtext said macbriar that these are the latter days when signs and wonders shall be multiplied  poundtext stood forward to reply but ere he could articulate a word the insane preacher broke in with a scream that drowned all competition  who talks of signs and wonders am not i habakkuk mucklewrath whose name is changed to magormissabib because i am made a terror unto myself and unto all that are around mei heard itwhen did i hear itwas it not in the tower of the bass that overhangeth the wide wild seaand it howled in the winds and it roared in the billows and it screamed and it whistled and it clanged with the screams and the clang and the whistle of the seabirds as they floated and flew and dropped and dived on the bosom of the waters i saw itwhere did i see itwas it not from the high peaks of dunbarton when i looked westward upon the fertile land and northward on the wild highland hills when the clouds gathered and the tempest came and the lightnings of heaven flashed in sheets as wide as the banners of an hostwhat did i seedead corpses and wounded horses the rushing together of battle and garments rolled in bloodwhat heard ithe voice that cried slay slaysmiteslay utterlylet not your eye have pity slay utterly old and young the maiden the child and the woman whose head is greydefile the house and fill the courts with the slain  we receive the command exclaimed more than one of the company six days he hath not spoken nor broken bread and now his tongue is unloosedwe receive the command as he hath said so will we do  astonished disgusted and horrorstruck at what he had seen and heard morton turned away from the circle and left the cottage he was followed by burley who had his eye on his motions  whither are you going said the latter taking him by the arm  any wherei care not whither but here i will abide no longer  art thou so soon weary young man answered burley thy hand is but now put to the plough and wouldst thou already abandon it is this thy adherence to the cause of thy father  no cause replied morton indignantlyno cause can prosper so conducted one party declares for the ravings of a bloodthirsty madman another leader is an old scholastic pedant a thirdhe stopped and his companion continued the sentenceis a desperate homicide thou wouldst say like john balfour of burleyi can bear thy misconstruction without resentment thou dost not consider that it is not men of sober and selfseeking minds who arise in these days of wrath to execute judgment and to accomplish deliverance hadst thou but seen the armies of england during her parliament of 1640 whose ranks were filled with sectaries and enthusiasts wilder than the anabaptists of munster thou wouldst have had more cause to marvel and yet these men were unconquered on the field and their hands wrought marvellous things for the liberties of the land  but their affairs replied morton were wisely conducted and the violence of their zeal expended itself in their exhortations and sermons without bringing divisions into their counsels or cruelty into their conduct i have often heard my father say so and protest that he wondered at nothing so much as the contrast between the extravagance of their religious tenets and the wisdom and moderation with which they conducted their civil and military affairs but our councils seem all one wild chaos of confusion  thou must have patience henry morton answered balfour thou must not leave the cause of thy religion and country either for one wild word or one extravagant action hear me i have already persuaded the wiser of our friends that the counsellors are too numerous and that we cannot expect that the midianites shall by so large a number be delivered into our hands they have hearkened to my voice and our assemblies will be shortly reduced within such a number as can consult and act together and in them thou shalt have a free voice as well as in ordering our affairs of war and protecting those to whom mercy should be shownart thou now satisfied  it will give me pleasure doubtless answered morton to be the means of softening the horrors of civil war and i will not leave the post i have taken unless i see measures adopted at which my conscience revolts but to no bloody executions after quarter asked or slaughter without trial will i lend countenance or sanction and you may depend on my opposing them with both heart and hand as constantly and resolutely if attempted by our own followers as when they are the work of the enemy  balfour waved his hand impatiently  thou wilt find he said that the stubborn and hardhearted generation with whom we deal must be chastised with scorpions ere their hearts be humbled and ere they accept the punishment of their iniquity the word is gone forth against them i will bring a sword upon you that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant but what is done shall be done gravely and with discretion like that of the worthy james melvin who executed judgment on the tyrant and oppressor cardinal beaton  i own to you replied morton that i feel still more abhorrent at coldblooded and premeditated cruelty than at that which is practised in the heat of zeal and resentment  thou art yet but a youth replied balfour and hast not learned how light in the balance are a few drops of blood in comparison to the weight and importance of this great national testimony but be not afraid thyself shall vote and judge in these matters it may be we shall see little cause to strive together anent them  with this concession morton was compelled to be satisfied for the present and burley left him advising him to lie down and get some rest as the host would probably move in the morning  and you answered morton do not you go to rest also  no said burley my eyes must not yet know slumber this is no work to be done lightly i have yet to perfect the choosing of the committee of leaders and i will call you by times in the morning to be present at their consultation  he turned away and left morton to his repose  the place in which he found himself was not ill adapted for the purpose being a sheltered nook beneath a large rock well protected from the prevailing wind a quantity of moss with which the ground was overspread made a couch soft enough for one who had suffered so much hardship and anxiety morton wrapped himself in the horsemans cloak which he had still retained stretched himself on the ground and had not long indulged in melancholy reflections on the state of the country and upon his own condition ere he was relieved from them by deep and sound slumber  the rest of the army slept on the ground dispersed in groups which chose their beds on the fields as they could best find shelter and convenience a few of the principal leaders held wakeful conference with burley on the state of their affairs and some watchmen were appointed who kept themselves on the alert by chanting psalms or listening to the exercises of the more gifted of their number      chapter ii                 got with much easenow merrily to horse                                              henry iv part i  with the first peep of day henry awoke and found the faithful cuddie standing beside him with a portmanteau in his hand  i hae been just putting your honours things in readiness again

lord evandales braw claes sergeant bothwells will serve me weel eneugh  not being able to prevail on the selfconstituted and disinterested follower to accept of any thing for himself out of these warlike spoils morton resolved to take the first opportunity of returning lord evandales property supposing him yet to be alive and in the meanwhile did not hesitate to avail himself of cuddies prize so far as to appropriate some changes of linen and other triffling articles amongst those of more value which the portmanteau contained  he then hastily looked over the papers which were found in bothwells pocketbook these were of a miscellaneous description the roll of his troop with the names of those absent on furlough memorandums of tavernbills and lists of delinquents who might be made subjects of fine and persecution first presented themselves along with a copy of a warrant from the privy council to arrest certain persons of distinction therein named in another pocket of the book were one or two commissions which bothwell had held at different times and certificates of his services abroad in which his courage and military talents were highly praised but the most remarkable paper was an accurate account of his genealogy with reference to many documents for establishment of its authenticity subjoined was a list of the ample possessions of the forfeited earls of bothwell and a particular account of the proportions in which king james vi had bestowed them on the courtiers and nobility by whose descendants they were at present actually possessed beneath this list was written in red letters in the hand of the deceased haud immemor f s e b the initials probably intimating francis stewart earl of bothwell to these documents which strongly painted the character and feelings of their deceased proprietor were added some which showed him in a light greatly different from that in which we have hitherto presented him to the reader  in a secret pocket of the book which morton did not discover without some trouble were one or two letters written in a beautiful female hand they were dated about twenty years back bore no address and were subscribed only by initials without having time to peruse them accurately morton perceived that they contained the elegant yet fond expressions of female affection directed towards an object whose jealousy they endeavoured to soothe and of whose hasty suspicious and impatient temper the writer seemed gently to complain the ink of these manuscripts had faded by time and notwithstanding the great care which had obviously been taken for their preservation they were in one or two places chafed so as to be illegible  it matters not these words were written on the envelope of that which had suffered most i have them by heart  with these letters was a lock of hair wrapped in a copy of verses written obviously with a feeling which atoned in mortons opinion for the roughness of the poetry and the conceits with which it abounded according to the taste of the period  thy hue dear pledge is pure and bright as in that wellrememberd night when first thy mystic braid was wove and first my agnes whisperd love since then how often hast thou pressd the torrid zone of this wild breast whose wrath and hate have sworn to dwell with the first sin which peopled hell a breast whose bloods a troubled ocean each throb the earthquakes wild commotiono if such clime thou canst endure yet keep thy hue unstaind and pure what conquest oer each erring thought of that fierce realm had agnes wrought i had not wanderd wild and wide with such an angel for my guide nor heaven nor earth could then reprove me if she had lived and lived to love me not then this worlds wild joys had been to me one savage huntingscene my sole delight the headlong race and frantic hurry of the chase to start pursue and bring to bay rush in drag down and rend my prey then from the carcass turn away mine ireful mood had sweetness tamed and soothed each wound which pride inflamedyes god and man might now approve me if thou hadst lived and lived to love me  as he finished reading these lines morton could not forbear reflecting with compassion on the fate of this singular and most unhappy being who it appeared while in the lowest state of degradation and almost of contempt had his recollections continually fixed on the high station to which his birth seemed to entitle him and while plunged in gross licentiousness was in secret looking back with bitter remorse to the period of his youth during which he had nourished a virtuous though unfortunate attachment  alas what are we said morton that our best and most praiseworthy feelings can be thus debased and depravedthat honourable pride can sink into haughty and desperate indifference for general opinion and the sorrow of blighted affection inhabit the same bosom which license revenge and rapine have chosen for their citadel but it is the same throughout the liberal principles of one man sink into cold and unfeeling indifference the religious zeal of another hurries him into frantic and savage enthusiasm our resolutions our passions are like the waves of the sea and without the aid of him who formed the human breast we cannot say to its tides thus far shall ye come and no farther  while he thus moralized he raised his eyes and observed that burley stood before him  already awake said that leaderit is well and shows zeal to tread the path before youwhat papers are these he continued  morton gave him some brief account of cuddies successful marauding party and handed him the pocketbook of bothwell with its contents the cameronian leader looked with some attention on such of the papers as related to military affairs or public business but when he came to the verses he threw them from him with contempt  i little thought he said when by the blessing of god i passed my sword three times through the body of that arch tool of cruelty and persecution that a character so desperate and so dangerous could have stooped to an art as trifling as it is profane but i see that satan can blend the most different qualities in his wellbeloved and chosen agents and that the same hand which can wield a club or a slaughterweapon against the godly in the valley of destruction can touch a tinkling lute or a gittern to soothe the ears of the dancing daughters of perdition in their vanity fair  your ideas of duty then said morton exclude love of the fine arts which have been supposed in general to purify and to elevate the mind  to me young man answered burley and to those who think as i do the pleasures of this world under whatever name disguised are vanity as its grandeur and power are a snare we have but one object on earth and that is to build up the temple of the lord  i have heard my father observe replied morton that many who assumed power in the name of heaven were as severe in its exercise and as unwilling to part with it as if they had been solely moved by the motives of worldly ambitionbut of this another time have you succeeded in obtaining a committee of the council to be nominated  i have answered burley the number is limited to six of which you are one and i come to call you to their deliberations  morton accompanied him to a sequestered grassplot where their colleagues awaited them in this delegation of authority the two principal factions which divided the tumultuary army had each taken care to send three of their own number on the part of the cameronians were burley macbriar and kettledrummle and on that of the moderate party poundtext henry morton and a small proprietor called the laird of langcale thus the two parties were equally balanced by their representatives in the committee of management although it seemed likely that those of the most violent opinions were as is usual in such cases to possess and exert the greater degree of energy their debate however was conducted more like men of this world than could have been expected from their conduct on the preceding evening after maturely considering their means and situation and the probable increase of their numbers they agreed that they would keep their position for that day in order to refresh their men and give time to reinforcements to join them and that on the next morning they would direct their march towards tillietudlem and summon that stronghold as they expressed it of malignancy if it was not surrendered to their summons they resolved to try the effect of a brisk assault and should that miscarry it was settled that they should leave a part of their number to blockade the place and reduce it if possible by famine while their main body should march forward to drive claverhouse and lord ross from the town of glasgow such was the determination of the council of management and thus mortons first enterprise in active life was likely to be the attack of a castle belonging to the parent of his mistress and defended by her relative major bellenden to whom he personally owed many obligations he felt fully the embarrassment of his situation yet consoled himself with the reflection that his newlyacquired power in the insurgent army would give him at all events the means of extending to the inmates of tillietudlem a protection which no other circumstance could have afforded them and he was not without hope that he might be able to mediate such an accommodation betwixt them and the presbyterian army as should secure them a safe neutrality during the war which was about to ensue      chapter iii                 there came a knight from the field of slain                his steed was drenchd in blood and rain                                              finlay  we must now return to the fortress of tillietudlem and its inhabitants the morning being the first after the battle of loudonhill had dawned upon its battlements and the defenders had already resumed the labours by which they proposed to render the place tenable when the watchman who was placed in a high turret called the warders tower gave the signal that a horseman was approaching as he came nearer his dress indicated an officer of the lifeguards and the slowness of his horses pace as well as the manner in which the rider stooped on the saddlebow plainly showed that he was sick or wounded the wicket was instantly opened to receive him and lord evandale rode into the courtyard so reduced by loss of blood that he was unable to dismount without assistance as he entered the hall leaning upon a servant the ladies shrieked with surprise and terror for pale as death stained with blood his regimentals soiled and torn and his hair matted and disordered he resembled rather a spectre than a human being but their next exclamation was that of joy at his escape  thank god exclaimed lady margaret that you are here and have escaped the hands of the bloodthirsty murderers who have cut off so many of the kings loyal servants  thank god added edith that you are here and in safety we have dreaded the worst but you are wounded and i fear we have little the means of assisting you  my wounds are only swordcuts answered the young nobleman as he reposed himself on a seat the pain is not worth mentioning and i should not even feel exhausted but for the loss of blood but it was not my purpose to bring my weakness to add to your danger and distress but to relieve them if possible what can i do for youpermit me he added addressing lady margaretpermit me to think and act as your son my dear madamas your brother edith  he pronounced the last part of the sentence with some emphasis as if he feared that the apprehension of his pretensions as a suitor might render his proffered services unacceptable to miss bellenden she was not insensible to his delicacy but there was no time for exchange of sentiments  we are preparing for our defence said the old lady with great dignity my brother has taken charge of our garrison and by the grace of god we will give the rebels such a reception as they deserve  how gladly said evandale would i share in the defence of the castle but in my present state i should be but a burden to you nay something worse for the knowledge that an officer of the lifeguards was in the castle would be sufficient to make these rogues more desperately earnest to possess themselves of it if they find it defended only by the family they may possibly march on to glasgow rather than hazard an assault  and can you think so meanly of us my lord said edith with the generous burst of feeling which woman so often evinces and which becomes her so well her voice faltering through eagerness and her brow colouring with the noble warmth which dictated her languagecan you think so meanly of your friends as that they would permit such considerations to interfere with their sheltering and protecting you at a moment when you are unable to defend yourself and when the whole country is filled with the enemy is there a cottage in scotland whose owners would permit a valued friend to leave it in such circumstances and can you think we will allow you to go from a castle which we hold to be strong enough for our own defence  lord evandale need never think of it said lady margaret i will dress his wounds myself it is all an old wife is fit for in war time but to quit the castle of tillietudlem when the sword of the enemy is drawn to slay himthe meanest trooper that ever wore the kings coat on his back should not do so much less my young lord evandaleours is not a house that ought to brook such dishonour the tower of tillietudlem has been too much distinguished by the visit of his most sacred  here she was interrupted by the entrance of the major  we have taken a prisoner my dear uncle said editha wounded prisoner and he wants to escape from us you must help us to keep him by force  lord evandale exclaimed the veteran i am as much pleased as when i got my first commission claverhouse reported you were killed or missing at least  i should have been slain but for a friend of yours said lord evandale speaking with some emotion and bending his eyes on the ground as if he wished to avoid seeing the impression that what he was about to say would make upon miss bellenden i was unhorsed and defenceless and the sword raised to dispatch me when young mr morton the prisoner for whom you interested yourself yesterday morning interposed in the most generous manner preserved my life and furnished me with the means of escaping  as he ended the sentence a painful curiosity overcame his first resolution he raised his eyes to ediths face and imagined he could read in the glow of her cheek and the sparkle of her eye joy at hearing of her lovers safety and freedom and triumph at his not having been left last in the race of generosity such indeed were her feelings but they were also mingled with admiration of the ready frankness with which lord evandale had hastened to bear witness to the merit of a favoured rival and to acknowledge an obligation which in all probability he would rather have owed to any other individual in the world  major bellenden who would never have observed the emotions of either party even had they been much more markedly expressed contented himself with saying since henry morton has influence with these rascals i am glad he has so exerted it but i hope he will get clear of them as soon as he can indeed i cannot doubt it i know his principles and that he detests their cant and hypocrisy i have heard him laugh a thousand times at the pedantry of that old presbyterian scoundrel poundtext who after enjoying the indulgence of the government for so many years has now upon the very first ruffle shown himself in his own proper colours and set off with three parts of his cropeared congregation to join the host of the fanaticsbut how did you escape after leaving the field my lord  i rode for my life as a recreant knight must answered lord evandale smiling i took the route where i thought i had least chance of meeting with any of the enemy and i found shelter for several hoursyou will hardly guess where  at castle bracklan perhaps said lady margaret or in the house of some other loyal gentleman  no madam i was repulsed under one mean pretext or another from more than one house of that description for fear of the enemy following my traces but i found refuge in the cottage of a poor widow whose husband had been shot within these three months by a party of our corps and whose two sons are at this very moment with the insurgents  indeed said lady margaret bellenden and was a fanatic woman capable of such generositybut she disapproved i suppose of the tenets of her family  far from it madam continued the young nobleman she was in principle a rigid recusant but she saw my danger and distress considered me as a fellowcreature and forgot that i was a cavalier and a soldier she bound my wounds and permitted me to rest upon her bed concealed me from a party of the insurgents who were seeking for stragglers supplied me with food and did not suffer me to leave my place of refuge until she had learned that i had every chance of getting to this tower without danger  it was nobly done said miss bellenden and i trust you will have an opportunity of rewarding her generosity  i am running up an arrear of obligation on all sides miss bellenden during these unfortunate occurrences replied lord evandale but when i can attain the means of showing my gratitude the will shall not be wanting  all now joined in pressing lord evandale to relinquish his intention of leaving the castle but the argument of major bellenden proved the most effectual  your presence in the castle will be most useful if not absolutely necessary my lord in order to maintain by your authority proper discipline among the fellows whom claverhouse has left in garrison here and who do not prove to be of the most orderly description of inmates and indeed we have the colonels authority for that very purpose to detain any officer of his regiment who might pass this way  that said lord evandale is an unanswerable argument since it shows me that my residence here may be useful even in my present disabled state  for your wounds my lord said the major if my sister lady bellenden will undertake to give battle to any feverish symptom if such should appear i will answer that my old campaigner gideon pike shall dress a fleshwound with any of the incorporation of barbersurgeons he had enough of practice in montroses time for we had few regularlybred army chirurgeons as you may well supposeyou agree to stay with us then  my reasons for leaving the castle said lord evandale glancing a look towards edith though they evidently seemed weighty must needs give way to those which infer the power of serving you may i presume major to enquire into the means and plan of defence which you have prepared or can i attend you to examine the works  it did not escape miss bellenden that lord evandale seemed much exhausted both in body and mind i think sir she said addressing the major that since lord evandale condescends to become an officer of our garrison you should begin by rendering him amenable to your authority and ordering him to his apartment that he may take some refreshment ere he enters on military discussions  edith is right said the old lady you must go instantly to bed my lord and take some febrifuge which i will prepare with my own hand and my ladyinwaiting mistress martha weddell shall make some friars chicken or something very light i would not advise winejohn gudyill let the housekeeper make ready the chamber of dais lord evandale must lie down instantly pike will take off the dressings and examine the state of the wounds  these are melancholy preparations madam said lord evandale as he returned thanks to lady margaret and was about to leave the hallbut i must submit to your ladyships directions and i trust that your skill will soon make me a more able defender of your castle than i am at present you must render my body serviceable as soon as you can for you have no use for my head while you have major bellenden  with these words he left the apartment  an excellent young man and a modest said the major  none of that conceit said lady margaret that often makes young folk suppose they know better how their complaints should be treated than people that have had experience  and so generous and handsome a young nobleman said jenny dennison who had entered during the latter part of this conversation and was now left alone with her mistress in the hall the major returning to his military cares and lady margaret to her medical preparations  edith only answered these encomiums with a sigh but although silent she felt and knew better than any one how much they were merited by the person on whom they were bestowed jenny however failed not to follow up her blow  after a its true that my lady saystheres nae trusting a presbyterian they are a faithless mansworn louns whae wad hae thought that young milnwood and cuddie headrigg wad hae taen on wi thae rebel blackguards  what do you mean by such improbable nonsense jenny said her young mistress very much displeased  i ken its no pleasing for you to hear madam answered jenny hardily and its as little pleasant for me to tell but as gude ye suld ken a about it sune as syne for the haill castles ringing wit  ringing with what jenny have you a mind to drive me mad answered edith impatiently  just that henry morton of milnwood is out wi the rebels and ane o their chief leaders  it is a falsehood said editha most base calumny and you are very bold to dare to repeat it to me henry morton is incapable of such treachery to his king and countrysuch cruelty to metoto all the innocent and defenceless victims i mean who must suffer in a civil wari tell you he is utterly incapable of it in every sense  dear dear miss edith replied jenny still constant to her text they maun be better acquainted wi young men than i am or ever wish to be that can tell preceesely what theyre capable or no capable o but there has been trooper tam and another chield out in bonnets and grey plaids like countrymen to reconreconnoitrei think john gudyill cad it and they hae been amang the rebels and brought back word that they had seen young milnwood mounted on ane o the dragoon horses that was taen at loudonhill armed wi swords and pistols like wha but him and hand and glove wi the foremost o them and dreeling and commanding the men and cuddie at the heels o him in ane o sergeant bothwells laced waistcoats and a cockit hat with a bab o blue ribbands at it for the auld cause o the covenant but cuddie aye liked a blue ribband and a ruffled sark like ony lord o the landit sets the like o him indeed  jenny said her young mistress hastily it is impossible these mens report can be true my uncle has heard nothing of it at this instant  because tam halliday answered the handmaiden came in just five minutes after lord evandale and when he heard his lordship was in the castle he swore the profane loon he would be dd ere he would make the report as he cad it of his news to major bellenden since there was an officer of his ain regiment in the garrison sae he wad have said naething till lord evandale wakened the next morning only he tauld me about it here jenny looked a little down just to vex me about cuddie  poh you silly girl said edith assuming some courage it is all a trick of that fellow to teaze you  na madam it canna be that for john gudyill took the other dragoon hes an auld hardfavoured man i wotna his name into the cellar and gae him a tass o brandy to get the news out o him and he said just the same as tam halliday word for word and mr gudyill was in sic a rage that he tauld it a ower again to us and says the haill rebellion is owing to the nonsense o my leddy and the major and lord evandale that begged off young milnwood and cuddie yesterday morning for that if they had suffered the country wad hae been quietand troth i am muckle o that opinion mysell  this last commentary jenny added to her tale in resentment of her mistresss extreme and obstinate incredulity she was instantly alarmed however by the effect which her news produced upon her young lady an effect rendered doubly violent by the highchurch principles and prejudices in which miss bellenden had been educated her complexion became as pale as a corpse her respiration so difficult that it was on the point of altogether failing her and her limbs so incapable of supporting her that she sunk rather than sat down upon one of the seats in the hall and seemed on the eve of fainting jenny tried cold water burnt feathers cutting of laces and all other remedies usual in hysterical cases but without any immediate effect  god forgie me what hae i done said the repentant filledechambre i wish my tongue had been cuttit outwha wad hae thought o her taking on that way and a for a young lado miss edithdear miss edith haud your heart up about it its maybe no true for a that i hae saido i wish my mouth had been blistered a body tells me my tongue will do me a mischief some day what if my leddy comes or the majorand shes sitting in the throne too that naebody has sate in since that weary morning the king was hereo what will i do o what will become o us  while jenny dennison thus lamented herself and her mistress edith slowly returned from the paroxysm into which she had been thrown by this unexpected intelligence  if he had been unfortunate she said i never would have deserted him i never did so even when there was danger and disgrace in pleading his cause if he had died i would have mourned himif he had been unfaithful i would have forgiven him but a rebel to his kinga traitor to his countrythe associate and colleague of cutthroats and common stabbersthe persecutor of all that is noblethe professed and blasphemous enemy of all that is sacredi will tear him from my heart if my lifeblood should ebb in the effort  she wiped her eyes and rose hastily from the great chair or throne as lady margaret used to call it while the terrified damsel hastened to shake up the cushion and efface the appearance of any one having occupied that sacred seat although king charles himself considering the youth and beauty as well as the affliction of the momentary usurper of his hallowed chair would probably have thought very little of the profanation she then hastened officiously to press her support on edith as she paced the hall apparently in deep meditation  tak my arm madam better just tak my arm sorrow maun hae its vent and doubtless  no jenny said edith with firmness you have seen my weakness and you shall see my strength  but ye leaned on me the other morning miss edith when ye were sae sair grieved  misplaced and erring affection may require support jennyduty can support itself yet i will do nothing rashly i will be aware of the reasons of his conductand thencast him off for ever was the firm and determined answer of her young lady  overawed by a manner of which she could neither conceive the motive nor estimate the merit jenny muttered between her teeth odd when the first flights ower miss edith taks it as easy as i do and muckle easier and im sure i neer cared half sae muckle about cuddie headrigg as she did about young milnwood forby that its maybe as weel to hae a friend on baith sides for if the whigs suld come to tak the castle as its like they may when theres sae little victual and the dragoons wasting whats ot ou in that case milnwood and cuddie wad hae the upper hand and their freendship wad be worth silleri was thinking sae this morning or i heard the news  with this consolatory reflection the damsel went about her usual occupations leaving her mistress to school her mind as she best might for eradicating the sentiments which she had hitherto entertained towards henry morton      chapter iv            once more into the breachdear friends once more                                                   henry v  on the evening of this day all the information which they could procure led them to expect that the insurgent army would be with early dawn on their march against tillietudlem lord evandales wounds had been examined by pike who reported them in a very promising state they were numerous but none of any consequence and the loss of blood as much perhaps as the boasted specific of lady margaret had prevented any tendency to fever so that notwithstanding he felt some pain and great weakness the patient maintained that he was able to creep about with the assistance of a stick in these circumstances he refused to be confined to his apartment both that he might encourage the soldiers by his presence and suggest any necessary addition to the plan of defence which the major might be supposed to have arranged upon something of an antiquated fashion of warfare lord evandale was well qualified to give advice on such subjects having served during his early youth both in france and in the low countries there was little or no occasion however for altering the preparations already made and excepting on the article of provisions there seemed no reason to fear for the defence of so strong a place against such assailants as those by whom it was threatened  with the peep of day lord evandale and major bellenden were on the battlements again viewing and reviewing the state of their preparations and anxiously expecting the approach of the enemy i ought to observe that the report of the spies had now been regularly made and received but the major treated the report that morton was in arms against the government with the most scornful incredulity  i know the lad better was the only reply he deigned to make the fellows have not dared to venture near enough and have been deceived by some fanciful resemblance or have picked up some story  i differ from you major answered lord evandale i think you will see that young gentleman at the head of the insurgents and though i shall be heartily sorry for it i shall not be greatly surprised  you are as bad as claverhouse said the major who contended yesterday morning down my very throat that this young fellow who is as highspirited and gentlemanlike a boy as i have ever known wanted but an opportunity to place himself at the head of the rebels  and considering the usage which he has received and the suspicions under which he lies said lord evandale what other course is open to him for my own part i should hardly know whether he deserved most blame or pity  blame my lordpity echoed the major astonished at hearing such sentiments he would deserve to be hanged thats all and were he my own son i should see him strung up with pleasureblame indeed but your lordship cannot think as you are pleased to speak  i give you my honour major bellenden that i have been for some time of opinion that our politicians and prelates have driven matters to a painful extremity in this country and have alienated by violence of various kinds not only the lower classes but all those in the upper ranks whom strong partyfeeling or a desire of courtinterest does not attach to their standard  i am no politician answered the major and i do not understand nice distinctions my sword is the kings and when he commands i draw it in his cause  i trust replied the young lord you will not find me more backward than yourself though i heartily wish that the enemy were foreigners it is however no time to debate that matter for yonder they come and we must defend ourselves as well as we can  as lord evandale spoke the van of the insurgents began to make their appearance on the road which crossed the top of the hill and thence descended opposite to the tower they did not however move downwards as if aware that in doing so their columns would be exposed to the fire of the artillery of the place but their numbers which at first seemed few appeared presently so to deepen and concentrate themselves that judging of the masses which occupied the road behind the hill from the closeness of the front which they presented on the top of it their force appeared very considerable there was a pause of anxiety on both sides and while the unsteady ranks of the covenanters were agitated as if by pressure behind or uncertainty as to their next movement their arms picturesque from their variety glanced in the morning sun whose beams were reflected from a grove of pikes muskets halberds and battleaxes the armed mass occupied for a few minutes this fluctuating position until three or four horsemen who seemed to be leaders advanced from the front and occupied the height a little nearer to the castle john gudyill who was not without some skill as an artilleryman brought a gun to bear on this detached group  ill flee the falconso the small cannon was calledill flee the falcon wheneer your honour gies command my certie shell ruffle their feathers for them  the major looked at lord evandale  stay a moment said the young nobleman they send us a flag of truce  in fact one of the horsemen at that moment dismounted and displaying a white cloth on a pike moved forward towards the tower while the major and lord evandale descending from the battlement of the main fortress advanced to meet him as far as the barricade judging it unwise to admit him within the precincts which they designed to defend at the same time that the ambassador set forth the group of horsemen as if they had anticipated the preparations of john gudyill for their annoyance withdrew from the advanced station which they had occupied and fell back to the main body  the envoy of the covenanters to judge by his mien and manner seemed fully imbued with that spiritual pride which distinguished his sect his features were drawn up to a contemptuous primness and his halfshut eyes seemed to scorn to look upon the terrestial objects around while at every solemn stride his toes were pointed outwards with an air that appeared to despise the ground on which they trode lord evandale could not suppress a smile at this singular figure  did you ever said he to major bellenden see such an absurd automaton one would swear it moves upon springscan it speak think you  o ay said the major that seems to be one of my old acquaintance a genuine puritan of the right pharisaical leavenstayhe coughs and hems he is about to summon the castle with the butend of a sermon instead of a parley on the trumpet  the veteran who in his day had had many an opportunity to become acquainted with the manners of these religionists was not far mistaken in his conjecture only that instead of a prose exordium the laird of langcalefor it was no less a personageuplifted with a stentorian voice a verse of the twentyfourth psalm  ye gates lift up your heads ye doors doors that do last for aye be lifted up  i told you so said the major to evandale and then presented himself at the entrance of the barricade demanding to know for what purpose or intent he made that doleful noise like a hog in a high wind beneath the gates of the castle  i come replied the ambassador in a high and shrill voice and without any of the usual salutations or deferencesi come from the godly army of the solemn league and covenant to speak with two carnal malignants william maxwell called lord evandale and miles bellenden of charnwood  and what have you to say to miles bellenden and lord evandale answered the major  are you the parties said the laird of langcale in the same sharp conceited disrespectful tone of voice  even so for fault of better said the major  then there is the public summons said the envoy putting a paper into lord evandales hand and there is a private letter for miles bellenden from a godly youth who is honoured with leading a part of our host read them quickly and god give you grace to fructify by the contents though it is muckle to be doubted  the summons ran thus we the named and constituted leaders of the gentlemen ministers and others presently in arms for the cause of liberty and true religion do warn and summon william lord evandale and miles bellenden of charnwood and others presently in arms and keeping garrison in the tower of tillietudlem to surrender the said tower upon fair conditions of quarter and license to depart with bag and baggage otherwise to suffer such extremity of fire and sword as belong by the laws of war to those who hold out an untenable post and so may god defend his own good cause  this summons was signed by john balfour of burley as quartermaster general of the army of the covenant for himself and in name of the other leaders  the letter to major bellenden was from henry morton it was couched in the following language  i have taken a step my venerable friend which among many painful consequences will i am afraid incur your very decided disapprobation but i have taken my resolution in honour and good faith and with the full approval of my own conscience i can no longer submit to have my own rights and those of my fellowsubjects trampled upon our freedom violated our persons insulted and our blood spilt without just cause or legal trial providence through the violence of the oppressors themselves seems now to have opened a way of deliverance from this intolerable tyranny and i do not hold him deserving of the name and rights of a freeman who thinking as i do shall withold his arm from the cause of his country but god who knows my heart be my witness that i do not share the angry or violent passions of the oppressed and harassed sufferers with whom i am now acting my most earnest and anxious desire is to see this unnatural war brought to a speedy end by the union of the good wise and moderate of all parties and a peace restored which without injury to the kings constitutional rights may substitute the authority of equal laws to that of military violence and permitting to all men to worship god according to their own consciences may subdue fanatical enthusiasm by reason and mildness instead of driving it to frenzy by persecution and intolerance  with these sentiments you may conceive with what pain i appear in arms before the house of your venerable relative which we understand you propose to hold out against us permit me to press upon you the assurance that such a measure will only lead to the effusion of bloodthat if repulsed in the assault we are yet strong enough to invest the place and reduce it by hunger being aware of your indifferent preparations to sustain a protracted siege it would grieve me to the heart to think what would be the sufferings in such a case and upon whom they would chiefly fall  do not suppose my respected friend that i would propose to you any terms which could compromise the high and honourable character which you have so deservedly won and so long borne if the regular soldiers to whom i will ensure a safe retreat are dismissed from the place i trust no more will be required than your parole to remain neuter during this unhappy contest and i will take care that lady margarets property as well as yours shall be duly respected and no garrison intruded upon you i could say much in favour of this proposal but i fear as i must in the present instance appear criminal in your eyes good arguments would lose their influence when coming from an unwelcome quarter i will therefore break off with assuring you that whatever your sentiments may be hereafter towards me my sense of gratitude to you can never be diminished or erased and it would be the happiest moment of my life that should give me more effectual means than mere words to assure you of it therefore although in the first moment of resentment you may reject the proposal i make to you let not that prevent you from resuming the topic if future events should render it more acceptable for whenever or howsoever i can be of service to you it will always afford the greatest satisfaction to                                      henry morton  having read this long letter with the most marked indignation major bellenden put it into the hands of lord evandale  i would not have believed this he said of henry morton if half mankind had sworn it the ungrateful rebellious traitor rebellious in cold blood and without even the pretext of enthusiasm that warms the liver of such a crackbrained fop as our friend the envoy there but i should have remembered he was a presbyteriani ought to have been aware that i was nursing a wolfcub whose diabolical nature would make him tear and snatch at me on the first opportunity were saint paul on earth again and a presbyterian he would be a rebel in three monthsit is in the very blood of them  well said lord evandale i will be the last to recommend surrender but if our provisions fail and we receive no relief from edinburgh or glasgow i think we ought to avail ourselves of this opening to get the ladies at least safe out of the castle  they will endure all ere they would accept the protection of such a smoothtongued hypocrite answered the major indignantly i would renounce them for relatives were it otherwise but let us dismiss the worthy ambassadormy friend he said turning to langcale tell your leaders and the mob they have gathered yonder that if they have not a particular opinion of the hardness of their own skulls i would advise them to beware how they knock them against these old walls and let them send no more flags of truce or we will hang up the messenger in retaliation of the murder of cornet grahame  with this answer the ambassador returned to those by whom he had been sent he had no sooner reached the main body than a murmur was heard amongst the multitude and there was raised in front of their ranks an ample red flag the borders of which were edged with blue as the signal of war and defiance spread out its large folds upon the morning wind the ancient banner of lady margarets family together with the royal ensign were immediately hoisted on the walls of the tower and at the same time a round of artillery was discharged against the foremost ranks of the insurgents by which they sustained some loss their leaders instantly withdrew them to the shelter of the brow of the hill  i think said john gudyill while he busied himself in recharging his guns they hae fund the falcons neb a bit ower hard for themits no for nought that the hawk whistles  but as he uttered these words the ridge was once more crowded with the ranks of the enemy a general discharge of their firearms was directed against the defenders upon the battlements under cover of the smoke a column of picked men rushed down the road with determined courage and sustaining with firmness a heavy fire from the garrison they forced their way in spite of opposition to the first barricade by which the avenue was defended they were led on by balfour in person who displayed courage equal to his enthusiasm and in spite of every opposition forced the barricade killing and wounding several of the defenders and compelling the rest to retreat to their second position the precautions however of major bellenden rendered this success unavailing for no sooner were the covenanters in possession of the post than a close and destructive fire was poured into it from the castle and from those stations which commanded it in the rear having no means of protecting themselves from this fire or of returning it with effect against men who were under cover of their barricades and defences the covenanters were obliged to retreat but not until they had with their axes destroyed the stockade so as to render it impossible for the defenders to reoccupy it  balfour was the last man that retired he even remained for a short space almost alone with an axe in his hand labouring like a pioneer amid the storm of balls many of which were specially aimed against him the retreat of the party he commanded was not effected without heavy loss and served as a severe lesson concerning the local advantages possessed by the garrison  the next attack of the covenanters was made with more caution a strong party of marksmen many of them competitors at the game of the popinjay under the command of henry morton glided through the woods where they afforded them the best shelter and avoiding the open road endeavoured by forcing their way through the bushes and trees and up the rocks which surrounded it on either side to gain a position from which without being exposed in an intolerable degree they might annoy the flank of the second barricade while it was menaced in front by a second attack from burley the besieged saw the danger of this movement and endeavoured to impede the approach of the marksmen by firing upon them at every point where they showed themselves the assailants on the other hand displayed great coolness spirit and judgment in the manner in which they approached the defences this was in a great measure to be ascribed to the steady and adroit manner in which they were conducted by their youthful leader who showed as much skill in protecting his own followers as spirit in annnoying the enemy  he repeatedly enjoined his marksmen to direct their aim chiefly upon the redcoats and to save the others engaged in the defence of the castle and above all to spare the life of the old major whose anxiety made him more than once expose himself in a manner that without such generosity on the part of the enemy might have proved fatal a dropping fire of musketry now glanced from every part of the precipitous mount on which the castle was founded from bush to bushfrom crag to cragfrom tree to tree the marksmen continued to advance availing themselves of branches and roots to assist their ascent and contending at once with the disadvantages of the ground and the fire of the enemy at length they got so high on the ascent that several of them possessed an opportunity of firing into the barricade against the defenders who then lay exposed to their aim and burley profiting by the confusion of the moment moved forward to the attack in front his onset was made with the same desperation and fury as before and met with less resistance the defenders being alarmed at the progress which the sharpshooters had made in turning the flank of their position determined to improve his advantage burley with his axe in his hand pursued the party whom he had dislodged even to the third and last barricade and entered it along with them  kill killdown with the enemies of god and his peopleno quarterthe castle is ours were the cries by which he animated his friends the most undaunted of whom followed him close whilst the others with axes spades and other implements threw up earth cut down trees hastily labouring to establish such a defensive cover in the rear of the second barricade as might enable them to retain possession of it in case the castle was not carried by this coupdemain  lord evandale could no longer restrain his impatience he charged with a few soldiers who had been kept in reserve in the courtyard of the castle and although his arm was in a sling encouraged them by voice and gesture to assist their companions who were engaged with burley the combat now assumed an air of desperation the narrow road was crowded with the followers of burley who pressed forward to support their companions the soldiers animated by the voice and presence of lord evandale fought with fury their small numbers being in some measure compensated by their greater skill and by their possessing the upper ground which they defended desperately with pikes and halberds as well as with the but of the carabines and their broadswords those within the castle endeavoured to assist their companions whenever they could so level their guns as to fire upon the enemy without endangering their friends the sharpshooters dispersed around were firing incessantly on each object that was exposed upon the battlement the castle was enveloped with smoke and the rocks rang to the cries of the combatants in the midst of this scene of confusion a singular accident had nearly given the besiegers possession of the fortress  cuddie headrigg who had advanced among the marksmen being well acquainted with every rock and bush in the vicinity of the castle where he had so often gathered nuts with jenny dennison was enabled by such local knowledge to advance farther and with less danger than most of his companions excepting some three or four who had followed him close now cuddie though a brave enough fellow upon the whole was by no means fond of danger either for its own sake or for that of the glory which attends it in his advance therefore he had not as the phrase goes taken the bull by the horns or advanced in front of the enemys fire on the contrary he had edged gradually away from the scene of action and turning his line of ascent rather to the left had pursued it until it brought him under a front of the castle different from that before which the parties were engaged and to which the defenders had given no attention trusting to the steepness of the precipice there was however on this point a certain window belonging to a certain pantry and communicating with a certain yewtree which grew out of a steep cleft of the rock being the very pass through which goose gibbie was smuggled out of the castle in order to carry ediths express to charnwood and which had probably in its day been used for other contraband purposes cuddie resting upon the but of his gun and looking up at this window observed to one of his companionstheres a place i ken weel mony a time i hae helped jenny dennison out o the winnock forby creeping in whiles mysell to get some daffin at een after the pleugh was loosed  and whats to hinder us to creep in just now said the other who was a smart enterprising young fellow  theres no muckle to hinder us an that were a answered cuddie but what were we to do neist  well take the castle cried the other here are five or six o us and a the sodgers are engaged at the gate  come awa wi you then said cuddie but mind deil a finger ye maun lay on lady margaret or miss edith or the auld major or aboon a on jenny dennison or ony body but the sodgerscut and quarter amang them as ye like i carena  ay ay said the other let us once in and we will make our ain terms with them a  gingerly and as if treading upon eggs cuddie began to ascend the wellknown pass not very willingly for besides that he was something apprehensive of the reception he might meet with in the inside his conscience insisted that he was making but a shabby requital for lady margarets former favours and protection he got up however into the yewtree followed by his companions one after another the window was small and had been secured by stancheons of iron but these had been long worn away by time or forced out by the domestics to possess a free passage for their own occasional convenience entrance was therefore easy providing there was no one in the pantry a point which cuddie endeavoured to discover before he made the final and perilous step while his companions therefore were urging and threatening him behind and he was hesitating and stretching his neck to look into the apartment his head became visible to jenny dennison who had ensconced herself in said pantry as the safest place in which to wait the issue of the assault so soon as this object of terror caught her eye she set up a hysteric scream flew to the adjacent kitchen and in the desperate agony of fear seized on a pot of kailbrose which she herself had hung on the fire before the combat began having promised to tam halliday to prepare his breakfast for him thus burdened she returned to the window of the pantry and still exclaiming murder murderwe are a harried and ravishedthe castles taentak it amang ye she discharged the whole scalding contents of the pot accompanied with a dismal yell upon the person of the unfortunate cuddie however welcome the mess might have been if cuddie and it had become acquainted in a regular manner the effects as administered by jenny would probably have cured him of soldiering for ever had he been looking upwards when it was thrown upon him but fortunately for our man of war he had taken the alarm upon jennys first scream and was in the act of looking down expostulating with his comrades who impeded the retreat which he was anxious to commence so that the steel cap and buff coat which formerly belonged to sergeant bothwell being garments of an excellent endurance protected his person against the greater part of the scalding brose enough however reached him to annoy him severely so that in the pain and surprise he jumped hastily out of the tree oversetting his followers to the manifest danger of their limbs and without listening to arguments entreaties or authority made the best of his way by the most safe road to the main body of the army whereunto he belonged and could neither by threats nor persuasion be prevailed upon to return to the attack   illustration jenny dennison050   as for jenny when she had thus conferred upon one admirers outward man the viands which her fair hands had so lately been in the act of preparing for the stomach of another she continued her song of alarm running a screaming division upon all those crimes which the lawyers call the four pleas of the crown namely murder fire rape and robbery these hideous exclamations gave so much alarm and created such confusion within the castle that major bellenden and lord evandale judged it best to draw off from the conflict without the gates and abandoning to the enemy all the exterior defences of the avenue confine themselves to the castle itself for fear of its being surprised on some unguarded point their retreat was unmolested for the panic of cuddie and his companions had occasioned nearly as much confusion on the side of the besiegers as the screams of jenny had caused to the defenders  there was no attempt on either side to renew the action that day the insurgents had suffered most severely and from the difficulty which they had experienced in carrying the barricadoed positions without the precincts of the castle they could have but little hope of storming the place itself on the other hand the situation of the besieged was dispiriting and gloomy in the skirmishing they had lost two or three men and had several wounded and though their loss was in proportion greatly less than that of the enemy who had left twenty men dead on the place yet their small number could much worse spare it while the desperate attacks of the opposite party plainly showed how serious the leaders were in the purpose of reducing the place and how well seconded by the zeal of their followers but especially the garrison had to fear for hunger in case blockade should be resorted to as the means of reducing them the majors directions had been imperfectly obeyed in regard to laying in provisions and the dragoons in spite of all warning and authority were likely to be wasteful in using them it was therefore with a heavy heart that major bellenden gave directions for guarding the window through which the castle had so nearly been surprised as well as all others which offered the most remote facility for such an enterprise      chapter v                 the king hath drawn                the special head of all the land together                                    henry iv part ii  the leaders of the presbyterian army had a serious consultation upon the evening of the day in which they had made the attack on tillietudlem they could not but observe that their followers were disheartened by the loss which they had sustained and which as usual in such cases had fallen upon the bravest and most forward it was to be feared that if they were suffered to exhaust their zeal and efforts in an object so secondary as the capture of this petty fort their numbers would melt away by degrees and they would lose all the advantages arising out of the present unprepared state of the government moved by these arguments it was agreed that the main body of the army should march against glasgow and dislodge the soldiers who were lying in that town the council nominated henry morton with others to this last service and appointed burley to the command of a chosen body of five hundred men who were to remain behind for the purpose of blockading the tower of tillietudlem morton testified the greatest repugnance to this arrangement  he had the strongest personal motives he said for desiring to remain near tillietudlem and if the management of the siege were committed to him he had little doubt but that he would bring it to such an accommodation as without being rigorous to the besieged would fully answer the purpose of the besiegers  burley readily guessed the cause of his young colleagues reluctance to move with the army for interested as he was in appreciating the characters with whom he had to deal he had contrived through the simplicity of cuddie and the enthusiasm of old mause to get much information concerning mortons relations with the family of tillietudlem he therefore took the advantage of poundtexts arising to speak to business as he said for some short space of time which burley rightly interpreted to mean an hour at the very least and seized that moment to withdraw morton from the hearing of their colleagues and to hold the following argument with him  thou art unwise henry morton to desire to sacrifice this holy cause to thy friendship for an uncircumcised philistine or thy lust for a moabitish woman  i neither understand your meaning mr balfour nor relish your allusions replied morton indignantly and i know no reason you have to bring so gross a charge or to use such uncivil language  confess however the truth said balfour and own that there are those within yon dark tower over whom thou wouldst rather be watching like a mother over her little ones than thou wouldst bear the banner of the church of scotland over the necks of her enemies  if you mean that i would willingly terminate this war without any bloody victory and that i am more anxious to do this than to acquire any personal fame or power you may be replied morton perfectly right  and not wholly wrong answered burley in deeming that thou wouldst not exclude from so general a pacification thy friends in the garrison of tillietudlem  certainly replied morton i am too much obliged to major bellenden not to wish to be of service to him as far as the interest of the cause i have espoused will permit i never made a secret of my regard for him  i am aware of that said burley but if thou hadst concealed it i should nevertheless have found out thy riddle now hearken to my words this miles bellenden hath means to subsist his garrison for a month  this is not the case answered morton we know his stores are hardly equal to a weeks consumption  ay but continued burley i have since had proof of the strongest nature that such a report was spread in the garrison by that wily and greyheaded malignant partly to prevail on the soldiers to submit to a diminution of their daily food partly to detain us before the walls of his fortress until the sword should be whetted to smite and destroy us  and why was not the evidence of this laid before the council of war said morton  to what purpose said balfour why need we undeceive kettledrummle macbriar poundtext and langcale upon such a point thyself must own that whatever is told to them escapes to the host out of the mouth of the preachers at their next holdingforth they are already discouraged by the thoughts of lying before the fort a week what would be the consequence were they ordered to prepare for the leaguer of a month  but why conceal it then from me or why tell it me now and above all what proofs have you got of the fact continued morton  there are many proofs replied burley and he put into his hands a number of requisitions sent forth by major bellenden with receipts on the back to various proprietors for cattle corn meal to such an amount that the sum total seemed to exclude the possibility of the garrison being soon distressed for provisions but burley did not inform morton of a fact which he himself knew full well namely that most of these provisions never reached the garrison owing to the rapacity of the dragoons sent to collect them who readily sold to one man what they took from another and abused the majors press for stores pretty much as sir john falstaff did that of the king for men  and now continued balfour observing that he had made the desired impression i have only to say that i concealed this from thee no longer than it was concealed from myself for i have only received these papers this morning and i tell it unto thee now that thou mayest go on thy way rejoicing and work the great work willingly at glasgow being assured that no evil can befall thy friends in the malignant party since their fort is abundantly victualled and i possess not numbers sufficient to do more against them than to prevent their sallying forth  and why continued morton who felt an inexpressible reluctance to acquiesce in balfours reasoningwhy not permit me to remain in the command of this smaller party and march forward yourself to glasgow it is the more honourable charge  and therefore young man answered burley have i laboured that it should be committed to the son of silas morton i am waxing old and this grey head has had enough of honour where it could be gathered by danger i speak not of the frothy bubble which men call earthly fame but the honour belonging to him that doth not the work negligently but thy career is yet to run thou hast to vindicate the high trust which has been bestowed on thee through my assurance that it was dearly wellmerited at loudonhill thou wert a captive and at the last assault it was thy part to fight under cover whilst i led the more open and dangerous attack and shouldst thou now remain before these walls when there is active service elsewhere trust me that men will say that the son of silas morton hath fallen away from the paths of his father  stung by this last observation to which as a gentleman and soldier he could offer no suitable reply morton hastily acquiesced in the proposed arrangement yet he was unable to divest himself of certain feelings of distrust which he involuntarily attached to the quarter from which he received this information  mr balfour he said let us distinctly understand each other you have thought it worth your while to bestow particular attention upon my private affairs and personal attachments be so good as to understand that i am as constant to them as to my political principles it is possible that during my absence you may possess the power of soothing or of wounding those feelings be assured that whatever may be the consequences to the issue of our present adventure my eternal gratitude or my persevering resentment will attend the line of conduct you may adopt on such an occasion and however young and inexperienced i am i have no doubt of finding friends to assist me in expressing my sentiments in either case  if there be a threat implied in that denunciation replied burley coldly and haughtily it had better have been spared i know how to value the regard of my friends and despise from my soul the threats of my enemies but i will not take occasion of offence whatever happens here in your absence shall be managed with as much deference to your wishes as the duty i owe to a higher power can possibly permit  with this qualified promise morton was obliged to rest satisfied  our defeat will relieve the garrison said he internally ere they can be reduced to surrender at discretion and in case of victory i already see from the numbers of the moderate party that i shall have a voice as powerful as burleys in determining the use which shall be made of it  he therefore followed balfour to the council where they found kettledrummle adding to his lastly a few words of practical application when these were expended morton testified his willingness to accompany the main body of the army which was destined to drive the regular troops from glasgow his companions in command were named and the whole received a strengthening exhortation from the preachers who were present next morning at break of day the insurgent army broke up from their encampment and marched towards glasgow  it is not our intention to detail at length incidents which may be found in the history of the period it is sufficient to say that claverhouse and lord ross learning the superior force which was directed against them intrenched or rather barricadoed themselves in the centre of the city where the townhouse and old jail were situated with the determination to stand the assault of the insurgents rather than to abandon the capital of the west of scotland the presbyterians made their attack in two bodies one of which penetrated into the city in the line of the college and cathedral church while the other marched up the gallowgate or principal access from the southeast both divisions were led by men of resolution and behaved with great spirit but the advantages of military skill and situation were too great for their undisciplined valour  ross and claverhouse had carefully disposed parties of their soldiers in houses at the heads of the streets and in the entrances of closes as they are called or lanes besides those who were intrenched behind breastworks which reached across the streets the assailants found their ranks thinned by a fire from invisible opponents which they had no means of returning with effect it was in vain that morton and other leaders exposed their persons with the utmost gallantry and endeavoured to bring their antagonists to a close action their followers shrunk from them in every direction and yet though henry morton was one of the very last to retire and exerted himself in bringing up the rear maintaining order in the retreat and checking every attempt which the enemy made to improve the advantage they had gained by the repulse he had still the mortification to hear many of those in his ranks muttering to each other that this came of trusting to latitudinarian boys and that had honest faithful burley led the attack as he did that of the barricades of tillietudlem the issue would have been as different as might be  it was with burning resentment that morton heard these reflections thrown out by the very men who had soonest exhibited signs of discouragement the unjust reproach however had the effect of firing his emulation and making him sensible that engaged as he was in a perilous cause it was absolutely necessary that he should conquer or die  i have no retreat he said to himself all shall alloweven major bellendeneven ediththat in courage at least the rebel morton was not inferior to his father  the condition of the army after the repulse was so undisciplined and in such disorganization that the leaders thought it prudent to draw off some miles from the city to gain time for reducing them once more into such order as they were capable of adopting recruits in the meanwhile came fast in more moved by the extreme hardships of their own condition and encouraged by the advantage obtained at loudonhill than deterred by the last unfortunate enterprise many of these attached themselves particularly to mortons division he had however the mortification to see that his unpopularity among the more intolerant part of the covenanters increased rapidly the prudence beyond his years which he exhibited in improving the discipline and arrangement of his followers they termed a trusting in the arm of flesh and his avowed tolerance for those of religious sentiments and observances different from his own obtained him most unjustly the nickname of gallio who cared for none of those things what was worse than these misconceptions the mob of the insurgents always loudest in applause of those who push political or religious opinions to extremity and disgusted with such as endeavour to reduce them to the yoke of discipline preferred avowedly the more zealous leaders in whose ranks enthusiasm in the cause supplied the want of good order and military subjection to the restraints which morton endeavoured to bring them under in short while bearing the principal burden of command for his colleagues willingly relinquished in his favour every thing that was troublesome and obnoxious in the office of general morton found himself without that authority which alone could render his regulations effectual note these feuds which tore to pieces the little army of insurgents turned merely on the point whether the kings interest or royal authority was to be owned or not and whether the party in arms were to be contented with a free exercise of their own religion or insist upon the reestablishment of presbytery in its supreme authority and with full power to predominate over all other forms of worship the few country gentlemen who joined the insurrection with the most sensible part of the clergy thought it best to limit their demands to what it might be possible to attain but the party who urged these moderate views were termed by the more zealous bigots the erastian party men namely who were willing to place the church under the influence of the civil government and therefore they accounted them a snare upon mizpah and a net spread upon tabor see the life of sir robert hamilton in the scottish worthies and his account of the battle of bothwellbridge passim  yet notwithstanding these obstacles he had during the course of a few days laboured so hard to introduce some degree of discipline into the army that he thought he might hazard a second attack upon glasgow with every prospect of success  it cannot be doubted that mortons anxiety to measure himself with colonel grahame of claverhouse at whose hands he had sustained such injury had its share in giving motive to his uncommon exertions but claverhouse disappointed his hopes for satisfied with having the advantage in repulsing the first attack upon glasgow he determined that he would not with the handful of troops under his command await a second assault from the insurgents with more numerous and better disciplined forces than had supported their first enterprise he therefore evacuated the place and marched at the head of his troops towards edinburgh the insurgents of course entered glasgow without resistance and without morton having the opportunity which he so deeply coveted of again encountering claverhouse personally but although he had not an opportunity of wiping away the disgrace which had befallen his division of the army of the covenant the retreat of claverhouse and the possession of glasgow tended greatly to animate the insurgent army and to increase its numbers the necessity of appointing new officers of organizing new regiments and squadrons of making them acquainted with at least the most necessary points of military discipline were labours which by universal consent seemed to be devolved upon henry morton and which he the more readily undertook because his father had made him acquainted with the theory of the military art and because he plainly saw that unless he took this ungracious but absolutely necessary labour it was vain to expect any other to engage in it  in the meanwhile fortune appeared to favour the enterprise of the insurgents more than the most sanguine durst have expected the privy council of scotland astonished at the extent of resistance which their arbitrary measures had provoked seemed stupified with terror and incapable of taking active steps to subdue the resentment which these measures had excited there were but very few troops in scotland and these they drew towards edinburgh as if to form an army for protection of the metropolis the feudal array of the crown vassals in the various counties was ordered to take the field and render to the king the military service due for their fiefs but the summons was very slackly obeyed the quarrel was not generally popular among the gentry and even those who were not unwilling themselves to have taken arms were deterred by the repugnance of their wives mothers and sisters to their engaging in such a cause  meanwhile the inadequacy of the scottish government to provide for their own defence or to put down a rebellion of which the commencement seemed so trifling excited at the english court doubts at once of their capacity and of the prudence of the severities they had exerted against the oppressed presbyterians it was therefore resolved to nominate to the command of the army of scotland the unfortunate duke of monmouth who had by marriage a great interest large estate and a numerous following as it was called in the southern parts of that kingdom the military skill which he had displayed on different occasions abroad was supposed more than adequate to subdue the insurgents in the field while it was expected that his mild temper and the favourable disposition which he showed to presbyterians in general might soften mens minds and tend to reconcile them to the government the duke was therefore invested with a commission containing high powers for settling the distracted affairs of scotland and dispatched from london with strong succours to take the principal military command in that country      chapter vi                      i am bound to bothwellhill                     where i maun either do or die                                              old ballad   illustration the battle of bothwell bridge128   there was now a pause in the military movements on both sides the government seemed contented to prevent the rebels advancing towards the capital while the insurgents were intent upon augmenting and strengthening their forces for this purpose they established a sort of encampment in the park belonging to the ducal residence at hamilton a centrical situation for receiving their recruits and where they were secured from any sudden attack by having the clyde a deep and rapid river in front of their position which is only passable by a long and narrow bridge near the castle and village of bothwell  morton remained here for about a fortnight after the attack on glasgow actively engaged in his military duties he had received more than one communication from burley but they only stated in general that the castle of tillietudlem continued to hold out impatient of suspense upon this most interesting subject he at length intimated to his colleagues in command his desire or rather his intentionfor he saw no reason why he should not assume a license which was taken by every one else in this disorderly armyto go to milnwood for a day or two to arrange some private affairs of consequence the proposal was by no means approved of for the military council of the insurgents were sufficiently sensible of the value of his services to fear to lose them and felt somewhat conscious of their own inability to supply his place they could not however pretend to dictate to him laws more rigid than they submitted to themselves and he was suffered to depart on his journey without any direct objection being stated the reverend mr poundtext took the same opportunity to pay a visit to his own residence in the neighbourhood of milnwood and favoured morton with his company on the journey as the country was chiefly friendly to their cause and in possession of their detached parties excepting here and there the stronghold of some old cavaliering baron they travelled without any other attendant than the faithful cuddie  it was near sunset when they reached milnwood where poundtext bid adieu to his companions and travelled forward alone to his own manse which was situated half a miles march beyond tillietudlem when morton was left alone to his own reflections with what a complication of feelings did he review the woods banks and fields that had been familiar to him his character as well as his habits thoughts and occupations had been entirely changed within the space of little more than a fortnight and twenty days seemed to have done upon him the work of as many years a mild romantic gentletempered youth bred up in dependence and stooping patiently to the control of a sordid and tyrannical relation had suddenly by the rod of oppression and the spur of injured feeling been compelled to stand forth a leader of armed men was earnestly engaged in affairs of a public nature had friends to animate and enemies to contend with and felt his individual fate bound up in that of a national insurrection and revolution it seemed as if he had at once experienced a transition from the romantic dreams of youth to the labours and cares of active manhood all that had formerly interested him was obliterated from his memory excepting only his attachment to edith and even his love seemed to have assumed a character more manly and disinterested as it had become mingled and contrasted with other duties and feelings as he revolved the particulars of this sudden change the circumstances in which it originated and the possible consequences of his present career the thrill of natural anxiety which passed along his mind was immediately banished by a glow of generous and highspirited confidence  i shall fall young he said if fall i must my motives misconstrued and my actions condemned by those whose approbation is dearest to me but the sword of liberty and patriotism is in my hand and i will neither fall meanly nor unavenged they may expose my body and gibbet my limbs but other days will come when the sentence of infamy will recoil against those who may pronounce it and that heaven whose name is so often profaned during this unnatural war will bear witness to the purity of the motives by which i have been guided  upon approaching milnwood henrys knock upon the gate no longer intimated the conscious timidity of a stripling who has been out of bounds but the confidence of a man in full possession of his own rights and master of his own actionsbold free and decided the door was cautiously opened by his old acquaintance mrs alison wilson who started back when she saw the steel cap and nodding plume of the martial visitor  where is my uncle alison said morton smiling at her alarm  lordsake mr harry is this you returned the old lady in troth ye garrd my heart loup to my very mouthbut it canna be your ainsell for ye look taller and mair manlylike than ye used to do  it is however my own self said henry sighing and smiling at the same time i believe this dress may make me look taller and these times ailie make men out of boys  sad times indeed echoed the old woman and o that you suld be endangered withem but wha can help itye were ill eneugh guided and as i tell your uncle if ye tread on a worm it will turn  you were always my advocate ailie said he and the housekeeper no longer resented the familiar epithet and would let no one blame me but yourself i am aware of thatwhere is my uncle  in edinburgh replied alison the honest man thought it was best to gang and sit by the chimley when the reek rasea vexd man hes been and a fearedbut ye ken the laird as weel as i do  i hope he has suffered nothing in health said henry  naething to speak of answered the housekeeper nor in gudes neitherwe fended as weel as we could and though the troopers of tillietudlem took the red cow and auld hackie yell mind them weel yet they sauld us a gude bargain o four they were driving to the castle  sold you a bargain said morton how do you mean  ou they cam out to gather marts for the garrison answered the housekeeper but they just fell to their auld trade and rade through the country couping and selling a that they gat like sae mony westcountry drovers my certie major bellenden was laird o the least share o what they lifted though it was taen in his name  then said morton hastily the garrison must be straitened for provisions  stressed eneugh replied ailietheres little doubt o that  a light instantly glanced on mortons mind  burley must have deceived mecraft as well as cruelty is permitted by his creed such was his inward thought he said aloud i cannot stay mrs wilson i must go forward directly  but oh bide to eat a mouthfu entreated the affectionate housekeeper and ill mak it ready for you as i used to do afore thae sad days it is impossible answered mortoncuddie get our horses ready  theyre just eating their corn answered the attendant  cuddie exclaimed ailie what garrd ye bring that illfaurd unlucky loon alang wi yeit was him and his randie mother began a the mischief in this house  tut tut replied cuddie ye should forget and forgie mistress mithers in glasgow wi her tittie and sall plague ye nae mair and im the captains wallie now and i keep him tighter in thack and rape than ever ye didsaw ye him ever sae weel put on as he is now  in troth and thats true said the old housekeeper looking with great complacency at her young master whose mien she thought much improved by his dress im sure ye neer had a laced cravat like that when ye were at milnwood thats nane o my sewing  na na mistress replied cuddie thats a cast o my handthats ane o lord evandales braws  lord evandale answered the old lady thats him that the whigs are gaun to hang the morn as i hear say  the whigs about to hang lord evandale said morton in the greatest surprise  ay troth are they said the housekeeper yesterday night he made a sally as they cat my mothers name was sallyi wonder they gie christian folks names to sic unchristian doingsbut he made an outbreak to get provisions and his men were driven back and he was taen an the whig captain balfour garrd set up a gallows and swore or said upon his conscience for they winna swear that if the garrison was not gien ower the morn by daybreak he would hing up the young lord poor thing as high as hamanthese are sair timesbut folk canna help themsae do ye sit down and tak bread and cheese until better meats made ready ye suldna hae kend a word about it an i had thought it was to spoil your dinner hinny  fed or unfed exclaimed morton saddle the horses instantly cuddie we must not rest until we get before the castle  and resisting all ailies entreaties they instantly resumed their journey  morton failed not to halt at the dwelling of poundtext and summon him to attend him to the camp that honest divine had just resumed for an instant his pacific habits and was perusing an ancient theological treatise with a pipe in his mouth and a small jug of ale beside him to assist his digestion of the argument it was with bitter illwill that he relinquished these comforts which he called his studies in order to recommence a hard ride upon a hightrotting horse however when he knew the matter in hand he gave up with a deep groan the prospect of spending a quiet evening in his own little parlour for he entirely agreed with morton that whatever interest burley might have in rendering the breach between the presbyterians and the government irreconcilable by putting the young nobleman to death it was by no means that of the moderate party to permit such an act of atrocity and it is but doing justice to mr poundtext to add that like most of his own persuasion he was decidedly adverse to any such acts of unnecessary violence besides that his own present feelings induced him to listen with much complacence to the probability held out by morton of lord evandales becoming a mediator for the establishment of peace upon fair and moderate terms with this similarity of views they hastened their journey and arrived about eleven oclock at night at a small hamlet adjacent to the castle at tillietudlem where burley had established his headquarters  they were challenged by the sentinel who made his melancholy walk at the entrance of the hamlet and admitted upon declaring their names and authority in the army another soldier kept watch before a house which they conjectured to be the place of lord evandales confinement for a gibbet of such great height as to be visible from the battlements of the castle was erected before it in melancholy confirmation of the truth of mrs wilsons report note the cameronians had suffered persecution but it was without learning mercy we are informed by captain crichton that they had set up in their camp a huge gibbet or gallows having many hooks upon it with a coil of new ropes lying beside it for the execution of such royalists as they might make prisoners guild in his bellum bothuellianum describes this machine particularly morton instantly demanded to speak with burley and was directed to his quarters they found him reading the scriptures with his arms lying beside him as if ready for any sudden alarm he started upon the entrance of his colleagues in office  what has brought ye hither said burley hastily is there bad news from the army  no replied morton but we understand that there are measures adopted here in which the safety of the army is deeply concernedlord evandale is your prisoner  the lord replied burley hath delivered him into our hands  and you will avail yourself of that advantage granted you by heaven to dishonour our cause in the eyes of all the world by putting a prisoner to an ignominious death  if the house of tillietudlem be not surrendered by daybreak replied burley god do so to me and more also if he shall not die that death to which his leader and patron john grahame of claverhouse hath put so many of gods saints  we are in arms replied morton to put down such cruelties and not to imitate them far less to avenge upon the innocent the acts of the guilty by what law can you justify the atrocity you would commit  if thou art ignorant of it replied burley thy companion is well aware of the law which gave the men of jericho to the sword of joshua the son of nun  but we answered the divine live under a better dispensation which instructeth us to return good for evil and to pray for those who despitefully use us and persecute us  that is to say said burley that thou wilt join thy grey hairs to his green youth to controvert me in this matter  we are rejoined poundtext two of those to whom jointly with thyself authority is delegated over this host and we will not permit thee to hurt a hair of the prisoners head it may please god to make him a means of healing these unhappy breaches in our israel  i judged it would come to this answered burley when such as thou wert called into the council of the elders  such as i answered poundtextand who am i that you should name me with such scornhave i not kept the flock of this sheepfold from the wolves for thirty years ay even while thou john balfour wert fighting in the ranks of uncircumcision a philistine of hardened brow and bloody handwho am i sayst thou  i will tell thee what thou art since thou wouldst so fain know said burley thou art one of those who would reap where thou hast not sowed and divide the spoil while others fight the battlethou art one of those that follow the gospel for the loaves and for the fishesthat love their own manse better than the church of god and that would rather draw their stipends under prelatists or heathens than be a partaker with those noble spirits who have cast all behind them for the sake of the covenant  and i will tell thee john balfour returned poundtext deservedly incensed i will tell thee what thou art thou art one of those for whose bloody and merciless disposition a reproach is flung upon the whole church of this suffering kingdom and for whose violence and bloodguiltiness it is to be feared this fair attempt to recover our civil and religious rights will never be honoured by providence with the desired success  gentlemen said morton cease this irritating and unavailing recrimination and do you mr balfour inform us whether it is your purpose to oppose the liberation of lord evandale which appears to us a profitable measure in the present position of our affairs  you are here answered burley as two voices against one but you will not refuse to tarry until the united council shall decide upon this matter  this said morton we would not decline if we could trust the hands in whom we are to leave the prisonerbut you know well he added looking sternly at burley that you have already deceived me in this matter  go to said burley disdainfullythou art an idle inconsiderate boy who for the black eyebrows of a silly girl would barter thy own faith and honour and the cause of god and of thy country  mr balfour said morton laying his hand on his sword this language requires satisfaction  and thou shalt have it stripling when and where thou darest said burley i plight thee my good word on it  poundtext in his turn interfered to remind them of the madness of quarrelling and effected with difficulty a sort of sullen reconciliation  concerning the prisoner said burley deal with him as ye think fit i wash my hands free from all consequences he is my prisoner made by my sword and spear while you mr morton were playing the adjutant at drills and parades and you mr poundtext were warping the scriptures into erastianism take him unto you nevertheless and dispose of him as ye think meetdingwall he continued calling a sort of aiddecamp who slept in the next apartment let the guard posted on the malignant evandale give up their post to those whom captain morton shall appoint to relieve themthe prisoner he said again addressing poundtext and morton is now at your disposal gentlemen but remember that for all these things there will one day come a term of heavy accounting  so saying he turned abruptly into an inner apartment without bidding them good evening his two visitors after a moments consideration agreed it would be prudent to ensure the prisoners personal safety by placing over him an additional guard chosen from their own parishioners a band of them happened to be stationed in the hamlet having been attached for the time to burleys command in order that the men might be gratified by remaining as long as possible near to their own homes they were in general smart active young fellows and were usually called by their companions the marksmen of milnwood by mortons desire four of these lads readily undertook the task of sentinels and he left with them headrigg on whose fidelity he could depend with instructions to call him if any thing remarkable happened  this arrangement being made morton and his colleague took possession for the night of such quarters as the overcrowded and miserable hamlet could afford them they did not however separate for repose till they had drawn up a memorial of the grievances of the moderate presbyterians which was summed up with a request of free toleration for their religion in future and that they should be permitted to attend gospel ordinances as dispensed by their own clergymen without oppression or molestation their petition proceeded to require that a free parliament should be called for settling the affairs of church and state and for redressing the injuries sustained by the subject and that all those who either now were or had been in arms for obtaining these ends should be indemnified morton could not but strongly hope that these terms which comprehended all that was wanted or wished for by the moderate party among the insurgents might when thus cleared of the violence of fanaticism find advocates even among the royalists as claiming only the ordinary rights of scottish freemen  he had the more confidence of a favourable reception that the duke of monmouth to whom charles had intrusted the charge of subduing this rebellion was a man of gentle moderate and accessible disposition well known to be favourable to the presbyterians and invested by the king with full powers to take measures for quieting the disturbances in scotland it seemed to morton that all that was necessary for influencing him in their favour was to find a fit and sufficiently respectable channel of communication and such seemed to be opened through the medium of lord evandale he resolved therefore to visit the prisoner early in the morning in order to sound his dispositions to undertake the task of mediator but an accident happened which led him to anticipate his purpose      chapter vii                      gie ower your house lady he said                     gie ower your house to me                                         edom of gordon  morton had finished the revisal and the making out of a fair copy of the paper on which he and poundtext had agreed to rest as a full statement of the grievances of their party and the conditions on which the greater part of the insurgents would be contented to lay down their arms and he was about to betake himself to repose when there was a knocking at the door of his apartment  enter said morton and the round bullethead of cuddie headrigg was thrust into the room come in said morton and tell me what you want is there any alarm  na stir but i hae brought ane to speak wi you  who is that cuddie enquired morton  ane o your auld acquaintance said cuddie and opening the door more fully he half led half dragged in a woman whose face was muffled in her plaidcome come ye needna be sae bashfu before auld acquaintance jenny said cuddie pulling down the veil and discovering to his master the wellremembered countenance of jenny dennison tell his honour nowtheres a braw lasstell him what ye were wanting to say to lord evandale mistress  what was i wanting to say answered jenny to his honour himsell the other morning when i visited him in captivity ye muckle hashdye think that folk dinna want to see their friends in adversity ye dour crowdyeater  this reply was made with jennys usual volubility but her voice quivered her cheek was thin and pale the tears stood in her eyes her hand trembled her manner was fluttered and her whole presence bore marks of recent suffering and privation as well as nervous and hysterical agitation  what is the matter jenny said morton kindly you know how much i owe you in many respects and can hardly make a request that i will not grant if in my power  many thanks milnwood said the weeping damsel but ye were aye a kind gentleman though folk say ye hae become sair changed now  what do they say of me answered morton  a body says replied jenny that you and the whigs hae made a vow to ding king charles aff the throne and that neither he nor his posteriors from generation to generation shall sit upon it ony mair and john gudyill threeps yere to gie a the church organs to the pipers and burn the book o commonprayer by the hands of the common hangman in revenge of the covenant that was burnt when the king cam hame  my friends at tillietudlem judge too hastily and too ill of me answered morton i wish to have free exercise of my own religion without insulting any other and as to your family i only desire an opportunity to show them i have the same friendship and kindness as ever  bless your kind heart for saying sae said jenny bursting into a flood of tears and they never needed kindness or friendship mair for they are famished for lack o food  good god replied morton i have heard of scarcity but not of famine it is possiblehave the ladies and the major  they hae suffered like the lave o us replied jenny for they shared every bit and sup wi the whole folk in the castleim sure my poor een see fifty colours wi faintness and my heads sae dizzy wi the mirligoes that i canna stand my lane  the thinness of the poor girls cheek and the sharpness of her features bore witness to the truth of what she said morton was greatly shocked  sit down he said for gods sake forcing her into the only chair the apartment afforded while he himself strode up and down the room in horror and impatience i knew not of this he exclaimed in broken ejaculationsi could not know of itcoldblooded ironhearted fanaticdeceitful villaincuddie fetch refreshmentsfoodwine if possiblewhatever you can find  whisky is gude eneugh for her muttered cuddie ane wadna hae thought that gude meal was sae scant amang them when the quean threw sae muckle gude kailbrose scalding het about my lugs  faint and miserable as jenny seemed to be she could not hear the allusion to her exploit during the storm of the castle without bursting into a laugh which weakness soon converted into a hysterical giggle confounded at her state and reflecting with horror on the distress which must have been in the castle morton repeated his commands to headrigg in a peremptory manner and when he had departed endeavoured to soothe his visitor  you come i suppose by the orders of your mistress to visit lord evandaletell me what she desires her orders shall be my law  jenny appeared to reflect a moment and then said your honour is sae auld a friend i must needs trust to you and tell the truth  be assured jenny said morton observing that she hesitated that you will best serve your mistress by dealing sincerely with me  weel then ye maun ken were starving as i said before and have been mair days than ane and the major has sworn that he expects relief daily and that he will not gie ower the house to the enemy till we have eaten up his auld bootsand they are unco thick in the soles as ye may weel mind forby being teugh in the upperleather the dragoons again they think they will be forced to gie up at last and they canna bide hunger weel after the life they led at free quarters for this while bypast and since lord evandales taen theres nae guiding them and inglis says hell gie up the garrison to the whigs and the major and the leddies into the bargain if they will but let the troopers gang free themsells  scoundrels said morton why do they not make terms for all in the castle  they are feard for denial o quarter to themsells having dune sae muckle mischief through the country and burley has hanged ane or twa o them alreadysae they want to draw their ain necks out o the collar at hazard o honest folks  and you were sent continued morton to carry to lord evandale the unpleasant news of the mens mutiny  just een sae said jenny tam halliday took the rue and tauld me a about it and gat me out o the castle to tell lord evandale if possibly i could win at him  but how can he help you said morton he is a prisoner  welladay ay answered the afflicted damsel but maybe he could mak fair terms for usor maybe he could gie us some good adviceor maybe he might send his orders to the dragoons to be civilor  or maybe said morton you were to try if it were possible to set him at liberty  if it were sae answered jenny with spirit it wadna be the first time i hae done my best to serve a friend in captivity  true jenny replied morton i were most ungrateful to forget it but here comes cuddie with refreshmentsi will go and do your errand to lord evandale while you take some food and wine  it willna be amiss ye should ken said cuddie to his master that this jennythis mrs dennison was trying to cuittle favour wi tam rand the millers man to win into lord evandales room without ony body kennin she wasna thinking the gipsy that i was at her elbow  and an unco fright ye gae me when ye cam ahint and took a grip o me said jenny giving him a sly twitch with her finger and her thumbif ye hadna been an auld acquaintance ye daft gomeril  cuddie somewhat relenting grinned a smile on his artful mistress while morton wrapped himself up in his cloak took his sword under his arm and went straight to the place of the young noblemans confinement he asked the sentinels if any thing extraordinary had occurred  nothing worth notice they said excepting the lass that cuddie took up and two couriers that captain balfour had dispatched one to the reverend ephraim macbriar another to kettledrummle both of whom were beating the drum ecclesiastic in different towns between the position of burley and the headquarters of the main army near hamilton  the purpose i presume said morton with an affectation of indifference was to call them hither  so i understand answered the sentinel who had spoke with the messengers  he is summoning a triumphant majority of the council thought morton to himself for the purpose of sanctioning whatever action of atrocity he may determine upon and thwarting opposition by authority i must be speedy or i shall lose my opportunity  when he entered the place of lord evandales confinement he found him ironed and reclining on a flock bed in the wretched garret of a miserable cottage he was either in a slumber or in deep meditation when morton entered and turned on him when aroused a countenance so much reduced by loss of blood want of sleep and scarcity of food that no one could have recognised in it the gallant soldier who had behaved with so much spirit at the skirmish of loudonhill he displayed some surprise at the sudden entrance of morton  i am sorry to see you thus my lord said that youthful leader  i have heard you are an admirer of poetry answered the prisoner in that case mr morton you may remember these lines                stone walls do not a prison make                or iron bars a cage                a free and quiet mind can take                these for a hermitage  but were my imprisonment less endurable i am given to expect tomorrow a total enfranchisement  by death said morton  surely answered lord evandale i have no other prospect your comrade burley has already dipped his hand in the blood of men whose meanness of rank and obscurity of extraction might have saved them i cannot boast such a shield from his vengeance and i expect to meet its extremity  but major bellenden said morton may surrender in order to preserve your life  never while there is one man to defend the battlement and that man has one crust to eat i know his gallant resolution and grieved should i be if he changed it for my sake  morton hastened to acquaint him with the mutiny among the dragoons and their resolution to surrender the castle and put the ladies of the family as well as the major into the hands of the enemy lord evandale seemed at first surprised and something incredulous but immediately afterwards deeply affected  what is to be done he saidhow is this misfortune to be averted  hear me my lord said morton i believe you may not be unwilling to bear the olive branch between our master the king and that part of his subjects which is now in arms not from choice but necessity  you construe me but justly said lord evandale but to what does this tend  permit me my lordcontinued morton i will set you at liberty upon parole nay you may return to the castle and shall have a safe conduct for the ladies the major and all who leave it on condition of its instant surrender in contributing to bring this about you will only submit to circumstances for with a mutiny in the garrison and without provisions it will be found impossible to defend the place twentyfour hours longer those therefore who refuse to accompany your lordship must take their fate you and your followers shall have a free pass to edinburgh or whereever the duke of monmouth may be in return for your liberty we hope that you will recommend to the notice of his grace as lieutenantgeneral of scotland this humble petition and remonstrance containing the grievances which have occasioned this insurrection a redress of which being granted i will answer with my head that the great body of the insurgents will lay down their arms  lord evandale read over the paper with attention  mr morton he said in my simple judgment i see little objection that can be made to the measure here recommended nay farther i believe in many respects they may meet the private sentiments of the duke of monmouth and yet to deal frankly with you i have no hopes of their being granted unless in the first place you were to lay down your arms  the doing so answered morton would be virtually conceding that we had no right to take them up and that for one i will never agree to  perhaps it is hardly to be expected you should said lord evandale and yet on that point i am certain the negotiations will be wrecked i am willing however having frankly told you my opinion to do all in my power to bring about a reconciliation  it is all we can wish or expect replied morton the issue is in gods hands who disposes the hearts of princesyou accept then the safe conduct  certainly answered lord evandale and if i do not enlarge upon the obligation incurred by your having saved my life a second time believe that i do not feel it the less  and the garrison of tillietudlem said morton  shall be withdrawn as you propose answered the young nobleman i am sensible the major will be unable to bring the mutineers to reason and i tremble to think of the consequences should the ladies and the brave old man be delivered up to this bloodthirsty ruffian burley  you are in that case free said morton prepare to mount on horseback a few men whom i can trust shall attend you till you are in safety from our parties  leaving lord evandale in great surprise and joy at this unexpected deliverance morton hastened to get a few chosen men under arms and on horseback each rider holding the rein of a spare horse jenny who while she partook of her refreshment had contrived to make up her breach with cuddie rode on the left hand of that valiant cavalier the tramp of their horses was soon heard under the window of lord evandales prison two men whom he did not know entered the apartment disencumbered him of his fetters and conducting him down stairs mounted him in the centre of the detachment they set out at a round trot towards tillietudlem  the moonlight was giving way to the dawn when they approached that ancient fortress and its dark massive tower had just received the first pale colouring of the morning the party halted at the tower barrier not venturing to approach nearer for fear of the fire of the place lord evandale alone rode up to the gate followed at a distance by jenny dennison as they approached the gate there was heard to arise in the courtyard a tumult which accorded ill with the quiet serenity of a summer dawn cries and oaths were heard a pistolshot or two were discharged and every thing announced that the mutiny had broken out at this crisis lord evandale arrived at the gate where halliday was sentinel on hearing lord evandales voice he instantly and gladly admitted him and that nobleman arrived among the mutinous troopers like a man dropped from the clouds they were in the act of putting their design into execution of seizing the place into their own hands and were about to disarm and overpower major bellenden and harrison and others of the castle who were offering the best resistance in their power  the appearance of lord evandale changed the scene he seized inglis by the collar and upbraiding him with his villainy ordered two of his comrades to seize and bind him assuring the others that their only chance of impunity consisted in instant submission he then ordered the men into their ranks they obeyed he commanded them to ground their arms they hesitated but the instinct of discipline joined to their persuasion that the authority of their officer so boldly exerted must be supported by some forces without the gate induced them to submit  take away those arms said lord evandale to the people of the castle they shall not be restored until these men know better the use for which they are intrusted with themand now he continued addressing the mutineers begonemake the best use of your time and of a truce of three hours which the enemy are contented to allow you take the road to edinburgh and meet me at the houseofmuir i need not bid you beware of committing violence by the way you will not in your present condition provoke resentment for your own sakes let your punctuality show that you mean to atone for this mornings business  the disarmed soldiers shrunk in silence from the presence of their officer and leaving the castle took the road to the place of rendezvous making such haste as was inspired by the fear of meeting with some detached party of the insurgents whom their present defenceless condition and their former violence might inspire with thoughts of revenge inglis whom evandale destined for punishment remained in custody halliday was praised for his conduct and assured of succeeding to the rank of the culprit these arrangements being hastily made lord evandale accosted the major before whose eyes the scene had seemed to pass like the change of a dream  my dear major we must give up the place  is it even so said major bellenden i was in hopes you had brought reinforcements and supplies  not a mannot a pound of meal answered lord evandale  yet i am blithe to see you returned the honest major we were informed yesterday that these psalmsinging rascals had a plot on your life and i had mustered the scoundrelly dragoons ten minutes ago in order to beat up burleys quarters and get you out of limbo when the dog inglis instead of obeying me broke out into open mutinybut what is to be done now  i have myself no choice said lord evandale i am a prisoner released on parole and bound for edinburgh you and the ladies must take the same route i have by the favour of a friend a safe conduct and horses for you and your retinuefor gods sake make hasteyou cannot propose to hold out with seven or eight men and without provisions enough has been done for honour and enough to render the defence of the highest consequence to government more were needless as well as desperate the english troops are arrived at edinburgh and will speedily move upon hamilton the possession of tillietudlem by the rebels will be but temporary  if you think so my lord said the veteran with a reluctant sighi know you only advise what is honourableif then you really think the case inevitable i must submit for the mutiny of these scoundrels would render it impossible to man the wallsgudyill let the women call up their mistresses and all be ready to marchbut if i could believe that my remaining in these old walls till i was starved to a mummy could do the kings cause the least service old miles bellenden would not leave them while there was a spark of life in his body  the ladies already alarmed by the mutiny now heard the determination of the major in which they readily acquiesced though not without some groans and sighs on the part of lady margaret which referred as usual to the dejeune of his most sacred majesty in the halls which were now to be abandoned to rebels hasty preparations were made for evacuating the castle and long ere the dawn was distinct enough for discovering objects with precision the ladies with major bellenden harrison gudyill and the other domestics were mounted on the led horses and others which had been provided in the neighbourhood and proceeded towards the north still escorted by four of the insurgent horsemen the rest of the party who had accompanied lord evandale from the hamlet took possession of the deserted castle carefully forbearing all outrage or acts of plunder and when the sun arose the scarlet and blue colours of the scottish covenant floated from the keep of tillietudlem      chapter viii                 and to my breast a bodkin in her hand                were worth a thousand daggers                                              marlow  the cavalcade which left the castle of tillietudlem halted for a few minutes at the small town of bothwell after passing the outposts of the insurgents to take some slight refreshments which their attendants had provided and which were really necessary to persons who had suffered considerably by want of proper nourishment they then pressed forward upon the road towards edinburgh amid the lights of dawn which were now rising on the horizon it might have been expected during the course of the journey that lord evandale would have been frequently by the side of miss edith bellenden yet after his first salutations had been exchanged and every precaution solicitously adopted which could serve for her accommodation he rode in the van of the party with major bellenden and seemed to abandon the charge of immediate attendance upon his lovely niece to one of the insurgent cavaliers whose dark military cloak with the large flapped hat and feather which drooped over his face concealed at once his figure and his features they rode side by side in silence for more than two miles when the stranger addressed miss bellenden in a tremulous and suppressed voice  miss bellenden he said must have friends wherever she is known even among those whose conduct she now disapproves is there any thing that such can do to show their respect for her and their regret for her sufferings  let them learn for their own sakes replied edith to venerate the laws and to spare innocent blood let them return to their allegiance and i can forgive them all that i have suffered were it ten times more  you think it impossible then rejoined the cavalier for any one to serve in our ranks having the weal of his country sincerely at heart and conceiving himself in the discharge of a patriotic duty  it might be imprudent while so absolutely in your power replied miss bellenden to answer that question  not in the present instance i plight you the word of a soldier replied the horseman  i have been taught candour from my birth said edith and if i am to speak at all i must utter my real sentiments god only can judge the heartmen must estimate intentions by actions treason murder by the sword and by gibbet the oppression of a private family such as ours who were only in arms for the defence of the established government and of our own property are actions which must needs sully all that have accession to them by whatever specious terms they may be gilded over  the guilt of civil war rejoined the horsemanthe miseries which it brings in its train lie at the door of those who provoked it by illegal oppression rather than of such as are driven to arms in order to assert their natural rights as freemen  that is assuming the question replied edith which ought to be proved each party contends that they are right in point of principle and therefore the guilt must lie with them who first drew the sword as in an affray law holds those to be the criminals who are the first to have recourse to violence  alas said the horseman were our vindication to rest there how easy would it be to show that we have suffered with a patience which almost seemed beyond the power of humanity ere we were driven by oppression into open resistancebut i perceive he continued sighing deeply that it is vain to plead before miss bellenden a cause which she has already prejudged perhaps as much from her dislike of the persons as of the principles of those engaged in it  pardon me answered edith i have stated with freedom my opinion of the principles of the insurgents of their persons i know nothingexcepting in one solitary instance  and that instance said the horseman has influenced your opinion of the whole body  far from it said edith he isat least i once thought himone in whose scale few were fit to be weighedhe isor he seemedone of early talent high faith pure morality and warm affections can i approve of a rebellion which has made such a man formed to ornament to enlighten and to defend his country the companion of gloomy and ignorant fanatics or canting hypocritesthe leader of brutal clownsthe brotherinarms to banditti and highway murderersshould you meet such an one in your camp tell him that edith bellenden has wept more over his fallen character blighted prospects and dishonoured name than over the distresses of her own houseand that she has better endured that famine which has wasted her cheek and dimmed her eye than the pang of heart which attended the reflection by and through whom these calamities were inflicted  as she thus spoke she turned upon her companion a countenance whose faded cheek attested the reality of her sufferings even while it glowed with the temporary animation which accompanied her language the horseman was not insensible to the appeal he raised his hand to his brow with the sudden motion of one who feels a pang shoot along his brain passed it hastily over his face and then pulled the shadowing hat still deeper on his forehead the movement and the feelings which it excited did not escape edith nor did she remark them without emotion  and yet she said should the person of whom i speak seem to you too deeply affected by the hard opinion ofofan early friend say to him that sincere repentance is next to innocencethat though fallen from a height not easily recovered and the author of much mischief because gilded by his example he may still atone in some measure for the evil he has done  and in what manner asked the cavalier in the same suppressed and almost choked voice  by lending his efforts to restore the blessings of peace to his distracted countrymen and to induce the deluded rebels to lay down their arms by saving their blood he may atone for that which has been already spiltand he that shall be most active in accomplishing this great end will best deserve the thanks of this age and an honoured remembrance in the next  and in such a peace said her companion with a firm voice miss bellenden would not wish i think that the interests of the people were sacrificed unreservedly to those of the crown  i am but a girl was the young ladys reply and i scarce can speak on the subject without presumption but since i have gone so far i will fairly add i would wish to see a peace which should give rest to all parties and secure the subjects from military rapine which i detest as much as i do the means now adopted to resist it  miss bellenden answered henry morton raising his face and speaking in his natural tone the person who has lost such a highlyvalued place in your esteem has yet too much spirit to plead his cause as a criminal and conscious that he can no longer claim a friends interest in your bosom he would be silent under your hard censure were it not that he can refer to the honoured testimony of lord evandale that his earnest wishes and most active exertions are even now directed to the accomplishment of such a peace as the most loyal cannot censure  he bowed with dignity to miss bellenden who though her language intimated that she well knew to whom she had been speaking probably had not expected that he would justify himself with so much animation she returned his salute confused and in silence morton then rode forward to the head of the party  henry morton exclaimed major bellenden surprised at the sudden apparition  the same answered morton who is sorry that he labours under the harsh construction of major bellenden and his family he commits to my lord evandale he continued turning towards the young nobleman and bowing to him the charge of undeceiving his friends both regarding the particulars of his conduct and the purity of his motives farewell major bellendenall happiness attend you and yoursmay we meet again in happier and better times  believe me said lord evandale your confidence mr morton is not misplaced i will endeavour to repay the great services i have received from you by doing my best to place your character on its proper footing with major bellenden and all whose esteem you value  i expected no less from your generosity my lord said morton  he then called his followers and rode off along the heath in the direction of hamilton their feathers waving and their steel caps glancing in the beams of the rising sun cuddie headrigg alone remained an instant behind his companions to take an affectionate farewell of jenny dennison who had contrived during this short mornings ride to reestablish her influence over his susceptible bosom a straggling tree or two obscured rather than concealed their teteatete as they halted their horses to bid adieu  fare ye weel jenny said cuddie with a loud exertion of his lungs intended perhaps to be a sigh but rather resembling the intonation of a groanyell think o puir cuddie sometimesan honest lad that loes ye jenny yell think o him now and then  whilesat brosetime answered the malicious damsel unable either to suppress the repartee or the arch smile which attended it   illustration whilesat brosetimepa098   cuddie took his revenge as rustic lovers are wont and as jenny probably expectedcaught his mistress round the neck kissed her cheeks and lips heartily and then turned his horse and trotted after his master  deils in the fallow said jenny wiping her lips and adjusting her headdress he has twice the spunk o tam halliday after acoming my leddy cominglord have a care o us i trust the auld leddy didna see us  jenny said lady margaret as the damsel came up was not that young man who commanded the party the same that was captain of the popinjay and who was afterwards prisoner at tillietudlem on the morning claverhouse came there  jenny happy that the query had no reference to her own little matters looked at her young mistress to discover if possible whether it was her cue to speak truth or not not being able to catch any hint to guide her she followed her instinct as a ladys maid and lied  i dinna believe it was him my leddy said jenny as confidently as if she had been saying her catechism he was a little black man that  you must have been blind jenny said the major henry morton is tall and fair and that youth is the very man  i had ither thing ado than be looking at him said jenny tossing her head he may be as fair as a farthing candle for me  is it not said lady margaret a blessed escape which we have made out of the hands of so desperate and bloodthirsty a fanatic  you are deceived madam said lord evandale mr morton merits such a title from no one but least from us that i am now alive and that you are now on your safe retreat to your friends instead of being prisoners to a real fanatical homicide is solely and entirely owing to the prompt active and energetic humanity of this young gentleman  he then went into a particular narrative of the events with which the reader is acquainted dwelling upon the merits of morton and expatiating on the risk at which he had rendered them these important services as if he had been a brother instead of a rival  i were worse than ungrateful he said were i silent on the merits of the man who has twice saved my life  i would willingly think well of henry morton my lord replied major bellenden and i own he has behaved handsomely to your lordship and to us but i cannot have the same allowances which it pleases your lordship to entertain for his present courses  you are to consider replied lord evandale that he has been partly forced upon them by necessity and i must add that his principles though differing in some degree from my own are such as ought to command respect claverhouse whose knowledge of men is not to be disputed spoke justly of him as to his extraordinary qualities but with prejudice and harshly concerning his principles and motives  you have not been long in learning all his extraordinary qualities my lord answered major bellenden i who have known him from boyhood could before this affair have said much of his good principles and goodnature but as to his high talents  they were probably hidden major replied the generous lord evandale even from himself until circumstances called them forth and if i have detected them it was only because our intercourse and conversation turned on momentous and important subjects he is now labouring to bring this rebellion to an end and the terms he has proposed are so moderate that they shall not want my hearty recommendation  and have you hopes said lady margaret to accomplish a scheme so comprehensive  i should have madam were every whig as moderate as morton and every loyalist as disinterested as major bellenden but such is the fanaticism and violent irritation of both parties that i fear nothing will end this civil war save the edge of the sword  it may be readily supposed that edith listened with the deepest interest to this conversation while she regretted that she had expressed herself harshly and hastily to her lover she felt a conscious and proud satisfaction that his character was even in the judgment of his nobleminded rival such as her own affection had once spoke it  civil feuds and domestic prejudices she said may render it necessary for me to tear his remembrance from my heart but it is not small relief to know assuredly that it is worthy of the place it has so long retained there  while edith was thus retracting her unjust resentment her lover arrived at the camp of the insurgents near hamilton which he found in considerable confusion certain advices had arrived that the royal army having been recruited from england by a large detachment of the kings guards were about to take the field fame magnified their numbers and their high state of equipment and discipline and spread abroad other circumstances which dismayed the courage of the insurgents what favour they might have expected from monmouth was likely to be intercepted by the influence of those associated with him in command his lieutenantgeneral was the celebrated general thomas dalzell who having practised the art of war in the then barbarous country of russia was as much feared for his cruelty and indifference to human life and human sufferings as respected for his steady loyalty and undaunted valour this man was second in command to monmouth and the horse were commanded by claverhouse burning with desire to revenge the death of his nephew and his defeat at drumclog to these accounts was added the most formidable and terrific description of the train of artillery and the cavalry force with which the royal army took the field       note  royal army at bothwell bridge a cameronian muse was      awakened from slumber on this doleful occasion and gave the      following account of the muster of the royal forces in poetry      nearly as melancholy as the subject                      they marched east through lithgowtown                     for to enlarge their forces                     and sent for all the northcountry                     to come both foot and horses                      montrose did come and athole both                     and with them many more                     and all the highland amorites                     that had been there before                      the lowdien mallishalothian militia they                     came with their coats of blew                     five hundred men from london came                     claid in a reddish hue                      when they were assembled one and all                     a full brigade were they                     like to a pack of hellish hounds                     roreing after their prey                      when they were all provided well                     in armour and amonition                     then thither wester did they come                     most cruel of intention       the royalists celebrated their victory in stanzas of equal merit      specimens of both may be found in the curious collection of fugitive      scottish poetry principally of the seventeenth century printed for      the messrs laing edinburgh  large bodies composed of the highland clans having in language religion and manners no connexion with the insurgents had been summoned to join the royal army under their various chieftains and these amorites or philistines as the insurgents termed them came like eagles to the slaughter in fact every person who could ride or run at the kings command was summoned to arms apparently with the purpose of forfeiting and fining such men of property whom their principles might deter from joining the royal standard though prudence prevented them from joining that of the insurgent presbyterians in short everyrumour tended to increase the apprehension among the insurgents that the kings vengeance had only been delayed in order that it might fall more certain and more heavy  morton endeavoured to fortify the minds of the common people by pointing out the probable exaggeration of these reports and by reminding them of the strength of their own situation with an unfordable river in front only passable by a long and narrow bridge he called to their remembrance their victory over claverhouse when their numbers were few and then much worse disciplined and appointed for battle than now showed them that the ground on which they lay afforded by its undulation and the thickets which intersected it considerable protection against artillery and even against cavalry if stoutly defended and that their safety in fact depended on their own spirit and resolution  but while morton thus endeavoured to keep up the courage of the army at large he availed himself of those discouraging rumours to endeavour to impress on the minds of the leaders the necessity of proposing to the government moderate terms of accommodation while they were still formidable as commanding an unbroken and numerous army he pointed out to them that in the present humour of their followers it could hardly be expected that they would engage with advantage the wellappointed and regular force of the duke of monmouth and that if they chanced as was most likely to be defeated and dispersed the insurrection in which they had engaged so far from being useful to the country would be rendered the apology for oppressing it more severely  pressed by these arguments and feeling it equally dangerous to remain together or to dismiss their forces most of the leaders readily agreed that if such terms could be obtained as had been transmitted to the duke of monmouth by the hands of lord evandale the purpose for which they had taken up arms would be in a great measure accomplished they then entered into similar resolutions and agreed to guarantee the petition and remonstrance which had been drawn up by morton on the contrary there were still several leaders and those men whose influence with the people exceeded that of persons of more apparent consequence who regarded every proposal of treaty which did not proceed on the basis of the solemn league and covenant of 1640 as utterly null and void impious and unchristian these men diffused their feelings among the multitude who had little foresight and nothing to lose and persuaded many that the timid counsellors who recommended peace upon terms short of the dethronement of the royal family and the declared independence of the church with respect to the state were cowardly labourers who were about to withdraw their hands from the plough and despicable trimmers who sought only a specious pretext for deserting their brethren in arms these contradictory opinions were fiercely argued in each tent of the insurgent army or rather in the huts or cabins which served in the place of tents violence in language often led to open quarrels and blows and the divisions into which the army of sufferers was rent served as too plain a presage of their future fate      chapter ix                 the curse of growing factions and divisions                still vex your councils                                    venice preserved  the prudence of morton found sufficient occupation in stemming the furious current of these contending parties when two days after his return to hamilton he was visited by his friend and colleague the reverend mr poundtext flying as he presently found from the face of john balfour of burley whom he left not a little incensed at the share he had taken in the liberation of lord evandale when the worthy divine had somewhat recruited his spirits after the hurry and fatigue of his journey he proceeded to give morton an account of what had passed in the vicinity of tillietudlem after the memorable morning of his departure  the night march of morton had been accomplished with such dexterity and the men were so faithful to their trust that burley received no intelligence of what had happened until the morning was far advanced his first enquiry was whether macbriar and kettledrummle had arrived agreeably to the summons which he had dispatched at midnight macbriar had come and kettledrummle though a heavy traveller might he was informed be instantly expected burley then dispatched a messenger to mortons quarters to summon him to an immediate council the messenger returned with news that he had left the place poundtext was next summoned but he thinking as he said himself that it was ill dealing with fractious folk had withdrawn to his own quiet manse preferring a dark ride though he had been on horseback the whole preceding day to a renewal in the morning of a controversy with burley whose ferocity overawed him when unsupported by the firmness of morton burleys next enquiries were directed after lord evandale and great was his rage when he learned that he had been conveyed away over night by a party of the marksmen of milnwood under the immediate command of henry morton himself  the villain exclaimed burley addressing himself to macbriar the base meanspirited traitor to curry favour for himself with the government hath set at liberty the prisoner taken by my own right hand through means of whom i have little doubt the possession of the place of strength which hath wrought us such trouble might now have been in our hands  but is it not in our hands said macbriar looking up towards the keep of the castle and are not these the colours of the covenant that float over its walls  a stratagema mere trick said burley an insult over our disappointment intended to aggravate and embitter our spirits  he was interrupted by the arrival of one of mortons followers sent to report to him the evacuation of the place and its occupation by the insurgent forces burley was rather driven to fury than reconciled by the news of this success  i have watched he saidi have foughti have plottedi have striven for the reduction of this placei have forborne to seek to head enterprises of higher command and of higher honouri have narrowed their outgoings and cut off the springs and broken the staff of bread within their walls and when the men were about to yield themselves to my hand that their sons might be bondsmen and their daughters a laughingstock to our whole camp cometh this youth without a beard on his chin and takes it on him to thrust his sickle into the harvest and to rend the prey from the spoiler surely the labourer is worthy of his hire and the city with its captives should be given to him that wins it  nay said macbriar who was surprised at the degree of agitation which balfour displayed chafe not thyself because of the ungodly heaven will use its own instruments and who knows but this youth  hush hush said burley do not discredit thine own better judgment it was thou that first badest me beware of this painted sepulchrethis lacquered piece of copper that passed current with me for gold it fares ill even with the elect when they neglect the guidance of such pious pastors as thou but our carnal affections will mislead usthis ungrateful boys father was mine ancient friend they must be as earnest in their struggles as thou ephraim macbriar that would shake themselves clear of the clogs and chains of humanity  this compliment touched the preacher in the most sensible part and burley deemed therefore he should find little difficulty in moulding his opinions to the support of his own views more especially as they agreed exactly in their highstrained opinions of church government  let us instantly he said go up to the tower there is that among the records in yonder fortress which well used as i can use it shall be worth to us a valiant leader and an hundred horsemen  but will such be the fitting aids of the children of the covenant said the preacher we have already among us too many who hunger after lands and silver and gold rather than after the word it is not by such that our deliverance shall be wrought out  thou errest said burley we must work by means and these worldly men shall be our instruments at all events the moabitish woman shall be despoiled of her inheritance and neither the malignant evandale nor the erastian morton shall possess yonder castle and lands though they may seek in marriage the daughter thereof  so saying he led the way to tillietudlem where he seized upon the plate and other valuables for the use of the army ransacked the charterroom and other receptacles for family papers and treated with contempt the remonstrances of those who reminded him that the terms granted to the garrison had guaranteed respect to private property  burley and macbriar having established themselves in their new acquisition were joined by kettledrummle in the course of the day and also by the laird of langcale whom that active divine had contrived to seduce as poundtext termed it from the pure light in which he had been brought up thus united they sent to the said poundtext an invitation or rather a summons to attend a council at tillietudlem he remembered however that the door had an iron grate and the keep a dungeon and resolved not to trust himself with his incensed colleagues he therefore retreated or rather fled to hamilton with the tidings that burley macbriar and kettledrummle were coming to hamilton as soon as they could collect a body of cameronians sufficient to overawe the rest of the army  and ye see concluded poundtext with a deep sigh that they will then possess a majority in the council for langcale though he has always passed for one of the honest and rational party cannot be suitably or preceesely termed either fish or flesh or gude redherringwhoever has the stronger party has langcale  thus concluded the heavy narrative of honest poundtext who sighed deeply as he considered the danger in which he was placed betwixt unreasonable adversaries amongst themselves and the common enemy from without morton exhorted him to patience temper and composure informed him of the good hope he had of negotiating for peace and indemnity through means of lord evandale and made out to him a very fair prospect that he should again return to his own parchmentbound calvin his evening pipe of tobacco and his noggin of inspiring ale providing always he would afford his effectual support and concurrence to the measures which he morton had taken for a general pacification       note  moderate presbyterians the author does not by any means      desire that poundtext should be regarded as a just representation of      the moderate presbyterians among whom were many ministers whose      courage was equal to their good sense and sound views of religion      were he to write the tale anew he would probably endeavour to give      the character a higher turn it is certain however that the      cameronians imputed to their opponents in opinion concerning the      indulgence or others of their strained and fanatical notions a      disposition not only to seek their own safety but to enjoy      themselves hamilton speaks of three clergymen of this description      as follows       they pretended great zeal against the indulgence but alas that      was all their practice otherwise being but very gross which i      shall but hint at in short when great cameron and those with him      were taking many a cold blast and storm in the fields and among the      cothouses in scotland these three had for the most part their      residence in glasgow where they found good quarter and a full      table which i doubt not but some bestowed upon them from real      affection to the lords cause and when these three were together      their greatest work was who should make the finest and sharpest      roundel and breathe the quickest jests upon one another and to      tell what valiant acts they were to do and who could laugh loudest      and most heartily among them and when at any time they came out to      the country whatever other things they had they were careful each      of them to have a great flask of brandy with them which was very      heavy to some particularly to mr cameron mr cargill and henry      halli shall name no morefaithful contendings p 198  thus backed and comforted poundtext resolved magnanimously to await the coming of the cameronians to the general rendezvous  burley and his confederates had drawn together a considerable body of these sectaries amounting to a hundred horse and about fifteen hundred foot clouded and severe in aspect morose and jealous in communication haughty of heart and confident as men who believed that the pale of salvation was open for them exclusively while all other christians however slight were the shades of difference of doctrine from their own were in fact little better than outcasts or reprobates these men entered the presbyterian camp rather as dubious and suspicious allies or possibly antagonists than as men who were heartily embarked in the same cause and exposed to the same dangers with their more moderate brethren in arms burley made no private visits to his colleagues and held no communication with them on the subject of the public affairs otherwise than by sending a dry invitation to them to attend a meeting of the general council for that evening  on the arrival of morton and poundtext at the place of assembly they found their brethren already seated slight greeting passed between them and it was easy to see that no amicable conference was intended by those who convoked the council the first question was put by macbriar the sharp eagerness of whose zeal urged him to the van on all occasions he desired to know by whose authority the malignant called lord evandale had been freed from the doom of death justly denounced against him  by my authority and mr mortons replied poundtext who besides being anxious to give his companion a good opinion of his courage confided heartily in his support and moreover had much less fear of encountering one of his own profession and who confined himself to the weapons of theological controversy in which poundtext feared no man than of entering into debate with the stern homicide balfour  and who brother said kettledrummle who gave you authority to interpose in such a high matter  the tenor of our commission answered poundtext gives us authority to bind and to loose if lord evandale was justly doomed to die by the voice of one of our number he was of a surety lawfully redeemed from death by the warrant of two of us  go to go to said burley we know your motives it was to send that silkwormthat gilded trinketthat embroidered trifle of a lord to bear terms of peace to the tyrant  it was so replied morton who saw his companion begin to flinch before the fierce eye of balfourit was so and what thenare we to plunge the nation in endless war in order to pursue schemes which are equally wild wicked and unattainable  hear him said balfour he blasphemeth  it is false said morton they blaspheme who pretend to expect miracles and neglect the use of the human means with which providence has blessed them i repeat itour avowed object is the reestablishment of peace on fair and honourable terms of security to our religion and our liberty we disclaim any desire to tyrannize over those of others  the debate would now have run higher than ever but they were interrupted by intelligence that the duke of monmouth had commenced his march towards the west and was already advanced half way from edinburgh this news silenced their divisions for the moment and it was agreed that the next day should be held as a fast of general humiliation for the sins of the land that the reverend mr poundtext should preach to the army in the morning and kettledrummle in the afternoon that neither should touch upon any topics of schism or of division but animate the soldiers to resist to the blood like brethren in a good cause this healing overture having been agreed to the moderate party ventured upon another proposal confiding that it would have the support of langcale who looked extremely blank at the news which they had just received and might be supposed reconverted to moderate measures it was to be presumed they said that since the king had not intrusted the command of his forces upon the present occasion to any of their active oppressors but on the contrary had employed a nobleman distinguished by gentleness of temper and a disposition favourable to their cause there must be some better intention entertained towards them than they had yet experienced they contended that it was not only prudent but necessary to ascertain from a communication with the duke of monmouth whether he was not charged with some secret instructions in their favour this could only be learned by dispatching an envoy to his army  and who will undertake the task said burley evading a proposal too reasonable to be openly resistedwho will go up to their camp knowing that john grahame of claverhouse hath sworn to hang up whomsoever we shall dispatch towards them in revenge of the death of the young man his nephew  let that be no obstacle said morton i will with pleasure encounter any risk attached to the bearer of your errand  let him go said balfour apart to macbriar our councils will be well rid of his presence  the motion therefore received no contradiction even from those who were expected to have been most active in opposing it and it was agreed that henry morton should go to the camp of the duke of monmouth in order to discover upon what terms the insurgents would be admitted to treat with him as soon as his errand was made known several of the more moderate party joined in requesting him to make terms upon the footing of the petition intrusted to lord evandales hands for the approach of the kings army spread a general trepidation by no means allayed by the high tone assumed by the cameronians which had so little to support it excepting their own headlong zeal with these instructions and with cuddie as his attendant morton set forth towards the royal camp at all the risks which attend those who assume the office of mediator during the heat of civil discord  morton had not proceeded six or seven miles before he perceived that he was on the point of falling in with the van of the royal forces and as he ascended a height saw all the roads in the neighbourhood occupied by armed men marching in great order towards bothwellmuir an open common on which they proposed to encamp for that evening at the distance of scarcely two miles from the clyde on the farther side of which river the army of the insurgents was encamped he gave himself up to the first advancedguard of cavalry which he met as bearer of a flag of truce and communicated his desire to obtain access to the duke of monmouth the noncommissioned officer who commanded the party made his report to his superior and he again to another in still higher command and both immediately rode to the spot where morton was detained  you are but losing your time my friend and risking your life said one of them addressing morton the duke of monmouth will receive no terms from traitors with arms in their hands and your cruelties have been such as to authorize retaliation of every kind better trot your nag back and save his mettle today that he may save your life tomorrow  i cannot think said morton that even if the duke of monmouth should consider us as criminals he would condemn so large a body of his fellowsubjects without even hearing what they have to plead for themselves on my part i fear nothing i am conscious of having consented to or authorized no cruelty and the fear of suffering innocently for the crimes of others shall not deter me from executing my commission  the two officers looked at each other  i have an idea said the younger that this is the young man of whom lord evandale spoke  is my lord evandale in the army said morton  he is not replied the officer we left him at edinburgh too much indisposed to take the fieldyour name sir i presume is henry morton  it is sir answered morton  we will not oppose your seeing the duke sir said the officer with more civility of manner but you may assure yourself it will be to no purpose for were his grace disposed to favour your people others are joined in commission with him who will hardly consent to his doing so  i shall be sorry to find it thus said morton but my duty requires that i should persevere in my desire to have an interview with him  lumley said the superior officer let the duke know of mr mortons arrival and remind his grace that this is the person of whom lord evandale spoke so highly  the officer returned with a message that the general could not see mr morton that evening but would receive him by times in the ensuing morning he was detained in a neighbouring cottage all night but treated with civility and every thing provided for his accommodation early on the next morning the officer he had first seen came to conduct him to his audience  the army was drawn out and in the act of forming column for march or attack the duke was in the centre nearly a mile from the place where morton had passed the night in riding towards the general he had an opportunity of estimating the force which had been assembled for the suppression of the hasty and illconcerted insurrection there were three or four regiments of english the flower of charless armythere were the scottish lifeguards burning with desire to revenge their late defeatother scottish regiments of regulars were also assembled and a large body of cavalry consisting partly of gentlemenvolunteers partly of the tenants of the crown who did military duty for their fiefs morton also observed several strong parties of highlanders drawn from the points nearest to the lowland frontiers a people as already mentioned particularly obnoxious to the western whigs and who hated and despised them in the same proportion these were assembled under their chiefs and made part of this formidable array a complete train of fieldartillery accompanied these troops and the whole had an air so imposing that it seemed nothing short of an actual miracle could prevent the illequipped illmodelled and tumultuary army of the insurgents from being utterly destroyed the officer who accompanied morton endeavoured to gather from his looks the feelings with which this splendid and awful parade of military force had impressed him but true to the cause he had espoused he laboured successfully to prevent the anxiety which he felt from appearing in his countenance and looked around him on the warlike display as on a sight which he expected and to which he was indifferent  you see the entertainment prepared for you said the officers  if i had no appetite for it replied morton i should not have been accompanying you at this moment but i shall be better pleased with a more peaceful regale for the sake of all parties  as they spoke thus they approached the commanderinchief who surrounded by several officers was seated upon a knoll commanding an extensive prospect of the distant country and from which could be easily discovered the windings of the majestic clyde and the distant camp of the insurgents on the opposite bank the officers of the royal army appeared to be surveying the ground with the purpose of directing an immediate attack when captain lumley the officer who accompanied morton had whispered in monmouths ear his name and errand the duke made a signal for all around him to retire excepting only two general officers of distinction while they spoke together in whispers for a few minutes before morton was permitted to advance he had time to study the appearance of the persons with whom he was to treat  it was impossible for any one to look upon the duke of monmouth without being captivated by his personal graces and accomplishments of which the great highpriest of all the nine afterwards recorded  whateer he did was done with so much ease in him alone twas natural to please his motions all accompanied with grace and paradise was opend in his face yet to a strict observer the manly beauty of monmouths face was occasionally rendered less striking by an air of vacillation and uncertainty which seemed to imply hesitation and doubt at moments when decisive resolution was most necessary  beside him stood claverhouse whom we have already fully described and another general officer whose appearance was singularly striking his dress was of the antique fashion of charles the firsts time and composed of shamoy leather curiously slashed and covered with antique lace and garniture his boots and spurs might be referred to the same distant period he wore a breastplate over which descended a grey beard of venerable length which he cherished as a mark of mourning for charles the first having never shaved since that monarch was brought to the scaffold his head was uncovered and almost perfectly bald his high and wrinkled forehead piercing grey eyes and marked features evinced age unbroken by infirmity and stern resolution unsoftened by humanity such is the outline however feebly expressed of the celebrated general thomas dalzell       note  usually called tom dalzell in crichtons memoirs edited by      swift where a particular account of this remarkable persons dress      and habits is given he is said never to have worn boots the      following account of his rencounter with john paton of meadowhead      showed that in action at least he wore pretty stout ones unless      the reader be inclined to believe in the truth of his having a      charm which made him proof against lead       dalzell says patons biographer advanced the whole left wing of      his army on colonel wallaces right here captain paton behaved with      great courage and gallantry dalzell knowing him in the former      wars advanced upon him himself thinking to take him prisoner upon      his approach each presented his pistol on their first discharge      captain paton perceiving his pistol ball to hop upon dalzells      boots and knowing what was the cause he having proof put his      hand in his pocket for some small pieces of silver he had there for      the purpose and put one of them into his other pistol but dalzell      having his eye upon him in the meanwhile retired behind his own      man who by that means was slain  a man more feared and hated by the whigs than even claverhouse himself and who executed the same violences against them out of a detestation of their persons or perhaps an innate severity of temper which grahame only resorted to on political accounts as the best means of intimidating the followers of presbytery and of destroying that sect entirely  the presence of these two generals one of whom he knew by person and the other by description seemed to morton decisive of the fate of his embassy but notwithstanding his youth and inexperience and the unfavourable reception which his proposals seemed likely to meet with he advanced boldly towards them upon receiving a signal to that purpose determined that the cause of his country and of those with whom he had taken up arms should suffer nothing from being intrusted to him monmouth received him with the graceful courtesy which attended even his slightest actions dalzell regarded him with a stern gloomy and impatient frown and claverhouse with a sarcastic smile and inclination of his head seemed to claim him as an old acquaintance  you come sir from these unfortunate people now assembled in arms said the duke of monmouth and your name i believe is morton will you favour us with the pupport of your errand  it is contained my lord answered morton in a paper termed a remonstrance and supplication which my lord evandale has placed i presume in your graces hands  he has done so sir answered the duke and i understand from lord evandale that mr morton has behaved in these unhappy matters with much temperance and generosity for which i have to request his acceptance of my thanks  here morton observed dalzell shake his head indignantly and whisper something into claverhouses ear who smiled in return and elevated his eyebrows but in a degree so slight as scarce to be perceptible the duke taking the petition from his pocket proceeded obviously struggling between the native gentleness of his own disposition and perhaps his conviction that the petitioners demanded no more than their rights and the desire on the other hand of enforcing the kings authority and complying with the sterner opinions of the colleagues in office who had been assigned for the purpose of controlling as well as advising him  there are mr morton in this paper proposals as to the abstract propriety of which i must now waive delivering any opinion some of them appear to me reasonable and just and although i have no express instructions from the king upon the subject yet i assure you mr morton and i pledge my honour that i will interpose in your behalf and use my utmost influence to procure you satisfaction from his majesty but you must distinctly understand that i can only treat with supplicants not with rebels and as a preliminary to every act of favour on my side i must insist upon your followers laying down their arms and dispersing themselves  to do so my lord duke replied morton undauntedly were to acknowledge ourselves the rebels that our enemies term us our swords are drawn for recovery of a birthright wrested from us your graces moderation and good sense has admitted the general justice of our demanda demand which would never have been listened to had it not been accompanied with the sound of the trumpet we cannot therefore and dare not lay down our arms even on your graces assurance of indemnity unless it were accompanied with some reasonable prospect of the redress of the wrongs which we complain of  mr morton replied the duke you are young but you must have seen enough of the world to perceive that requests by no means dangerous or unreasonable in themselves may become so by the way in which they are pressed and supported  we may reply my lord answered morton that this disagreeable mode has not been resorted to until all others have failed  mr morton said the duke i must break this conference short we are in readiness to commence the attack yet i will suspend it for an hour until you can communicate my answer to the insurgents if they please to disperse their followers lay down their arms and send a peaceful deputation to me i will consider myself bound in honour to do all i can to procure redress of their grievances if not let them stand on their guard and expect the consequencesi think gentlemen he added turning to his two colleagues this is the utmost length to which i can stretch my instructions in favour of these misguided persons  by my faith answered dalzell suddenly and it is a length to which my poor judgment durst not have stretched them considering i had both the king and my conscience to answer to but doubtless your grace knows more of the kings private mind than we who have only the letter of our instructions to look to  monmouth blushed deeply you hear he said addressing morton general dalzell blames me for the length which i am disposed to go in your favour  general dalzells sentiments my lord replied morton are such as we expected from him your graces such as we were prepared to hope you might please to entertain indeed i cannot help adding that in the case of the absolute submission upon which you are pleased to insist it might still remain something less than doubtful how far with such counsellors around the king even your graces intercession might procure us effectual relief but i will communicate to our leaders your graces answer to our supplication and since we cannot obtain peace we must bid war welcome as well as we may  good morning sir said the duke i suspend the movements of attack for one hour and for one hour only if you have an answer to return within that space of time i will receive it here and earnestly entreat it may be such as to save the effusion of blood  at this moment another smile of deep meaning passed between dalzell and claverhouse the duke observed it and repeated his words with great dignity  yes gentlemen i said i trusted the answer might be such as would save the effusion of blood i hope the sentiment neither needs your scorn nor incurs your displeasure  dalzell returned the dukes frown with a stern glance but made no answer claverhouse his lip just curled with an ironical smile bowed and said it was not for him to judge the propriety of his graces sentiments  the duke made a signal to morton to withdraw he obeyed and accompanied by his former escort rode slowly through the army to return to the camp of the nonconformists as he passed the fine corps of lifeguards he found claverhouse was already at their head that officer no sooner saw morton than he advanced and addressed him with perfect politeness of manner  i think this is not the first time i have seen mr morton of milnwood  it is not colonel grahames fault said morton smiling sternly that he or any one else should be now incommoded by my presence  allow me at least to say replied claverhouse that mr mortons present situation authorizes the opinion i have entertained of him and that my proceedings at our last meeting only squared to my duty  to reconcile your actions to your duty and your duty to your conscience is your business colonel grahame not mine said morton justly offended at being thus in a manner required to approve of the sentence under which he had so nearly suffered  nay but stay an instant said claverhouse evandale insists that i have some wrongs to acquit myself of in your instance i trust i shall always make some difference between a highminded gentleman who though misguided acts upon generous principles and the crazy fanatical clowns yonder with the bloodthirsty assassins who head them therefore if they do not disperse upon your return let me pray you instantly come over to our army and surrender yourself for be assured they cannot stand our assault for half an hour if you will be ruled and do this be sure to enquire for me monmouth strange as it may seem cannot protect youdalzell will noti both can and will and i have promised to evandale to do so if you will give me an opportunity  i should owe lord evandale my thanks answered morton coldly did not his scheme imply an opinion that i might be prevailed on to desert those with whom i am engaged for you colonel grahame if you will honour me with a different species of satisfaction it is probable that in an hours time you will find me at the west end of bothwell bridge with my sword in my hand  i shall be happy to meet you there said claverhouse but still more so should you think better on my first proposal  they then saluted and parted  that is a pretty lad lumley said claverhouse addressing himself to the other officer but he is a lost manhis blood be upon his head  so saying he addressed himself to the task of preparation for instant battle      chapter x                 but hark the tent has changed its voice                theres peace and rest nae langer                                                   burns                 the lowdien mallisha they                came with their coats of blew                five hundred men from london came                claid in a reddish hue                                         bothwell lines  when morton had left the wellordered outposts of the regular army and arrived at those which were maintained by his own party he could not but be peculiarly sensible of the difference of discipline and entertain a proportional degree of fear for the consequences the same discords which agitated the counsels of the insurgents raged even among their meanest followers and their picquets and patrols were more interested and occupied in disputing the true occasion and causes of wrath and defining the limits of erastian heresy than in looking out for and observing the motions of their enemies though within hearing of the royal drums and trumpets  there was a guard however of the insurgent army posted at the long and narrow bridge of bothwell over which the enemy must necessarily advance to the attack but like the others they were divided and disheartened and entertaining the idea that they were posted on a desperate service they even meditated withdrawing themselves to the main body this would have been utter ruin for on the defence or loss of this pass the fortune of the day was most likely to depend all beyond the bridge was a plain open field excepting a few thickets of no great depth and consequently was ground on which the undisciplined forces of the insurgents deficient as they were in cavalry and totally unprovided with artillery were altogether unlikely to withstand the shock of regular troops  morton therefore viewed the pass carefully and formed the hope that by occupying two or three houses on the left bank of the river with the copse and thickets of alders and hazels that lined its side and by blockading the passage itself and shutting the gates of a portal which according to the old fashion was built on the central arch of the bridge of bothwell it might be easily defended against a very superior force he issued directions accordingly and commanded the parapets of the bridge on the farther side of the portal to be thrown down that they might afford no protection to the enemy when they should attempt the passage morton then conjured the party at this important post to be watchful and upon their guard and promised them a speedy and strong reinforcement he caused them to advance videttes beyond the river to watch the progress of the enemy which outposts he directed should be withdrawn to the left bank as soon as they approached finally he charged them to send regular information to the main body of all that they should observe men under arms and in a situation of danger are usually sufficiently alert in appreciating the merit of their officers mortons intelligence and activity gained the confidence of these men and with better hope and heart than before they began to fortify their position in the manner he recommended and saw him depart with three loud cheers  morton now galloped hastily towards the main body of the insurgents but was surprised and shocked at the scene of confusion and clamour which it exhibited at the moment when good order and concord were of such essential consequence instead of being drawn up in line of battle and listening to the commands of their officers they were crowding together in a confused mass that rolled and agitated itself like the waves of the sea while a thousand tongues spoke or rather vociferated and not a single ear was found to listen scandalized at a scene so extraordinary morton endeavoured to make his way through the press to learn and if possible to remove the cause of this so untimely disorder while he is thus engaged we shall make the reader acquainted with that which he was some time in discovering  the insurgents had proceeded to hold their day of humiliation which agreeably to the practice of the puritans during the earlier civil war they considered as the most effectual mode of solving all difficulties and waiving all discussions it was usual to name an ordinary weekday for this purpose but on this occasion the sabbath itself was adopted owing to the pressure of the time and the vicinity of the enemy a temporary pulpit or tent was erected in the middle of the encampment which according to the fixed arrangement was first to be occupied by the reverend peter poundtext to whom the post of honour was assigned as the eldest clergyman present but as the worthy divine with slow and stately steps was advancing towards the rostrum which had been prepared for him he was prevented by the unexpected apparition of habakkuk mucklewrath the insane preacher whose appearance had so much startled morton at the first council of the insurgents after their victory at loudonhill it is not known whether he was acting under the influence and instigation of the cameronians or whether he was merely compelled by his own agitated imagination and the temptation of a vacant pulpit before him to seize the opportunity of exhorting so respectable a congregation it is only certain that he took occasion by the forelock sprung into the pulpit cast his eyes wildly round him and undismayed by the murmurs of many of the audience opened the bible read forth as his text from the thirteenth chapter of deuteronomy certain men the children of belial are gone out from among you and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city saying let us go and serve other gods which you have not known and then rushed at once into the midst of his subject  the harangue of mucklewrath was as wild and extravagant as his intrusion was unauthorized and untimely but it was provokingly coherent in so far as it turned entirely upon the very subjects of discord of which it had been agreed to adjourn the consideration until some more suitable opportunity not a single topic did he omit which had offence in it and after charging the moderate party with heresy with crouching to tyranny with seeking to be at peace with gods enemies he applied to morton by name the charge that he had been one of those men of belial who in the words of his text had gone out from amongst them to withdraw the inhabitants of his city and to go astray after false gods to him and all who followed him or approved of his conduct mucklewrath denounced fury and vengeance and exhorted those who would hold themselves pure and undefiled to come up from the midst of them  fear not he said because of the neighing of horses or the glittering of breastplates seek not aid of the egyptians because of the enemy though they may be numerous as locusts and fierce as dragons their trust is not as our trust nor their rock as our rock how else shall a thousand fly before one and two put ten thousand to the flight i dreamed it in the visions of the night and the voice said habakkuk take thy fan and purge the wheat from the chaff that they be not both consumed with the fire of indignation and the lightning of fury wherefore i say take this henry mortonthis wretched achan who hath brought the accursed thing among ye and made himself brethren in the camp of the enemytake him and stone him with stones and thereafter burn him with fire that the wrath may depart from the children of the covenant he hath not taken a babylonish garment but he hath sold the garment of righteousness to the woman of babylonhe hath not taken two hundred shekels of fine silver but he hath bartered the truth which is more precious than shekels of silver or wedges of gold  at this furious charge brought so unexpectedly against one of their most active commanders the audience broke out into open tumult some demanding that there should instantly be a new election of officers into which office none should hereafter be admitted who had in their phrase touched of that which was accursed or temporized more or less with the heresies and corruptions of the times while such was the demand of the cameronians they vociferated loudly that those who were not with them were against themthat it was no time to relinquish the substantial part of the covenanted testimony of the church if they expected a blessing on their arms and their cause and that in their eyes a lukewarm presbyterian was little better than a prelatist an anticovenanter and a nullifidian  the parties accused repelled the charge of criminal compliance and defection from the truth with scorn and indignation and charged their accusers with breach of faith as well as with wrongheaded and extravagant zeal in introducing such divisions into an army the joint strength of which could not by the most sanguine be judged more than sufficient to face their enemies poundtext and one or two others made some faint efforts to stem the increasing fury of the factious exclaiming to those of the other party in the words of the patriarchlet there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee and between thy herdsmen and my herdsmen for we be brethren no pacific overture could possibly obtain audience it was in vain that even burley himself when he saw the dissension proceed to such ruinous lengths exerted his stern and deep voice commanding silence and obedience to discipline the spirit of insubordination had gone forth and it seemed as if the exhortation of habakkuk mucklewrath had communicated a part of his frenzy to all who heard him the wiser or more timid part of the assembly were already withdrawing themselves from the field and giving up their cause as lost others were moderating a harmonious call as they somewhat improperly termed it to new officers and dismissing those formerly chosen and that with a tumult and clamour worthy of the deficiency of good sense and good order implied in the whole transaction it was at this moment when morton arrived in the field and joined the army in total confusion and on the point of dissolving itself his arrival occasioned loud exclamations of applause on the one side and of imprecation on the other  what means this ruinous disorder at such a moment he exclaimed to burley who exhausted with his vain exertions to restore order was now leaning on his sword and regarding the confusion with an eye of resolute despair  it means he replied that god has delivered us into the hands of our enemies  not so answered morton with a voice and gesture which compelled many to listen it is not god who deserts us it is we who desert him and dishonour ourselves by disgracing and betraying the cause of freedom and religionhear me he exclaimed springing to the pulpit which mucklewrath had been compelled to evacuate by actual exhaustioni bring from the enemy an offer to treat if you incline to lay down your arms i can assure you the means of making an honourable defence if you are of more manly tempers the time flies fast on let us resolve either for peace or war and let it not be said of us in future days that six thousand scottish men in arms had neither courage to stand their ground and fight it out nor prudence to treat for peace nor even the cowards wisdom to retreat in good time and with safety what signifies quarrelling on minute points of churchdiscipline when the whole edifice is threatened with total destruction o remember my brethren that the last and worst evil which god brought upon the people whom he had once chosenthe last and worst punishment of their blindness and hardness of heart was the bloody dissensions which rent asunder their city even when the enemy were thundering at its gates  some of the audience testified their feeling of this exhortation by loud exclamations of applause others by hooting and exclaimingto your tents o israel  morton who beheld the columns of the enemy already beginning to appear on the right bank and directing their march upon the bridge raised his voice to its utmost pitch and pointing at the same time with his hand exclaimedsilence your senseless clamours yonder is the enemy on maintaining the bridge against him depend our lives as well as our hope to reclaim our laws and libertiesthere shall at least one scottishman die in their defencelet any one who loves his country follow me  the multitude had turned their heads in the direction to which he pointed the sight of the glittering files of the english footguards supported by several squadrons of horse of the cannon which the artillerymen were busily engaged in planting against the bridge of the plaided clans who seemed to search for a ford and of the long succession of troops which were destined to support the attack silenced at once their clamorous uproar and struck them with as much consternation as if it were an unexpected apparition and not the very thing which they ought to have been looking out for they gazed on each other and on their leaders with looks resembling those that indicate the weakness of a patient when exhausted by a fit of frenzy yet when morton springing from the rostrum directed his steps towards the bridge he was followed by about an hundred of the young men who were particularly attached to his command  burley turned to macbriarephraim he said it is providence points us the way through the worldly wisdom of this latitudinarian youthhe that loves the light let him follow burley  tarry replied macbriar it is not by henry morton or such as he that our goingsout and our comingsin are to be meted therefore tarry with us i fear treachery to the host from this nullifidian achanthou shalt not go with him thou art our chariots and our horsemen  hinder me not replied burley he hath well said that all is lost if the enemy win the bridgetherefore let me not shall the children of this generation be called wiser or braver than the children of the sanctuaryarray yourselves under your leaderslet us not lack supplies of men and ammunition and accursed be he who turneth back from the work on this great day  having thus spoken he hastily marched towards the bridge and was followed by about two hundred of the most gallant and zealous of his party there was a deep and disheartened pause when morton and burley departed the commanders availed themselves of it to display their lines in some sort of order and exhorted those who were most exposed to throw themselves upon their faces to avoid the cannonade which they might presently expect the insurgents ceased to resist or to remonstrate but the awe which had silenced their discords had dismayed their courage they suffered themselves to be formed into ranks with the docility of a flock of sheep but without possessing for the time more resolution or energy for they experienced a sinking of the heart imposed by the sudden and imminent approach of the danger which they had neglected to provide against while it was yet distant they were however drawn out with some regularity and as they still possessed the appearance of an army their leaders had only to hope that some favourable circumstance would restore their spirits and courage  kettledrummle poundtext macbriar and other preachers busied themselves in their ranks and prevailed on them to raise a psalm but the superstitious among them observed as an ill omen that their song of praise and triumph sunk into a quaver of consternation and resembled rather a penitentiary stave sung on the scaffold of a condemned criminal than the bold strain which had resounded along the wild heath of loudonhill in anticipation of that days victory the melancholy melody soon received a rough accompaniment the royal soldiers shouted the highlanders yelled the cannon began to fire on one side and the musketry on both and the bridge of bothwell with the banks adjacent were involved in wreaths of smoke      chapter xi                      as eer ye saw the rain doun fa                     or yet the arrow from the bow                     sae our scots lads fell even down                     and they lay slain on every knowe                                         old ballad  ere morton or burley had reached the post to be defended the enemy had commenced an attack upon it with great spirit the two regiments of footguards formed into a close column rushed forward to the river one corps deploying along the right bank commenced a galling fire on the defenders of the pass while the other pressed on to occupy the bridge the insurgents sustained the attack with great constancy and courage and while part of their number returned the fire across the river the rest maintained a discharge of musketry upon the further end of the bridge itself and every avenue by which the soldiers endeavoured to approach it the latter suffered severely but still gained ground and the head of their column was already upon the bridge when the arrival of morton changed the scene and his marksmen commencing upon the pass a fire as well aimed as it was sustained and regular compelled the assailants to retire with much loss they were a second time brought up to the charge and a second time repulsed with still greater loss as burley had now brought his party into action the fire was continued with the utmost vehemence on both sides and the issue of the action seemed very dubious  monmouth mounted on a superb white charger might be discovered on the top of the right bank of the river urging entreating and animating the exertions of his soldiers by his orders the cannon which had hitherto been employed in annoying the distant main body of the presbyterians were now turned upon the defenders of the bridge but these tremendous engines being wrought much more slowly than in modern times did not produce the effect of annoying or terrifying the enemy to the extent proposed the insurgents sheltered by copsewood along the bank of the river or stationed in the houses already mentioned fought under cover while the royalists owing to the precautions of morton were entirely exposed the defence was so protracted and obstinate that the royal generals began to fear it might be ultimately successful while monmouth threw himself from his horse and rallying the footguards brought them on to another close and desperate attack he was warmly seconded by dalzell who putting himself at the head of a body of lennoxhighlanders rushed forward with their tremendous warcry of lochsloy       note this was the slogan or warcry of the macfarlanes taken from      a lake near the head of loch lomond in the centre of their ancient      possessions on the western banks of that beautiful inland sea  the ammunition of the defenders of the bridge began to fail at this important crisis messages commanding and imploring succours and supplies were in vain dispatched one after the other to the main body of the presbyterian army which remained inactively drawn up on the open fields in the rear fear consternation and misrule had gone abroad among them and while the post on which their safety depended required to be instantly and powerfully reinforced there remained none either to command or to obey  as the fire of the defenders of the bridge began to slacken that of the assailants increased and in its turn became more fatal animated by the example and exhortations of their generals they obtained a footing upon the bridge itself and began to remove the obstacles by which it was blockaded the portalgate was broke open the beams trunks of trees and other materials of the barricade pulled down and thrown into the river this was not accomplished without opposition morton and burley fought in the very front of their followers and encouraged them with their pikes halberds and partisans to encounter the bayonets of the guards and the broadswords of the highlanders but those behind the leaders began to shrink from the unequal combat and fly singly or in parties of two or three towards the main body until the remainder were by the mere weight of the hostile column as much as by their weapons fairly forced from the bridge the passage being now open the enemy began to pour over but the bridge was long and narrow which rendered the manoeuvre slow as well as dangerous and those who first passed had still to force the houses from the windows of which the covenanters continued to fire burley and morton were near each other at this critical moment  there is yet time said the former to bring down horse to attack them ere they can get into order and with the aid of god we may thus regain the bridgehasten thou to bring them down while i make the defence good with this old and wearied body  morton saw the importance of the advice and throwing himself on the horse which cuddie held in readiness for him behind the thicket galloped towards a body of cavalry which chanced to be composed entirely of cameronians ere he could speak his errand or utter his orders he was saluted by the execrations of the whole body  he flies they exclaimedthe cowardly traitor flies like a hart from the hunters and hath left valiant burley in the midst of the slaughter  i do not fly said morton i come to lead you to the attack advance boldly and we shall yet do well  follow him notfollow him notsuch were the tumultuous exclamations which resounded from the rankshe hath sold you to the sword of the enemy  and while morton argued entreated and commanded in vain the moment was lost in which the advance might have been useful and the outlet from the bridge with all its defences being in complete possession of the enemy burley and his remaining followers were driven back upon the main body to whom the spectacle of their hurried and harassed retreat was far from restoring the confidence which they so much wanted  in the meanwhile the forces of the king crossed the bridge at their leisure and securing the pass formed in line of battle while claverhouse who like a hawk perched on a rock and eyeing the time to pounce on its prey had watched the event of the action from the opposite bank now passed the bridge at the head of his cavalry at full trot and leading them in squadrons through the intervals and round the flanks of the royal infantry formed them in line on the moor and led them to the charge advancing in front with one large body while other two divisions threatened the flanks of the covenanters their devoted army was now in that situation when the slightest demonstration towards an attack was certain to inspire panic their broken spirits and disheartened courage were unable to endure the charge of the cavalry attended with all its terrible accompaniments of sight and soundthe rush of the horses at full speed the shaking of the earth under their feet the glancing of the swords the waving of the plumes and the fierce shouts of the cavaliers the front ranks hardly attempted one illdirected and disorderly fire and their rear were broken and flying in confusion ere the charge had been completed and in less than five minutes the horsemen were mixed with them cutting and hewing without mercy the voice of claverhouse was heard even above the din of conflict exclaiming to his soldierskill killno quarterthink on richard grahame the dragoons many of whom had shared the disgrace of loudonhill required no exhortations to vengeance as easy as it was complete their swords drank deep of slaughter among the unresisting fugitives screams for quarter were only answered by the shouts with which the pursuers accompanied their blows and the whole field presented one general scene of confused slaughter flight and pursuit  about twelve hundred of the insurgents who remained in a body a little apart from the rest and out of the line of the charge of cavalry threw down their arms and surrendered at discretion upon the approach of the duke of monmouth at the head of the infantry that mildtempered nobleman instantly allowed them the quarter which they prayed for and galloping about through the field exerted himself as much to stop the slaughter as he had done to obtain the victory while busied in this humane task he met with general dalzell who was encouraging the fierce highlanders and royal volunteers to show their zeal for king and country by quenching the flame of the rebellion with the blood of the rebels  sheathe your sword i command you general exclaimed the duke and sound the retreat enough of blood has been shed give quarter to the kings misguided subjects  i obey your grace said the old man wiping his bloody sword and returning it to the scabbard but i warn you at the same time that enough has not been done to intimidate these desperate rebels has not your grace heard that basil olifant has collected several gentlemen and men of substance in the west and is in the act of marching to join them  basil olifant said the duke who or what is he  the next male heir to the last earl of torwood he is disaffected to government from his claim to the estate being set aside in favour of lady margaret bellenden and i suppose the hope of getting the inheritance has set him in motion  be his motives what they will replied monmouth he must soon disperse his followers for this army is too much broken to rally again therefore once more i command that the pursuit be stopped  it is your graces province to command and to be responsible for your commands answered dalzell as he gave reluctant orders for checking the pursuit  but the fiery and vindictive grahame was already far out of hearing of the signal of retreat and continued with his cavalry an unwearied and bloody pursuit breaking dispersing and cutting to pieces all the insurgents whom they could come up with  burley and morton were both hurried off the field by the confused tide of fugitives they made some attempt to defend the streets of the town of hamilton but while labouring to induce the fliers to face about and stand to their weapons burley received a bullet which broke his swordarm  may the hand be withered that shot the shot he exclaimed as the sword which he was waving over his head fell powerless to his side i can fight no longer note this incident and burleys exclamation are taken from the records  then turning his horses head he retreated out of the confusion morton also now saw that the continuing his unavailing efforts to rally the fliers could only end in his own death or captivity and followed by the faithful cuddie he extricated himself from the press and being well mounted leaped his horse over one or two enclosures and got into the open country  from the first hill which they gained in their flight they looked back and beheld the whole country covered with their fugitive companions and with the pursuing dragoons whose wild shouts and halloo as they did execution on the groups whom they overtook mingled with the groans and screams of their victims rose shrilly up the hill  it is impossible they can ever make head again said morton  the heads taen aff them as clean as i wad bite it aff a sybo rejoined cuddie eh lord see how the broadswords are flashing wars a fearsome thing theyll be cunning that catches me at this wark againbut for gods sake sir let us mak for some strength  morton saw the necessity of following the advice of his trusty squire they resumed a rapid pace and continued it without intermission directing their course towards the wild and mountainous country where they thought it likely some part of the fugitives might draw together for the sake either of making defence or of obtaining terms      chapter xii                              they require                of heaven the hearts of lions breath of tigers                yea and the fierceness too                                              fletcher  evening had fallen and for the last two hours they had seen none of their illfated companions when morton and his faithful attendant gained the moorland and approached a large and solitary farmhouse situated in the entrance of a wild glen far remote from any other habitation  our horses said morton will carry us no farther without rest or food and we must try to obtain them here if possible  so speaking he led the way to the house the place had every appearance of being inhabited there was smoke issuing from the chimney in a considerable volume and the marks of recent hoofs were visible around the door they could even hear the murmuring of human voices within the house but all the lower windows were closely secured and when they knocked at the door no answer was returned after vainly calling and entreating admittance they withdrew to the stable or shed in order to accommodate their horses ere they used farther means of gaining admission in this place they found ten or twelve horses whose state of fatigue as well as the military yet disordered appearance of their saddles and accoutrements plainly indicated that their owners were fugitive insurgents in their own circumstances  this meeting bodes luck said cuddie and they hae walth o beef thats ae thing certain for heres a raw hide that has been about the hurdies o a stot not half an hour syneits warm yet  encouraged by these appearances they returned again to the house and announcing themselves as men in the same predicament with the inmates clamoured loudly for admittance  whoever ye be answered a stern voice from the window after a long and obdurate silence disturb not those who mourn for the desolation and captivity of the land and search out the causes of wrath and of defection that the stumblingblocks may be removed over which we have stumbled  they are wild western whigs said cuddie in a whisper to his master i ken by their language fiend hae me if i like to venture on them  morton however again called to the party within and insisted on admittance but finding his entreaties still disregarded he opened one of the lower windows and pushing asunder the shutters which were but slightly secured stepped into the large kitchen from which the voice had issued cuddie followed him muttering betwixt his teeth as he put his head within the window that he hoped there was nae scalding brose on the fire and master and servant both found themselves in the company of ten or twelve armed men seated around the fire on which refreshments were preparing and busied apparently in their devotions  in the gloomy countenances illuminated by the firelight morton had no difficulty in recognising several of those zealots who had most distinguished themselves by their intemperate opposition to all moderate measures together with their noted pastor the fanatical ephraim macbriar and the maniac habakkuk mucklewrath the cameronians neither stirred tongue nor hand to welcome their brethren in misfortune but continued to listen to the low murmured exercise of macbriar as he prayed that the almighty would lift up his hand from his people and not make an end in the day of his anger that they were conscious of the presence of the intruders only appeared from the sullen and indignant glances which they shot at them from time to time as their eyes encountered  morton finding into what unfriendly society he had unwittingly intruded began to think of retreating but on turning his head observed with some alarm that two strong men had silently placed themselves beside the window through which they had entered one of these ominous sentinels whispered to cuddie son of that precious woman mause headrigg do not cast thy lot farther with this child of treachery and perditionpass on thy way and tarry not for the avenger of blood is behind thee  with this he pointed to the window out of which cuddie jumped without hesitation for the intimation he had received plainly implied the personal danger he would otherwise incur  winnocks are no lucky wi me was his first reflection when he was in the open air his next was upon the probable fate of his master theyll kill him the murdering loons and think theyre doing a gude turn but ise tak the back road for hamilton and see if i canna get some o our ain folk to bring help in time of needcessity  so saying cuddie hastened to the stable and taking the best horse he could find instead of his own tired animal he galloped off in the direction he proposed  the noise of his horses tread alarmed for an instant the devotion of the fanatics as it died in the distance macbriar brought his exercise to a conclusion and his audience raised themselves from the stooping posture and louring downward look with which they had listened to it and all fixed their eyes sternly on henry morton  you bend strange countenances on me gentlemen said he addressing them i am totally ignorant in what manner i can have deserved them  out upon thee out upon thee exclaimed mucklewrath starting up the word that thou hast spurned shall become a rock to crush and to bruise thee the spear which thou wouldst have broken shall pierce thy side we have prayed and wrestled and petitioned for an offering to atone the sins of the congregation and lo the very head of the offence is delivered into our hand he hath burst in like a thief through the window he is a ram caught in the thicket whose blood shall be a drinkoffering to redeem vengeance from the church and the place shall from henceforth be called jehovahjireh for the sacrifice is provided up then and bind the victim with cords to the horns of the altar  there was a movement among the party and deeply did morton regret at that moment the incautious haste with which he had ventured into their company he was armed only with his sword for he had left his pistols at the bow of his saddle and as the whigs were all provided with firearms there was little or no chance of escaping from them by resistance the interposition however of macbriar protected him for the moment  tarry yet a while brethrenlet us not use the sword rashly lest the load of innocent blood lie heavy on uscome he said addressing himself to morton we will reckon with thee ere we avenge the cause thou hast betrayedhast thou not he continued made thy face as hard as flint against the truth in all the assemblies of the host  he hashe has murmured the deep voices of the assistants  he hath ever urged peace with the malignants said one  and pleaded for the dark and dismal guilt of the indulgence said another  and would have surrendered the host into the hands of monmouth echoed a third and was the first to desert the honest and manly burley while he yet resisted at the pass i saw him on the moor with his horse bloody with spurring long ere the firing had ceased at the bridge  gentlemen said morton if you mean to bear me down by clamour and take my life without hearing me it is perhaps a thing in your power but you will sin before god and man by the commission of such a murder  i say hear the youth said macbriar for heaven knows our bowels have yearned for him that he might be brought to see the truth and exert his gifts in its defence but he is blinded by his carnal knowledge and has spurned the light when it blazed before him  silence being obtained morton proceeded to assert the good faith which he had displayed in the treaty with monmouth and the active part he had borne in the subsequent action  i may not gentlemen he said be fully able to go the lengths you desire in assigning to those of my own religion the means of tyrannizing over others but none shall go farther in asserting our own lawful freedom and i must needs aver that had others been of my mind in counsel or disposed to stand by my side in battle we should this evening instead of being a defeated and discordant remnant have sheathed our weapons in an useful and honourable peace or brandished them triumphantly after a decisive victory  he hath spoken the word said one of the assemblyhe hath avowed his carnal selfseeking and erastianism let him die the death  peace yet again said macbriar for i will try him furtherwas it not by thy means that the malignant evandale twice escaped from death and captivity was it not through thee that miles bellenden and his garrison of cutthroats were saved from the edge of the sword  i am proud to say that you have spoken the truth in both instances replied morton  lo you see said macbriar again hath his mouth spoken itand didst thou not do this for the sake of a midianitish woman one of the spawn of prelacy a toy with which the archenemys trap is baited didst thou not do all this for the sake of edith bellenden  you are incapable answered morton boldly of appreciating my feelings towards that young lady but all that i have done i would have done had she never existed  thou art a hardy rebel to the truth said another darkbrowd man and didst thou not so act that by conveying away the aged woman margaret bellenden and her granddaughter thou mightest thwart the wise and godly project of john balfour of burley for bringing forth to battle basil olifant who had agreed to take the field if he were insured possession of these womens worldly endowments  i never heard of such a scheme said morton and therefore i could not thwart itbut does your religion permit you to take such uncreditable and immoral modes of recruiting  peace said macbriar somewhat disconcerted it is not for thee to instruct tender professors or to construe covenant obligations for the rest you have acknowledged enough of sin and sorrowful defection to draw down defeat on a host were it as numerous as the sands on the seashore and it is our judgment that we are not free to let you pass from us safe and in life since providence hath given you into our hands at the moment that we prayed with godly joshua saying what shall we say when israel turneth their backs before their enemiesthen camest thou delivered to us as it were by lot that thou mightest sustain the punishment of one that hath wrought folly in israel therefore mark my words this is the sabbath and our hand shall not be on thee to spill thy blood upon this day but when the twelfth hour shall strike it is a token that thy time on earth hath run wherefore improve thy span for it flitteth fast awayseize on the prisoner brethren and take his weapon  the command was so unexpectedly given and so suddenly executed by those of the party who had gradually closed behind and around morton that he was overpowered disarmed and a horsegirth passed round his arms before he could offer any effectual resistance when this was accomplished a dead and stern silence took place the fanatics ranged themselves around a large oaken table placing morton amongst them bound and helpless in such a manner as to be opposite to the clock which was to strike his knell food was placed before them of which they offered their intended victim a share but it will readily be believed he had little appetite when this was removed the party resumed their devotions macbriar whose fierce zeal did not perhaps exclude some feelings of doubt and compunction began to expostulate in prayer as if to wring from the deity a signal that the bloody sacrifice they proposed was an acceptable service the eyes and ears of his hearers were anxiously strained as if to gain some sight or sound which might be converted or wrested into a type of approbation and ever and anon dark looks were turned on the dialplate of the timepiece to watch its progress towards the moment of execution  mortons eye frequently took the same course with the sad reflection that there appeared no posibility of his life being expanded beyond the narrow segment which the index had yet to travel on the circle until it arrived at the fatal hour faith in his religion with a constant unyielding principle of honour and the sense of conscious innocence enabled him to pass through this dreadful interval with less agitation than he himself could have expected had the situation been prophesied to him yet there was a want of that eager and animating sense of right which supported him in similar circumstances when in the power of claverhouse then he was conscious that amid the spectators were many who were lamenting his condition and some who applauded his conduct but now among these paleeyed and ferocious zealots whose hardened brows were soon to be bent not merely with indifference but with triumph upon his executionwithout a friend to speak a kindly word or give a look either of sympathy or encouragementawaiting till the sword destined to slay him crept out of the scabbard gradually and as it were by strawbreadths and condemned to drink the bitterness of death drop by dropit is no wonder that his feelings were less composed than they had been on any former occasion of danger his destined executioners as he gazed around them seemed to alter their forms and features like spectres in a feverish dream their figures became larger and their faces more disturbed and as an excited imagination predominated over the realities which his eyes received he could have thought himself surrounded rather by a band of demons than of human beings the walls seemed to drop with blood and the light tick of the clock thrilled on his ear with such loud painful distinctness as if each sound were the prick of a bodkin inflicted on the naked nerve of the organ   illustration morton awaiting deathfrontispiece2   it was with pain that he felt his mind wavering while on the brink between this and the future world he made a strong effort to compose himself to devotional exercises and unequal during that fearful strife of nature to arrange his own thoughts into suitable expressions he had instinctively recourse to the petition for deliverance and for composure of spirit which is to be found in the book of common prayer of the church of england macbriar whose family were of that persuasion instantly recognised the words which the unfortunate prisoner pronounced half aloud  there lacked but this he said his pale cheek kindling with resentment to root out my carnal reluctance to see his blood spilt he is a prelatist who has sought the camp under the disguise of an erastian and all and more than all that has been said of him must needs be verity his blood be on his head the deceiverlet him go down to tophet with the illmumbled mass which he calls a prayerbook in his right hand  i take up my song against him exclaimed the maniac as the sun went back on the dial ten degrees for intimating the recovery of holy hezekiah so shall it now go forward that the wicked may be taken away from among the people and the covenant established in its purity  he sprang to a chair with an attitude of frenzy in order to anticipate the fatal moment by putting the index forward and several of the party began to make ready their slaughterweapons for immediate execution when mucklewraths hand was arrested by one of his companions  hist he saidi hear a distant noise  it is the rushing of the brook over the pebbles said one  it is the sough of the wind among the bracken said another  it is the galloping of horse said morton to himself his sense of hearing rendered acute by the dreadful situation in which he stood god grant they may come as my deliverers  the noise approached rapidly and became more and more distinct  it is horse cried macbriar look out and descry who they are  the enemy are upon us cried one who had opened the window in obedience to his order  a thick trampling and loud voices were heard immediately round the house some rose to resist and some to escape the doors and windows were forced at once and the red coats of the troopers appeared in the apartment  have at the bloody rebelsremember cornet grahame was shouted on every side  the lights were struck down but the dubious glare of the fire enabled them to continue the fray several pistolshots were fired the whig who stood next to morton received a shot as he was rising stumbled against the prisoner whom he bore down with his weight and lay stretched above him a dying man this accident probably saved morton from the damage he might otherwise have received in so close a struggle where firearms were discharged and swordblows given for upwards of five minutes  is the prisoner safe exclaimed the wellknown voice of claverhouse look about for him and dispatch the whig dog who is groaning there  both orders were executed the groans of the wounded man were silenced by a thrust with a rapier and morton disencumbered of his weight was speedily raised and in the arms of the faithful cuddie who blubbered for joy when he found that the blood with which his master was covered had not flowed from his own veins a whisper in mortons ear while his trusty follower relieved him from his bonds explained the secret of the very timely appearance of the soldiers  i fell into claverhouses party when i was seeking for some o our ain folk to help ye out o the hands of the whigs sae being atween the deil and the deep sea i een thought it best to bring him on wi me for hell be wearied wi felling folk the night and the morns a new day and lord evandale awes ye a day in haarst and monmouth gies quarter the dragoons tell me for the asking sae haud up your heart an ise warrant well do a weel eneugh yet       note note to chapter xii the principal incident of the foregoing      chapter was suggested by an occurrence of a similar kind told me by      a gentleman now deceased who held an important situation in the      excise to which he had been raised by active and resolute exertions      in an inferior department when employed as a supervisor on the      coast of galloway at a time when the immunities of the isle of man      rendered smuggling almost universal in that district this gentleman      had the fortune to offend highly several of the leaders in the      contraband trade by his zeal in serving the revenue       this rendered his situation a dangerous one and on more than one      occasion placed his life in jeopardy at one time in particular as      he was riding after sunset on a summer evening he came suddenly      upon a gang of the most desperate smugglers in that part of the      country they surrounded him without violence but in such a manner      as to show that it would be resorted to if he offered resistance      and gave him to understand he must spend the evening with them      since they had met so happily the officer did not attempt      opposition but only asked leave to send a country lad to tell his      wife and family that he should be detained later than he expected      as he had to charge the boy with this message in the presence of the      smugglers he could found no hope of deliverance from it save what      might arise from the sharpness of the lads observation and the      natural anxiety and affection of his wife but if his errand should      be delivered and received literally as he was conscious the      smugglers expected it was likely that it might by suspending alarm      about his absence from home postpone all search after him till it      might be useless making a merit of necessity therefore he      instructed and dispatched his messenger and went with the      contraband traders with seeming willingness to one of their      ordinary haunts he sat down at table with them and they began to      drink and indulge themselves in gross jokes while like mirabel in      the inconstant their prisoner had the heavy task of receiving      their insolence as wit answering their insults with goodhumour      and withholding from them the opportunity which they sought of      engaging him in a quarrel that they might have a pretence for      misusing him he succeeded for some time but soon became satisfied      it was their purpose to murder him outright or else to beat him in      such a manner as scarce to leave him with life a regard for the      sanctity of the sabbath evening which still oddly subsisted among      these ferocious men amidst their habitual violation of divine and      social law prevented their commencing their intended cruelty until      the sabbath should be terminated they were sitting around their      anxious prisoner muttering to each other words of terrible import      and watching the index of a clock which was shortly to strike the      hour at which in their apprehension murder would become lawful      when their intended victim heard a distant rustling like the wind      among withered leaves it came nearer and resembled the sound of a      brook in flood chafing within its banks it came nearer yet and was      plainly distinguished as the galloping of a party of horse the      absence of her husband and the account given by the boy of the      suspicious appearance of those with whom he had remained had      induced mrsto apply to the neighbouring town for a party of      dragoons who thus providentially arrived in time to save him from      extreme violence if not from actual destruction      chapter xiii                 sound sound the clarion fill the fife                to all the sensual world proclaim                one crowded hour of glorious life                is worth an age without a name                                         anonymous  when the desperate affray had ceased claverhouse commanded his soldiers to remove the dead bodies to refresh themselves and their horses and prepare for passing the night at the farmhouse and for marching early in the ensuing morning he then turned his attention to morton and there was politeness and even kindness in the manner in which he addressed him  you would have saved yourself risk from both sides mr morton if you had honoured my counsel yesterday morning with some attention but i respect your motives you are a prisonerofwar at the disposal of the king and council but you shall be treated with no incivility and i will be satisfied with your parole that you will not attempt an escape  when morton had passed his word to that effect claverhouse bowed civilly and turning away from him called for his sergeantmajor  how many prisoners halliday and how many killed  three killed in the house sir two cut down in the court and one in the gardensix in all four prisoners  armed or unarmed said claverhouse  three of them armed to the teeth answered halliday one without armshe seems to be a preacher  aythe trumpeter to the longeard rout i suppose replied claverhouse glancing slightly round upon his victims i will talk with him tomorrow take the other three down to the yard draw out two files and fire upon them and dye hear make a memorandum in the orderly book of three rebels taken in arms and shot with the date and name of the placedrumshinnel i think they call itlook after the preacher till tomorrow as he was not armed he must undergo a short examination or better perhaps take him before the privy council i think they should relieve me of a share of this disgusting drudgerylet mr morton be civilly used and see that the men look well after their horses and let my groom wash wildbloods shoulder with some vinegar the saddle has touched him a little  all these various ordersfor life and death the securing of his prisoners and the washing his chargers shoulderwere given in the same unmoved and equable voice of which no accent or tone intimated that the speaker considered one direction as of more importance than another  the cameronians so lately about to be the willing agents of a bloody execution were now themselves to undergo it they seemed prepared alike for either extremity nor did any of them show the least sign of fear when ordered to leave the room for the purpose of meeting instant death their severe enthusiasm sustained them in that dreadful moment and they departed with a firm look and in silence excepting that one of them as he left the apartment looked claverhouse full in the face and pronounced with a stern and steady voicemischief shall haunt the violent man to which grahame only answered by a smile of contempt  they had no sooner left the room than claverhouse applied himself to some food which one or two of his party had hastily provided and invited morton to follow his example observing it had been a busy day for them both morton declined eating for the sudden change of circumstancesthe transition from the verge of the grave to a prospect of life had occasioned a dizzy revulsion in his whole system but the same confused sensation was accompanied by a burning thirst and he expressed his wish to drink  i will pledge you with all my heart said claverhouse for here is a black jack full of ale and good it must be if there be good in the country for the whigs never miss to find it outmy service to you mr morton he said filling one horn of ale for himself and handing another to his prisoner  morton raised it to his head and was just about to drink when the discharge of carabines beneath the window followed by a deep and hollow groan repeated twice or thrice and more faint at each interval announced the fate of the three men who had just left them morton shuddered and set down the untasted cup  you are but young in these matters mr morton said claverhouse after he had very composedly finished his draught and i do not think the worse of you as a young soldier for appearing to feel them acutely but habit duty and necessity reconcile men to every thing  i trust said morton they will never reconcile me to such scenes as these  you would hardly believe said claverhouse in reply that in the beginning of my military career i had as much aversion to seeing blood spilt as ever man felt it seemed to me to be wrung from my own heart and yet if you trust one of those whig fellows he will tell you i drink a warm cup of it every morning before i breakfast note the author is uncertain whether this was ever said of claverhouse but it was currently reported of sir robert grierson of lagg another of the persecutors that a cup of wine placed in his hand turned to clotted blood but in truth mr morton why should we care so much for death light upon us or around us whenever it may men die dailynot a bell tolls the hour but it is the deathnote of some one or other and why hesitate to shorten the span of others or take overanxious care to prolong our own it is all a lotterywhen the hour of midnight came you were to dieit has struck you are alive and safe and the lot has fallen on those fellows who were to murder you it is not the expiring pang that is worth thinking of in an event that must happen one day and may befall us on any given momentit is the memory which the soldier leaves behind him like the long train of light that follows the sunken sunthat is all which is worth caring for which distinguishes the death of the brave or the ignoble when i think of death mr morton as a thing worth thinking of it is in the hope of pressing one day some wellfought and hardwon field of battle and dying with the shout of victory in my earthat would be worth dying for and more it would be worth having lived for  at the moment when grahame delivered these sentiments his eye glancing with the martial enthusiasm which formed such a prominent feature in his character a gory figure which seemed to rise out of the floor of the apartment stood upright before him and presented the wild person and hideous features of the maniac so often mentioned his face where it was not covered with bloodstreaks was ghastly pale for the hand of death was on him he bent upon claverhouse eyes in which the grey light of insanity still twinkled though just about to flit for ever and exclaimed with his usual wildness of ejaculation wilt thou trust in thy bow and in thy spear in thy steed and in thy banner and shall not god visit thee for innocent bloodwilt thou glory in thy wisdom and in thy courage and in thy might and shall not the lord judge theebehold the princes for whom thou hast sold thy soul to the destroyer shall be removed from their place and banished to other lands and their names shall be a desolation and an astonishment and a hissing and a curse and thou who hast partaken of the winecup of fury and hast been drunken and mad because thereof the wish of thy heart shall be granted to thy loss and the hope of thine own pride shall destroy thee i summon thee john grahame to appear before the tribunal of god to answer for this innocent blood and the seas besides which thou hast shed  he drew his right hand across his bleeding face and held it up to heaven as he uttered these words which he spoke very loud and then added more faintly how long o lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge the blood of thy saints  as he uttered the last word he fell backwards without an attempt to save himself and was a dead man ere his head touched the floor  morton was much shocked at this extraordinary scene and the prophecy of the dying man which tallied so strangely with the wish which claverhouse had just expressed and he often thought of it afterwards when that wish seemed to be accomplished two of the dragoons who were in the apartment hardened as they were and accustomed to such scenes showed great consternation at the sudden apparition the event and the words which preceded it claverhouse alone was unmoved at the first instant of mucklewraths appearance he had put his hand to his pistol but on seeing the situation of the wounded wretch he immediately withdrew it and listened with great composure to his dying exclamation  when he dropped claverhouse asked in an unconcerned tone of voicehow came the fellow herespeak you staring fool he added addressing the nearest dragoon unless you would have me think you such a poltroon as to fear a dying man  the dragoon crossed himself and replied with a faltering voicethat the dead fellow had escaped their notice when they removed the other bodies as he chanced to have fallen where a cloak or two had been flung aside and covered him  take him away now then you gaping idiot and see that he does not bite you to put an old proverb to shamethis is a new incident mr morton that dead men should rise and push us from our stools i must see that my blackguards grind their swords sharper they used not to do their work so slovenlybut we have had a busy day they are tired and their blades blunted with their bloody work and i suppose you mr morton as well as i are well disposed for a few hours repose  so saying he yawned and taking a candle which a soldier had placed ready saluted morton courteously and walked to the apartment which had been prepared for him  morton was also accommodated for the evening with a separate room being left alone his first occupation was the returning thanks to heaven for redeeming him from danger even through the instrumentality of those who seemed his most dangerous enemies he also prayed sincerely for the divine assistance in guiding his course through times which held out so many dangers and so many errors and having thus poured out his spirit in prayer before the great being who gave it he betook himself to the repose which he so much required      chapter xiv                 the charge is prepared the lawyers are met                the judges all rangeda terrible show                                         beggars opera  so deep was the slumber which succeeded the agitation and embarrassment of the preceding day that morton hardly knew where he was when it was broken by the tramp of horses the hoarse voice of men and the wild sound of the trumpets blowing the reveille the sergeantmajor immediately afterwards came to summon him which he did in a very respectful manner saying the general for claverhouse now held that rank hoped for the pleasure of his company upon the road in some situations an intimation is a command and morton considered that the present occasion was one of these he waited upon claverhouse as speedily as he could found his own horse saddled for his use and cuddie in attendance both were deprived of their firearms though they seemed otherwise rather to make part of the troop than of the prisoners and morton was permitted to retain his sword the wearing which was in those days the distinguishing mark of a gentleman claverhouse seemed also to take pleasure in riding beside him in conversing with him and in confounding his ideas when he attempted to appreciate his real character the gentleness and urbanity of that officers general manners the high and chivalrous sentiments of military devotion which he occasionally expressed his deep and accurate insight into the human bosom demanded at once the approbation and the wonder of those who conversed with him while on the other hand his cold indifference to military violence and cruelty seemed altogether inconsistent with the social and even admirable qualities which he displayed morton could not help in his heart contrasting him with balfour of burley and so deeply did the idea impress him that he dropped a hint of it as they rode together at some distance from the troop  you are right said claverhouse with a smile you are very rightwe are both fanatics but there is some distinction between the fanaticism of honour and that of dark and sullen superstition  yet you both shed blood without mercy or remorse said morton who could not suppress his feelings  surely said claverhouse with the same composure but of what kindthere is a difference i trust between the blood of learned and reverend prelates and scholars of gallant soldiers and noble gentlemen and the red puddle that stagnates in the veins of psalmsinging mechanics crackbrained demagogues and sullen boorssome distinction in short between spilling a flask of generous wine and dashing down a can full of base muddy ale  your distinction is too nice for my comprehension replied morton god gives every spark of lifethat of the peasant as well as of the prince and those who destroy his work recklessly or causelessly must answer in either case what right for example have i to general grahames protection now more than when i first met him  and narrowly escaped the consequences you would say answered claverhousewhy i will answer you frankly then i thought i had to do with the son of an old roundheaded rebel and the nephew of a sordid presbyterian laird now i know your points better and there is that about you which i respect in an enemy as much as i like in a friend i have learned a good deal concerning you since our first meeting and i trust that you have found that my construction of the information has not been unfavourable to you  but yet said morton  but yet interrupted grahame taking up the word you would say you were the same when i first met you that you are now true but then how could i know that though by the by even my reluctance to suspend your execution may show you how high your abilities stood in my estimation  do you expect general said morton that i ought to be particularly grateful for such a mark of your esteem  poh poh you are critical returned claverhouse i tell you i thought you a different sort of person did you ever read froissart  no was mortons answer  i have half a mind said claverhouse to contrive you should have six months imprisonment in order to procure you that pleasure his chapters inspire me with more enthusiasm than even poetry itself and the noble canon with what true chivalrous feeling he confines his beautiful expressions of sorrow to the death of the gallant and highbred knight of whom it was a pity to see the fall such was his loyalty to his king pure faith to his religion hardihood towards his enemy and fidelity to his ladyloveah benedicite how he will mourn over the fall of such a pearl of knighthood be it on the side he happens to favour or on the other but truly for sweeping from the face of the earth some few hundreds of villain churls who are born but to plough it the highborn and inquisitive historian has marvellous little sympathyas little or less perhaps than john grahame of claverhouse  there is one ploughman in your possession general for whom said morton in despite of the contempt in which you hold a profession which some philosophers have considered as useful as that of a soldier i would humbly request your favour  you mean said claverhouse looking at a memorandum book one hatherickhedderickororheadrigg ay cuthbert or cuddie headrigghere i have him o never fear him if he will be but tractable the ladies of tillietudlem made interest with me on his account some time ago he is to marry their waitingmaid i think he will be allowed to slip off easy unless his obstinacy spoils his good fortune  he has no ambition to be a martyr i believe said morton  tis the better for him said claverhouse but besides although the fellow had more to answer for i should stand his friend for the sake of the blundering gallantry which threw him into the midst of our ranks last night when seeking assistance for you i never desert any man who trusts me with such implicit confidence but to deal sincerely with you he has been long in our eyehere halliday bring me up the black book  the sergeant having committed to his commander this ominous record of the disaffected which was arranged in alphabetical order claverhouse turning over the leaves as he rode on began to read names as they occurred  gumblegumption a minister aged 50 indulged close sly and so forthpooh poohhehei have him hereheathercat outlaweda preachera zealous cameroniankeeps a conventicle among the campsie hillstusho here is headriggcuthbert his mother a bitter puritanhimself a simple fellowlike to be forward in action but of no genius for plotsmore for the hand than the head and might be drawn to the right side but for his attachment tohere claverhouse looked at morton and then shut the book and changed his tone faithful and true are words never thrown away upon me mr morton you may depend on the young mans safety  does it not revolt a mind like yours said morton to follow a system which is to be supported by such minute enquiries after obscure individuals  you do not suppose we take the trouble said the general haughtily the curates for their own sakes willingly collect all these materials for their own regulation in each parish they know best the black sheep of the flock i have had your picture for three years  indeed replied morton will you favour me by imparting it  willingly said claverhouse it can signify little for you cannot avenge yourself on the curate as you will probably leave scotland for some time  this was spoken in an indifferent tone morton felt an involuntary shudder at hearing words which implied a banishment from his native land but ere he answered claverhouse proceeded to read henry morton son of silas morton colonel of horse for the scottish parliament nephew and apparent heir of morton of milnwoodimperfectly educated but with spirit beyond his yearsexcellent at all exercisesindifferent to forms of religion but seems to incline to the presbyterianhas highflown and dangerous notions about liberty of thought and speech and hovers between a latitudinarian and an enthusiast much admired and followed by the youth of his own agemodest quiet and unassuming in manner but in his heart peculiarly bold and intractable he ishere follow three red crosses mr morton which signify triply dangerous you see how important a person you arebut what does this fellow want  a horseman rode up as he spoke and gave a letter claverhouse glanced it over laughed scornfully bade him tell his master to send his prisoners to edinburgh for there was no answer and as the man turned back said contemptuously to mortonhere is an ally of yours deserted from you or rather i should say an ally of your good friend burleyhear how he sets forthdear sir i wonder when we were such intimates may it please your excellency to accept my humble congratulations on the victoryhumhumblessed his majestys army i pray you to understand i have my people under arms to take and intercept all fugitives and have already several prisoners and so forth subscribed basil olifantyou know the fellow by name i suppose  a relative of lady margaret bellenden replied morton is he not  ay replied grahame and heirmale of her fathers family though a distant one and moreover a suitor to the fair edith though discarded as an unworthy one but above all a devoted admirer of the estate of tillietudlem and all thereunto belonging  he takes an ill mode of recommending himself said morton suppressing his feelings to the family at tillietudlem by corresponding with our unhappy party  o this precious basil will turn cat in pan with any man replied claverhouse he was displeased with the government because they would not overturn in his favour a settlement of the late earl of torwood by which his lordship gave his own estate to his own daughter he was displeased with lady margaret because she avowed no desire for his alliance and with the pretty edith because she did not like his tall ungainly person so he held a close correspondence with burley and raised his followers with the purpose of helping him providing always he needed no help that is if you had beat us yesterday and now the rascal pretends he was all the while proposing the kings service and for aught i know the council will receive his pretext for current coin for he knows how to make friends among themand a dozen scores of poor vagabond fanatics will be shot or hanged while this cunning scoundrel lies hid under the double cloak of loyalty welllined with the foxfur of hypocrisy  with conversation on this and other matters they beguiled the way claverhouse all the while speaking with great frankness to morton and treating him rather as a friend and companion than as a prisoner so that however uncertain of his fate the hours he passed in the company of this remarkable man were so much lightened by the varied play of his imagination and the depth of his knowledge of human nature that since the period of his becoming a prisoner of war which relieved him at once from the cares of his doubtful and dangerous station among the insurgents and from the consequences of their suspicious resentment his hours flowed on less anxiously than at any time since his having commenced actor in public life he was now with respect to his fortune like a rider who has flung his reins on the horses neck and while he abandoned himself to circumstances was at least relieved from the task of attempting to direct them in this mood he journeyed on the number of his companions being continually augmented by detached parties of horse who came in from every quarter of the country bringing with them for the most part the unfortunate persons who had fallen into their power at length they approached edinburgh  our council said claverhouse being resolved i suppose to testify by their present exultation the extent of their former terror have decreed a kind of triumphal entry to us victors and our captives but as i do not quite approve the taste of it i am willing to avoid my own part in the show and at the same time to save you from yours  so saying he gave up the command of the forces to allan now a lieutenantcolonel and turning his horse into a bylane rode into the city privately accompanied by morton and two or three servants when claverhouse arrived at the quarters which he usually occupied in the canongate he assigned to his prisoner a small apartment with an intimation that his parole confined him to it for the present  after about a quarter of an hour spent in solitary musing on the strange vicissitudes of his late life the attention of morton was summoned to the window by a great noise in the street beneath trumpets drums and kettledrums contended in noise with the shouts of a numerous rabble and apprised him that the royal cavalry were passing in the triumphal attitude which claverhouse had mentioned the magistrates of the city attended by their guard of halberds had met the victors with their welcome at the gate of the city and now preceded them as a part of the procession the next object was two heads borne upon pikes and before each bloody head were carried the hands of the dismembered sufferers which were by the brutal mockery of those who bore them often approached towards each other as if in the attitude of exhortation or prayer these bloody trophies belonged to two preachers who had fallen at bothwell bridge after them came a cart led by the executioners assistant in which were placed macbriar and other two prisoners who seemed of the same profession they were bareheaded and strongly bound yet looked around them with an air rather of triumph than dismay and appeared in no respect moved either by the fate of their companions of which the bloody evidences were carried before them or by dread of their own approaching execution which these preliminaries so plainly indicated  behind these prisoners thus held up to public infamy and derision came a body of horse brandishing their broadswords and filling the wide street with acclamations which were answered by the tumultuous outcries and shouts of the rabble who in every considerable town are too happy in being permitted to huzza for any thing whatever which calls them together in the rear of these troopers came the main body of the prisoners at the head of whom were some of their leaders who were treated with every circumstance of inventive mockery and insult several were placed on horseback with their faces to the animals tail others were chained to long bars of iron which they were obliged to support in their hands like the galleyslaves in spain when travelling to the port where they are to be put on shipboard the heads of others who had fallen were borne in triumph before the survivors some on pikes and halberds some in sacks bearing the names of the slaughtered persons labelled on the outside such were the objects who headed the ghastly procession who seemed as effectually doomed to death as if they wore the sanbenitos of the condemned heretics in an autodafe note david hackston of rathillet who was wounded and made prisoner in the skirmish of airsmoss in which the celebrated cameron fell was on entering edinburgh by order of the council received by the magistrates at the watergate and set on a horses bare back with his face to the tail and the other three laid on a goad of iron and carried up the street mr camerons head being on a halberd before them  behind them came on the nameless crowd to the number of several hundreds some retaining under their misfortunes a sense of confidence in the cause for which they suffered captivity and were about to give a still more bloody testimony others seemed pale dispirited dejected questioning in their own minds their prudence in espousing a cause which providence seemed to have disowned and looking about for some avenue through which they might escape from the consequences of their rashness others there were who seemed incapable of forming an opinion on the subject or of entertaining either hope confidence or fear but who foaming with thirst and fatigue stumbled along like overdriven oxen lost to every thing but their present sense of wretchedness and without having any distinct idea whether they were led to the shambles or to the pasture these unfortunate men were guarded on each hand by troopers and behind them came the main body of the cavalry whose military music resounded back from the high houses on each side of the street and mingled with their own songs of jubilee and triumph and the wild shouts of the rabble  morton felt himself heartsick while he gazed on the dismal spectacle and recognised in the bloody heads and still more miserable and agonized features of the living sufferers faces which had been familiar to him during the brief insurrection he sunk down in a chair in a bewildered and stupified state from which he was awakened by the voice of cuddie  lord forgie us sir said the poor fellow his teeth chattering like a pair of nutcrackers his hair erect like boars bristles and his face as pale as that of a corpselord forgie us sir we maun instantly gang before the councilo lord what made them send for a puir bodie

sic a guse o cuddie if i can do better but heres claverhouse himsellthe lord preserve and forgie us i say anes mair  you must immediately attend the council mr morton said claverhouse who entered while cuddie spoke and your servant must go with you you need be under no apprehension for the consequences to yourself personally but i warn you that you will see something that will give you much pain and from which i would willingly have saved you if i had possessed the power my carriage waits usshall we go  it will be readily supposed that morton did not venture to dispute this invitation however unpleasant he rose and accompanied claverhouse  i must apprise you said the latter as he led the way down stairs that you will get off cheap and so will your servant provided he can keep his tongue quiet  cuddie caught these last words to his exceeding joy  deil a fear o me said he an my mither disna pit her finger in the pie  at that moment his shoulder was seized by old mause who had contrived to thrust herself forward into the lobby of the apartment  o hinny hinny said she to cuddie hanging upon his neck glad and proud and sorry and humbled am i ain ane and the same instant to see my bairn ganging to testify for the truth gloriously with his mouth in council as he did with his weapon in the field  whisht whisht mither cried cuddie impatiently odd ye daft wife is this a time

out of his mothers embraces and requested the soldiers who took him in charge to conduct him to the place of examination without delay he had been already preceded by claverhouse and morton      chapter xv                      my native land good night                                         lord byron  the privy council of scotland in whom the practice since the union of the crowns vested great judicial powers as well as the general superintendence of the executive department was met in the ancient dark gothic room adjoining to the house of parliament in edinburgh when general grahame entered and took his place amongst the members at the council table  you have brought us a leash of game today general said a nobleman of high place amongst them here is a craven to confessa cock of the game to stand at bayand what shall i call the third general  without further metaphor i will entreat your grace to call him a person in whom i am specially interested replied claverhouse  and a whig into the bargain said the nobleman lolling out a tongue which was at all times too big for his mouth and accommodating his coarse features to a sneer to which they seemed to be familiar  yes please your grace a whig as your grace was in 1641 replied claverhouse with his usual appearance of imperturbable civility  he has you there i think my lord duke said one of the privy councillors  ay ay returned the duke laughing theres no speaking to him since drumclogbut come bring in the prisonersand do you mr clerk read the record  the clerk read forth a bond in which general grahame of claverhouse and lord evandale entered themselves securities that henry morton younger of milnwood should go abroad and remain in foreign parts until his majestys pleasure was further known in respect of the said henry mortons accession to the late rebellion and that under penalty of life and limb to the said henry morton and of ten thousand marks to each of his securities  do you accept of the kings mercy upon these terms mr morton said the duke of lauderdale who presided in the council  i have no other choice my lord replied morton  then subscribe your name in the record  morton did so without reply conscious that in the circumstances of his case it was impossible for him to have escaped more easily macbriar who was at the same instant brought to the foot of the counciltable bound upon a chair for his weakness prevented him from standing beheld morton in the act of what he accounted apostasy  he hath summed his defection by owning the carnal power of the tyrant he exclaimed with a deep groana fallen stara fallen star  hold your peace sir said the duke and keep your ain breath to cool your ain porridgeyell find them scalding hot i promise youcall in the other fellow who has some common sense one sheep will leap the ditch when another goes first  cuddie was introduced unbound but under the guard of two halberdiers and placed beside macbriar at the foot of the table the poor fellow cast a piteous look around him in which were mingled awe for the great men in whose presence he stood and compassion for his fellowsufferers with no small fear of the personal consequences which impended over himself he made his clownish obeisances with a double portion of reverence and then awaited the opening of the awful scene  were you at the battle of bothwell brigg was the first question which was thundered in his ears  cuddie meditated a denial but had sense enough upon reflection to discover that the truth would be too strong for him so he replied with true caledonian indirectness of response ill no say but it may be possible that i might hae been there  answer directly you knaveyes or noyou know you were there  its no for me to contradict your lordships graces honour said cuddie  once more sir were you thereyes or no said the duke impatiently  dear stir again replied cuddie how can ane mind preceesely where they hae been a the days o their life  speak out you scoundrel said general dalzell or ill dash your teeth out with my dudgeonhaftdo you think we can stand here all day to be turning and dodging with you like greyhounds after a hare note the general is said to have struck one of the captive whigs when under examination with the hilt of his sabre so that the blood gushed out the provocation for this unmanly violence was that the prisoner had called the fierce veteran a muscovy beast who used to roast men dalzell had been long in the russian service which in those days was no school of humanity  aweel then said cuddie since naething else will please ye write down that i cannot deny but i was there  well sir said the duke and do you think that the rising upon that occasion was rebellion or not  im no just free to gie my opinion stir said the cautious captive on what might cost my neck but i doubt it will be very little better  better than what  just than rebellion as your honour cas it replied cuddie  well sir thats speaking to the purpose replied his grace and are you content to accept of the kings pardon for your guilt as a rebel and to keep the church and pray for the king  blithely stir answered the unscrupulous cuddie and drink his health into the bargain when the ales gude  egad said the duke this is a hearty cockwhat brought you into such a scrape mine honest friend  just ill example stir replied the prisoner and a daft auld jaud of a mither wi reverence to your graces honour  why godamercy my friend replied the duke take care of bad advice another time i think you are not likely to commit treason on your own scoremake out his free pardon and bring forward the rogue in the chair  macbriar was then moved forward to the post of examination  were you at the battle of bothwell bridge was in like manner demanded of him  i was answered the prisoner in a bold and resolute tone  were you armed  i was noti went in my calling as a preacher of gods word to encourage them that drew the sword in his cause  in other words to aid and abet the rebels said the duke  thou hast spoken it replied the prisoner  well then continued the interrogator let us know if you saw john balfour of burley among the partyi presume you know him  i bless god that i do know him replied macbriar he is a zealous and a sincere christian  and when and where did you last see this pious personage was the query which immediately followed  i am here to answer for myself said macbriar in the same dauntless manner and not to endanger others  we shall know said dalzell how to make you find your tongue  if you can make him fancy himself in a conventicle answered lauderdale he will find it without youcome laddie speak while the play is goodyoure too young to bear the burden will be laid on you else  i defy you retorted macbriar this has not been the first of my imprisonments or of my sufferings and young as i may be i have lived long enough to know how to die when i am called upon  ay but there are some things which must go before an easy death if you continue obstinate said lauderdale and rung a small silver bell which was placed before him on the table  a dark crimson curtain which covered a sort of niche or gothic recess in the wall rose at the signal and displayed the public executioner a tall grim and hideous man having an oaken table before him on which lay thumbscrews and an iron case called the scottish boot used in those tyrannical days to torture accused persons morton who was unprepared for this ghastly apparition started when the curtain arose but macbriars nerves were more firm he gazed upon the horrible apparatus with much composure and if a touch of nature called the blood from his cheek for a second resolution sent it back to his brow with greater energy  do you know who that man is said lauderdale in a low stern voice almost sinking into a whisper  he is i suppose replied macbriar the infamous executioner of your bloodthirsty commands upon the persons of gods people he and you are equally beneath my regard and i bless god i no more fear what he can inflict than what you can command flesh and blood may shrink under the sufferings you can doom me to and poor frail nature may shed tears or send forth cries but i trust my soul is anchored firmly on the rock of ages  do your duty said the duke to the executioner  the fellow advanced and asked with a harsh and discordant voice upon which of the prisoners limbs he should first employ his engine  let him choose for himself said the duke i should like to oblige him in any thing that is reasonable  since you leave it to me said the prisoner stretching forth his right leg take the besti willingly bestow it in the cause for which i suffer note this was the reply actually made by james mitchell when subjected to the torture of the boot for an attempt to assassinate archbishop sharpe  the executioner with the help of his assistants enclosed the leg and knee within the tight iron boot or case and then placing a wedge of the same metal between the knee and the edge of the machine took a mallet in his hand and stood waiting for farther orders a welldressed man by profession a surgeon placed himself by the other side of the prisoners chair bared the prisoners arm and applied his thumb to the pulse in order to regulate the torture according to the strength of the patient when these preparations were made the president of the council repeated with the same stern voice the question when and where did you last see john balfour of burley  the prisoner instead of replying to him turned his eyes to heaven as if imploring divine strength and muttered a few words of which the last were distinctly audible thou hast said thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power  the duke of lauderdale glanced his eye around the council as if to collect their suffrages and judging from their mute signs gave on his own part a nod to the executioner whose mallet instantly descended on the wedge and forcing it between the knee and the iron boot occasioned the most exquisite pain as was evident from the flush which instantly took place on the brow and on the cheeks of the sufferer the fellow then again raised his weapon and stood prepared to give a second blow  will you yet say repeated the duke of lauderdale where and when you last parted from balfour of burley  you have my answer said the sufferer resolutely and the second blow fell the third and fourth succeeded but at the fifth when a larger wedge had been introduced the prisoner set up a scream of agony  morton whose blood boiled within him at witnessing such cruelty could bear no longer and although unarmed and himself in great danger was springing forward when claverhouse who observed his emotion withheld him by force laying one hand on his arm and the other on his mouth while he whispered for gods sake think where you are  this movement fortunately for him was observed by no other of the councillors whose attention was engaged with the dreadful scene before them  he is gone said the surgeonhe has fainted my lords and human nature can endure no more  release him said the duke and added turning to dalzell he will make an old proverb good for hell scarce ride today though he has had his boots on i suppose we must finish with him  ay dispatch his sentence and have done with him we have plenty of drudgery behind  strong waters and essences were busily employed to recall the senses of the unfortunate captive and when his first faint gasps intimated a return of sensation the duke pronounced sentence of death upon him as a traitor taken in the act of open rebellion and adjudged him to be carried from the bar to the common place of execution and there hanged by the neck his head and hands to be stricken off after death and disposed of according to the pleasure of the council note the pleasure of the council respecting the relics of their victims was often as savage as the rest of their conduct the heads of the preachers were frequently exposed on pikes between their two hands the palms displayed as in the attitude of prayer when the celebrated richard camerons head was exposed in this manner a spectator bore testimony to it as that of one who lived praying and preaching and died praying and fighting and all and sundry his movable goods and gear escheat and inbrought to his majestys use  doomster he continued repeat the sentence to the prisoner  the office of doomster was in those days and till a much later period held by the executioner in commendam with his ordinary functions note see a note on the subject of this office in the heart of midlothian the duty consisted in reciting to the unhappy criminal the sentence of the law as pronounced by the judge which acquired an additional and horrid emphasis from the recollection that the hateful personage by whom it was uttered was to be the agent of the cruelties he denounced macbriar had scarce understood the purport of the words as first pronounced by the lord president of the council but he was sufficiently recovered to listen and to reply to the sentence when uttered by the harsh and odious voice of the ruffian who was to execute it and at the last awful words and this i pronounce for doom he answered boldly my lords i thank you for the only favour i looked for or would accept at your hands namely that you have sent the crushed and maimed carcass which has this day sustained your cruelty to this hasty end it were indeed little to me whether i perish on the gallows or in the prisonhouse but if death following close on what i have this day suffered had found me in my cell of darkness and bondage many might have lost the sight how a christian man can suffer in the good cause for the rest i forgive you my lords for what you have appointed and i have sustainedand why should i notye send me to a happy exchangeto the company of angels and the spirits of the just for that of frail dust and ashesye send me from darkness into dayfrom mortality to immortalityand in a word from earth to heavenif the thanks therefore and pardon of a dying man can do you good take them at my hand and may your last moments be as happy as mine  as he spoke thus with a countenance radiant with joy and triumph he was withdrawn by those who had brought him into the apartment and executed within half an hour dying with the same enthusiastic firmness which his whole life had evinced  the council broke up and morton found himself again in the carriage with general grahame  marvellous firmness and gallantry said morton as he reflected upon macbriars conduct what a pity it is that with such selfdevotion and heroism should have been mingled the fiercer features of his sect  you mean said claverhouse his resolution to condemn you to death to that he would have reconciled himself by a single text for example and phinehas arose and executed judgment or something to the same purposebut wot ye where you are now bound mr morton  we are on the road to leith i observe answered morton can i not be permitted to see my friends ere i leave my native land  your uncle replied grahame has been spoken to and declines visiting you the good gentleman is terrified and not without some reason that the crime of your treason may extend itself over his lands and tenementshe sends you however his blessing and a small sum of money lord evandale continues extremely indisposed major bellenden is at tillietudlem putting matters in order the scoundrels have made great havoc there with lady margarets muniments of antiquity and have desecrated and destroyed what the good lady called the throne of his most sacred majesty is there any one else whom you would wish to see  morton sighed deeply as he answered noit would avail nothingbut my preparationssmall as they are some must be necessary  they are all ready for you said the general lord evandale has anticipated all you wish here is a packet from him with letters of recommendation for the court of the stadtholder prince of orange to which i have added one or two i made my first campaigns under him and first saw fire at the battle of seneff note august 1674 claverhouse greatly distinguished himself in this action and was made captain there are also bills of exchange for your immediate wants and more will be sent when you require it  morton heard all this and received the parcel with an astounded and confused look so sudden was the execution of the sentence of banishment  and my servant he said  he shall be taken care of and replaced if it be practicable in the service of lady margaret bellenden i think he will hardly neglect the parade of the feudal retainers or go awhigging a second timebut here we are upon the quay and the boat waits you  it was even as claverhouse said a boat waited for captain morton with the trunks and baggage belonging to his rank claverhouse shook him by the hand and wished him good fortune and a happy return to scotland in quieter times  i shall never forget he said the gallantry of your behaviour to my friend evandale in circumstances when many men would have sought to rid him out of their way  another friendly pressure and they parted as morton descended the pier to get into the boat a hand placed in his a letter folded up in very small space he looked round the person who gave it seemed much muffled up he pressed his finger upon his lip and then disappeared among the crowd the incident awakened mortons curiosity and when he found himself on board of a vessel bound for rotterdam and saw all his companions of the voyage busy making their own arrangements he took an opportunity to open the billet thus mysteriously thrust upon him it ran thusthy courage on the fatal day when israel fled before his enemies hath in some measure atoned for thy unhappy owning of the erastian interest these are not days for ephraim to strive with israel i know thy heart is with the daughter of the stranger but turn from that folly for in exile and in flight and even in death itself shall my hand be heavy against that bloody and malignant house and providence hath given me the means of meting unto them with their own measure of ruin and confiscation the resistance of their stronghold was the main cause of our being scattered at bothwell bridge and i have bound it upon my soul to visit it upon them wherefore think of her no more but join with our brethren in banishment whose hearts are still towards this miserable land to save and to relieve her there is an honest remnant in holland whose eyes are looking out for deliverance join thyself unto them like the true son of the stout and worthy silas morton and thou wilt have good acceptance among them for his sake and for thine own working shouldst thou be found worthy again to labour in the vineyard thou wilt at all times hear of my incomings and outgoings by enquiring after quintin mackell of irongray at the house of that singular christian woman bessie maclure near to the place called the howff where niel blane entertaineth guests so much from him who hopes to hear again from thee in brotherhood resisting unto blood and striving against sin meanwhile possess thyself in patience keep thy sword girded and thy lamp burning as one that wakes in the night for he who shall judge the mount of esau and shall make false professors as straw and malignants as stubble will come in the fourth watch with garments dyed in blood and the house of jacob shall be for spoil and the house of joseph for fire i am he that hath written it whose hand hath been on the mighty in the waste field  this extraordinary letter was subscribed j b of b but the signature of these initials was not necessary for pointing out to morton that it could come from no other than burley it gave him new occasion to admire the indomitable spirit of this man who with art equal to his courage and obstinacy was even now endeavouring to reestablish the web of conspiracy which had been so lately torn to pieces but he felt no sort of desire in the present moment to sustain a correspondence which must be perilous or to renew an association which in so many ways had been nearly fatal to him the threats which burley held out against the family of bellenden he considered as a mere expression of his spleen on account of their defence of tillietudlem and nothing seemed less likely than that at the very moment of their party being victorious their fugitive and distressed adversary could exercise the least influence over their fortunes  morton however hesitated for an instant whether he should not send the major or lord evandale intimation of burleys threats upon consideration he thought he could not do so without betraying his confidential correspondence for to warn them of his menaces would have served little purpose unless he had given them a clew to prevent them by apprehending his person while by doing so he deemed he should commit an ungenerous breach of trust to remedy an evil which seemed almost imaginary upon mature consideration therefore he tore the letter having first made a memorandum of the name and place where the writer was to be heard of and threw the fragments into the sea  while morton was thus employed the vessel was unmoored and the white sails swelled out before a favourable northwest wind the ship leaned her side to the gale and went roaring through the waves leaving a long and rippling furrow to track her course the city and port from which he had sailed became undistinguishable in the distance the hills by which they were surrounded melted finally into the blue sky and morton was separated for several years from the land of his nativity      chapter xvi                      whom does time gallop withal                                         as you like it  it is fortunate for taletellers that they are not tied down like theatrical writers to the unities of time and place but may conduct their personages to athens and thebes at their pleasure and bring them back at their convenience time to use rosalinds simile has hitherto paced with the hero of our tale for betwixt mortons first appearance as a competitor for the popinjay and his final departure for holland hardly two months elapsed years however glided away ere we find it possible to resume the thread of our narrative and time must be held to have galloped over the interval craving therefore the privilege of my cast i entreat the readers attention to the continuation of the narrative as it starts from a new era being the year immediately subsequent to the british revolution  scotland had just begun to repose from the convulsion occasioned by a change of dynasty and through the prudent tolerance of king william had narrowly escaped the horrors of a protracted civil war agriculture began to revive and men whose minds had been disturbed by the violent political concussions and the general change of government in church and state had begun to recover their ordinary temper and to give the usual attention to their own private affairs in lieu of discussing those of the public the highlanders alone resisted the newly established order of things and were in arms in a considerable body under the viscount of dundee whom our readers have hitherto known by the name of grahame of claverhouse but the usual state of the highlands was so unruly that their being more or less disturbed was not supposed greatly to affect the general tranquillity of the country so long as their disorders were confined within their own frontiers in the lowlands the jacobites now the undermost party had ceased to expect any immediate advantage by open resistance and were in their turn driven to hold private meetings and form associations for mutual defence which the government termed treason while they cried out persecution  the triumphant whigs while they reestablished presbytery as the national religion and assigned to the general assemblies of the kirk their natural influence were very far from going the lengths which the cameronians and more extravagant portion of the nonconformists under charles and james loudly demanded they would listen to no proposal for reestablishing the solemn league and covenant and those who had expected to find in king william a zealous covenanted monarch were grievously disappointed when he intimated with the phlegm peculiar to his country his intention to tolerate all forms of religion which were consistent with the safety of the state the principles of indulgence thus espoused and gloried in by the government gave great offence to the more violent party who condemned them as diametrically contrary to scripturefor which narrowspirited doctrine they cited various texts all as it may well be supposed detached from their context and most of them derived from the charges given to the jews in the old testament dispensation to extirpate idolaters out of the promised land they also murmured highly against the influence assumed by secular persons in exercising the rights of patronage which they termed a rape upon the chastity of the church they censured and condemned as erastian many of the measures by which government after the revolution showed an inclination to interfere with the management of the church and they positively refused to take the oath of allegiance to king william and queen mary until they should on their part have sworn to the solemn leagueand covenant the magna charta as they termed it of the presbyterian church  this party therefore remained grumbling and dissatisfied and made repeated declarations against defections and causes of wrath which had they been prosecuted as in the two former reigns would have led to the same consequence of open rebellion but as the murmurers were allowed to hold their meetings uninterrupted and to testify as much as they pleased against socinianism erastianism and all the compliances and defections of the time their zeal unfanned by persecution died gradually away their numbers became diminished and they sunk into the scattered remnant of serious scrupulous and harmless enthusiasts of whom old mortality whose legends have afforded the groundwork of my tale may be taken as no bad representative but in the years which immediately succeeded the revolution the cameronians continued a sect strong in numbers and vehement in their political opinions whom government wished to discourage while they prudently temporised with them these men formed one violent party in the state and the episcopalian and jacobite interest notwithstanding their ancient and national animosity yet repeatedly endeavoured to intrigue among them and avail themselves of their discontents to obtain their assistance in recalling the stewart family the revolutionary government in the mean while was supported by the great bulk of the lowland interest who were chiefly disposed to a moderate presbytery and formed in a great measure the party who in the former oppressive reigns were stigmatized by the cameronians for having exercised that form of worship under the declaration of indulgence issued by charles ii such was the state of parties in scotland immediately subsequent to the revolution  it was on a delightful summer evening that a stranger well mounted and having the appearance of a military man of rank rode down a winding descent which terminated in view of the romantic ruins of bothwell castle and the river clyde which winds so beautifully between rocks and woods to sweep around the towers formerly built by aymer de valence bothwell bridge was at a little distance and also in sight the opposite field once the scene of slaughter and conflict now lay as placid and quiet as the surface of a summer lake the trees and bushes which grew around in romantic variety of shade were hardly seen to stir under the influence of the evening breeze the very murmur of the river seemed to soften itself into unison with the stillness of the scene around  the path through which the traveller descended was occasionally shaded by detached trees of great size and elsewhere by the hedges and boughs of flourishing orchards now laden with summer fruits  the nearest object of consequence was a farmhouse or it might be the abode of a small proprietor situated on the side of a sunny bank which was covered by apple and pear trees at the foot of the path which led up to this modest mansion was a small cottage pretty much in the situation of a porters lodge though obviously not designed for such a purpose the hut seemed comfortable and more neatly arranged than is usual in scotland it had its little garden where some fruittrees and bushes were mingled with kitchen herbs a cow and six sheep fed in a paddock hard by the cock strutted and crowed and summoned his family around him before the door a heap of brushwood and turf neatly made up indicated that the winter fuel was provided and the thin blue smoke which ascended from the strawbound chimney and winded slowly out from among the green trees showed that the evening meal was in the act of being made ready to complete the little scene of rural peace and comfort a girl of about five years old was fetching water in a pitcher from a beautiful fountain of the purest transparency which bubbled up at the root of a decayed old oaktree about twenty yards from the end of the cottage  the stranger reined up his horse and called to the little nymph desiring to know the way to fairy knowe the child set down her waterpitcher hardly understanding what was said to her put her fair flaxen hair apart on her brows and opened her round blue eyes with the wondering whats your wull which is usually a peasants first answer if it can be called one to all questions whatever  i wish to know the way to fairy knowe  mammie mammie exclaimed the little rustic running towards the door of the hut come out and speak to the gentleman  her mother appeareda handsome young countrywoman to whose features originally sly and espiegle in expression matrimony had given that decent matronly air which peculiarly marks the peasants wife of scotland she had an infant in one arm and with the other she smoothed down her apron to which hung a chubby child of two years old the elder girl whom the traveller had first seen fell back behind her mother as soon as she appeared and kept that station occasionally peeping out to look at the stranger  what was your pleasure sir said the woman with an air of respectful breeding not quite common in her rank of life but without anything resembling forwardness  the stranger looked at her with great earnestness for a moment and then replied i am seeking a place called fairy knowe and a man called cuthbert headrigg you can probably direct me to him  its my gudeman sir said the young woman with a smile of welcome will you alight sir and come into our puir dwellingcuddie cuddiea whiteheaded rogue of four years appeared at the door of the hutrin awa my bonny man and tell your father a gentleman wants him or stayjenny yell hae

ale though i shouldna say sae that brews it but ploughmanlads work hard and maun hae something to keep their hearts abune by ordinar sae i aye pit a gude gowpin o maut to the browst  as the stranger declined her courteous offers cuddie the readers old acquaintance made his appearance in person his countenance still presented the same mixture of apparent dulness with occasional sparkles which indicated the craft so often found in the clouted shoe he looked on the rider as on one whom he never had before seen and like his daughter and wife opened the conversation with the regular query whats your wull wi me sir  i have a curiosity to ask some questions about this country said the traveller and i was directed to you as an intelligent man who can answer them  nae doubt sir said cuddie after a moments hesitation but i would first like to ken what sort of questions they are i hae had sae mony questions speered at me in my day and in sic queer ways that if ye kend a ye wadna wonder at my jalousing a thing about them my mother gar d me learn the single carritch whilk was a great vex then i behoved to learn about my godfathers and godmothers to please the auld leddy and whiles i jumbled them thegether and pleased nane o them and when i cam to mans yestate cam another kind o questioning in fashion that i liked waur than effectual calling and the did promise and vow of the tape

country  country replied cuddie ou the countrys weel eneugh an it werena that dour deevil claverse they ca him dundee now thats stirring about yet in the highlands they say wi a the donalds and

that hell gie him his fairing ill be caution for it  what makes you so positive of that my friend asked the horseman  i heard it wi my ain lugs answered cuddie foretauld to him by a man that had been three hours stane dead and came back to this earth again just to tell him his mind it was at a place they ca drumshinnel  indeed said the stranger i can hardly believe you my friend  ye might ask my mither then if she were in life said cuddie it was her explained it a to me for i thought the man had only been wounded at ony rate he spake of the casting out of the stewarts by their very names and the vengeance that was brewing for claverse and his dragoons they cad the man habakkuk mucklewrath his brain was a wee ajee but he was a braw preacher for a that  you seem said the stranger to live in a rich and peaceful country  its no to compleen o sir an we get the crap weel in quoth cuddie but if ye had seen the blude rinnin as fast on the tap o that brigg yonder as ever the water ran below it ye wadna hae thought it sae bonnie a spectacle  you mean the battle some years since i was waiting upon monmouth that morning my good friend and did see some part of the action said the stranger  then ye saw a bonny stour said cuddie that sail serve me for fighting a the days o my life i judged ye wad be a trooper by your red scarlet lacecoat and your looped hat  and which side were you upon my friend continued the inquisitive stranger  aha lad retorted cuddie with a knowing look or what he designed for suchthere s nae use in telling that unless i kend wha was asking me  i commend your prudence but it is unnecessary i know you acted on that occasion as servant to henry morton  ay said cuddie in surprise how came ye by that secret no that i need care a bodee about it for the suns on our side o the hedge now i wish my master were living to get a blink ot  and what became of him said the rider  he was lost in the vessel gaun to that weary hollandclean lost and a body perished and my poor master amang them neither man nor mouse was ever heard o mair then cuddie uttered a groan  you had some regard for him then continued the stranger  how could i help it his face was made of a fiddle as they say for a body that looked on him liked him and a braw soldier he was oh an ye had but seen him down at the brigg there fleeing about like a fleeing dragon to gar folk fight that had unto little will till t there was he and that sour whigamore they cad burley if twa men could hae won a field we wadna hae gotten our skins paid that day  you mention burley do you know if he yet lives  i kenna muckle about him folk say he was abroad and our sufferers wad hold no communion wi him because o his having murdered the archbishop sae he cam hame ten times dourer than ever and broke aff wi mony o the presbyterians and at this last coming of the prince of orange he could get nae countenance nor command for fear of his deevilish temper and he hasna been heard of since only some folk say that pride and anger hae driven him clean wud  andand said the traveller after considerable hesitationdo you know anything of lord evan dale  div i ken onything o lord evandale div i no is

ower glasgowward and maist skeily folk think that bodes rain  in fact a deep black cloud had already surmounted the setting sun a few large drops of rain fell and the murmurs of distant thunder were heard  the deils in this man said cuddie to himself i wish he would either light aff or ride on that he may quarter himsell in hamilton or the shower begin  but the rider sate motionless on his horse for two or three moments after his last question like one exhausted by some uncommon effort at length recovering himself as if with a sudden and painful effort he asked cuddie if lady margaret bellenden still lived  she does replied cuddie but in a very sma way they hae been a sad changed family since thae rough times began they hae suffered eneugh first and lastand to lose the auld tower and a the bonny barony and the holms that i hae pleughed sae often and the mains and my kaleyard that i suld hae gotten back again and a for naething as a body may say but just the want o some bits of sheepskin that were lost in the confusion of the taking of tillietudlem  i have heard something of this said the stranger deepening his voice and averting his head i have some interest in the family and would willingly help them if i could can you give me a bed in your house tonight my friend  its but a corner of a place sir said cuddie but wese try rather than ye suld ride on in the rain and

sorted said cuddie i ken weel what belangs to suppering a horse and this is a very gude ane cuddie took the horse to the little cowhouse and called to his wife to attend in the mean while to the strangers accommodation the officer entered and threw himself on a settle at some distance from the fire and carefully turning his back to the little lattice window jenny or mrs headrigg if the reader pleases requested him to lay aside the cloak belt and flapped hat which he wore upon his journey but he excused himself under pretence of feeling cold and to divert the time till cuddies return he entered into some chat with the children carefully avoiding during the interval the inquisitive glances of his landlady      chapter xvii                      what tragic tears bedim the eye                     what deaths we suffer ere we die                     our broken friendships we deplore                     and loves of youth that are no more                                         logan  cuddie soon returned assuring the stranger with a cheerful voice that the horse was properly suppered up and that the gudewife should make a bed up for him at the house mair purposelike and comfortable than the like o them could gie him  are the family at the house said the stranger with an interrupted and broken voice  no stir theyre awa wi a the servantsthey keep only twa nowadays and my gudewife there has the keys and the charge though shes no a feed servant she has been born and bred in the family and has a trust and management if they were there we behovedna to take sic freedom

leddy margaret has an unto respect for the gentry and shes no ill to the poor bodies neitherand now wife what for are ye no getting forrit wi the sowens  never mind lad rejoined jenny ye sall hae them in gude time i ken weel that ye like your brose het  cuddie fidgeted and laughed with a peculiar expression of intelligence at this repartee which was followed by a dialogue of little consequence betwixt his wife and him in which the stranger took no share at length he suddenly interrupted them by the question can you tell me when lord evandales marriage takes place  very soon we expect answered jenny before it was possible for her husband to reply it wad hae been ower afore now but for the death o auld major bellenden  the excellent old man said the stranger i heard at edinburgh he was no more was he long ill  he couldna be said to haud up his head after his brothers wife and his niece were turned out o their ain house and he had himsell sair borrowing siller to stand the lawbut it was in the latter end o king jamess days and basil olifant who claimed the estate turned a papist to please the managers and then naething was to be refused him sae the law gaed again the leddies at last after they had fought a weary sort o years about it and as i said before the major neer held up his head again and then cam the pitting awa o the stewart line and though he had but little reason to like them he couldna brook that and it clean broke the heart o him and creditors cam to charnwood and cleaned out a that was therehe was never rich the gude auld man for he dowd na see onybody want  he was indeed said the stranger with a faltering voice an admirable manthat is i have heard that he was so so the ladies were left without fortune as well as without a protector  they will neither want the tane nor the tother while lord evandale lives said jenny he has been a true friend in their griefs een to the house they live in is his lordships and never man as my auld gudemother used to say since the days of the patriarch jacob served sae lang and sae sair for a wife as gude lord evandale has dune  and why said the stranger with a voice that quivered with emotion why was he not sooner rewarded by the object of his attachment  there was the lawsuit to be ended said jenny readily forby many other family arrangements  na but said cuddie there was another reason forby for the young leddy  whisht hand your tongue and sup your sowens said his wife i see the gentlemans far frae weel and downa eat our coarse supper i wad kill him a chicken in an instant  there is no occasion said the stranger i shall want only a glass of water and to be left alone  youll gie yoursell the trouble then to follow me said jenny lighting a small lantern and ill show you the way  cuddie also proffered his assistance but his wife reminded him that the bairns would be left to fight thegither and coup ane anither into the fire so that he remained to take charge of the menage his wife led the way up a little winding path which after threading some thickets of sweetbrier and honeysuckle conducted to the backdoor of a small garden jenny undid the latch and they passed through an oldfashioned flowergarden with its clipped yew hedges and formal parterres to a glasssashed door which she opened with a masterkey and lighting a candle which she placed upon a small worktable asked pardon for leaving him there for a few minutes until she prepared his apartment she did not exceed five minutes in these preparations but when she returned was startled to find that the stranger had sunk forward with his head upon the table in what she at first apprehended to be a swoon as she advanced to him however she could discover by his shortdrawn sobs that it was a paroxysm of mental agony she prudently drew back until he raised his head and then showing herself without seeming to have observed his agitation informed him that his bed was prepared the stranger gazed at her a moment as if to collect the sense of her words she repeated them and only bending his head as an indication that he understood her he entered the apartment the door of which she pointed out to him it was a small bedchamber used as she informed him by lord evandale when a guest at fairy knowe connecting on one side with a little chinacabinet which opened to the garden and on the other with a saloon from which it was only separated by a thin wainscot partition having wished the stranger better health and good rest jenny descended as speedily as she could to her own mansion  oh cuddie she exclaimed to her helpmate as she entered i doubt were ruined folk  how can that be whats the matter wi ye returned the imperturbed cuddie who was one of those persons who do not easily take alarm at anything  wha d ye

quarrelled and pued me twa ways at anes as if ilk ane had an end o me like punch and the deevil rugging about the baker at the fair and now i hae gotten a wife he murmured in continuation as he stowed the blankets around his person and shes like to tak the guiding o me a thegither  and amna i the best guide ye ever had in a your life said jenny as she closed the conversation by assuming her place beside her husband and extinguishing the candle  leaving this couple to their repose we have next to inform the reader that early on the next morning two ladies on horseback attended by their servants arrived at the house of fairy knowe whom to jennys utter confusion she instantly recognised as miss bellenden and lady emily hamilton a sister of lord evandale  had i no better gang to the house to put things to rights said jenny confounded with this unexpected apparition  we want nothing but the passkey said miss bellenden gudyill will open the windows of the little parlour  the little parlours locked and the locks spoiled answered jenny who recollected the local spmpathy between that apartment and the bedchamber of her guest  in the red parlour then said miss bellenden and rode up to the front of the house but by an approach different from that through which morton had been conducted  all will be out thought jenny unless i can get him smuggled out of the house the back way  so saying she sped up the bank in great tribulation and uncertainty  i had better hae said at ante there was a stranger there was her next natural reflection but then they wad hae been for asking him to breakfast oh safe us what will i doand theres gudyill walking in the garden too she exclaimed internally on approaching the wicket and i daurna gang in the back way till hes aff the coast oh sirs what will become of us  in this state of perplexity she approached the cidevant butler with the purpose of decoying him out of the garden but john gudyills temper was not improved by his decline in rank and increase in years like many peevish people too he seemed to have an intuitive perception as to what was most likely to teaze those whom he conversed with and on the present occasion all jennys efforts to remove him from the garden served only to root him in it as fast as if he had been one of the shrubs  unluckily also he had commenced florist during his residence at fairy knowe and leaving all other things to the charge of lady emilys servant his first care was dedicated to the flowers which he had taken under his special protection and which he propped dug and watered prosing all the while upon their respective merits to poor jenny who stood by him trembling and almost crying with anxiety fear and impatience  fate seemed determined to win a match against jenny this unfortunate morning as soon as the ladies entered the house they observed that the door of the little parlourthe very apartment out of which she was desirous of excluding them on account of its contiguity to the room in which morton sleptwas not only unlocked but absolutely ajar miss bellenden was too much engaged with her own immediate subjects of reflection to take much notice of the circumstance but desiring the servant to open the windowshutters walked into the room along with her friend  he is not yet come she said what can your brother possibly mean why express so anxious a wish that we should meet him here and why not come to castle dinnan as he proposed i own my dear emily that even engaged as we are to each other and with the sanction of your presence i do not feel that i have done quite right in indulging him  evandale was never capricious answered his sister i am sure he will satisfy us with his reasons and if he does not i will help you to scold him  what i chiefly fear said edith is his having engaged in some of the plots of this fluctuating and unhappy time i know his heart is with that dreadful claverhouse and his army and i believe he would have joined them ere now but for my uncles death which gave him so much additional trouble on our account how singular that one so rational and so deeply sensible of the errors of the exiled family should be ready to risk all for their restoration  what can i say answered lady emilyit is a point of honour with evandale our family have always been loyal he served long in the guards the viscount of dundee was his commander and his friend for years he is looked on with an evil eye by many of his own relations who set down his inactivity to the score of want of spirit you must be aware my dear edith how often family connections and early predilections influence our actions more than abstract arguments but i trust evandale will continue quietthough to tell you truth i believe you are the only one who can keep him so  and how is it in my power said miss bellenden  you can furnish him with the scriptural apology for not going forth with the hosthe has married a wife and therefore cannot come  i have promised said edith in a faint voice but i trust i shall not be urged on the score of time  nay said lady emily i will leave evandale and here he comes to plead his own cause  stay stay for gods sake said edith endeavouring to detain her  not i not i said the young lady making her escape the third person makes a silly figure on such occasions when you want me for breakfast i will be found in the willowwalk by the river  as she tripped out of the room lord evandale entered goodmorrow brother and goodby till breakfasttime said the lively young lady i trust you will give miss bellenden some good reasons for disturbing her rest so early in the morning  and so saying she left them together without waiting a reply  and now my lord said edith may i desire to know the meaning of your singular request to meet you here at so early an hour  she was about to add that she hardly felt herself excusable in having complied with it but upon looking at the person whom she addressed she was struck dumb by the singular and agitated expression of his countenance and interrupted herself to exclaim for gods sake what is the matter  his majestys faithful subjects have gained a great and most decisive victory near blair of athole but alas my gallant friend lord dundee  has fallen said edith anticipating the rest of his tidings  true most true he has fallen in the arms of victory and not a man remains of talents and influence sufficient to fill up his loss in king jamess service this edith is no time for temporizing with our duty i have given directions to raise my followers and i must take leave of you this evening  do not think of it my lord answered edith your life isessential to your friendsdo not throw it away in an adventure so rash what can your single arm and the few tenants or servants who might follow you do against the force of almost all scotland the highland clans only excepted  listen to me edith said lord evandale i am not so rash as you may suppose me nor are my present motives of such light importance as to affect only those personally dependent on myself the life guards with whom i served so long although newmodelled and newofficered by the prince of orange retain a predilection for the cause of their rightful master and and here he whispered as if he feared even the walls of the apartment had earswhen my foot is known to be in the stirrup two regiments of cavalry have sworn to renounce the usurpers service and fight under my orders they delayed only till dundee should descend into the lowlands but since he is no more which of his successors dare take that decisive step unless encouraged by the troops declaring themselves meantime the zeal of the soldiers will die away i must bring them to a decision while their hearts are glowing with the victory their old leader has obtained and burning to avenge his untimely death  and will you on the faith of such men as you know these soldiers to be said edith take a part of such dreadful moment  i will said lord evandalei must my honour and loyalty are both pledged for it  and all for the sake continued miss bellenden of a prince whose measures while he was on the throne no one could condemn more than lord evandale  most true replied lord evandale and as i resented even during the plenitude of his power his innovations on church and state like a freeborn subject i am determined i will assert his real rights when he is in adversity like a loyal one let courtiers and sycophants flatter power and desert misfortune i will neither do the one nor the other  and if you are determined to act what my feeble judgment must still term rashly why give yourself the pain of this untimely meeting  were it not enough to answer said lord evandale that ere rushing on battle i wished to bid adieu to my betrothed bride surely it is judging coldly of my feelings and showing too plainly the indifference of your own to question my motive for a request so natural  but why in this place my lord said edith and why with such peculiar circumstances of mystery  because he replied putting a letter into her hand i have yet another request which i dare hardly proffer even when prefaced by these credentials  in haste and terror edith glanced over the letter which was from her grandmother       my dearest childe such was its tenor in style and spelling i      never more deeply regretted the reumatizm which disqualified me      from riding on horseback than at this present writing when i would      most have wished to be where this paper will soon be that is at      fairy knowe with my poor dear willies only child but it is the      will of god i should not be with her which i conclude to be the      case as much for the pain i now suffer as because it hath now not      given way either to cammomile poultices or to decoxion of wild      mustard wherewith i have often relieved others therefore i must      tell you by writing instead of word of mouth that as my young      lord evandale is called to the present campaign both by his honour      and his duty he hath earnestly solicited me that the bonds of holy      matrimony be knitted before his departure to the wars between you      and him in implement of the indenture formerly entered into for      that effeck whereuntill as i see no raisonable objexion so i      trust that you who have been always a good and obedient childe      will not devize any which has less than raison it is trew that the      contrax of our house have heretofore been celebrated in a manner      more befitting our rank and not in private and with few witnesses      as a thing done in a corner but it has been heavens own free will      as well as those of the kingdom where we live to take away from us      our estate and from the king his throne yet i trust he will yet      restore the rightful heir to the throne and turn his heart to the      true protestant episcopal faith which i have the better right to      expect to see even with my old eyes as i have beheld the royal      family when they were struggling as sorely with masterful usurpers      and rebels as they are now that is to say when his most sacred      majesty charles the second of happy memory honoured our poor house      of tillietudlem by taking his disjune therein etc etc etc  we will not abuse the readers patience by quoting more of lady margarets prolix epistle suffice it to say that it closed by laying her commands on her grandchild to consent to the solemnization of her marriage without loss of time  i never thought till this instant said edith dropping the letter from her hand that lord evandale would have acted ungenerously  ungenerously edith replied her lover and how can you apply such a term to my desire to call you mine ere i part from you perhaps for ever  lord evandale ought to have remembered said edith that when his perseverance and i must add a due sense of his merit and of the obligations we owed him wrung from me a slow consent that i would one day comply with his wishes i made it my condition that i should not be pressed to a hasty accomplishment of my promise and now he avails himself of his interest with my only remaining relative to hurry me with precipitate and even indelicate importunity there is more selfishness than generosity my lord in such eager and urgent solicitation  lord evandale evidently much hurt took two or three turns through the apartment ere he replied to this accusation at length he spoke i should have escaped this painful charge durst i at once have mentioned to miss bellendon my principal reason for urging this request it is one which she will probably despise on her own account but which ought to weigh with her for the sake of lady margaret my death in battle must give my whole estate to my heirs of entail my forfeiture as a traitor by the usurping government may vest it in the prince of orange or some dutch favourite in either case my venerable friend and betrothed bride must remain unprotected and in poverty vested with the rights and provisions of lady evandale edith will find in the power of supporting her aged parent some consolation for having condescended to share the titles and fortunes of one who does not pretend to be worthy of her  edith was struck dumb by an argument which she had not expected and was compelled to acknowledge that lord evandales suit was urged with delicacy as well as with consideration  and yet she said such is the waywardness with which my heart reverts to former times that i cannot she burst into tears suppress a degree of ominous reluctance at fulfilling my engagement upon such a brief summons  we have already fully considered this painful subject said lord evandale and i hoped my dear edith your own inquiries as well as mine had fully convinced you that these regrets were fruitless  fruitless indeed said edith with a deep sigh which as if by an unexpected echo was repeated from the adjoining apartment miss bellenden started at the sound and scarcely composed herself upon lord evandales assurances that she had heard but the echo of her own respiration  it sounded strangely distinct she said and almost ominous but my feelings are so harassed that the slightest trifle agitates them  lord evandale eagerly attempted to soothe her alarm and reconcile her to a measure which however hasty appeared to him the only means by which he could secure her independence he urged his claim in virtue of the contract her grandmothers wish and command the propriety of insuring her comfort and independence and touched lightly on his own long attachment which he had evinced by so many and such various services these edith felt the more the less they were insisted upon and at length as she had nothing to oppose to his ardour excepting a causeless reluctance which she herself was ashamed to oppose against so much generosity she was compelled to rest upon the impossibility of having the ceremony performed upon such hasty notice at such a time and place but for all this lord evandale was prepared and he explained with joyful alacrity that the former chaplain of his regiment was in attendance at the lodge with a faithful domestic once a noncommissioned officer in the same corps that his sister was also possessed of the secret and that headrigg and his wife might be added to the list of witnesses if agreeable to miss bellenden as to the place he had chosen it on very purpose the marriage was to remain a secret since lord evandale was to depart in disguise very soon after it was solemnizeda circumstance which had their union been public must have drawn upon him the attention of the government as being altogether unaccountable unless from his being engaged in some dangerous design having hastily urged these motives and explained his arrangements he ran without waiting for an answer to summon his sister to attend his bride while he went in search of the other persons whose presence was necessary when lady emily arrived she found her friend in an agony of tears of which she was at some loss to comprehend the reason being one of those damsels who think there is nothing either wonderful or terrible in matrimony and joining with most who knew him in thinking that it could not be rendered peculiarly alarming by lord evandale being the bridegroom influenced by these feelings she exhausted in succession all the usual arguments for courage and all the expressions of sympathy and condolence ordinarily employed on such occasions but when lady emily beheld her future sisterinlaw deaf to all those ordinary topics of consolation when she beheld tears follow fast and without intermission down cheeks as pale as marble when she felt that the hand which she pressed in order to enforce her arguments turned cold within her grasp and lay like that of a corpse insensible and unresponsive to her caresses her feelings of sympathy gave way to those of hurt pride and pettish displeasure  i must own she said that i am something at a loss to understand all this miss bellenden months have passed since you agreed to marry my brother and you have postponed the fulfilment of your engagement from one period to another as if you had to avoid some dishonourable or highly disagreeable connection i think i can answer for lord evandale that he will seek no womans hand against her inclination and though his sister i may boldly say that he does not need to urge any lady further than her inclinations carry her you will forgive me miss bellenden but your present distress augurs ill for my brothers future happiness and i must needs say that he does not merit all these expressions of dislike and dolour and that they seem an odd return for an attachment which he has manifested so long and in so many ways  you are right lady emily said edith drying her eyes and endeavouring to resume her natural manner though still betrayed by her faltering voice and the paleness of her cheeksyou are quite right lord evandale merits such usage from no one least of all from her whom he has honoured with his regard but if i have given way for the last time to a sudden and irresistible burst of feeling it is my consolation lady emily that your brother knows the cause that i have hid nothing from him and that he at least is not apprehensive of finding in edith bellenden a wife undeserving of his affection but still you are right and i merit your censure for indulging for a moment fruitless regret and painful remembrances it shall be so no longer my lot is cast with evandale and with him i am resolved to bear it nothing shall in future occur to excite his complaints or the resentment of his relations no idle recollections of other days shall intervene to prevent the zealous and affectionate discharge of my duty no vain illusions recall the memory of other days  as she spoke these words she slowly raised her eyes which had before been hidden by her hand to the latticed window of her apartment which was partly open uttered a dismal shriek and fainted lady emily turned her eyes in the same direction but saw only the shadow of a man which seemed to disappear from the window and terrified more by the state of edith than by the apparition she had herself witnessed she uttered shriek upon shriek for assistance her brother soon arrived with the chaplain and jenny dennison but strong and vigorous remedies were necessary ere they could recall miss bellenden to sense and motion even then her language was wild and incoherent   illustration uttered a dismal shriek and fainted224   press me no farther she said to lord evandaleit cannot be heaven and earth the living and the dead have leagued themselves against this illomened union take all i can givemy sisterly regard my devoted friendship i will love you as a sister and serve you as a bondswoman but never speak to me more of marriage  the astonishment of lord evandale may easily be conceived emily he said to his sister this is your doing i was accursed when i thought of bringing you here some of your confounded folly has driven her mad  on my word brother answered lady emily youre sufficient to drive all the women in scotland mad because your mistress seems much disposed to jilt you you quarrel with your sister who has been arguing in your cause and had brought her to a quiet hearing when all of a sudden a man looked in at a window whom her crazed sensibility mistook either for you or some one else and has treated us gratis with an excellent tragic scene  what man  what window said lord evandale in impatient displeasure miss bellenden is incapable of trifling with me and yet what else could have  hush hush said jenny whose interest lay particularly in shifting further inquiry for heavens sake my lord speak low for my lady begins to recover  edith was no sooner somewhat restored to herself than she begged in a feeble voice to be left alone with lord evandale all retreatedjenny with her usual air of officious simplicity lady emily and the chaplain with that of awakened curiosity no sooner had they left the apartment than edith beckoned lord evandale to sit beside her on the couch her next motion was to take his hand in spite of his surprised resistance to her lips her last was to sink from her seat and to clasp his knees forgive me my lord she exclaimed forgive me i must deal most untruly by you and break a solemn engagement you have my friendship my highest regard my most sincere gratitude you have moreyou have my word and my faith butoh forgive me for the fault is not mineyou have not my love and i cannot marry you without a sin  you dream my dearest edith said evandale perplexed in the utmost degree you let your imagination beguile you this is but some delusion of an oversensitive mind the person whom you preferred to me has been long in a better world where your unavailing regret cannot follow him or if it could would only diminish his happiness  you are mistaken lord evandale said edith solemnly i am not a sleepwalker or a madwoman no i could not have believed from any one what i have seen but having seen him i must believe mine own eyes  seen himseen whom asked lord evandale in great anxiety  henry morton replied edith uttering these two words as if they were her last and very nearly fainting when she had done so  miss bellenden said lord evandale you treat me like a fool or a child if you repent your engagement to me he continued indignantly i am not a man to enforce it against your inclination but deal with me as a man and forbear this trifling  he was about to go on when he perceived from her quivering eye and pallid cheek that nothing less than imposture was intended and that by whatever means her imagination had been so impressed it was really disturbed by unaffected awe and terror he changed his tone and exerted all his eloquence in endeavouring to soothe and extract from her the secret cause of such terror  i saw him she repeatedi saw henry morton stand at that window and look into the apartment at the moment i was on the point of abjuring him for ever his face was darker thinner and paler than it was wont to be his dress was a horsemans cloak and hat looped down over his face his expression was like that he wore on that dreadful morning when he was examined by claverhouse at tillietudlem ask your sister ask lady emily if she did not see him as well as i i know what has called him uphe came to upbraid me that while my heart was with him in the deep and dead sea i was about to give my hand to another my lord it is ended between you and me be the consequences what they will she cannot marry whose union disturbs the repose of the dead  good heaven said evandale as he paced the room half mad himself with surprise and vexation her fine understanding must be totally overthrown and that by the effort which she has made to comply with my illtimed though wellmeant request without rest and attention her health is ruined for ever  at this moment the door opened and halliday who had been lord evandales principal personal attendant since they both left the guards on the revolution stumbled into the room with a countenance as pale and ghastly as terror could paint it  what is the matter next halliday cried his master starting up any discovery of the  he had just recollection sufficient to stop short in the midst of the dangerous sentence  no sir said halliday it is not that nor anything like that but i have seen a ghost  a ghost you eternal idiot said lord evandale forced altogether out of his patience has all mankind sworn to go mad in order to drive me so what ghost you simpleton  the ghost of henry morton the whig captain at bothwell bridge replied halliday he passed by me like a fireflaught when i was in the garden  this is midsummer madness said lord evandale or there is some strange villainy afloat jenny attend your lady to her chamber while i endeavour to find a clue to all this  but lord evandales inquiries were in vain jenny who might have given had she chosen a very satisfactory explanation had an interest to leave the matter in darkness and interest was a matter which now weighed principally with jenny since the possession of an active and affectionate husband in her own proper right had altogether allayed her spirit of coquetry she had made the best use of the first moments of confusion hastily to remove all traces of any one having slept in the apartment adjoining to the parlour and even to erase the mark of footsteps beneath the window through which she conjectured mortons face had been seen while attempting ere he left the garden to gain one look at her whom he had so long loved and was now on the point of losing for ever that he had passed halliday in the garden was equally clear and she learned from her elder boy whom she had employed to have the strangers horse saddled and ready for his departure that he had rushed into the stable thrown the child a broad gold piece and mounting his horse had ridden with fearful rapidity down towards the clyde the secret was therefore in their own family and jenny was resolved it should remain so  for to be sure she said although her lady and halliday kend mr morton by broad daylight that was nae reason i suld own to kenning him in the gloaming and by candlelight and him keeping his face frae cuddie and me a the time  so she stood resolutely upon the negative when examined by lord evandale as for halliday he could only say that as he entered the gardendoor the supposed apparition met him walking swiftly and with a visage on which anger and grief appeared to be contending  he knew him well he said having been repeatedly guard upon him and obliged to write down his marks of stature and visage in case of escape and there were few faces like mr mortons but what should make him haunt the country where he was neither hanged nor shot he the said halliday did not pretend to conceive  lady emily confessed she had seen the face of a man at the window but her evidence went no farther john gudyill deponed nil novit in causa he had left his gardening to get his morning dram just at the time when the apparition had taken place lady emilys servant was waiting orders in the kitchen and there was not another being within a quarter of a mile of the house  lord evandale returned perplexed and dissatisfied in the highest degree at beholding a plan which he thought necessary not less for the protection of edith in contingent circumstances than for the assurance of his own happiness and which he had brought so very near perfection thus broken off without any apparent or rational cause his knowledge of ediths character set her beyond the suspicion of covering any capricious change of determination by a pretended vision but he would have set the apparition down to the influence of an overstrained imagination agitated by the circumstances in which she had so suddenly been placed had it not been for the coinciding testimony of halliday who had no reason for thinking of morton more than any other person and knew nothing of miss bellendens vision when he promulgated his own on the other hand it seemed in the highest degree improbable that morton so long and so vainly sought after and who was with such good reason supposed to be lost when the vryheid of rotterdam went down with crew and passengers should be alive and lurking in this country where there was no longer any reason why he should not openly show himself since the present government favoured his party in politics when lord evandale reluctantly brought himself to communicate these doubts to the chaplain in order to obtain his opinion he could only obtain a long lecture on demonology in which after quoting delrio and burthoog and de lancre on the subject of apparitions together with sundry civilians and common lawyers on the nature of testimony the learned gentleman expressed his definite and determined opinion to be either that there had been an actual apparition of the deceased henry mortons spirit the possibility of which he was as a divine and a philosopher neither fully prepared to admit or to deny or else that the said henry morton being still in rerum natura had appeared in his proper person that morning or finally that some strong deceptio visus or striking similitude of person had deceived the eyes of miss bellenden and of thomas halliday which of these was the most probable hypothesis the doctor declined to pronounce but expressed himself ready to die in the opinion that one or other of them had occasioned that mornings disturbance  lord evandale soon had additional cause for distressful anxiety miss bellenden was declared to be dangerously ill  i will not leave this place he exclaimed till she is pronounced to be in safety i neither can nor ought to do so for whatever may have been the immediate occasion of her illness i gave the first cause for it by my unhappy solicitation  he established himself therefore as a guest in the family which the presence of his sister as well as of lady margaret bellenden who in despite of her rheumatism caused herself to be transported thither when she heard of her granddaughters illness rendered a step equally natural and delicate and thus he anxiously awaited until without injury to her health edith could sustain a final explanation ere his departure on his expedition  she shall never said the generous young man look on her engagement with me as the means of fettering her to a union the idea of which seems almost to unhinge her understanding      chapter xviii                 ah happy hills ah pleasing shades                ah fields beloved in vain                where once my careless childhood strayed                a stranger yet to pain                        ode on a distant prospect of eton college  it is not by corporal wants and infirmities only that men of the most distinguished talents are levelled during their lifetime with the common mass of mankind there are periods of mental agitation when the firmest of mortals must be ranked with the weakest of his brethren and when in paying the general tax of humanity his distresses are even aggravated by feeling that he transgresses in the indulgence of his grief the rules of religion and philosophy by which he endeavours in general to regulate his passions and his actions it was during such a paroxysm that the unfortunate morton left fairy knowe to know that his longloved and stillbeloved edith whose image had filled his mind for so many years was on the point of marriage to his early rival who had laid claim to her heart by so many services as hardly left her a title to refuse his addresses bitter as the intelligence was yet came not as an unexpected blow  during his residence abroad he had once written to edith it was to bid her farewell for ever and to conjure her to forget him he had requested her not to answer his letter yet he half hoped for many a day that she might transgress his injunction the letter never reached her to whom it was addressed and morton ignorant of its miscarriage could only conclude himself laid aside and forgotten according to his own selfdenying request all that he had heard of their mutual relations since his return to scotland prepared him to expect that he could only look upon miss bellenden as the betrothed bride of lord evandale and even if freed from the burden of obligation to the latter it would still have been inconsistent with mortons generosity of disposition to disturb their arrangements by attempting the assertion of a claim proscribed by absence never sanctioned by the consent of friends and barred by a thousand circumstances of difficulty why then did he seek the cottage which their broken fortunes had now rendered the retreat of lady margaret bellenden and her granddaughter he yielded we are under the necessity of acknowledging to the impulse of an inconsistent wish which many might have felt in his situation  accident apprised him while travelling towards his native district that the ladies near whose mansion he must necessarily pass were absent and learning that cuddie and his wife acted as their principal domestics he could not resist pausing at their cottage to learn if possible the real progress which lord evandale had made in the affections of miss bellen denalas no longer his edith this rash experiment ended as we have related and he parted from the house of fairy knowe conscious that he was still beloved by edith yet compelled by faith and honour to relinquish her for ever with what feelings he must have listened to the dialogue between lord evandale and edith the greater part of which he involuntarily overheard the reader must conceive for we dare not attempt to describe them an hundred times he was tempted to burst upon their interview or to exclaim aloud edith i yet live and as often the recollection of her plighted troth and of the debt of gratitude which he owed lord evandale to whose influence with claverhouse he justly ascribed his escape from torture and from death withheld him from a rashness which might indeed have involved all in further distress but gave little prospect of forwarding his own happiness he repressed forcibly these selfish emotions though with an agony which thrilled his every nerve  no edith was his internal oath never will i add a thorn to thy pillow that which heaven has ordained let it be and let me not add by my selfish sorrows one atoms weight to the burden thou hast to bear i was dead to thee when thy resolution was adopted and never never shalt thou know that henry morton still lives  as he formed this resolution diffident of his own power to keep it and seeking that firmness in flight which was every moment shaken by his continuing within hearing of ediths voice he hastily rushed from his apartment by the little closet and the sashed door which led to the garden  but firmly as he thought his resolution was fixed he could not leave the spot where the last tones of a voice so beloved still vibrated on his ear without endeavouring to avail himself of the opportunity which the parlour window afforded to steal one last glance at the lovely speaker it was in this attempt made while edith seemed to have her eyes unalterably bent upon the ground that mortons presence was detected by her raising them suddenly so soon as her wild scream made this known to the unfortunate object of a passion so constant and which seemed so illfated he hurried from the place as if pursued by the furies he passed halliday in the garden without recognising or even being sensible that he had seen him threw himself on his horse and by a sort of instinct rather than recollection took the first byroad in preference to the public route to hamilton  in all probability this prevented lord evandale from learning that he was actually in existence for the news that the highlanders had obtained a decisive victory at killiecrankie had occasioned an accurate lookout to be kept by order of the government on all the passes for fear of some commotion among the lowland jacobites they did not omit to post sentinels on bothwell bridge and as these men had not seen any traveller pass westward in that direction and as besides their comrades stationed in the village of bothwell were equally positive that none had gone eastward the apparition in the existence of which edith and halliday were equally positive became yet more mysterious in the judgment of lord evandale who was finally inclined to settle in the belief that the heated and disturbed imagination of edith had summoned up the phantom she stated herself to have seen and that halliday had in some unaccountable manner been infected by the same superstition meanwhile the bypath which morton pursued with all the speed which his vigorous horse could exert brought him in a very few seconds to the brink of the clyde at a spot marked with the feet of horses who were conducted to it as a wateringplace the steed urged as he was to the gallop did not pause a single instant but throwing himself into the river was soon beyond his depth the plunge which the animal made as his feet quitted the ground with the feeling that the cold water rose above his swordbelt were the first incidents which recalled morton whose movements had been hitherto mechanical to the necessity of taking measures for preserving himself and the noble animal which he bestrode a perfect master of all manly exercises the management of a horse in water was as familiar to him as when upon a meadow he directed the animals course somewhat down the stream towards a low plain or holm which seemed to promise an easy egress from the river in the first and second attempt to get on shore the horse was frustrated by the nature of the ground and nearly fell backwards on his rider the instinct of selfpreservation seldom fails even in the most desperate circumstances to recall the human mind to some degree of equipoise unless when altogether distracted by terror and morton was obliged to the danger in which he was placed for complete recovery of his selfpossession a third attempt at a spot more carefully and judiciously selected succeeded better than the former and placed the horse and his rider in safety upon the farther and lefthand bank of the clyde  but whither said morton in the bitterness of his heart am i now to direct my course or rather what does it signify to which point of the compass a wretch so forlorn betakes himself i would to god could the wish be without a sin that these dark waters had flowed over me and drowned my recollection of that which was and that which is the sense of impatience which the disturbed state of his feelings had occasioned scarcely had vented itself in these violent expressions ere he was struck with shame at having given way to such a paroxysm he remembered how signally the life which he now held so lightly in the bitterness of his disappointment had been preserved through the almost incessant perils which had beset him since he entered upon his public career  i am a fool he said and worse than a fool to set light by that existence which heaven has so often preserved in the most marvellous manner something there yet remains for me in this world were it only to bear my sorrows like a man and to aid those who need my assistance what have i seen what have i heard but the very conclusion of that which i knew was to happen theyhe durst not utter their names even in soliloquythey are embarrassed and in difficulties she is stripped of her inheritance and he seems rushing on some dangerous career with which but for the low voice in which he spoke i might have become acquainted are there no means to aid or to warn them  as he pondered upon this topic forcibly withdrawing his mind from his own disappointment and compelling his attention to the affairs of edith and her betrothed husband the letter of burley long forgotten suddenly rushed on his memory like a ray of light darting through a mist their ruin must have been his work was his internal conclusion if it can be repaired it must be through his means or by information obtained from him i will search him out stern crafty and enthusiastic as he is my plain and downright rectitude of purpose has more than once prevailed with him i will seek him out at least and who knows what influence the information i may acquire from him may have on the fortunes of those whom i shall never see more and who will probably never learn that i am now suppressing my own grief to add if possible to their happiness  animated by these hopes though the foundation was but slight he sought the nearest way to the highroad and as all the tracks through the valley were known to him since he hunted through them in youth he had no other difficulty than that of surmounting one or two enclosures ere he found himself on the road to the small burgh where the feast of the popinjay had been celebrated he journeyed in a state of mind sad indeed and dejected yet relieved from its earlier and more intolerable state of anguish for virtuous resolution and manly disinterestedness seldom fail to restore tranquillity even where they cannot create happiness he turned his thoughts with strong effort upon the means of discovering burley and the chance there was of extracting from him any knowledge which he might possess favourable to her in whose cause he interested himself and at length formed the resolution of guiding himself by the circumstances in which he might discover the object of his quest trusting that from cuddies account of a schism betwixt burley and his brethren of the presbyterian persuasion he might find him less rancorously disposed against miss bellenden and inclined to exert the power which he asserted himself to possess over her fortunes more favourably than heretofore  noontide had passed away when our traveller found himself in the neighbourhood of his deceased uncles habitation of milnwood it rose among glades and groves that were chequered with a thousand early recollections of joy and sorrow and made upon morton that mournful impression soft and affecting yet withal soothing which the sensitive mind usually receives from a return to the haunts of childhood and early youth after having experienced the vicissitudes and tempests of public life a strong desire came upon him to visit the house itself old alison he thought will not know me more than the honest couple whom i saw yesterday i may indulge my curiosity and proceed on my journey without her having any knowledge of my existence i think they said my uncle had bequeathed to her my family mansionwell be it so i have enough to sorrow for to enable me to dispense with lamenting such a disappointment as that and yet methinks he has chosen an odd successor in my grumbling old dame to a line of respectable if not distinguished ancestry let it be as it may i will visit the old mansion at least once more  the house of milnwood even in its best days had nothing cheerful about it but its gloom appeared to be doubled under the auspices of the old housekeeper everything indeed was in repair there were no slates deficient upon the steep grey roof and no panes broken in the narrow windows but the grass in the courtyard looked as if the foot of man had not been there for years the doors were carefully locked and that which admitted to the hall seemed to have been shut for a length of time since the spiders had fairly drawn their webs over the doorway and the staples living sight or sound there was none until after much knocking morton heard the little window through which it was usual to reconnoitre visitors open with much caution the face of alison puckered with some score of wrinkles in addition to those with which it was furrowed when morton left scotland now presented itself enveloped in a toy from under the protection of which some of her grey tresses had escaped in a manner more picturesque than beautiful while her shrill tremulous voice demanded the cause of the knocking i wish to speak an instant with one alison wilson who resides here said henry  shes no at hame the day answered mrs wilson in propria persona the state of whose headdress perhaps inspired her with this direct mode of denying herself and ye are but a misleard person to speer for her in sic a manner ye might hae had an m under your belt for mistress wilson of milnwood  i beg pardon said morton internally smiling at finding in old ailie the same jealousy of disrespect which she used to exhibit upon former occasionsi beg pardon i am but a stranger in this country and have been so long abroad that i have almost forgotten my own language did ye come frae foreign parts said ailie then maybe ye may hae heard of a young gentleman of this country that they ca henry morton  i have heard said morton of such a name in germany  then bide a wee bit where ye are friend or staygang round by the back o the house and yell find a laigh door its on the latch for its never barred till sunset ye ll open tand tak care ye dinna fa ower the tub for the entrys darkand then yell turn to the right and then yell hand straught forward and then yell turn to the right again and ye ll tak heed o the cellarstairs and then ye ll be at the door o the little kitchenits a the kitchen thats at milnwood nowand ill come down tye and whateer ye wad say to mistress wilson ye may very safely tell it to me  a stranger might have had some difficulty notwithstanding the minuteness of the directions supplied by ailie to pilot himself in safety through the dark labyrinth of passages that led from the backdoor to the little kitchen but henry was too well acquainted with the navigation of these straits to experience danger either from the scylla which lurked on one side in shape of a bucking tub or the charybdis which yawned on the other in the profundity of a winding cellarstair his only impediment arose from the snarling and vehement barking of a small cocking spaniel once his own property but which unlike to the faithful argus saw his master return from his wanderings without any symptom of recognition  the little dogs and all said morton to himself on being disowned by his former favourite i am so changed that no breathing creature that i have known and loved will now acknowledge me  at this moment he had reached the kitchen and soon after the tread of alisons high heels and the pat of the crutchhandled cane which served at once to prop and to guide her footsteps were heard upon the stairsan annunciation which continued for some time ere she fairly reached the kitchen  morton had therefore time to survey the slender preparations for housekeeping which were now sufficient in the house of his ancestors the fire though coals are plenty in that neighbourhood was husbanded with the closest attention to economy of fuel and the small pipkin in which was preparing the dinner of the old woman and her maidofallwork a girl of twelve years old intimated by its thin and watery vapour that ailie had not mended her cheer with her improved fortune  when she entered the head which nodded with selfimportance the features in which an irritable peevishness acquired by habit and indulgence strove with a temper naturally affectionate and goodnatured the coif the apron the bluechecked gownwere all those of old ailie but laced pinners hastily put on to meet the stranger with some other trifling articles of decoration marked the difference between mrs wilson liferentrix of milnwood and the housekeeper of the late proprietor  what were ye pleased to want wi mrs wilson sir i am mrs wilson was her first address for the five minutes time which she had gained for the business of the toilet entitled her she conceived to assume the full merit of her illustrious name and shine forth on her guest in unchastened splendour mortons sensations confounded between the past and present fairly confused him so much that he would have had difficulty in answering her even if he had known well what to say but as he had not determined what character he was to adopt while concealing that which was properly his own he had an additional reason for remaining silent mrs wilson in perplexity and with some apprehension repeated her question  what were ye pleased to want wi me sir ye said ye kend mr harry morton  pardon me madam answered henry it was of one silas morton i spoke the old womans countenance fell  it was his father then ye kent o the brother o the late milnwood ye canna mind him abroad i wad thinkhe was come hame afore ye were born i thought ye had brought me news of poor maister harry  it was from my father i learned to know colonel morton said henry of the son i know little or nothingrumour says he died abroad on his passage to holland  thats ower like to be true said the old woman with a sigh and mony a tear its cost my auld een his uncle poor gentleman just soughd awa wi it in his mouth he had been gieing me preceeze directions anent the bread and the wine and the brandy at his burial and how often it was to be handed round the company for dead or alive he was a prudent frugal painstaking man and then he said said he ailie he aye cad me ailie we were auld acquaintance ailie take ye care and haud the gear weel thegither for the name of morton of milnwood s gane out like the last sough of an auld sang and sae he fell out o ae dwam into another and neer spak a word mair unless it were something we coudna mak out about a dipped candle being gude eneugh to see to dee wi he coud neer bide to see a moulded ane and there was ane by ill luck on the table  while mrs wilson was thus detailing the last moments of the old miser morton was pressingly engaged in diverting the assiduous curiosity of the dog which recovered from his first surprise and combining former recollections had after much snuffing and examination begun a course of capering and jumping upon the stranger which threatened every instant to betray him at length in the urgency of his impatience morton could not forbear exclaiming in a tone of hasty impatience down elphin down sir  ye ken our dogs name said the old lady struck with great and sudden surpriseye ken our dogs name and its no a common ane and the creature kens you too she continued in a more agitated and shriller tonegod guide us its my ain bairn  so saying the poor old woman threw herself around mortons neck cling to him kissed him as if he had been actually her child and wept for joy there was no parrying the discovery if he could have had the heart to attempt any further disguise he returned the embrace with the most grateful warmth and answered  i do indeed live dear ailie to thank you for all your kindness past and present and to rejoice that there is at least one friend to welcome me to my native country  friends exclaimed ailie yell hae mony friendsye ll hae mony friends for ye will hae gear hinnyye will hae gear heaven mak ye a gude guide ot but eh sirs she continued pushing him back from her with her trembling hand and shrivelled arm and gazing in his face as if to read at more convenient distance the ravages which sorrow rather than time had made on his faceeh sirs yere sair altered hinny your face is turned pale and your een are sunken and your bonny redandwhite cheeks are turned a dark and sunburnt oh weary on the wars mony s the comely face they destroyand when cam ye here hinny and where hae ye been and what hae ye been doing and what for did ye na write to us and how cam ye to pass yoursell for dead and what for did ye come creepin to your ain house as if ye had been an unto body to gie poor auld ailie sic a start she concluded smiling through her tears it was some time ere morton could overcome his own emotion so as to give the kind old woman the information which we shall communicate to our readers in the next chapter      chapter xix                 aumerle that was                but that is gone for being richards friend                and madam you must call him rutland now                                       richard ii  the scene of explanation was hastily removed from the little kitchen to mrs wilsons own matted roomthe very same which she had occupied as housekeeper and which she continued to retain it was she said better secured against sifting winds than the hall which she had found dangerous to her rheumatisms and it was more fitting for her use than the late milnwoods apartment honest man which gave her sad thoughts and as for the great oak parlour it was never opened but to be aired washed and dusted according to the invariable practice of the family unless upon their most solemn festivals in the matted room therefore they were settled surrounded by picklepots and conserves of all kinds which the cidevant housekeeper continued to compound out of mere habit although neither she herself nor any one else ever partook of the comfits which she so regularly prepared  morton adapting his narrative to the comprehension of his auditor informed her briefly of the wreck of the vessel and the loss of all hands excepting two or three common seamen who had early secured the skiff and were just putting off from the vessel when he leaped from the deck into their boat and unexpectedly as well as contrary to their inclination made himself partner of their voyage and of their safety landed at flushing he was fortunate enough to meet with an old officer who had been in service with his father by his advice he shunned going immediately to the hague but forwarded his letters to the court of the stadtholder  our prince said the veteran must as yet keep terms with his fatherinlaw and with your king charles and to approach him in the character of a scottish malecontent would render it imprudent for him to distinguish you by his favour wait therefore his orders without forcing yourself on his notice observe the strictest prudence and retirement assume for the present a different name shun the company of the british exiles and depend upon it you will not repent your prudence  the old friend of silas morton argued justly after a considerable time had elapsed the prince of orange in a progress through the united states came to the town where morton impatient at his situation and the incognito which he was obliged to observe still continued nevertheless to be a resident he had an hour of private interview assigned in which the prince expressed himself highly pleased with his intelligence his prudence and the liberal view which he seemed to take of the factions of his native country their motives and their purposes  i would gladly said william attach you to my own person but that cannot be without giving offence in england but i will do as much for you as well out of respect for the sentiments you have expressed as for the recommendations you have brought me here is a commission in a swiss regiment at present in garrison in a distant province where you will meet few or none of your countrymen continue to be captain melville and let the name of morton sleep till better days  thus began my fortune continued morton and my services have on various occasions been distinguished by his royal highness until the moment that brought him to britain as our political deliverer his commands must excuse my silence to my few friends in scotland and i wonder not at the report of my death considering the wreck of the vessel and that i found no occasion to use the letters of exchange with which i was furnished by the liberality of some of thema circumstance which must have confirmed the belief that i had perished  but dear hinny asked mrs wilson did ye find nae scotch body at the prince of orangers court that kend ye i wad hae thought morton o milnwood was kend a through the country  i was purposely engaged in distant service said morton until a period when few without as deep and kind a motive of interest as yours ailie would have known the stripling morton in majorgeneral melville  malville was your mothers name said mrs wilson but morton sounds far bonnier in my auld lugs and when ye tak up the lairdship ye maun tak the auld name and designation again  i am like to be in no haste to do either the one or the other ailie for i have some reasons for the present to conceal my being alive from every one but you and as for the lairdship of milnwood it is in as good hands  as gude hands hinny reechoed ailie im hopefu ye are no meaning mine the rents and the lands are but a sair fash to me and im ower failed to tak a helpmate though wylie mactrickit the writer was very pressing and spak very civilly but i m ower auld a cat to draw that strae before me he canna whilliwhaw me as hes dune mony a ane and then i thought aye ye wad come back and i wad get my pickle meal and my soup milk and keep a things right about ye as i used to do in your puir uncles time and it wad be just pleasure eneugh for me to see ye thrive and guide the gear canny yell hae learned that in holland ise warrant for theyre thrifty folk there as i hear tellbut yell be for keeping rather a mair house than puir auld milnwood thats gave and indeed i would approve o your eating butchermeat maybe as aften as three times aweekit keeps the wind out o the stamack  we will talk of all this another time said morton surprised at the generosity upon a large scale which mingled in ailies thoughts and actions with habitual and sordid parsimony and at the odd contrast between her love of saving and indifference to selfacquisition you must know he continued that i am in this country only for a few days on some special business of importance to the government and therefore ailie not a word of having seen me at some other time i will acquaint you fully with my motives and intentions  een be it sae my jo replied ailie i can keep a secret like my neighbours and weel auld milnwood kend it honest man for he tauld me where he keepit his gear and thats what maist folk like to hae as private as possibly may bebut come awa wi me hinny till i show ye the oakparlour how grandly its keepit just as if ye had been expected haine every dayi loot naebody sort it but my ain hands it was a kind o divertisement to me though whiles the tear wan into my ee and i said to mysell what needs i fash wi grates and carpets and cushions and the muckle brass candlesticks ony mair for theyll neer come hame that aught it rightfully  with these words she hauled him away to this sanctum sanctorum the scrubbing and cleaning whereof was her daily employment as its high state of good order constituted the very pride of her heart morton as he followed her into the room underwent a rebuke for not dighting his shune which showed that ailie had not relinquished her habits of authority on entering the oakparlour he could not but recollect the feelings of solemn awe with which when a boy he had been affected at his occasional and rare admission to an apartment which he then supposed had not its equal save in the halls of princes it may be readily supposed that the workedworsted chairs with their short ebony legs and long upright backs had lost much of their influence over his mind that the large brass andirons seemed diminished in splendour that the green worsted tapestry appeared no masterpiece of the arras loom and that the room looked on the whole dark gloomy and disconsolate yet there were two objects the counterfeit presentment of two brothers which dissimilar as those described by hamlet affected his mind with a variety of sensations one fulllength portrait represented his father in complete armour with a countenance indicating his masculine and determined character and the other set forth his uncle in velvet and brocade looking as if he were ashamed of his own finery though entirely indebted for it to the liberality of the painter  it was an idle fancy ailie said to dress the honest auld man in thae expensive fallalls that he neer wore in his life instead o his douce raploch grey and his band wi the narrow edging  in private morton could not help being much of her opinion for anything approaching to the dress of a gentleman sate as ill on the ungainly person of his relative as an open or generous expression would have done on his mean and moneymaking features he now extricated himself from ailie to visit some of his haunts in the neighbouring wood while her own hands made an addition to the dinner she was preparingan incident no otherwise remarkable than as it cost the life of a fowl which for any event of less importance than the arrival of henry morton might have cackled on to a good old age ere ailie could have been guilty of the extravagance of killing and dressing it the meal was seasoned by talk of old times and by the plans which ailie laid out for futurity in which she assigned her young master all the prudential habits of her old one and planned out the dexterity with which she was to exercise her duty as governante morton let the old woman enjoy her daydreams and castlebuilding during moments of such pleasure and deferred till some fitter occasion the communication of his purpose again to return and spend his life upon the continent  his next care was to lay aside his military dress which he considered likely to render more difficult his researches after burley he exchanged itfor a grey doublet and cloak formerly his usual attire at milnwood and which mrs wilson produced from a chest of walnuttree wherein she had laid them aside without forgetting carefully to brush and air them from time to time morton retained his sword and firearms without which few persons travelled in those unsettled times when he appeared in his new attire mrs wilson was first thankful that they fitted him sae decently since though he was nae fatter yet he looked mair manly than when he was taen frae milnwood  next she enlarged on the advantage of saving old clothes to be what she called beetmasters to the new and was far advanced in the history of a velvet cloak belonging to the late milnwood which had first been converted to a velvet doublet and then into a pair of breeches and appeared each time as good as new when morton interrupted her account of its transmigration to bid her goodby  he gave indeed a sufficient shock to her feelings by expressing the necessity he was under of proceeding on his journey that evening  and where are ye gaun and what wad ye do that for and whar wad ye sleep but in your ain house after ye hae been sae mony years frae hame  i feel all the unkindness of it ailie but it must be so and that was the reason that i attempted to conceal myself from you as i suspected you would not let me part from you so easily  but whar are ye gaun then said ailie once more saw eer mortal een the like o you just to come ae moment and flee awa like an arrow out of a bow the neist  i must go down replied morton to niel blane the pipers howff he can give me a bed i suppose  a bed ise warrant can he replied ailie and gar ye pay weel for t into the bargain laddie i daresay ye hae lost your wits in thae foreign parts to gang and gie siller for a supper and a bed and might hae baith for naething and thanks t ye for accepting them  i assure you ailie said morton desirous to silence her remonstrances that this is a business of great importance in which i may be a great gainer and cannot possibly be a loser  i dinna see how that can be if ye begin by gieing maybe the feck o twal shillings scots for your supper but young folks are aye venturesome and think to get siller that way my puir auld master took a surer gate and never parted wi it when he had anes gotten t  persevering in his desperate resolution morton took leave of ailie and mounted his horse to proceed to the little town after exacting a solemn promise that she would conceal his return until she again saw or heard from him  i am not very extravagant was his natural reflection as he trotted slowly towards the town but were ailie and i to set up house together as she proposes i think my profusion would break the good old creatures heart before a week were out      chapter xx                 wheres the jolly host                you told me of t has been my custom ever                to parley with mine host                                   lovers progress  morton reached the borough town without meeting with any remarkable adventure and alighted at the little inn it had occurred to him more than once while upon his journey that his resumption of the dress which he had worn while a youth although favourable to his views in other respects might render it more difficult for him to remain incognito but a few years of campaigns and wandering had so changed his appearance that he had great confidence that in the grown man whose brows exhibited the traces of resolution and considerate thought none would recognise the raw and bashful stripling who won the game of the popinjay the only chance was that here and there some whig whom he had led to battle might remember the captain of the milnwood marksmen but the risk if there was any could not be guarded against  the howff seemed full and frequented as if possessed of all its old celebrity the person and demeanour of niel blane more fat and less civil than of yore intimated that he had increased as well in purse as in corpulence for in scotland a landlords complaisance for his guests decreases in exact proportion to his rise in the world his daughter had acquired the air of a dexterous barmaid undisturbed by the circumstances of love and war so apt to perplex her in the exercise of her vocation both showed morton the degree of attention which could have been expected by a stranger travelling without attendants at a time when they were particularly the badges of distinction he took upon himself exactly the character his appearance presented went to the stable and saw his horse accommodated then returned to the house and seating himself in the public room for to request one to himself would in those days have been thought an overweening degree of conceit he found himself in the very apartment in which he had some years before celebrated his victory at the game of the popinjaya jocular preferment which led to so many serious consequences  he felt himself as may well be supposed a much changed man since that festivity and yet to look around him the groups assembled in the howff seemed not dissimilar to those which the same scene had formerly presented two or three burghers husbanded their dribbles o brandy two or three dragoons lounged over their muddy ale and cursed the inactive times that allowed them no better cheer their cornet did not indeed play at backgammon with the curate in his cassock but he drank a little modicum of aqua mirabilis with the greycloaked presbyterian minister the scene was another and yet the same differing only in persons but corresponding in general character  let the tide of the world wax or wane as it will morton thought as he looked around him enough will be found to fill the places which chance renders vacant and in the usual occupations and amusements of life human beings will succeed each other as leaves upon the same tree with the same individual difference and the same general resemblance  after pausing a few minutes morton whose experience had taught him the readiest mode of securing attention ordered a pint of claret and as the smiling landlord appeared with the pewter measure foaming fresh from the tap for bottling wine was not then in fashion he asked him to sit down and take a share of the good cheer this invitation was peculiarly acceptable to niel blane who if he did not positively expect it from every guest not provided with better company yet received it from many and was not a whit abashed or surprised at the summons he sat down along with his guest in a secluded nook near the chimney and while he received encouragement to drink by far the greater share of the liquor before them he entered at length as a part of his expected functions upon the news of the countrythe births deaths and marriages the change of property the downfall of old families and the rise of new but politics now the fertile source of eloquence mine host did not care to mingle in his theme and it was only in answer to a question of morton that he replied with an air of indifference um ay we aye hae sodgers amang us mair or less theres a wheen german horse down at glasgow yonder they ca their commander wittybody or some sic name though hes as grave and grewsome an auld dutchman as eer i saw  wittenbold perhaps said mortonan old man with grey hair and short black moustaches speaks seldom  and smokes for ever replied niel blane i see your honour kens the man he may be a very gude man too for aught i seethat is considering he is a sodger and a dutchman but if he were ten generals and as mony wittybodies he has nae skill in the pipes he gard me stop in the middle of torphichens rantthe best piece o music that ever bag gae wind to  but these fellows said morton glancing his eye towards the soldiers that were in the apartment are not of his corps  na na these are scotch dragoons said mine hostour ain auld caterpillars these were claverses lads a while syne and wad be again maybe if he had the lang ten in his hand  is there not a report of his death inquired morton  troth is there said the landlord your honour is rightthere is sic a fleeing rumour but in my puir opinion its lang or the deil die i wad hae the folks here look to themsells if he makes an outbreak hell be doun frae the hielands or i could drink this glassand whare are they then a thae hellrakers o dragoons wad be at his whistle in a moment nae doubt theyre willies men een now as they were jamess a while syne and reason goodthey fight for their pay what else hae they to fight for they hae neither lands nor houses i trow theres ae gude thing o the change or the revolution as they ca itfolks may speak out afore thae birkies now and nae fear o being hauled awa to the guardhouse or having the thumikins screwed on your fingerends just as i wad drive the screw through a cork  there was a little pause when morton feeling confident in the progress he had made in mine hosts familiarity asked though with the hesitation proper to one who puts a question on the answer to which rests something of importance whether blane knew a woman in that neighbourhood called elizabeth maclure  whether i ken bessie maclure answered the landlord with a landlords laughhow can i but ken my

the road for ten lang scots miles and thats worth twenty english i am sorry your honour would think o gaun out o my house the night but my wifes gudesister is a decent woman and its no lost that a friend gets  morton accordingly paid his reckoning and departed the sunset of the summer day placed him at the ashtree where the path led up towards the moors  here he said to himself my misfortunes commenced for just here when burley and i were about to separate on the first night we ever met he was alarmed by the intelligence that the passes were secured by soldiers lying in wait for him beneath that very ash sate the old woman who apprised him of his danger how strange that my whole fortunes should have become inseparably interwoven with that mans without anything more on my part than the discharge of an ordinary duty of humanity would to heaven it were possible i could find my humble quiet and tranquillity of mind upon the spot where i lost them  thus arranging his reflections betwixt speech and thought he turned his horses head up the path  evening lowered around him as he advanced up the narrow dell which had once been a wood but was now a ravine divested of trees unless where a few from their inaccessible situation on the edge of precipitous banks or clinging among rocks and huge stones defied the invasion of men and of cattle like the scattered tribes of a conquered country driven to take refuge in the barren strength of its mountains these too wasted and decayed seemed rather to exist than to flourish and only served to indicate what the landscape had once been but the stream brawled down among them in all its freshness and vivacity giving the life and animation which a mountain rivulet alone can confer on the barest and most savage scenes and which the inhabitants of such a country miss when gazing even upon the tranquil winding of a majestic stream through plains of fertility and beside palaces of splendour the track of the road followed the course of the brook which was now visible and now only to be distinguished by its brawling heard among the stones or in the clefts of the rock that occasionally interrupted its course  murmurer that thou art said morton in the enthusiasm of his reverie why chafe with the rocks that stop thy course for a moment there is a sea to receive thee in its bosom and there is an eternity for man when his fretful and hasty course through the vale of time shall be ceased and over what thy petty fuming is to the deep and vast billows of a shoreless ocean are our cares hopes fears joys and sorrows to the objects which must occupy us through the awful and boundless succession of ages  thus moralizing our traveller passed on till the dell opened and the banks receding from the brook left a little green vale exhibiting a croft or small field on which some corn was growing and a cottage whose walls were not above five feet high and whose thatched roof green with moisture age houseleek and grass had in some places suffered damage from the encroachment of two cows whose appetite this appearance of verdure had diverted from their more legitimate pasture an illspelt and worsewritten inscription intimated to the traveller that he might here find refreshment for man and horseno unacceptable intimation rude as the hut appeared to be considering the wild path he had trod in approaching it and the high and waste mountains which rose in desolate dignity behind this humble asylum  it must indeed have been thought morton in some such spot as this that burley was likely to find a congenial confident  as he approached he observed the good dame of the house herself seated by the door she had hitherto been concealed from him by a huge alderbush  good evening mother said the traveller your name is mistress maclure  elizabeth maclure sir a poor widow was the reply  can you lodge a stranger for a night  i can sir if he will be pleased with the widows cake and the widows cruse  i have been a soldier good dame answered morton and nothing can come amiss to me in the way of entertainment  a sodger sir said the old woman with a sighgod send ye a better trade  it is believed to be an honourable profession my good dame i hope you do not think the worse of me for having belonged to it  i judge no one sir replied the woman and your voice sounds like that of a civil gentleman but i hae witnessed sae muckle ill wi sodgering in this puir land that i am een content that i can see nae mair ot wi these sightless organs  as she spoke thus morton observed that she was blind  shall i not be troublesome to you my good dame said he compassionately your infirmity seems ill calculated for your profession  na sir answered the old woman i can gang about the house readily eneugh and i hae a bit lassie to help me and the dragoon lads will look after your horse when they come hame frae their patrol for a sma matter they are civiller now than lang syne  upon these assurances morton alighted  peggy my bonny bird continued the hostess addressing a little girl of twelve years old who had by this time appeared tak the gentlemans horse to the stable and slack his girths and tak aff the bridle and shake down a lock o hay before him till the dragoons come backcome this way sir she continued yell find my house clean though its a puir ane  morton followed her into the cottage accordingly      chapter xxi                 then out and spake the auld mother                and fast her tears did fa                ye wadna be warnd my son johnie                frae the hunting to bide awa                                           old ballad  when he entered the cottage morton perceived that the old hostess had spoken truth the inside of the hut belied its outward appearance and was neat and even comfortable especially the inner apartment in which the hostess informed her guest that he was to sup and sleep refreshments were placed before him such as the little inn afforded and though he had small occasion for them he accepted the offer as the means of maintaining some discourse with the landlady notwithstanding her blindness she was assiduous in her attendance and seemed by a sort of instinct to find her way to what she wanted  have you no one but this pretty little girl to assist you in waiting on your guests was the natural question  none sir replied his old hostess i dwell alone like the widow of zarephath few guests come to this puir place and i haena custom eneugh to hire servants i had anes twa fine sons that lookit after a thing but god gives and takes awayhis name be praised she continued turning her clouded eyes towards heaveni was anes better off that is waridly speaking even since i lost them but that was before this last change  indeed said morton and yet you are a presbyterian my good mother  i am sir praised be the light that showed me the right way replied the landlady  then i should have thought continued the guest the revolution would have brought you nothing but good  if said the old woman it has brought the land gude and freedom of worship to tender consciences its little matter what it has brought to a puir blind worm like me  still replied morton i cannot see how it could possibly injure you  its a lang story sir answered his hostess with a sigh but ae night sax weeks or thereby afore bothwell brigg a young gentleman stopped at this puir cottage stiff and bloody with wounds pale and dune out wi riding and his horse sae weary he couldna drag ae foot after the other and his foes were close ahint him and he was ane o our enemies what could i do sir you thats a sodger will think me but a silly auld wife but i fed him and relieved him and keepit him hidden till the pursuit was ower  and who said morton dares disapprove of your having done so  i kenna answered the blind woman i gat illwill about it amang some o our ain folk they said i should hae been to him what jael was to sisera but weel i wot i had nae divine command to shed blood and to save it was baith like a woman and a christian and then they said i wanted natural affection to relieve ane that belanged to the band that murdered my twa sons  that murdered your two sons  ay sir though maybe yell gie their deaths another name the tane fell wi sword in hand fighting for a broken national covenant the totheroh they took him and shot him dead on the green before his mothers face my auld een dazzled when the shots were looten off and to my thought they waxed weaker and weaker ever since that weary day and sorrow and heartbreak and tears that would not be dried might help on the disorder but alas betraying lord evandales young blood to his enemies sword wad neer hae brought my ninian and johnie alive again  lord evandale said morton in surprise was it lord evandale whose life you saved  in troth even his she replied and kind he was to me after and gae me a cow and calf malt meal and siller and nane durst steer me when he was in power but we live on an outside bit of tillietudlem land and the estate was sair plead between leddy margaret bellenden and the present laird basil olifant and lord evandale backed the auld leddy for love o her daughter miss edith as the country said ane o the best and bonniest lassies in scotland but they behuved to gie way and basil gat the castle and land and on the back o that came the revolution and wha to turn coat faster than the laird for he said he had been a true whig a the time and turned papist only for fashions sake and then he got favour and lord evandales head was under water for he was ower proud and manfu to bend to every blast o wind though mony a ane may ken as weel as me that be his ain principles as they might he was nae ill friend to our folk when he could protect us and far kinder than basil olifant that aye keepit the cobble head doun the stream but he was set by and ill looked on and his word neer asked and then basil whas a revengefu man set himsell to vex him in a shapes and especially by oppressing and despoiling the auld blind widow bessie maclure that saved lord evandales life and that he was sae kind to but hes mistaen if thats his end for it will be lang or lord evandale hears a word frae me about the selling my kye for rent or eer it was due or the putting the dragoons on me when the countrys quiet or onything else that will vex himi can bear my ain burden patiently and warlds loss is the least part ot  astonished and interested at this picture of patient grateful and highminded resignation morton could not help bestowing an execration upon the poorspirited rascal who had taken such a dastardly course of vengeance  dinna curse him sir said the old woman i have heard a good man say that a curse was like a stone flung up to the heavens and maist like to return on the head that sent it but if ye ken lord evandale bid him look to himsell for i hear strange words pass atween the sodgers that are lying here and his name is often mentioned and the tane o them has been twice up at tillietudlem hes a kind of favourite wi the laird though he was in former times ane o the maist cruel oppressors ever rade through a country outtaken sergeant bothwellthey ca him inglis  i have the deepest interest in lord evandales safety said morton and you may depend on my finding some mode to apprise him of these suspicious circumstances and in return my good friend will you indulge me with another question do you know anything of quintin mackell of irongray  do i know whom echoed the blind woman in a tone of great surprise and alarm  quintin mackell of irongray repeated morton is there anything so alarming in the sound of that name  na na answered the woman with hesitation but to hear him asked after by a stranger and a sodgergude protect us what mischief is to come next  none by my means i assure you said morton the subject of my inquiry has nothing to fear from me if as i suppose this quintin mackell is the same with john bal  do not mention his name said the widow pressing his lips with her fingers i see you have his secret and his password and ill be free wi you but for gods sake speak lound and low in the name of heaven i trust ye seek him not to his hurt ye said ye were a sodger  i said truly but one he has nothing to fear from i commanded a party at bothwell bridge  indeed said the woman and verily there is something in your voice i can trust ye speak prompt and readily and like an honest man  i trust i am so said morton  but nae displeasure to you sir in thae waefu times continued mrs maclure the hand of brother is against brother and he fears as mickle almaist frae this government as eer he did frae the auld persecutors  indeed said morton in a tone of inquiry i was not aware of that but i am only just now returned from abroad  ill tell ye said the blind woman first assuming an attitude of listening that showed how effectually her powers of collecting intelligence had been transferred from the eye to the ear for instead of casting a glance of circumspection around she stooped her face and turned her head slowly around in such a manner as to insure that there was not the slightest sound stirring in the neighbourhood and then continuedill tell ye ye ken how he has laboured to raise up again the covenant burned broken and buried in the hard hearts and selfish devices of this stubborn people now when he went to holland far from the countenance and thanks of the great and the comfortable fellowship of the godly both whilk he was in right to expect the prince of orange wad show him no favour and the ministers no godly communion this was hard to bide for ane that had suffered and done mickleower mickle it may be but why suld i be a judge he came back to me and to the auld place o refuge that had often received him in his distresses mair especially before the great day of victory at drumclog for i sail neer forget how he was bending hither of a nights in the year on that eening after the play when young milnwood wan the popinjay but i warned him off for that time  what exclaimed morton it was you that sat in your red cloak by the highroad and told him there was a lion in the path  in the name of heaven wha are ye said the old woman breaking off her narrative in astonishment but be wha ye may she continued resuming it with tranquillity ye can ken naething waur o me than that i hae been willing to save the life o friend and foe  i know no ill of you mrs maclure and i mean no ill by you i only wished to show you that i know so much of this persons affairs that i might be safely intrusted with the rest proceed if you please in your narrative  there is a strange command in your voice said the blind woman though its tones are sweet i have little mair to say the stewarts hae been dethroned and william and mary reign in their stead but nae mair word of the covenant than if it were a dead letter they hae taen the indulged clergy and an erastian general assembly of the ante pure and triumphant kirk of scotland even into their very arms and bosoms our faithfu champions o the testimony agree een waur wi this than wi the open tyranny and apostasy of the persecuting times for souls are hardened and deadened and the mouths of fasting multitudes are crammed wi fizenless bran instead of the sweet word in season and mony an hungry starving creature when he sits down on a sunday forenoon to get something that might warm him to the great work has a dry clatter o morality driven about his lugs and  in short said morton desirous to stop a discussion which the good old woman as enthusiastically attached to her religious profession as to the duties of humanity might probably have indulged longerin short you are not disposed to acquiesce in this new government and burley is of the same opinion  many of our brethren sir are of belief we fought for the covenant and fasted and prayed and suffered for that grand national league and now we are like neither to see nor hear tell of that which we suffered and fought and fasted and prayed for and anes it was thought something might be made by bringing back the auld family on a new bargain and a new bottom as after a when king james went awa i understand the great quarrel of the english against him was in behalf of seven unhallowed prelates and sae though ae part of our people were free to join wi the present model and levied an armed regiment under the yerl of angus yet our honest friend and others that stude up for purity of doctrine and freedom of conscience were determined to hear the breath o the jacobites before they took part again them fearing to fa to the ground like a wall built with unslaked mortar or from sitting between twa stools  they chose an odd quarter said morton from which to expect freedom of conscience and purity of doctrine  oh dear sir said the landlady the natural dayspring rises in the east but the spiritual dayspring may rise in the north for what we blinded mortals ken  and burley went to the north to seek it replied the guest  truly ay sir and he saw claverse himsell that they ca dundee now  what exclaimed morton in amazement i would have sworn that meeting would have been the last of one of their lives  na na sir in troubled times as i understand said mrs maclure theres sudden changesmontgomery and ferguson and mony ane mair that were king jamess greatest faes are on his side now claverse spake our friend fair and sent him to consult with lord evandale but then there was a breakoff for lord evandale wadna look at hear or speak wi him and now hes anes wud and aye waur and roars for revenge again lord evandale and will hear nought of onything but burn and slay and oh thae starts o passion they unsettle his mind and gie the enemy sair advantages  the enemy said morton what enemy  what enemy are ye acquainted familiarly wi john balfour o burley and dinna ken that he has had sair and frequent combats to sustain against the evil one did ye ever see him alone but the bible was in his hand and the drawn sword on his knee did ye never sleep in the same room wi him and hear him strive in his dreams with the delusions of satan oh ye ken little o him if ye have seen him only in fair daylight for nae man can put the face upon his doleful visits and strifes that he can do i hae seen him after sic a strife of agony tremble that an infant might hae held him while the hair on his brow was drapping as fast as ever my puir thatched roof did in a heavy rain as she spoke morton began to recollect the appearance of burley during his sleep in the hayloft at milnwood the report of cuddie that his senses had become impaired and some whispers current among the cameronians who boasted frequently of burleys soulexercises and his strifes with the foul fiendwhich several circumstances led him to conclude that this man himself was a victim to those delusions though his mind naturally acute and forcible not only disguised his superstition from those in whose opinion it might have discredited his judgment but by exerting such a force as is said to be proper to those afflicted with epilepsy could postpone the fits which it occasioned until he was either freed from superintendence or surrounded by such as held him more highly on account of these visitations it was natural to suppose and could easily be inferred from the narrative of mrs maclure that disappointed ambition wrecked hopes and the downfall of the party which he had served with such desperate fidelity were likely to aggravate enthusiasm into temporary insanity it was indeed no uncommon circumstance in those singular times that men like sir harry vane harrison overton and others themselves slaves to the wildest and most enthusiastic dreams could when mingling with the world conduct themselves not only with good sense in difficulties and courage in dangers but with the most acute sagacity and determined valour the subsequent part of mrs maclures information confirmed morton in these impressions  in the grey of the morning she said my little peggy sail show ye the gate to him before the sodgers are up but ye maun let his hour of danger as he cas it be ower afore ye venture on him in his place of refuge peggy will tell ye when to venture in she kens his ways weel for whiles she carries him some little helps that he canna do without to sustain life  and in what retreat then said morton has this unfortunate person found refuge  an awsome place answered the blind woman as ever living creature took refuge in they ca it the black linn of linklater its a doleful place but he loves it abune a others because he has sae often been in safe hiding there and its my belief he prefers it to a tapestried chamber and a down bed but yell see t i hae seen it mysell mony a day syne i was a daft hempie lassie then and little thought what was to come otwad ye choose ony thing sir ere ye betake yoursell to your rest for ye maun stir wi the first dawn o the grey light  nothing more my good mother said morton and they parted for the evening  morton recommended himself to heaven threw himself on the bed heard between sleeping and waking the trampling of the dragoon horses at the riders return from their patrol and then slept soundly after such painful agitation      chapter xxii                 the darksome cave they enter where they found                the accursed man low sitting on the ground                musing full sadly in his sullen mind                                       spenser  as the morning began to appear on the mountains a gentle knock was heard at the door of the humble apartment in which morton slept and a girlish treble voice asked him from without if he wad please gang to the linn or the folk raise  he arose upon the invitation and dressing himself hastily went forth and joined his little guide the mountain maid tript lightly before him through the grey haze over hill and moor it was a wild and varied walk unmarked by any regular or distinguishable track and keeping upon the whole the direction of the ascent of the brook though without tracing its windings the landscape as they advanced became waster and more wild until nothing but heath and rock encumbered the side of the valley  is the place still distant said morton nearly a mile off answered the girl well be there belive  and do you often go this wild journey my little maid  when grannie sends me wi milk and meal to the linn answered the child  and are you not afraid to travel so wild a road alone  hout na sir replied the guide nae living creature wad touch sic a bit thing as i am and grannie says we need never fear onything else when we are doing a gude turn  strong in innocence as in triple mail said morton to himself and followed her steps in silence  they soon came to a decayed thicket where brambles and thorns supplied the room of the oak and birches of which it had once consisted here the guide turned short off the open heath and by a sheeptrack conducted morton to the brook a hoarse and sullen roar had in part prepared him for the scene which presented itself yet it was not to be viewed without surprise and even terror when he emerged from the devious path which conducted him through the thicket he found himself placed on a ledge of flat rock projecting over one side of a chasm not less than a hundred feet deep where the dark mountainstream made a decided and rapid shoot over the precipice and was swallowed up by a deep black yawning gulf the eye in vain strove to see the bottom of the fall it could catch but one sheet of foaming uproar and sheer descent until the view was obstructed by the proecting crags which enclosed the bottom of the waterfall and hid from sight the dark pool which received its tortured waters far beneath at the distance of perhaps a quarter of a mile the eye caught the winding of the stream as it emerged into a more open course but for that distance they were lost to sight as much as if a cavern had been arched over them and indeed the steep and projecting ledges of rock through which they wound their way in darkness were very nearly closing and overroofing their course  while morton gazed at this scene of tumult which seemed by the surrounding thickets and the clefts into which the waters descended to seek to hide itself from every eye his little attendant as she stood beside him on the platform of rock which commanded the best view of the fall pulled him by the sleeve and said in a tone which he could not hear without stooping his ear near the speaker hear till him eh hear till him  morton listened more attentively and out of the very abyss into which the brook fell and amidst the turnultuary sounds of the cataract thought he could distinguish shouts screams and even articulate words as if the tortured demon of the stream had been mingling his complaints with the roar of his broken waters  this is the way said the little girl follow me gin ye please sir but tak tent to your feet and with the daring agility which custom had rendered easy she vanished from the platform on which she stood and by notches and slight projections in the rock scrambled down its face into the chasm which it overhung steady bold and active morton hesitated not to follow her but the necessary attention to secure his hold and footing in a descent where both foot and hand were needful for security prevented him from looking around him till having descended nigh twenty feet and being sixty or seventy above the pool which received the fall his guide made a pause and he again found himself by her side in a situation that appeared equally romantic and precarious they were nearly opposite to the waterfall and in point of level situated at about onequarters depth from the point of the cliff over which it thundered and threefourths of the height above the dark deep and restless pool which received its fall both these tremendous pointsthe first shoot namely of the yet unbroken stream and the deep and sombre abyss into which it was emptiedwere full before him as well as the whole continuous stream of billowy froth which dashing from the one was eddying and boiling in the other they were so near this grand phenomenon that they were covered with its spray and wellnigh deafened by the incessant roar but crossing in the very front of the fall and at scarce three yards distance from the cataract an old oaktree flung across the chasm in a manner that seemed accidental formed a bridge of fearfully narrow dimensions and uncertain footing the upper end of the tree rested on the platform on which they stood the lower or uprooted extremity extended behind a projection on the opposite side and was secured mortons eye could not discover where from behind the same projection glimmered a strong red light which glancing in the waves of the falling water and tinging them partially with crimson had a strange preternatural and sinister effect when contrasted with the beams of the rising sun which glanced on the first broken waves of the fall though even its meridian splendour could not gain the third of its full depth when he had looked around him for a moment the girl again pulled his sleeve and pointing to the oak and the projecting point beyond it for hearing speech was now out of the question indicated that there lay his farther passage  morton gazed at her with surprise for although he well knew that the persecuted presbyterians had in the preceding reigns sought refuge among dells and thickets caves and cataracts in spots the most extraordinary and secluded although he had heard of the champions of the covenant who had long abidden beside dobslien on the wild heights of polmoodie and others who had been concealed in the yet more terrific cavern called creehopelinn in the parish of closeburnyet his imagination had never exactly figured out the horrors of such a residence and he was surprised how the strange and romantic scene which he now saw had remained concealed from him while a curious investigator of such natural phenomena but he readily conceived that lying in a remote and wild district and being destined as a place of concealment to the persecuted preachers and professors of nonconformity the secret of its existence was carefully preserved by the few shepherds to whom it might be known as breaking from these meditations he began to consider how he should traverse the doubtful and terrific bridge which skirted by the cascade and rendered wet and slippery by its constant drizzle traversed the chasm above sixty feet from the bottom of the fall his guide as if to give him courage tript over and back without the least hesitation envying for a moment the little bare feet which caught a safer hold of the rugged side of the oak than he could pretend to with his heavy boots morton nevertheless resolved to attempt the passage and fixing his eye firm on a stationary object on the other side without allowing his head to become giddy or his attention to be distracted by the flash the foam and the roar of the waters around him he strode steadily and safely along the uncertain bridge and reached the mouth of a small cavern on the farther side of the torrent here he paused for a light proceeding from a fire of redhot charcoal permitted him to see the interior of the cave and enabled him to contemplate the appearance of its inhabitant by whom he himself could not be so readily distinguished being concealed by the shadow of the rock what he observed would by no means have encouraged a less determined man to proceed with the task which he had undertaken  burley only altered from what he had been formerly by the addition of a grisly beard stood in the midst of the cave with his clasped bible in one hand and his drawn sword in the other his figure dimly ruddied by the light of the red charcoal seemed that of a fiend in the lurid atmosphere of pandemonium and his gestures and words as far as they could be heard seemed equally violent and irregular all alone and in a place of almost unapproachable seclusion his demeanour was that of a man who strives for life and death with a mortal enemy ha hatherethere he exclaimed accompanying each word with a thrust urged with his whole force against the impassible and empty air did i not tell thee soi have resisted and thou fleest from mecoward as thou art come in all thy terrors come with mine own evil deeds which render thee most terrible of allthere is enough betwixt the boards of this book to rescue mewhat mutterest thou of grey hairs it was well done to slay himthe more ripe the corn the readier for the sickle art gone art gonei have ever known thee but a cowardha ha ha  with these wild exclamations he sunk the point of his sword and remained standing still in the same posture like a maniac whose fit is over  the dangerous time is by now said the little girl who had followed it seldom lasts beyond the time that the suns ower the hill ye may gang in and speak wi him now ill wait for you at the other side of the linn he canna bide to see twa folk at anes  slowly and cautiously and keeping constantly upon his guard morton presented himself to the view of his old associate in command  what comest thou again when thine hour is over was his first exclamation and flourishing his sword aloft his countenance assumed an expression in which ghastly terror seemed mingled with the rage of a demoniac  i am come mr balfour said morton in a steady and composed tone to renew an acquaintance which has been broken off since the fight of bothwell bridge  as soon as burley became aware that morton was before him in personan idea which he caught with marvellous celerityhe at once exerted that mastership over his heated and enthusiastic imagination the power of enforcing which was a most striking part of his extraordinary character he sunk his swordpoint at once and as he stole it composedly into the scabbard he muttered something of the damp and cold which sent an old soldier to his fencing exercise to prevent his blood from chilling this done he proceeded in the cold determined manner which was peculiar to his ordinary discourse  thou hast tarried long henry morton and hast not come to the vintage before the twelfth hour has struck art thou yet willing to take the right hand of fellowship and be one with those who look not to thrones or dynasties but to the rule of scripture for their directions   illustration morton and black linn272   i am surprised said morton evading the direct answer to his question that you should have known me after so many years  the features of those who ought to act with me are engraved on my heart answered burley and few but silas mortons son durst have followed me into this my castle of retreat seest thou that drawbridge of natures own construction he added pointing to the prostrate oaktreeone spurn of my foot and it is overwhelmed in the abyss below bidding foeman on the farther side stand at defiance and leaving enemies on this at the mercy of one who never yet met his equal in single fight  of such defences said morton i should have thought you would now have had little need  little need said burley impatiently what little need when incarnate fiends are combined against me on earth and sathan himselfbut it matters not added he checking himself enough that i like my place of refuge my cave of adullam and would not change its rude ribs of limestone rock for the fair chambers of the castle of the earls of torwood with their broad bounds and barony thou unless the foolish feverfit be over mayst think differently  it was of those very possessions i came to speak said morton and i doubt not to find mr balfour the same rational and reflecting person which i knew him to be in times when zeal disunited brethren  ay said burley indeed is such truly your hope wilt thou express it more plainly  in a word then said morton you have exercised by means at which i can guess a secret but most prejudicial influence over the fortunes of lady margaret bellenden and her granddaughter and in favour of that base oppressive apostate basil olifant whom the law deceived by thy operations has placed in possession of their lawful property  sayest thou said balfour  i do say so replied morton and face to face you will not deny what you have vouched by your handwriting  and suppose i deny it not said balfour and suppose that thyeloquence were found equal to persuade me to retrace the steps i have taken on matured resolvewhat will be thy meed dost thou still hope to possess the fairhaired girl with her wide and rich inheritance  i have no such hope answered morton calmly  and for whom then hast thou ventured to do this great thingto seek to rend the prey from the valiant to bring forth food from the den of the lion and to extract sweetness from the maw of the devourer for whose sake hast thou undertaken to read this riddle more hard than samsons  for lord evandales and that of his bride replied morton firmly think better of mankind mr balfour and believe there are some who are willing to sacrifice their happiness to that of others  then as my soul liveth replied balfour thou art to wear beard and back a horse and draw a sword the tamest and most gallless puppet that ever sustained injury unavenged what thou wouldst help that accursed evandale to the arms of the woman that thou lovest thou wouldst endow them with wealth and with heritages and thou thinkst that there lives another man offended even more deeply than thou yet equally coldlivered and meanspirited crawling upon the face of the earth and hast dared to suppose that one other to be john balfour  for my own feelings said morton composedly i am answerable to none but heaven to you mr balfour i should suppose it of little consequence whether basil olifant or lord evandale possess these estates  thou art deceived said burley both are indeed in outer darkness and strangers to the light as he whose eyes have never been opened to the day but this basil olifant is a nabal a demas a base churl whose wealth and power are at the disposal of him who can threaten to deprive him of them he became a professor because he was deprived of these lands of tillietudlem he turned a papist to obtain possession of them he called himself an erastian that he might not again lose them and he will become what i list while i have in my power the document that may deprive him of them these lands are a bit between his jaws and a hook in his nostrils and the rein and the line are in my hands to guide them as i think meet and his they shall therefore be unless i had assurance of bestowing them on a sure and sincere friend but lord evandale is a malignant of heart like flint and brow like adamant the goods of the world fall on him like leaves on the frostbound earth and unmoved he will see them whirled off by the first wind the heathen virtues of such as he are more dangerous to us than the sordid cupidity of those who governed by their interest must follow where it leads and who therefore themselves the slaves of avarice may be compelled to work in the vineyard were it but to earn the wages of sin  this might have been all well some years since replied morton and i could understand your argument although i could never acquiesce in its justice but at this crisis it seems useless to you to persevere in keeping up an influence which can no longer be directed to an useful purpose the land has peace liberty and freedom of conscienceand what would you more  more exclaimed burley again unsheathing his sword with a vivacity which nearly made morton start look at the notches upon that weapon they are three in number are they not  it seems so answered morton but what of that  the fragment of steel that parted from this first gap rested on the skull of the perjured traitor who first introduced episcopacy into scotland this second notch was made in the ribbone of an impious villain the boldest and best soldier that upheld the prelatic cause at drumclog this third was broken on the steel headpiece of the captain who defended the chapel of holyrood when the people rose at the revolution i cleft him to the teeth through steel and bone it has done great deeds this little weapon and each of these blows was a deliverance to the church this sword he said again sheathing it has yet more to doto weed out this base and pestilential heresy of erastianism to vindicate the true liberty of the kirk in her purity to restore the covenant in its glorythen let it moulder and rust beside the bones of its master  you have neither men nor means mr balfour to disturb the government as now settled argued morton the people are in general satisfied excepting only the gentlemen of the jacobite interest and surely you would not join with those who would only use you for their own purposes  it is they answered burley that should serve ours i went to the camp of the malignant claverse as the future king of israel sought the land of the philistines i arranged with him a rising and but for the villain evandale the erastians ere now had been driven from the west i could slay him he added with a vindictive scowl were he grasping the horns of the altar he then proceeded in a calmer tone if thou son of mine ancient comrade were suitor for thyself to this edith bellenden and wert willing to put thy hand to the great work with zeal equal to thy courage think not i would prefer the friendship of basil olifant to thine thou shouldst then have the means that this document he produced a parchment affords to place her in possession of the lands of her fathers this have i longed to say to thee ever since i saw thee fight the good fight so strongly at the fatal bridge the maiden loved thee and thou her  morton replied firmly i will not dissemble with you mr balfour even to gain a good end i came in hopes to persuade you to do a deed of justice to others not to gain any selfish end of my own i have failed i grieve for your sake more than for the loss which others will sustain by your injustice  you refuse my proffer then said burley with kindling eyes  i do said morton would you be really as you are desirous to be thought a man of honour and conscience you would regardless of all other considerations restore that parchment to lord evandale to be used for the advantage of the lawful heir  sooner shall it perish said balfour and casting the deed into the heap of red charcoal beside him pressed it down with the heel of his boot  while it smoked shrivelled and crackled in the flames morton sprung forward to snatch it and burley catching hold of him a struggle ensued both were strong men but although morton was much the more active and younger of the two yet balfour was the most powerful and effectually prevented him from rescuing the deed until it was fairly reduced to a cinder they then quitted hold of each other and the enthusiast rendered fiercer by the contest glared on morton with an eye expressive of frantic revenge  thou hast my secret he exclaimed thou must be mine or die  i contemn your threats said morton i pity you and leave you but as he turned to retire burley stept before him pushed the oaktrunk from its resting place and as it fell thundering and crashing into the abyss beneath drew his sword and cried out with a voice that rivalled the roar of the cataract and the thunder of the falling oak now thou art at bay fightyield or die and standing in the mouth of the cavern he flourished his naked sword  i will not fight with the man that preserved my fathers life said morton i have not yet learned to say the words i yield and my life i will rescue as i best can  so speaking and ere balfour was aware of his purpose he sprung past him and exerting that youthful agility of which he possessed an uncommon share leaped clear across the fearful chasm which divided the mouth of the cave from the projecting rock on the opposite side and stood there safe and free from his incensed enemy he immediately ascended the ravine and as he turned saw burley stand for an instant aghast with astonishment and then with the frenzy of disappointed rage rush into the interior of his cavern  it was not difficult for him to perceive that this unhappy mans mind had been so long agitated by desperate schemes and sudden disappointments that it had lost its equipoise and that there was now in his conduct a shade of lunacy not the less striking from the vigour and craft with which he pursued his wild designs morton soon joined his guide who had been terrified by the fall of the oak this he represented as accidental and she assured him in return that the inhabitant of the cave would experience no inconvenience from it being always provided with materials to construct another bridge  the adventures of the morning were not yet ended as they approached the hut the little girl made an exclamation of surprise at seeing her grandmother groping her way towards them at a greater distance from her home than she could have been supposed capable of travelling  oh sir sir said the old woman when she heard them approach gin eer ye loved lord evandale help now or never god be praised that left my hearing when he took my poor eyesight come this waythis way and oh tread lightly peggy hinny gang saddle the gentlemans horse and lead him cannily ahint the thorny shaw and bide him there  she conducted him to a small window through which himself unobserved he could see two dragoons seated at their morning draught of ale and conversing earnestly together  the more i think of it said the one the less i like it inglis evandale was a good officer and the soldiers friend and though we were punished for the mutiny at tillietudlem yet by  frank you must own we deserved it  dn seize me if i forgive him for it though replied the other and i think i can sit in his skirts now  why man you should forget and forgive better take the start with him along with the rest and join the ranting highlanders we have all eat king jamess bread  thou art an ass the start as you call it will never happenthe days put off hallidays seen a ghost or miss bellendens fallen sick of the pip or some blasted nonsense or another the thing will never keep two days longer and the first bird that sings out will get the reward  thats true too answered his comrade and will this fellowthis basil olifantpay handsomely  like a prince man said inglis evandale is the man on earth whom he hates worst and he fears him besides about some law business and were he once rubbed out of the way all he thinks will be his own  but shall we have warrants and force enough said the other fellow few people here will stir against my lord and we may find him with some of our own fellows at his back  thou rt a cowardly fool dick returned inglis he is living quietly down at fairy knowe to avoid suspicion olifant is a magistrate and will have some of his own people that he can trust along with him there are us two and the laird says he can get a desperate fighting whig fellow called quintin mackell that has an old grudge at evandale  well well you are my officer you know said the private with true military conscience and if anything is wrong  ill take the blame said inglis come another pot of ale and let us to tillietudlemhere blind besswhy where the devil has the old hag crept to  delay them as long as you can whispered morton as he thrust his purse into the hostesss hand all depends on gaining time  then walking swiftly to the place where the girl held his horse ready to fairy knowe no alone i could not protect them i must instantly to glasgow wittenbold the commandant there will readily give me the support of a troop and procure me the countenance of the civil power i must drop a caution as i passcome moorkopf he said addressing his horse as he mounted him this day must try your breath and speed      chapter xxiii            yet could he not his closing eyes withdraw           though less and less of emily he saw           so speechless for a little space he lay           then graspd the hand he held and sighd his soul away                                        palamon and acite  the indisposition of edith confined her to bed during the eventful day on which she had received such an unexpected shock from the sudden apparition of morton next morning however she was reported to be so much better that lord evandale resumed his purpose of leaving fairy knowe at a late hour in the forenoon lady emily entered the apartment of edith with a peculiar gravity of manner having received and paid the compliments of the day she observed it would be a sad one for her though it would relieve miss bellenden of an encumbrance my brother leaves us today miss bellenden  leaves us exclaimed edith in surprise for his own house i trust  i have reason to think he meditates a more distant journey answered lady emily he has little to detain him in this country  good heaven exclaimed edith why was i born to become the wreck of all that is manly and noble what can be done to stop him from running headlong on ruin i will come down instantlysay that i implore he will not depart until i speak with him  it will be in vain miss bellenden but i will execute your commission and she left the room as formally as she had entered it and informed her brother miss bellenden was so much recovered as to propose coming downstairs ere he went away  i suppose she added pettishly the prospect of being speedily released from our company has wrought a cure on her shattered nerves  sister said lord evandale you are unjust if not envious  unjust i maybe evandale but i should not have dreamt glancing her eye at a mirror of being thought envious without better cause but let us go to the old lady she is making a feast in the other room which might have dined all your troop when you had one  lord evandale accompanied her in silence to the parlour for he knew it was in vain to contend with her prepossessions and offended pride they found the table covered with refreshments arranged under the careful inspection of lady margaret  ye could hardly weel be said to breakfast this morning my lord evandale and ye maun een partake of a small collation before ye ride such as this poor house whose inmates are so much indebted to you can provide in their present circumstances for my ain part i like to see young folk take some refection before they ride out upon their sports or their affairs and i said as much to his most sacred majesty when he breakfasted at tillietudlem in the year of grace sixteen hundred and fiftyone and his most sacred majesty was pleased to reply drinking to my health at the same time in a flagon of rhenish wine lady margaret ye speak like a highland oracle these were his majestys very words so that your lordship may judge whether i have not good authority to press young folk to partake of their vivers  it may be well supposed that much of the good ladys speech failed lord evandales ears which were then employed in listening for the light step of edith his absence of mind on this occasion however natural cost him very dear while lady margaret was playing the kind hostessa part she delighted and excelled inshe was interrupted by john gudyill who in the natural phrase for announcing an inferior to the mistress of a family said there was ane wanting to speak to her leddyship  ane what ane has he nae name ye speak as if i kept a shop and was to come at everybodys whistle  yes he has a name answered john but your leddyship likes ill to heart  what is it you fool  its calfgibbie my leddy said john in a tone rather above the pitch of decorous respect on which he occasionally trespassed confiding in his merit as an ancient servant of the family and a faithful follower of their humble fortunesits calfgibbie an your leddyship will haet that keeps edie henshaws kye down yonder at the briggendthats him that was gusegibbie at tillietudlem and gaed to the wappinshaw and that  hold your peace john said the old lady rising in dignity you are very insolent to think i wad speak wi a person like that let him tell his business to you or mrs headrigg  hell no hear o that my leddy he says them that sent him bade him gie the thing to your leddyships ain hand direct or to lord evandales he wots na whilk but to say the truth hes far frae fresh and hes but an idiot an he were  then turn him out said lady margaret and tell him to come back tomorrow when he is sober i suppose he comes to crave some benevolence as an ancient follower o the house  like eneugh my leddy for hes a in rags poor creature  gudyill made another attempt to get at gibbies commission which was indeed of the last importance being a few lines from morton to lord evandale acquainting him with the danger in which he stood from the practices of olifant and exhorting him either to instant flight or else to come to glasgow and surrender himself where he could assure him of protection this billet hastily written he intrusted to gibbie whom he saw feeding his herd beside the bridge and backed with a couple of dollars his desire that it might instantly be delivered into the hand to which it was addressed  but it was decreed that goosegibbies intermediation whether as an emissary or as a manatarms should be unfortunate to the family of tillietudlem he unluckily tarried so long at the alehouse to prove if his employers coin was good that when he appeared at fairy knowe the little sense which nature had given him was effectually drowned in ale and brandy and instead of asking for lord evandale he demanded to speak with lady margaret whose name was more familiar to his ear being refused admittance to her presence he staggered away with the letter undelivered perversely faithful to mortons instructions in the only point in which it would have been well had he departed from them a few minutes after he was gone edith entered the apartment lord evandale and she met with mutual embarrassment which lady margaret who only knew in general that their union had been postponed by her granddaughters indisposition set down to the bashfulness of a bride and bridegroom and to place them at ease began to talk to lady emily on indifferent topics at this moment edith with a countenance as pale as death muttered rather than whispered to lord evandale a request to speak with him he offered his arm and supported her into the small anteroom which as we have noticed before opened from the parlour he placed her in a chair and taking one himself awaited the opening of the conversation  i am distressed my lord were the first words she was able to articulate and those with difficulty i scarce know what i would say nor how to speak it  if i have any share in occasioning your uneasiness said lord evandale mildly you will soon edith be released from it  you are determined then my lord she replied to run this desperate course with desperate men in spite of your own better reason in spite of your friends entreaties in spite of the almost inevitable ruin which yawns before you  forgive me miss bellenden even your solicitude on my account must not detain me when my honour calls my horses stand ready saddled my servants are prepared the signal for rising will be given so soon as i reach kilsyth if it is my fate that calls me i will not shun meeting it it will be something he said taking her hand to die deserving your compassion since i cannot gain your love  oh my lord remain said edith in a tone which went to his heart time may explain the strange circumstance which has shocked me so much my agitated nerves may recover their tranquillity oh do not rush on death and ruin remain to be our prop and stay and hope everything from time  it is too late edith answered lord evandale and i were most ungenerous could i practise on the warmth and kindliness of your feelings towards me i know you cannot love me nervous distress so strong as to conjure up the appearance of the dead or absent indicates a predilection too powerful to give way to friendship and gratitude alone but were it otherwise the die is now cast  as he spoke thus cuddie burst into the room terror and haste in his countenance oh my lord hide yoursell they hae beset the outlets o the house was his first exclamation  they who said lord evandale  a party of horse headed by basil olifant answered cuddie  oh hide yourself my lord echoed edith in an agony of terror  i will not by heaven answered lord evandale what right has the villain to assail me or stop my passage i will make my way were he backed by a regiment tell halliday and hunter to get out the horses and now farewell edith he clasped her in his arms and kissed her tenderly then bursting from his sister who with lady margaret endeavoured to detain him rushed out and mounted his horse  all was in confusion the women shrieked and hurried in consternation to the front windows of the house from which they could see a small party of horsemen of whom two only seemed soldiers they were on the open ground before cuddies cottage at the bottom of the descent from the house and showed caution in approaching it as if uncertain of the strength within  he may escape he may escape said edith oh would he but take the byroad  but lord evandale determined to face a danger which his high spirit undervalued commanded his servants to follow him and rode composedly down the avenue old gudyill ran to arm himself and cuddie snatched down a gun which was kept for the protection of the house and although on foot followed lord evandale it was in vain his wife who had hurried up on the alarm hung by his skirts threatening him with death by the sword or halter for meddling with other folks matters  hand your peace ye b said cuddie and thats braid scotch or i wotna what is is it ither folks matters to see lord evandale murdered before my face and down the avenue he marched but considering on the way that he composed the whole infantry as john gudyill had not appeared he took his vantage ground behind the hedge hammered his flint cocked his piece and taking a long aim at laird basil as he was called stood prompt for action  as soon as lord evandale appeared olifants party spread themselves a little as if preparing to enclose him their leader stood fast supported by three men two of whom were dragoons the third in dress and appearance a countryman all well armed but the strong figure stern features and resolved manner of the third attendant made him seem the most formidable of the party and whoever had before seen him could have no difficulty in recognising balfour of burley  follow me said lord evandale to his servants and if we are forcibly opposed do as i do he advanced at a hand gallop towards olifant and was in the act of demanding why he had thus beset the road when olifant called out shoot the traitor and the whole four fired their carabines upon the unfortunate nobleman he reeled in the saddle advanced his hand to the holster and drew a pistol but unable to discharge it fell from his horse mortally wounded his servants had presented their carabines hunter fired at random but halliday who was an intrepid fellow took aim at inglis and shot him dead on the spot at the same instant a shot from behind the hedge still more effectually avenged lord evandale for the ball took place in the very midst of basil olifants forehead and stretched him lifeless on the ground his followers astonished at the execution done in so short a time seemed rather disposed to stand inactive when burley whose blood was up with the contest exclaimed down with the midianites and attacked halliday sword in hand at this instant the clatter of horses hoofs was heard and a party of horse rapidly advancing on the road from glasgow appeared on the fatal field they were foreign dragoons led by the dutch commandant wittenbold accompanied by morton and a civil magistrate  a hasty call to surrender in the name of god and king william was obeyed by all except burley who turned his horse and attempted to escape several soldiers pursued him by command of their officer but being well mounted only the two headmost seemed likely to gain on him he turned deliberately twice and discharging first one of his pistols and then the other rid himself of the one pursuer by mortally wounding him and of the other by shooting his horse and then continued his flight to bothwell bridge where for his misfortune he found the gates shut and guarded turning from thence he made for a place where the river seemed passable and plunged into the stream the bullets from the pistols and carabines of his pursuers whizzing around him two balls took effect when he was past the middle of the stream and he felt himself dangerously wounded he reined his horse round in the midst of the river and returned towards the bank he had left waving his hand as if with the purpose of intimating that he surrendered the troopers ceased firing at him accordingly and awaited his return two of them riding a little way into the river to seize and disarm him but it presently appeared that his purpose was revenge not safety as he approached the two soldiers he collected his remaining strength and discharged a blow on the head of one which tumbled him from his horse the other dragoon a strong muscular man had in the mean while laid hands on him burley in requital grasped his throat as a dying tiger seizes his prey and both losing the saddle in the struggle came headlong into the river and were swept down the stream their course might be traced by the blood which bubbled up to the surface they were twice seen to rise the dutchman striving to swim and burley clinging to him in a manner that showed his desire that both should perish their corpses were taken out about a quarter of a mile down the river as balfours grasp could not have been unclenched without cutting off his hands both were thrown into a hasty grave still marked by a rude stone and a ruder epitaph       gentle reader i did request of mine honest friend peter proudfoot      travelling merchant known to many of this land for his faithful and      just dealings as well in muslins and cambrics as in small wares to      procure me on his next peregrinations to that vicinage a copy of      the epitaphion alluded to and according to his report which i see      no ground to discredit it runneth thus                 here lyes ane saint to prelates surly                being john balfour sometime of burley                who stirred up to vengeance take                for solemn league and covnants sake                upon the magusmoor in fife                did tak james sharpe the apostates life                by dutchmans hands was hacked and shot                then drowned in clyde near this saam spot  while the soul of this stern enthusiast flitted to its account that of the brave and generous lord evandale was also released morton had flung himself from his horse upon perceiving his situation to render his dying friend all the aid in his power he knew him for he pressed his hand and being unable to speak intimated by signs his wish to be conveyed to the house this was done with all the care possible and he was soon surrounded by his lamenting friends but the clamorous grief of lady emily was far exceeded in intensity by the silent agony of edith  unconscious even of the presence of morton she hung over the dying man nor was she aware that fate who was removing one faithful lover had restored another as if from the grave until lord evandale taking their hands in his pressed them both affectionately united them together raised his face as if to pray for a blessing on them and sunk back and expired in the next moment                                    conclusion  i had determined to waive the task of a concluding chapter leaving to the readers imagination the arrangements which must necessarily take place after lord evandales death but as i was aware that precedents are wanting for a practice which might be found convenient both to readers and compilers i confess myself to have been in a considerable dilemma when fortunately i was honoured with an invitation to drink tea with miss martha buskbody a young lady who has carried on the profession of mantuamaking at ganderscleugh and in the neighbourhood with great success for about forty years knowing her taste for narratives of this description i requested her to look over the loose sheets the morning before i waited on her and enlighten me by the experience which she must have acquired in reading through the whole stock of three circulating libraries in ganderscleugh and the two next markettowns when with a palpitating heart i appeared before her in the evening i found her much disposed to be complimentary  i have not been more affected said she wiping the glasses of her spectacles by any novel excepting the tale of jemmy and jenny jessamy which is indeed pathos itself but your plan of omitting a formal conclusion will never do you may be as harrowing to our nerves as you will in the course of your story but unless you had the genius of the author of julia de roubignd never let the end be altogether overclouded let us see a glimpse of sunshine in the last chapter it is quite essential  nothing would be more easy for me madam than to comply with your injunctions for in truth the parties in whom you have had the goodness to be interested did live long and happily and begot sons and daughters  it is unnecessary sir she said with a slight nod of reprimand to be particular concerning their matrimonial comforts but what is your objection to let us have in a general way a glimpse of their future felicity  really madam said i you must be aware that every volume of a narrative turns less and less interesting as the author draws to a conclusionjust like your tea which though excellent hyson is necessarily weaker and more insipid in the last cup now as i think the one is by no means improved by the luscious lump of halfdissolved sugar usually found at the bottom of it so i am of opinion that a history growing already vapid is but dully crutched up by a detail of circumstances which every reader must have anticipated even though the author exhaust on them every flowery epithet in the language  this will not do mr pattieson continued the lady you have as i may say basted up your first story very hastily and clumsily at the conclusion and in my trade i would have cuffed the youngest apprentice who had put such a horrid and bungled spot of work out of her hand and if you do not redeem this gross error by telling us all about the marriage of morton and edith and what became of the other personages of the story from lady margaret down to goosegibbie i apprise you that you will not be held to have accomplished your task handsomely  well madam i replied my materials are so ample that i think i can satisfy your curiosity unless it descend to very minute circumstances indeed  first then said she for that is most essentialdid lady margaret get back her fortune and her castle  she did madam and in the easiest way imaginable as heir namely to her worthy cousin basil olifant who died without a will and thus by his death not only restored but even augmented the fortune of her whom during his life he had pursued with the most inveterate malice john gudyill reinstated in his dignity was more important than ever and cuddie with rapturous delight entered upon the cultivation of the mains of tillietudlem and the occupation of his original cottage but with the shrewd caution of his character he was never heard to boast of having fired the lucky shot which repossessed his lady and himself in their original habitations after a he said to jenny who was his only confidant auld basil olifant was my leddys cousin and a grand gentleman and though he was acting again the law as i understand for he neer showed ony warrant or required lord evandale to surrender and though i mind killing him nae mair than i wad do a muircock yet it s just as weel to keep a calm sough about it he not only did so but ingeniously enough countenanced a report that old gudyill had done the deedwhich was worth many a gill of brandy to him from the old butler who far different in disposition from cuddie was much more inclined to exaggerate than suppress his exploits of manhood the blind widow was provided for in the most comfortable manner as well as the little guide to the linn and  but what is all this to the marriagethe marriage of the principal personages interrupted miss buskbody impatiently tapping her snuffbox  the marriage of morton and miss bellenden was delayed for several months as both went into deep mourning on account of lord evandales death they were then wedded  i hope not without lady margarets consent sir said my fair critic i love books which teach a proper deference in young persons to their parents in a novel the young people may fall in love without their countenance because it is essential to the necessary intricacy of the story but they must always have the benefit of their consent at last even old delville received cecilia though the daughter of a man of low birth  and even so madam replied i lady margaret was prevailed on to countenance morton although the old covenanter his father stuck sorely with her for some time edith was her only hope and she wished to see her happy morton or melville morton as he was more generally called stood so high in the reputation of the world and was in every other respect such an eligible match that she put her prejudice aside and consoled herself with the recollection that marriage went by destiny as was observed to her she said by his most sacred majesty charles the second of happy memory when she showed him the portrait of her grandfather fergus third earl of torwood the handsomest man of his time and that of countess jane his second lady who had a humpback and only one eye this was his majestys observation she said on one remarkable morning when he deigned to take his disjune  nay said miss buskbody again interrupting me if she brought such authority to countenance her acquiescing in a misalliance there was no more to be saidand what became of old mrs whats her name the housekeeper  mrs wilson madam answered i she was perhaps the happiest of the party for once a year and not oftener mr and mrs melville morton dined in the great wainscotted chamber in solemn state the hangings being all displayed the carpet laid down and the huge brass candlestick set on the table stuck round with leaves of laurel the preparing the room for this yearly festival employed her mind for six months before it came about and the putting matters to rights occupied old alison the other six so that a single day of rejoicing found her business for all the year round  and niel blane said miss buskbody  lived to a good old age drank ale and brandy with guests of all persuasions played whig or jacobite tunes as best pleased his customers and died worth as much money as married jenny to a cock laird i hope maam you have no other inquiries to make for really  goosegibbie sir said my persevering friendgoosegibbie whose ministry was fraught with such consequences to the personages of the narrative  consider my dear miss buskbody i beg pardon for the familiaritybut pray consider even the memory of the renowned scheherazade that empress of taletellers could not preserve every circumstance i am not quite positive as to the fate of goosegibbie but am inclined to think him the same with one gilbert dudden alias calfgibbie who was whipped through hamilton for stealing poultry  miss buskbody now placed her left foot on the fender crossed her right leg over her knee lay back on the chair and looked towards the ceiling when i observed her assume this contemplative mood i concluded she was studying some farther crossexamination and therefore took my hat and wished her a hasty goodnight ere the demon of criticism had supplied her with any more queries in like manner gentle reader returning you my thanks for the patience which has conducted you thus far i take the liberty to withdraw myself from you for the present                                    peroration  it was mine earnest wish most courteous reader that the tales of my landlord should have reached thine hands in one entire succession of tomes or volumes but as i sent some few more manuscript quires containing the continuation of these most pleasing narratives i was apprised somewhat unceremoniously by my publisher that he did not approve of novels as he injuriously called these real histories extending beyond four volumes and if i did not agree to the first four being published separately he threatened to decline the article oh ignorance as if the vernacular article of our mother english were capable of declension whereupon somewhat moved by his remonstrances and more by heavy charges for print and paper which he stated to have been already incurred i have resolved that these four volumes shall be the heralds or avantcouriers of the tales which are yet in my possession nothing doubting that they will be eagerly devoured and the remainder anxiously demanded by the unanimous voice of a discerning public i rest esteemed reader thine as thou shalt construe me  jedediah cleishbotham gandercleugh nov 15 1816   illustration interior of
