11616835	almayers folly  a story of an eastern river by joseph conrad      qui de nous na eu sa terre promise son jour dextase et sa fin en    exilamiel  london t fisher unwin ltd adelphi terrace  first edition    1895  second impression 1907  third  1914  fourth  1915  to the memory of t b     chapter i   kaspar  makan  the wellknown shrill voice startled almayer from his dream of splendid future into the unpleasant realities of the present hour  an unpleasant voice too  he had heard it for many years and with every year he liked it less  no matter there would be an end to all this soon  he shuffled uneasily but took no further notice of the call  leaning with both his elbows on the balustrade of the verandah he went on looking fixedly at the great river that flowedindifferent and hurriedbefore his eyes  he liked to look at it about the time of sunset perhaps because at that time the sinking sun would spread a glowing gold tinge on the waters of the pantai and almayers thoughts were often busy with gold gold he had failed to secure gold the others had secureddishonestly of courseor gold he meant to secure yet through his own honest exertions for himself and nina  he absorbed himself in his dream of wealth and power away from this coast where he had dwelt for so many years forgetting the bitterness of toil and strife in the vision of a great and splendid reward  they would live in europe he and his daughter  they would be rich and respected  nobody would think of her mixed blood in the presence of her great beauty and of his immense wealth  witnessing her triumphs he would grow young again he would forget the twentyfive years of heartbreaking struggle on this coast where he felt like a prisoner  all this was nearly within his reach  let only dain return  and return soon he mustin his own interest for his own share  he was now more than a week late  perhaps he would return tonight  such were almayers thoughts as standing on the verandah of his new but already decaying housethat last failure of his lifehe looked on the broad river  there was no tinge of gold on it this evening for it had been swollen by the rains and rolled an angry and muddy flood under his inattentive eyes carrying small driftwood and big dead logs and whole uprooted trees with branches and foliage amongst which the water swirled and roared angrily  one of those drifting trees grounded on the shelving shore just by the house and almayer neglecting his dream watched it with languid interest  the tree swung slowly round amid the hiss and foam of the water and soon getting free of the obstruction began to move down stream again rolling slowly over raising upwards a long denuded branch like a hand lifted in mute appeal to heaven against the rivers brutal and unnecessary violence  almayers interest in the fate of that tree increased rapidly  he leaned over to see if it would clear the low point below  it did then he drew back thinking that now its course was free down to the sea and he envied the lot of that inanimate thing now growing small and indistinct in the deepening darkness  as he lost sight of it altogether he began to wonder how far out to sea it would drift would the current carry it north or south  south probably till it drifted in sight of celebes as far as macassar perhaps  macassar  almayers quickened fancy distanced the tree on its imaginary voyage but his memory lagging behind some twenty years or more in point of time saw a young and slim almayer clad all in white and modestlooking landing from the dutch mailboat on the dusty jetty of macassar coming to woo fortune in the godowns of old hudig  it was an important epoch in his life the beginning of a new existence for him his father a subordinate official employed in the botanical gardens of buitenzorg was no doubt delighted to place his son in such a firm  the young man himself too was nothing loth to leave the poisonous shores of java and the meagre comforts of the parental bungalow where the father grumbled all day at the stupidity of native gardeners and the mother from the depths of her long easychair bewailed the lost glories of amsterdam where she had been brought up and of her position as the daughter of a cigar dealer there  almayer had left his home with a light heart and a lighter pocket speaking english well and strong in arithmetic ready to conquer the world never doubting that he would  after those twenty years standing in the close and stifling heat of a bornean evening he recalled with pleasurable regret the image of hudigs lofty and cool warehouses with their long and straight avenues of gin cases and bales of manchester goods the big door swinging noiselessly the dim light of the place so delightful after the glare of the streets the little railedoff spaces amongst piles of merchandise where the chinese clerks neat cool and sadeyed wrote rapidly and in silence amidst the din of the working gangs rolling casks or shifting cases to a muttered song ending with a desperate yell  at the upper end facing the great door there was a larger space railed off well lighted there the noise was subdued by distance and above it rose the soft and continuous clink of silver guilders which other discreet chinamen were counting and piling up under the supervision of mr vinck the cashier the genius presiding in the placethe right hand of the master  in that clear space almayer worked at his table not far from a little green painted door by which always stood a malay in a red sash and turban and whose hand holding a small string dangling from above moved up and down with the regularity of a machine  the string worked a punkah on the other side of the green door where the socalled private office was and where old hudigthe mastersat enthroned holding noisy receptions  sometimes the little door would fly open disclosing to the outer world through the bluish haze of tobacco smoke a long table loaded with bottles of various shapes and tall waterpitchers rattan easychairs occupied by noisy men in sprawling attitudes while the master would put his head through and holding by the handle would grunt confidentially to vinck perhaps send an order thundering down the warehouse or spy a hesitating stranger and greet him with a friendly roar welgome gapitan ver you gome vrom  bali eh  got bonies  i vant bonies  vant all you got ha ha ha  gome in  then the stranger was dragged in in a tempest of yells the door was shut and the usual noises refilled the place the song of the workmen the rumble of barrels the scratch of rapid pens while above all rose the musical chink of broad silver pieces streaming ceaselessly through the yellow fingers of the attentive chinamen  at that time macassar was teeming with life and commerce  it was the point in the islands where tended all those bold spirits who fitting out schooners on the australian coast invaded the malay archipelago in search of money and adventure  bold reckless keen in business not disinclined for a brush with the pirates that were to be found on many a coast as yet making money fast they used to have a general rendezvous in the bay for purposes of trade and dissipation  the dutch merchants called those men english pedlars some of them were undoubtedly gentlemen for whom that kind of life had a charm most were seamen the acknowledged king of them all was tom lingard he whom the malays honest or dishonest quiet fishermen or desperate cutthroats recognised as the rajahlautthe king of the sea  almayer had heard of him before he had been three days in macassar had heard the stories of his smart business transactions his loves and also of his desperate fights with the sulu pirates together with the romantic tale of some childa girlfound in a piratical prau by the victorious lingard when after a long contest he boarded the craft driving the crew overboard  this girl it was generally known lingard had adopted was having her educated in some convent in java and spoke of her as my daughter  he had sworn a mighty oath to marry her to a white man before he went home and to leave her all his money  and captain lingard has lots of money would say mr vinck solemnly with his head on one side lots of money more than hudig  and after a pausejust to let his hearers recover from their astonishment at such an incredible assertionhe would add in an explanatory whisper you know he has discovered a river  that was it  he had discovered a river  that was the fact placing old lingard so much above the common crowd of seagoing adventurers who traded with hudig in the daytime and drank champagne gambled sang noisy songs and made love to halfcaste girls under the broad verandah of the sunda hotel at night  into that river whose entrances himself only knew lingard used to take his assorted cargo of manchester goods brass gongs rifles and gunpowder  his brig flash which he commanded himself would on those occasions disappear quietly during the night from the roadstead while his companions were sleeping off the effects of the midnight carouse lingard seeing them drunk under the table before going on board himself unaffected by any amount of liquor  many tried to follow him and find that land of plenty for guttapercha and rattans pearl shells and birds nests wax and gumdammar but the little flash could outsail every craft in those seas  a few of them came to grief on hidden sandbanks and coral reefs losing their all and barely escaping with life from the cruel grip of this sunny and smiling sea others got discouraged and for many years the green and peacefullooking islands guarding the entrances to the promised land kept their secret with all the merciless serenity of tropical nature  and so lingard came and went on his secret or open expeditions becoming a hero in almayers eyes by the boldness and enormous profits of his ventures seeming to almayer a very great man indeed as he saw him marching up the warehouse grunting a how are you to vinck or greeting hudig the master with a boisterous hallo old pirate  alive yet as a preliminary to transacting business behind the little green door  often of an evening in the silence of the then deserted warehouse almayer putting away his papers before driving home with mr vinck in whose household he lived would pause listening to the noise of a hot discussion in the private office would hear the deep and monotonous growl of the master and the roaredout interruptions of lingardtwo mastiffs fighting over a marrowy bone  but to almayers ears it sounded like a quarrel of titansa battle of the gods  after a year or so lingard having been brought often in contact with almayer in the course of business took a sudden and to the onlookers a rather inexplicable fancy to the young man  he sang his praises late at night over a convivial glass to his cronies in the sunda hotel and one fine morning electrified vinck by declaring that he must have that young fellow for a supercargo  kind of captains clerk  do all my quilldriving for me  hudig consented  almayer with youths natural craving for change was nothing loth and packing his few belongings started in the flash on one of those long cruises when the old seaman was wont to visit almost every island in the archipelago  months slipped by and lingards friendship seemed to increase  often pacing the deck with almayer when the faint night breeze heavy with aromatic exhalations of the islands shoved the brig gently along under the peaceful and sparkling sky did the old seaman open his heart to his entranced listener  he spoke of his past life of escaped dangers of big profits in his trade of new combinations that were in the future to bring profits bigger still  often he had mentioned his daughter the girl found in the pirate prau speaking of her with a strange assumption of fatherly tenderness  she must be a big girl now he used to say its nigh unto four years since i have seen her  damme almayer if i dont think we will run into sourabaya this trip  and after such a declaration he always dived into his cabin muttering to himself something must be donemust be done  more than once he would astonish almayer by walking up to him rapidly clearing his throat with a powerful hem as if he was going to say something and then turning abruptly away to lean over the bulwarks in silence and watch motionless for hours the gleam and sparkle of the phosphorescent sea along the ships side  it was the night before arriving in sourabaya when one of those attempts at confidential communication succeeded  after clearing his throat he spoke  he spoke to some purpose  he wanted almayer to marry his adopted daughter  and dont you kick because youre white he shouted suddenly not giving the surprised young man the time to say a word  none of that with me  nobody will see the colour of your wifes skin  the dollars are too thick for that i tell you  and mind you they will be thicker yet before i die  there will be millions kaspar millions i say  and all for herand for you if you do what you are told  startled by the unexpected proposal almayer hesitated and remained silent for a minute  he was gifted with a strong and active imagination and in that short space of time he saw as in a flash of dazzling light great piles of shining guilders and realised all the possibilities of an opulent existence  the consideration the indolent ease of lifefor which he felt himself so well fittedhis ships his warehouses his merchandise old lingard would not live for ever and crowning all in the far future gleamed like a fairy palace the big mansion in amsterdam that earthly paradise of his dreams where made king amongst men by old lingards money he would pass the evening of his days in inexpressible splendour  as to the other side of the picturethe companionship for life of a malay girl that legacy of a boatful of piratesthere was only within him a confused consciousness of shame that he a white manstill a convent education of four yearsand then she may mercifully die  he was always lucky and money is powerful  go through it  why not  he had a vague idea of shutting her up somewhere anywhere out of his gorgeous future  easy enough to dispose of a malay woman a slave after all to his eastern mind convent or no convent ceremony or no ceremony  he lifted his head and confronted the anxious yet irate seaman  iof courseanything you wish captain lingard  call me father my boy  she does said the mollified old adventurer damme though if i didnt think you were going to refuse  mind you kaspar i always get my way so it would have been no use  but you are no fool  he remembered well that timethe look the accent the words the effect they produced on him his very surroundings  he remembered the narrow slanting deck of the brig the silent sleeping coast the smooth black surface of the sea with a great bar of gold laid on it by the rising moon  he remembered it all and he remembered his feelings of mad exultation at the thought of that fortune thrown into his hands  he was no fool then and he was no fool now  circumstances had been against him the fortune was gone but hope remained  he shivered in the night air and suddenly became aware of the intense darkness which on the suns departure had closed in upon the river blotting out the outlines of the opposite shore  only the fire of dry branches lit outside the stockade of the rajahs compound called fitfully into view the ragged trunks of the surrounding trees putting a stain of glowing red halfway across the river where the drifting logs were hurrying towards the sea through the impenetrable gloom  he had a hazy recollection of having been called some time during the evening by his wife  to his dinner probably  but a man busy contemplating the wreckage of his past in the dawn of new hopes cannot be hungry whenever his rice is ready  time he went home though it was getting late  he stepped cautiously on the loose planks towards the ladder  a lizard disturbed by the noise emitted a plaintive note and scurried through the long grass growing on the bank  almayer descended the ladder carefully now thoroughly recalled to the realities of life by the care necessary to prevent a fall on the uneven ground where the stones decaying planks and halfsawn beams were piled up in inextricable confusion  as he turned towards the house where he livedmy old house he called ithis ear detected the splash of paddles away in the darkness of the river  he stood still in the path attentive and surprised at anybody being on the river at this late hour during such a heavy freshet  now he could hear the paddles distinctly and even a rapidly exchanged word in low tones the heavy breathing of men fighting with the current and hugging the bank on which he stood  quite close too but it was too dark to distinguish anything under the overhanging bushes  arabs no doubt muttered almayer to himself peering into the solid blackness  what are they up to now  some of abdullas business curse him  the boat was very close now  oh ya  man hailed almayer  the sound of voices ceased but the paddles worked as furiously as before  then the bush in front of almayer shook and the sharp sound of the paddles falling into the canoe rang in the quiet night  they were holding on to the bush now but almayer could hardly make out an indistinct dark shape of a mans head and shoulders above the bank  you abdulla said almayer doubtfully  a grave voice answered  tuan almayer is speaking to a friend  there is no arab here  almayers heart gave a great leap  dain he exclaimed  at last at last  i have been waiting for you every day and every night  i had nearly given you up  nothing could have stopped me from coming back here said the other almost violently  not even death he whispered to himself  this is a friends talk and is very good said almayer heartily  but you are too far here  drop down to the jetty and let your men cook their rice in my campong while we talk in the house  there was no answer to that invitation  what is it asked almayer uneasily  there is nothing wrong with the brig i hope  the brig is where no orang blanda can lay his hands on her said dain with a gloomy tone in his voice which almayer in his elation failed to notice  right he said  but where are all your men  there are only two with you  listen tuan almayer said dain  tomorrows sun shall see me in your house and then we will talk  now i must go to the rajah  to the rajah  why  what do you want with lakamba  tuan tomorrow we talk like friends  i must see lakamba tonight  dain you are not going to abandon me now when all is ready asked almayer in a pleading voice  have i not returned  but i must see lakamba first for your good and mine  the shadowy head disappeared abruptly  the bush released from the grasp of the bowman sprung back with a swish scattering a shower of muddy water over almayer as he bent forward trying to see  in a little while the canoe shot into the streak of light that streamed on the river from the big fire on the opposite shore disclosing the outline of two men bending to their work and a third figure in the stern flourishing the steering paddle his head covered with an enormous round hat like a fantastically exaggerated mushroom  almayer watched the canoe till it passed out of the line of light shortly after the murmur of many voices reached him across the water  he could see the torches being snatched out of the burning pile and rendering visible for a moment the gate in the stockade round which they crowded  then they went in apparently  the torches disappeared and the scattered fire sent out only a dim and fitful glare  almayer stepped homewards with long strides and mind uneasy  surely dain was not thinking of playing him false  it was absurd  dain and lakamba were both too much interested in the success of his scheme  trusting to malays was poor work but then even malays have some sense and understand their own interest  all would be wellmust be well  at this point in his meditation he found himself at the foot of the steps leading to the verandah of his home  from the low point of land where he stood he could see both branches of the river  the main branch of the pantai was lost in complete darkness for the fire at the rajahs had gone out altogether but up the sambir reach his eye could follow the long line of malay houses crowding the bank with here and there a dim light twinkling through bamboo walls or a smoky torch burning on the platforms built out over the river  further away where the island ended in a low cliff rose a dark mass of buildings towering above the malay structures founded solidly on a firm ground with plenty of space starred by many lights burning strong and white with a suggestion of paraffin and lamp glasses stood the house and the godowns of abdulla bin selim the great trader of sambir  to almayer the sight was very distasteful and he shook his fist towards the buildings that in their evident prosperity looked to him cold and insolent and contemptuous of his own fallen fortunes  he mounted the steps of his house slowly  in the middle of the verandah there was a round table  on it a paraffin lamp without a globe shed a hard glare on the three inner sides  the fourth side was open and faced the river  between the rough supports of the highpitched roof hung torn rattan screens  there was no ceiling and the harsh brilliance of the lamp was toned above into a soft half light that lost itself in the obscurity amongst the rafters  the front wall was cut in two by the doorway of a central passage closed by a red curtain  the womens room opened into that passage which led to the back courtyard and to the cooking shed  in one of the side walls there was a doorway  half obliterated wordsoffice lingard and cowere still legible on the dusty door which looked as if it had not been opened for a very long time  close to the other side wall stood a bent wood rockingchair and by the table and about the verandah four wooden armchairs straggled forlornly as if ashamed of their shabby surroundings  a heap of common mats lay in one corner with an old hammock slung diagonally above  in the other corner his head wrapped in a piece of red calico huddled into a shapeless heap slept a malay one of almayers domestic slavesmy own people he used to call them  a numerous and representative assembly of moths were holding high revels round the lamp to the spirited music of swarming mosquitoes  under the palmleaf thatch lizards raced on the beams calling softly  a monkey chained to one of the verandah supportsretired for the night under the eavespeered and grinned at almayer as it swung to one of the bamboo roof sticks and caused a shower of dust and bits of dried leaves to settle on the shabby table  the floor was uneven with many withered plants and dried earth scattered about  a general air of squalid neglect pervaded the place  great red stains on the floor and walls testified to frequent and indiscriminate betelnut chewing  the light breeze from the river swayed gently the tattered blinds sending from the woods opposite a faint and sickly perfume as of decaying flowers  under almayers heavy tread the boards of the verandah creaked loudly the sleeper in the corner moved uneasily muttering indistinct words there was a slight rustle behind the curtained doorway and a soft voice asked in malay is it you father  yes nina  i am hungry  is everybody asleep in this house  almayer spoke jovially and dropped with a contented sigh into the armchair nearest to the table  nina almayer came through the curtained doorway followed by an old malay woman who busied herself in setting upon the table a plateful of rice and fish a jar of water and a bottle half full of genever  after carefully placing before her master a cracked glass tumbler and a tin spoon she went away noiselessly  nina stood by the table one hand lightly resting on its edge the other hanging listlessly by her side  her face turned towards the outer darkness through which her dreamy eyes seemed to see some entrancing picture wore a look of impatient expectancy  she was tall for a half caste with the correct profile of the father modified and strengthened by the squareness of the lower part of the face inherited from her maternal ancestorsthe sulu pirates  her firm mouth with the lips slightly parted and disclosing a gleam of white teeth put a vague suggestion of ferocity into the impatient expression of her features  and yet her dark and perfect eyes had all the tender softness of expression common to malay women but with a gleam of superior intelligence they looked gravely wide open and steady as if facing something invisible to all other eyes while she stood there all in white straight flexible graceful unconscious of herself her low but broad forehead crowned with a shining mass of long black hair that fell in heavy tresses over her shoulders and made her pale olive complexion look paler still by the contrast of its coalblack hue  almayer attacked his rice greedily but after a few mouthfuls he paused spoon in hand and looked at his daughter curiously  did you hear a boat pass about half an hour ago nina he asked  the girl gave him a quick glance and moving away from the light stood with her back to the table  no she said slowly  there was a boat  at last  dain himself and he went on to lakamba  i know it for he told me so  i spoke to him but he would not come here tonight  will come tomorrow he said  he swallowed another spoonful then said  i am almost happy tonight nina  i can see the end of a long road and it leads us away from this miserable swamp  we shall soon get away from here i and you my dear little girl and then  he rose from the table and stood looking fixedly before him as if contemplating some enchanting vision  and then he went on we shall be happy you and i  live rich and respected far from here and forget this life and all this struggle and all this misery  he approached his daughter and passed his hand caressingly over her hair  it is bad to have to trust a malay he said but i must own that this dain is a perfect gentlemana perfect gentleman he repeated  did you ask him to come here father inquired nina not looking at him  well of course  we shall start on the day after tomorrow said almayer joyously  we must not lose any time  are you glad little girl  she was nearly as tall as himself but he liked to recall the time when she was little and they were all in all to each other  i am glad she said very low  of course said almayer vivaciously you cannot imagine what is before you  i myself have not been to europe but i have heard my mother talk so often that i seem to know all about it  we shall live aa glorious life  you shall see  again he stood silent by his daughters side looking at that enchanting vision  after a while he shook his clenched hand towards the sleeping settlement  ah my friend abdulla he cried we shall see who will have the best of it after all these years  he looked up the river and remarked calmly  another thunderstorm  well  no thunder will keep me awake tonight i know  goodnight little girl he whispered tenderly kissing her cheek  you do not seem to be very happy tonight but tomorrow you will show a brighter face  eh  nina had listened to her father with her face unmoved with her halfclosed eyes still gazing into the night now made more intense by a heavy thundercloud that had crept down from the hills blotting out the stars merging sky forest and river into one mass of almost palpable blackness  the faint breeze had died out but the distant rumble of thunder and pale flashes of lightning gave warning of the approaching storm  with a sigh the girl turned towards the table  almayer was in his hammock now already half asleep  take the lamp nina he muttered drowsily  this place is full of mosquitoes  go to sleep daughter  but nina put the lamp out and turned back again towards the balustrade of the verandah standing with her arm round the wooden support and looking eagerly towards the pantai reach  and motionless there in the oppressive calm of the tropical night she could see at each flash of lightning the forest lining both banks up the river bending before the furious blast of the coming tempest the upper reach of the river whipped into white foam by the wind and the black clouds torn into fantastic shapes trailing low over the swaying trees  round her all was as yet stillness and peace but she could hear afar off the roar of the wind the hiss of heavy rain the wash of the waves on the tormented river  it came nearer and nearer with loud thunderclaps and long flashes of vivid lightning followed by short periods of appalling blackness  when the storm reached the low point dividing the river the house shook in the wind and the rain pattered loudly on the palmleaf roof the thunder spoke in one prolonged roll and the incessant lightning disclosed a turmoil of leaping waters driving logs and the big trees bending before a brutal and merciless force  undisturbed by the nightly event of the rainy monsoon the father slept quietly oblivious alike of his hopes his misfortunes his friends and his enemies and the daughter stood motionless at each flash of lightning eagerly scanning the broad river with a steady and anxious gaze     chapter ii   when in compliance with lingards abrupt demand almayer consented to wed the malay girl no one knew that on the day when the interesting young convert had lost all her natural relations and found a white father she had been fighting desperately like the rest of them on board the prau and was only prevented from leaping overboard like the few other survivors by a severe wound in the leg  there on the foredeck of the prau old lingard found her under a heap of dead and dying pirates and had her carried on the poop of the flash before the malay craft was set on fire and sent adrift  she was conscious and in the great peace and stillness of the tropical evening succeeding the turmoil of the battle she watched all she held dear on earth after her own savage manner drift away into the gloom in a great roar of flame and smoke  she lay there unheeding the careful hands attending to her wound silent and absorbed in gazing at the funeral pile of those brave men she had so much admired and so well helped in their contest with the redoubtable rajahlaut        the light night breeze fanned the brig gently to the southward and the great blaze of light got smaller and smaller till it twinkled only on the horizon like a setting star  it set the heavy canopy of smoke reflected the glare of hidden flames for a short time and then disappeared also  she realised that with this vanishing gleam her old life departed too thenceforth there was slavery in the far countries amongst strangers in unknown and perhaps terrible surroundings  being fourteen years old she realised her position and came to that conclusion the only one possible to a malay girl soon ripened under a tropical sun and not unaware of her personal charms of which she heard many a young brave warrior of her fathers crew express an appreciative admiration  there was in her the dread of the unknown otherwise she accepted her position calmly after the manner of her people and even considered it quite natural for was she not a daughter of warriors conquered in battle and did she not belong rightfully to the victorious rajah  even the evident kindness of the terrible old man must spring she thought from admiration for his captive and the flattered vanity eased for her the pangs of sorrow after such an awful calamity  perhaps had she known of the high walls the quiet gardens and the silent nuns of the samarang convent where her destiny was leading her she would have sought death in her dread and hate of such a restraint  but in imagination she pictured to herself the usual life of a malay girlthe usual succession of heavy work and fierce love of intrigues gold ornaments of domestic drudgery and of that great but occult influence which is one of the few rights of halfsavage womankind  but her destiny in the rough hands of the old seadog acting under unreasoning impulses of the heart took a strange and to her a terrible shape  she bore it allthe restraint and the teaching and the new faithwith calm submission concealing her hate and contempt for all that new life  she learned the language very easily yet understood but little of the new faith the good sisters taught her assimilating quickly only the superstitious elements of the religion  she called lingard father gently and caressingly at each of his short and noisy visits under the clear impression that he was a great and dangerous power it was good to propitiate  was he not now her master  and during those long four years she nourished a hope of finding favour in his eyes and ultimately becoming his wife counsellor and guide  those dreams of the future were dispelled by the rajah lauts fiat which made almayers fortune as that young man fondly hoped  and dressed in the hateful finery of europe the centre of an interested circle of batavian society the young convert stood before the altar with an unknown and sulkylooking white man  for almayer was uneasy a little disgusted and greatly inclined to run away  a judicious fear of the adopted fatherinlaw and a just regard for his own material welfare prevented him from making a scandal yet while swearing fidelity he was concocting plans for getting rid of the pretty malay girl in a more or less distant future  she however had retained enough of conventual teaching to understand well that according to white mens laws she was going to be almayers companion and not his slave and promised to herself to act accordingly  so when the flash freighted with materials for building a new house left the harbour of batavia taking away the young couple into the unknown borneo she did not carry on her deck so much love and happiness as old lingard was wont to boast of before his casual friends in the verandahs of various hotels  the old seaman himself was perfectly happy now he had done his duty by the girl  you know i made her an orphan he often concluded solemnly when talking about his own affairs to a scratch audience of shore loafersas it was his habit to do  and the approbative shouts of his halfintoxicated auditors filled his simple soul with delight and pride  i carry everything right through was another of his sayings and in pursuance of that principle he pushed the building of house and godowns on the pantai river with feverish haste the house for the young couple the godowns for the big trade almayer was going to develop while he lingard would be able to give himself up to some mysterious work which was only spoken of in hints but was understood to relate to gold and diamonds in the interior of the island almayer was impatient too  had he known what was before him he might not have been so eager and full of hope as he stood watching the last canoe of the lingard expedition disappear in the bend up the river  when turning round he beheld the pretty little house the big godowns built neatly by an army of chinese carpenters the new jetty round which were clustered the trading canoes he felt a sudden elation in the thought that the world was his  but the world had to be conquered first and its conquest was not so easy as he thought  he was very soon made to understand that he was not wanted in that corner of it where old lingard and his own weak will placed him in the midst of unscrupulous intrigues and of a fierce trade competition  the arabs had found out the river had established a trading post in sambir and where they traded they would be masters and suffer no rival  lingard returned unsuccessful from his first expedition and departed again spending all the profits of the legitimate trade on his mysterious journeys  almayer struggled with the difficulties of his position friendless and unaided save for the protection given to him for lingards sake by the old rajah the predecessor of lakamba  lakamba himself then living as a private individual on a rice clearing seven miles down the river exercised all his influence towards the help of the white mans enemies plotting against the old rajah and almayer with a certainty of combination pointing clearly to a profound knowledge of their most secret affairs outwardly friendly his portly form was often to be seen on almayers verandah his green turban and goldembroidered jacket shone in the front rank of the decorous throng of malays coming to greet lingard on his returns from the interior his salaams were of the lowest and his hand shakings of the heartiest when welcoming the old trader  but his small eyes took in the signs of the times and he departed from those interviews with a satisfied and furtive smile to hold long consultations with his friend and ally syed abdulla the chief of the arab trading post a man of great wealth and of great influence in the islands  it was currently believed at that time in the settlement that lakambas visits to almayers house were not limited to those official interviews often on moonlight nights the belated fishermen of sambira saw a small canoe shooting out from the narrow creek at the back of the white mans house and the solitary occupant paddle cautiously down the river in the deep shadows of the bank and those events duly reported were discussed round the evening fires far into the night with the cynicism of expression common to aristocratic malays and with a malicious pleasure in the domestic misfortunes of the orang blandothe hated dutchman almayer went on struggling desperately but with a feebleness of purpose depriving him of all chance of success against men so unscrupulous and resolute as his rivals the arabs  the trade fell away from the large godowns and the godowns themselves rotted piecemeal  the old mans banker hudig of macassar failed and with this went the whole available capital  the profits of past years had been swallowed up in lingards exploring craze  lingard was in the interiorperhaps deadat all events giving no sign of life  almayer stood alone in the midst of those adverse circumstances deriving only a little comfort from the companionship of his little daughter born two years after the marriage and at the time some six years old  his wife had soon commenced to treat him with a savage contempt expressed by sulky silence only occasionally varied by a flood of savage invective  he felt she hated him and saw her jealous eyes watching himself and the child with almost an expression of hate  she was jealous of the little girls evident preference for the father and almayer felt he was not safe with that woman in the house while she was burning the furniture and tearing down the pretty curtains in her unreasoning hate of those signs of civilisation almayer cowed by these outbursts of savage nature meditated in silence on the best way of getting rid of her  he thought of everything even planned murder in an undecided and feeble sort of way but dared do nothingexpecting every day the return of lingard with news of some immense good fortune  he returned indeed but aged ill a ghost of his former self with the fire of fever burning in his sunken eyes almost the only survivor of the numerous expedition  but he was successful at last  untold riches were in his grasp he wanted more moneyonly a little more torealise a dream of fabulous fortune  and hudig had failed  almayer scraped all he could together but the old man wanted more  if almayer could not get it he would go to singaporeto europe even but before all to singapore and he would take the little nina with him  the child must be brought up decently  he had good friends in singapore who would take care of her and have her taught properly  all would be well and that girl upon whom the old seaman seemed to have transferred all his former affection for the mother would be the richest woman in the eastin the world even  so old lingard shouted pacing the verandah with his heavy quarter deck step gesticulating with a smouldering cheroot ragged dishevelled enthusiastic and almayer sitting huddled up on a pile of mats thought with dread of the separation with the only human being he lovedwith greater dread still perhaps of the scene with his wife the savage tigress deprived of her young  she will poison me thought the poor wretch well aware of that easy and final manner of solving the social political or family problems in malay life  to his great surprise she took the news very quietly giving only him and lingard a furtive glance and saying not a word  this however did not prevent her the next day from jumping into the river and swimming after the boat in which lingard was carrying away the nurse with the screaming child  almayer had to give chase with his whaleboat and drag her in by the hair in the midst of cries and curses enough to make heaven fall  yet after two days spent in wailing she returned to her former mode of life chewing betelnut and sitting all day amongst her women in stupefied idleness  she aged very rapidly after that and only roused herself from her apathy to acknowledge by a scathing remark or an insulting exclamation the accidental presence of her husband  he had built for her a riverside hut in the compound where she dwelt in perfect seclusion lakambas visits had ceased when by a convenient decree of providence and the help of a little scientific manipulation the old ruler of sambir departed this life  lakamba reigned in his stead now having been well served by his arab friends with the dutch authorities  syed abdulla was the great man and trader of the pantai  almayer lay ruined and helpless under the closemeshed net of their intrigues owing his life only to his supposed knowledge of lingards valuable secret  lingard had disappeared  he wrote once from singapore saying the child was well and under the care of a mrs vinck and that he himself was going to europe to raise money for the great enterprise  he was coming back soon  there would be no difficulties he wrote people would rush in with their money  evidently they did not for there was only one letter more from him saying he was ill had found no relation living but little else besides  then came a complete silence  europe had swallowed up the rajah laut apparently and almayer looked vainly westward for a ray of light out of the gloom of his shattered hopes  years passed and the rare letters from mrs vinck later on from the girl herself were the only thing to be looked to to make life bearable amongst the triumphant savagery of the river  almayer lived now alone having even ceased to visit his debtors who would not pay sure of lakambas protection  the faithful sumatrese ali cooked his rice and made his coffee for he dared not trust any one else and least of all his wife  he killed time wandering sadly in the overgrown paths round the house visiting the ruined godowns where a few brass guns covered with verdigris and only a few broken cases of mouldering manchester goods reminded him of the good early times when all this was full of life and merchandise and he overlooked a busy scene on the river bank his little daughter by his side  now the upcountry canoes glided past the little rotten wharf of lingard and co to paddle up the pantai branch and cluster round the new jetty belonging to abdulla  not that they loved abdulla but they dared not trade with the man whose star had set  had they done so they knew there was no mercy to be expected from arab or rajah no rice to be got on credit in the times of scarcity from either and almayer could not help them having at times hardly enough for himself  almayer in his isolation and despair often envied his near neighbour the chinaman jim eng whom he could see stretched on a pile of cool mats a wooden pillow under his head an opium pipe in his nerveless fingers  he did not seek however consolation in opiumperhaps it was too expensiveperhaps his white mans pride saved him from that degradation but most likely it was the thought of his little daughter in the faroff straits settlements  he heard from her oftener since abdulla bought a steamer which ran now between singapore and the pantai settlement every three months or so almayer felt himself nearer his daughter  he longed to see her and planned a voyage to singapore but put off his departure from year to year always expecting some favourable turn of fortune  he did not want to meet her with empty hands and with no words of hope on his lips  he could not take her back into that savage life to which he was condemned himself  he was also a little afraid of her  what would she think of him  he reckoned the years  a grown woman  a civilised woman young and hopeful while he felt old and hopeless and very much like those savages round him  he asked himself what was going to be her future  he could not answer that question yet and he dared not face her  and yet he longed after her  he hesitated for years  his hesitation was put an end to by ninas unexpected appearance in sambir  she arrived in the steamer under the captains care  almayer beheld her with surprise not unmixed with wonder  during those ten years the child had changed into a woman blackhaired oliveskinned tall and beautiful with great sad eyes where the startled expression common to malay womankind was modified by a thoughtful tinge inherited from her european ancestry  almayer thought with dismay of the meeting of his wife and daughter of what this grave girl in european clothes would think of her betelnut chewing mother squatting in a dark hut disorderly half naked and sulky  he also feared an outbreak of temper on the part of that pest of a woman he had hitherto managed to keep tolerably quiet thereby saving the remnants of his dilapidated furniture  and he stood there before the closed door of the hut in the blazing sunshine listening to the murmur of voices wondering what went on inside wherefrom all the servantmaids had been expelled at the beginning of the interview and now stood clustered by the palings with halfcovered faces in a chatter of curious speculation  he forgot himself there trying to catch a stray word through the bamboo walls till the captain of the steamer who had walked up with the girl fearing a sunstroke took him under the arm and led him into the shade of his own verandah where ninas trunk stood already having been landed by the steamers men  as soon as captain ford had his glass before him and his cheroot lighted almayer asked for the explanation of his daughters unexpected arrival  ford said little beyond generalising in vague but violent terms upon the foolishness of women in general and of mrs vinck in particular  you know kaspar said he in conclusion to the excited almayer it is deucedly awkward to have a halfcaste girl in the house  theres such a lot of fools about  there was that young fellow from the bank who used to ride to the vinck bungalow early and late  that old woman thought it was for that emma of hers  when she found out what he wanted exactly there was a row i can tell you  she would not have ninanot an hour longerin the house  fact is i heard of this affair and took the girl to my wife  my wife is a pretty good womanas women goand upon my word we would have kept the girl for you only she would not stay  now then  dont flare up kaspar  sit still  what can you do  it is better so  let her stay with you  she was never happy over there  those two vinck girls are no better than dressedup monkeys  they slighted her  you cant make her white  its no use you swearing at me  you cant  she is a good girl for all that but she would not tell my wife anything  if you want to know ask her yourself but if i was you i would leave her alone  you are welcome to her passage money old fellow if you are short now  and the skipper throwing away his cigar walked off to wake them up on board as he expressed it  almayer vainly expected to hear of the cause of his daughters return from his daughters lips  not that day not on any other day did she ever allude to her singapore life  he did not care to ask awed by the calm impassiveness of her face by those solemn eyes looking past him on the great still forests sleeping in majestic repose to the murmur of the broad river  he accepted the situation happy in the gentle and protecting affection the girl showed him fitfully enough for she had as she called it her bad days when she used to visit her mother and remain long hours in the riverside hut coming out as inscrutable as ever but with a contemptuous look and a short word ready to answer any of his speeches  he got used even to that and on those days kept quiet although greatly alarmed by his wifes influence upon the girl  otherwise nina adapted herself wonderfully to the circumstances of a halfsavage and miserable life  she accepted without question or apparent disgust the neglect the decay the poverty of the household the absence of furniture and the preponderance of rice diet on the family table  she lived with almayer in the little house now sadly decaying built originally by lingard for the young couple  the malays eagerly discussed her arrival  there were at the beginning crowded levees of malay women with their children seeking eagerly after ubat for all the ills of the flesh from the young mem putih  in the cool of the evening grave arabs in long white shirts and yellow sleeveless jackets walked slowly on the dusty path by the riverside towards almayers gate and made solemn calls upon that unbeliever under shallow pretences of business only to get a glimpse of the young girl in a highly decorous manner  even lakamba came out of his stockade in a great pomp of war canoes and red umbrellas and landed on the rotten little jetty of lingard and co  he came he said to buy a couple of brass guns as a present to his friend the chief of sambir dyaks and while almayer suspicious but polite busied himself in unearthing the old popguns in the godowns the rajah sat on an armchair in the verandah surrounded by his respectful retinue waiting in vain for ninas appearance  she was in one of her bad days and remained in her mothers hut watching with her the ceremonious proceedings on the verandah  the rajah departed baffled but courteous and soon almayer began to reap the benefit of improved relations with the ruler in the shape of the recovery of some debts paid to him with many apologies and many a low salaam by debtors till then considered hopelessly insolvent under these improving circumstances almayer brightened up a little  all was not lost perhaps  those arabs and malays saw at last that he was a man of some ability he thought  and he began after his manner to plan great things to dream of great fortunes for himself and nina  especially for nina  under these vivifying impulses he asked captain ford to write to his friends in england making inquiries after lingard  was he alive or dead  if dead had he left any papers documents any indications or hints as to his great enterprise  meantime he had found amongst the rubbish in one of the empty rooms a notebook belonging to the old adventurer  he studied the crabbed handwriting of its pages and often grew meditative over it  other things also woke him up from his apathy the stir made in the whole of the island by the establishment of the british borneo company affected even the sluggish flow of the pantai life  great changes were expected annexation was talked of the arabs grew civil  almayer began building his new house for the use of the future engineers agents or settlers of the new company  he spent every available guilder on it with a confiding heart  one thing only disturbed his happiness his wife came out of her seclusion importing her green jacket scant sarongs shrill voice and witchlike appearance into his quiet life in the small bungalow  and his daughter seemed to accept that savage intrusion into their daily existence with wonderful equanimity  he did not like it but dared say nothing     chapter iii   the deliberations conducted in london have a farreaching importance and so the decision issued from the fogveiled offices of the borneo company darkened for almayer the brilliant sunshine of the tropics and added another drop of bitterness to the cup of his disenchantments  the claim to that part of the east coast was abandoned leaving the pantai river under the nominal power of holland  in sambir there was joy and excitement  the slaves were hurried out of sight into the forest and jungle and the flags were run up to tall poles in the rajahs compound in expectation of a visit from dutch manofwar boats  the frigate remained anchored outside the mouth of the river and the boats came up in tow of the steam launch threading their way cautiously amongst a crowd of canoes filled with gaily dressed malays  the officer in command listened gravely to the loyal speeches of lakamba returned the salaams of abdulla and assured those gentlemen in choice malay of the great rajahsdown in bataviafriendship and goodwill towards the ruler and inhabitants of this model state of sambir  almayer from his verandah watched across the river the festive proceedings heard the report of brass guns saluting the new flag presented to lakamba and the deep murmur of the crowd of spectators surging round the stockade  the smoke of the firing rose in white clouds on the green background of the forests and he could not help comparing his own fleeting hopes to the rapidly disappearing vapour  he was by no means patriotically elated by the event yet he had to force himself into a gracious behaviour when the official reception being over the naval officers of the commission crossed the river to pay a visit to the solitary white man of whom they had heard no doubt wishing also to catch a glimpse of his daughter  in that they were disappointed nina refusing to show herself but they seemed easily consoled by the gin and cheroots set before them by the hospitable almayer and sprawling comfortably on the lame armchairs under the shade of the verandah while the blazing sunshine outside seemed to set the great river simmering in the heat they filled the little bungalow with the unusual sounds of european languages with noise and laughter produced by naval witticisms at the expense of the fat lakamba whom they had been complimenting so much that very morning  the younger men in an access of good fellowship made their host talk and almayer excited by the sight of european faces by the sound of european voices opened his heart before the sympathising strangers unaware of the amusement the recital of his many misfortunes caused to those future admirals  they drank his health wished him many big diamonds and a mountain of gold expressed even an envy of the high destinies awaiting him yet  encouraged by so much friendliness the grey headed and foolish dreamer invited his guests to visit his new house they went there through the long grass in a straggling procession while their boats were got ready for the return down the river in the cool of the evening  and in the great empty rooms where the tepid wind entering through the sashless windows whirled gently the dried leaves and the dust of many days of neglect almayer in his white jacket and flowered sarong surrounded by a circle of glittering uniforms stamped his foot to show the solidity of the neatlyfitting floors and expatiated upon the beauties and convenience of the building  they listened and assented amazed by the wonderful simplicity and the foolish hopefulness of the man till almayer carried away by his excitement disclosed his regret at the nonarrival of the english who knew how to develop a rich country as he expressed it  there was a general laugh amongst the dutch officers at that unsophisticated statement and a move was made towards the boats but when almayer stepping cautiously on the rotten boards of the lingard jetty tried to approach the chief of the commission with some timid hints anent the protection required by the dutch subject against the wily arabs that salt water diplomat told him significantly that the arabs were better subjects than hollanders who dealt illegally in gunpowder with the malays  the innocent almayer recognised there at once the oily tongue of abdulla and the solemn persuasiveness of lakamba but ere he had time to frame an indignant protest the steam launch and the string of boats moved rapidly down the river leaving him on the jetty standing openmouthed in his surprise and anger  there are thirty miles of river from sambir to the gemlike islands of the estuary where the frigate was awaiting the return of the boats  the moon rose long before the boats had traversed half that distance and the black forest sleeping peacefully under her cold rays woke up that night to the ringing laughter in the small flotilla provoked by some reminiscence of almayers lamentable narrative  saltwater jests at the poor mans expense were passed from boat to boat the nonappearance of his daughter was commented upon with severe displeasure and the halffinished house built for the reception of englishmen received on that joyous night the name of almayers folly by the unanimous vote of the lighthearted seamen  for many weeks after this visit life in sambir resumed its even and uneventful flow  each days sun shooting its morning rays above the tree tops lit up the usual scene of daily activity  nina walking on the path that formed the only street in the settlement saw the accustomed sight of men lolling on the shady side of the houses on the high platforms of women busily engaged in husking the daily rice of naked brown children racing along the shady and narrow paths leading to the clearings  jim eng strolling before his house greeted her with a friendly nod before climbing up indoors to seek his beloved opium pipe  the elder children clustered round her daring from long acquaintance pulling the skirts of her white robe with their dark fingers and showing their brilliant teeth in expectation of a shower of glass beads  she greeted them with a quiet smile but always had a few friendly words for a siamese girl a slave owned by bulangi whose numerous wives were said to be of a violent temper  wellfounded rumour said also that the domestic squabbles of that industrious cultivator ended generally in a combined assault of all his wives upon the siamese slave  the girl herself never complainedperhaps from dictates of prudence but more likely through the strange resigned apathy of halfsavage womankind  from early morning she was to be seen on the paths amongst the housesby the riverside or on the jetties the tray of pastry it was her mission to sell skilfully balanced on her head  during the great heat of the day she usually sought refuge in almayers campong often finding shelter in a shady corner of the verandah where she squatted with her tray before her when invited by nina  for mem putih she had always a smile but the presence of mrs almayer the very sound of her shrill voice was the signal for a hurried departure  to this girl nina often spoke the other inhabitants of sambir seldom or never heard the sound of her voice  they got used to the silent figure moving in their midst calm and whiterobed a being from another world and incomprehensible to them  yet ninas life for all her outward composure for all the seeming detachment from the things and people surrounding her was far from quiet in consequence of mrs almayer being much too active for the happiness and even safety of the household  she had resumed some intercourse with lakamba not personally it is true for the dignity of that potentate kept him inside his stockade but through the agency of that potentates prime minister harbour master financial adviser and general factotum  that gentlemanof sulu originwas certainly endowed with statesmanlike qualities although he was totally devoid of personal charms  in truth he was perfectly repulsive possessing only one eye and a pockmarked face with nose and lips horribly disfigured by the smallpox  this unengaging individual often strolled into almayers garden in unofficial costume composed of a piece of pink calico round his waist  there at the back of the house squatting on his heels on scattered embers in close proximity to the great iron boiler where the family daily rice was being cooked by the women under mrs almayers superintendence did that astute negotiator carry on long conversations in sulu language with almayers wife  what the subject of their discourses was might have been guessed from the subsequent domestic scenes by almayers hearthstone  of late almayer had taken to excursions up the river  in a small canoe with two paddlers and the faithful ali for a steersman he would disappear for a few days at a time  all his movements were no doubt closely watched by lakamba and abdulla for the man once in the confidence of rajah laut was supposed to be in possession of valuable secrets  the coast population of borneo believes implicitly in diamonds of fabulous value in gold mines of enormous richness in the interior  and all those imaginings are heightened by the difficulty of penetrating far inland especially on the northeast coast where the malays and the river tribes of dyaks or headhunters are eternally quarrelling  it is true enough that some gold reaches the coast in the hands of those dyaks when during short periods of truce in the desultory warfare they visit the coast settlements of malays  and so the wildest exaggerations are built up and added to on the slight basis of that fact  almayer in his quality of white manas lingard before himhad somewhat better relations with the upriver tribes  yet even his excursions were not without danger and his returns were eagerly looked for by the impatient lakamba  but every time the rajah was disappointed  vain were the conferences by the ricepot of his factotum babalatchi with the white mans wife  the white man himself was impenetrableimpenetrable to persuasion coaxing abuse to soft words and shrill revilings to desperate beseechings or murderous threats for mrs almayer in her extreme desire to persuade her husband into an alliance with lakamba played upon the whole gamut of passion  with her soiled robe wound tightly under the armpits across her lean bosom her scant grayish hair tumbled in disorder over her projecting cheekbones in suppliant attitude she depicted with shrill volubility the advantages of close union with a man so good and so fair dealing  why dont you go to the rajah she screamed  why do you go back to those dyaks in the great forest  they should be killed  you cannot kill them you cannot but our rajahs men are brave  you tell the rajah where the old white mans treasure is  our rajah is good  he is our very grandfather datu besar  he will kill those wretched dyaks and you shall have half the treasure  oh kaspar tell where the treasure is tell me  tell me out of the old mans surat where you read so often at night  on those occasions almayer sat with rounded shoulders bending to the blast of this domestic tempest accentuating only each pause in the torrent of his wifes eloquence by an angry growl there is no treasure go away woman  exasperated by the sight of his patiently bent back she would at last walk round so as to face him across the table and clasping her robe with one hand she stretched the other lean arm and claw like hand to emphasise in a passion of anger and contempt the rapid rush of scathing remarks and bitter cursings heaped on the head of the man unworthy to associate with brave malay chiefs  it ended generally by almayer rising slowly his long pipe in hand his face set into a look of inward pain and walking away in silence  he descended the steps and plunged into the long grass on his way to the solitude of his new house dragging his feet in a state of physical collapse from disgust and fear before that fury  she followed to the head of the steps and sent the shafts of indiscriminate abuse after the retreating form  and each of those scenes was concluded by a piercing shriek reaching him far away you know kaspar i am your wife your own christian wife after your own blanda law  for she knew that this was the bitterest thing of all the greatest regret of that mans life  all these scenes nina witnessed unmoved  she might have been deaf dumb without any feeling as far as any expression of opinion went  yet oft when her father had sought the refuge of the great dusty rooms of almayers folly and her mother exhausted by rhetorical efforts squatted wearily on her heels with her back against the leg of the table nina would approach her curiously guarding her skirts from betel juice besprinkling the floor and gaze down upon her as one might look into the quiescent crater of a volcano after a destructive eruption  mrs almayers thoughts after these scenes were usually turned into a channel of childhood reminiscences and she gave them utterance in a kind of monotonous recitativeslightly disconnected but generally describing the glories of the sultan of sulu his great splendour his power his great prowess the fear which benumbed the hearts of white men at the sight of his swift piratical praus  and these muttered statements of her grandfathers might were mixed up with bits of later recollections where the great fight with the white devils brig and the convent life in samarang occupied the principal place  at that point she usually dropped the thread of her narrative and pulling out the little brass cross always suspended round her neck she contemplated it with superstitious awe  that superstitious feeling connected with some vague talismanic properties of the little bit of metal and the still more hazy but terrible notion of some bad djinns and horrible torments invented as she thought for her especial punishment by the good mother superior in case of the loss of the above charm were mrs almayers only theological luggage for the stormy road of life  mrs almayer had at least something tangible to cling to but nina brought up under the protestant wing of the proper mrs vinck had not even a little piece of brass to remind her of past teaching  and listening to the recital of those savage glories those barbarous fights and savage feasting to the story of deeds valorous albeit somewhat bloodthirsty where men of her mothers race shone far above the orang blanda she felt herself irresistibly fascinated and saw with vague surprise the narrow mantle of civilised morality in which goodmeaning people had wrapped her young soul fall away and leave her shivering and helpless as if on the edge of some deep and unknown abyss  strangest of all this abyss did not frighten her when she was under the influence of the witchlike being she called her mother  she seemed to have forgotten in civilised surroundings her life before the time when lingard had so to speak kidnapped her from brow since then she had had christian teaching social education and a good glimpse of civilised life  unfortunately her teachers did not understand her nature and the education ended in a scene of humiliation in an outburst of contempt from white people for her mixed blood  she had tasted the whole bitterness of it and remembered distinctly that the virtuous mrs vincks indignation was not so much directed against the young man from the bank as against the innocent cause of that young mans infatuation  and there was also no doubt in her mind that the principal cause of mrs vincks indignation was the thought that such a thing should happen in a white nest where her snowwhite doves the two misses vinck had just returned from europe to find shelter under the maternal wing and there await the coming of irreproachable men of their destiny not even the thought of the money so painfully scraped together by almayer and so punctually sent for ninas expenses could dissuade mrs vinck from her virtuous resolve  nina was sent away and in truth the girl herself wanted to go although a little frightened by the impending change  and now she had lived on the river for three years with a savage mother and a father walking about amongst pitfalls with his head in the clouds weak irresolute and unhappy  she had lived a life devoid of all the decencies of civilisation in miserable domestic conditions she had breathed in the atmosphere of sordid plottings for gain of the no less disgusting intrigues and crimes for lust or money and those things together with the domestic quarrels were the only events of her three years existence  she did not die from despair and disgust the first month as she expected and almost hoped for  on the contrary at the end of half a year it had seemed to her that she had known no other life  her young mind having been unskilfully permitted to glance at better things and then thrown back again into the hopeless quagmire of barbarism full of strong and uncontrolled passions had lost the power to discriminate it seemed to nina that there was no change and no difference  whether they traded in brick godowns or on the muddy river bank whether they reached after much or little whether they made love under the shadows of the great trees or in the shadow of the cathedral on the singapore promenade whether they plotted for their own ends under the protection of laws and according to the rules of christian conduct or whether they sought the gratification of their desires with the savage cunning and the unrestrained fierceness of natures as innocent of culture as their own immense and gloomy forests nina saw only the same manifestations of love and hate and of sordid greed chasing the uncertain dollar in all its multifarious and vanishing shapes  to her resolute nature however after all these years the savage and uncompromising sincerity of purpose shown by her malay kinsmen seemed at last preferable to the sleek hypocrisy to the polite disguises to the virtuous pretences of such white people as she had had the misfortune to come in contact with  after all it was her life it was going to be her life and so thinking she fell more and more under the influence of her mother  seeking in her ignorance a better side to that life she listened with avidity to the old womans tales of the departed glories of the rajahs from whose race she had sprung and she became gradually more indifferent more contemptuous of the white side of her descent represented by a feeble and traditionless father  almayers difficulties were by no means diminished by the girls presence in sambir  the stir caused by her arrival had died out it is true and lakamba had not renewed his visits but about a year after the departure of the manofwar boats the nephew of abdulla syed reshid returned from his pilgrimage to mecca rejoicing in a green jacket and the proud title of hadji  there was a great letting off of rockets on board the steamer which brought him in and a great beating of drums all night in abdullas compound while the feast of welcome was prolonged far into the small hours of the morning  reshid was the favourite nephew and heir of abdulla and that loving uncle meeting almayer one day by the riverside stopped politely to exchange civilities and to ask solemnly for an interview  almayer suspected some attempt at a swindle or at any rate something unpleasant but of course consented with a great show of rejoicing  accordingly the next evening after sunset abdulla came accompanied by several other greybeards and by his nephew  that young manof a very rakish and dissipated appearanceaffected the greatest indifference as to the whole of the proceedings  when the torchbearers had grouped themselves below the steps and the visitors had seated themselves on various lame chairs reshid stood apart in the shadow examining his aristocratically small hands with great attention  almayer surprised by the great solemnity of his visitors perched himself on the corner of the table with a characteristic want of dignity quickly noted by the arabs with grave disapproval  but abdulla spoke now looking straight past almayer at the red curtain hanging in the doorway where a slight tremor disclosed the presence of women on the other side  he began by neatly complimenting almayer upon the long years they had dwelt together in cordial neighbourhood and called upon allah to give him many more years to gladden the eyes of his friends by his welcome presence  he made a polite allusion to the great consideration shown him almayer by the dutch commissie and drew thence the flattering inference of almayers great importance amongst his own people  heabdullawas also important amongst all the arabs and his nephew reshid would be heir of that social position and of great riches  now reshid was a hadji  he was possessor of several malay women went on abdulla but it was time he had a favourite wife the first of the four allowed by the prophet  and speaking with wellbred politeness he explained further to the dumbfounded almayer that if he would consent to the alliance of his offspring with that true believer and virtuous man reshid she would be the mistress of all the splendours of reshids house and first wife of the first arab in the islands when heabdullawas called to the joys of paradise by allah the allmerciful  you know tuan he said in conclusion the other women would be her slaves and reshids house is great  from bombay he has brought great divans and costly carpets and european furniture  there is also a great lookingglass in a frame shining like gold  what could a girl want more  and while almayer looked upon him in silent dismay abdulla spoke in a more confidential tone waving his attendants away and finished his speech by pointing out the material advantages of such an alliance and offering to settle upon almayer three thousand dollars as a sign of his sincere friendship and the price of the girl  poor almayer was nearly having a fit  burning with the desire of taking abdulla by the throat he had but to think of his helpless position in the midst of lawless men to comprehend the necessity of diplomatic conciliation  he mastered his impulses and spoke politely and coldly saying the girl was young and as the apple of his eye  tuan reshid a faithful and a hadji would not want an infidel woman in his harem and seeing abdulla smile sceptically at that last objection he remained silent not trusting himself to speak more not daring to refuse point blank nor yet to say anything compromising  abdulla understood the meaning of that silence and rose to take leave with a grave salaam  he wished his friend almayer a thousand years and moved down the steps helped dutifully by reshid  the torchbearers shook their torches scattering a shower of sparks into the river and the cortege moved off leaving almayer agitated but greatly relieved by their departure  he dropped into a chair and watched the glimmer of the lights amongst the tree trunks till they disappeared and complete silence succeeded the tramp of feet and the murmur of voices  he did not move till the curtain rustled and nina came out on the verandah and sat in the rockingchair where she used to spend many hours every day  she gave a slight rocking motion to her seat leaning back with halfclosed eyes her long hair shading her face from the smoky light of the lamp on the table  almayer looked at her furtively but the face was as impassible as ever  she turned her head slightly towards her father and speaking to his great surprise in english asked  was that abdulla here  yes said almayerjust gone  and what did he want father  he wanted to buy you for reshid answered almayer brutally his anger getting the better of him and looking at the girl as if in expectation of some outbreak of feeling  but nina remained apparently unmoved gazing dreamily into the black night outside  be careful nina said almayer after a short silence and rising from his chair when you go paddling alone into the creeks in your canoe that reshid is a violent scoundrel and there is no saying what he may do  do you hear me  she was standing now ready to go in one hand grasping the curtain in the doorway  she turned round throwing her heavy tresses back by a sudden gesture  do you think he would dare she asked quickly and then turned again to go in adding in a lower tone he would not dare  arabs are all cowards  almayer looked after her astonished  he did not seek the repose of his hammock  he walked the floor absently sometimes stopping by the balustrade to think  the lamp went out  the first streak of dawn broke over the forest almayer shivered in the damp air  i give it up he muttered to himself lying down wearily  damn those women  well  if the girl did not look as if she wanted to be kidnapped  and he felt a nameless fear creep into his heart making him shiver again     chapter iv   that year towards the breaking up of the southwest monsoon disquieting rumours reached sambir  captain ford coming up to almayers house for an evenings chat brought late numbers of the straits times giving the news of acheen war and of the unsuccessful dutch expedition  the nakhodas of the rare trading praus ascending the river paid visits to lakamba discussing with that potentate the unsettled state of affairs and wagged their heads gravely over the recital of orang blanda exaction severity and general tyranny as exemplified in the total stoppage of gunpowder trade and the rigorous visiting of all suspicious craft trading in the straits of macassar  even the loyal soul of lakamba was stirred into a state of inward discontent by the withdrawal of his license for powder and by the abrupt confiscation of one hundred and fifty barrels of that commodity by the gunboat princess amelia when after a hazardous voyage it had almost reached the mouth of the river  the unpleasant news was given him by reshid who after the unsuccessful issue of his matrimonial projects had made a long voyage amongst the islands for trading purposes had bought the powder for his friend and was overhauled and deprived of it on his return when actually congratulating himself on his acuteness in avoiding detection  reshids wrath was principally directed against almayer whom he suspected of having notified the dutch authorities of the desultory warfare carried on by the arabs and the rajah with the upriver dyak tribes  to reshids great surprise the rajah received his complaints very coldly and showed no signs of vengeful disposition towards the white man  in truth lakamba knew very well that almayer was perfectly innocent of any meddling in state affairs and besides his attitude towards that much persecuted individual was wholly changed in consequence of a reconciliation effected between him and his old enemy by almayers newly found friend dain maroola  almayer had now a friend  shortly after reshids departure on his commercial journey nina drifting slowly with the tide in the canoe on her return home after one of her solitary excursions heard in one of the small creeks a splashing as if of heavy ropes dropping in the water and the prolonged song of malay seamen when some heavy pulling is to be done through the thick fringe of bushes hiding the mouth of the creek she saw the tall spars of some europeanrigged sailing vessel overtopping the summits of the nipa palms  a brig was being hauled out of the small creek into the main stream  the sun had set and during the short moments of twilight nina saw the brig aided by the evening breeze and the flowing tide head towards sambir under her set foresail  the girl turned her canoe out of the main river into one of the many narrow channels amongst the wooded islets and paddled vigorously over the black and sleepy backwaters towards sambir  her canoe brushed the waterpalms skirted the short spaces of muddy bank where sedate alligators looked at her with lazy unconcern and just as darkness was setting in shot out into the broad junction of the two main branches of the river where the brig was already at anchor with sails furled yards squared and decks seemingly untenanted by any human being  nina had to cross the river and pass pretty close to the brig in order to reach home on the low promontory between the two branches of the pantai  up both branches in the houses built on the banks and over the water the lights twinkled already reflected in the still waters below  the hum of voices the occasional cry of a child the rapid and abruptly interrupted roll of a wooden drum together with some distant hailing in the darkness by the returning fishermen reached her over the broad expanse of the river  she hesitated a little before crossing the sight of such an unusual object as an europeanrigged vessel causing her some uneasiness but the river in its wide expansion was dark enough to render a small canoe invisible she urged her small craft with swift strokes of her paddle kneeling in the bottom and bending forward to catch any suspicious sound while she steered towards the little jetty of lingard and co to which the strong light of the paraffin lamp shining on the whitewashed verandah of almayers bungalow served as a convenient guide  the jetty itself under the shadow of the bank overgrown by drooping bushes was hidden in darkness  before even she could see it she heard the hollow bumping of a large boat against its rotten posts and heard also the murmur of whispered conversation in that boat whose white paint and great dimensions faintly visible on nearer approach made her rightly guess that it belonged to the brig just anchored  stopping her course by a rapid motion of her paddle with another swift stroke she sent it whirling away from the wharf and steered for a little rivulet which gave access to the back courtyard of the house  she landed at the muddy head of the creek and made her way towards the house over the trodden grass of the courtyard  to the left from the cooking shed shone a red glare through the banana plantation she skirted and the noise of feminine laughter reached her from there in the silent evening  she rightly judged her mother was not near laughter and mrs almayer not being close neighbours  she must be in the house thought nina as she ran lightly up the inclined plane of shaky planks leading to the back door of the narrow passage dividing the house in two  outside the doorway in the black shadow stood the faithful ali  who is there asked nina  a great malay man has come answered ali in a tone of suppressed excitement  he is a rich man  there are six men with lances  real soldat you understand  and his dress is very brave  i have seen his dress  it shines  what jewels  dont go there mem nina  tuan said not but the old mem is gone  tuan will be angry  merciful allah what jewels that man has got  nina slipped past the outstretched hand of the slave into the dark passage where in the crimson glow of the hanging curtain close by its other end she could see a small dark form crouching near the wall  her mother was feasting her eyes and ears with what was taking place on the front verandah and nina approached to take her share in the rare pleasure of some novelty  she was met by her mothers extended arm and by a low murmured warning not to make a noise  have you seen them mother asked nina in a breathless whisper  mrs almayer turned her face towards the girl and her sunken eyes shone strangely in the red halflight of the passage  i saw him she said in an almost inaudible tone pressing her daughters hand with her bony fingers  a great rajah has come to sambira son of heaven muttered the old woman to herself  go away girl  the two women stood close to the curtain nina wishing to approach the rent in the stuff and her mother defending the position with angry obstinacy  on the other side there was a lull in the conversation but the breathing of several men the occasional light tinkling of some ornaments the clink of metal scabbards or of brass sirivessels passed from hand to hand was audible during the short pause  the women struggled silently when there was a shuffling noise and the shadow of almayers burly form fell on the curtain  the women ceased struggling and remained motionless  almayer had stood up to answer his guest turning his back to the doorway unaware of what was going on on the other side  he spoke in a tone of regretful irritation  you have come to the wrong house tuan maroola if you want to trade as you say  i was a trader once not now whatever you may have heard about me in macassar  and if you want anything you will not find it here i have nothing to give and want nothing myself  you should go to the rajah here you can see in the daytime his houses across the river there where those fires are burning on the shore  he will help you and trade with you  or better still go to the arabs over there he went on bitterly pointing with his hand towards the houses of sambir abdulla is the man you want  there is nothing he would not buy and there is nothing he would not sell believe me i know him well  he waited for an answer a short time then added  all that i have said is true and there is nothing more  nina held back by her mother heard a soft voice reply with a calm evenness of intonation peculiar to the better class malays  who would doubt a white tuans words  a man seeks his friends where his heart tells him  is this not true also  i have come although so late for i have something to say which you may be glad to hear  tomorrow i will go to the sultan a trader wants the friendship of great men  then i shall return here to speak serious words if tuan permits  i shall not go to the arabs their lies are very great  what are they  chelakka  almayers voice sounded a little more pleasantly in reply  well as you like  i can hear you tomorrow at any time if you have anything to say  bah  after you have seen the sultan lakamba you will not want to return here inchi dain  you will see  only mind i will have nothing to do with lakamba  you may tell him so  what is your business with me after all  tomorrow we talk tuan now i know you answered the malay  i speak english a little so we can talk and nobody will understand and then  he interrupted himself suddenly asking surprised whats that noise tuan  almayer had also heard the increasing noise of the scuffle recommenced on the womens side of the curtain  evidently ninas strong curiosity was on the point of overcoming mrs almayers exalted sense of social proprieties  hard breathing was distinctly audible and the curtain shook during the contest which was mainly physical although mrs almayers voice was heard in angry remonstrance with its usual want of strictly logical reasoning but with the wellknown richness of invective  you shameless woman  are you a slave shouted shrilly the irate matron  veil your face abandoned wretch  you white snake i will not let you  almayers face expressed annoyance and also doubt as to the advisability of interfering between mother and daughter  he glanced at his malay visitor who was waiting silently for the end of the uproar in an attitude of amused expectation and waving his hand contemptuously he murmured  it is nothing  some women  the malay nodded his head gravely and his face assumed an expression of serene indifference as etiquette demanded after such an explanation  the contest was ended behind the curtain and evidently the younger will had its way for the rapid shuffle and click of mrs almayers highheeled sandals died away in the distance  the tranquillised master of the house was going to resume the conversation when struck by an unexpected change in the expression of his guests countenance he turned his head and saw nina standing in the doorway  after mrs almayers retreat from the field of battle nina with a contemptuous exclamation its only a trader had lifted the conquered curtain and now stood in full light framed in the dark background on the passage her lips slightly parted her hair in disorder after the exertion the angry gleam not yet faded out of her glorious and sparkling eyes  she took in at a glance the group of whiteclad lancemen standing motionless in the shadow of the faroff end of the verandah and her gaze rested curiously on the chief of that imposing cortege  he stood almost facing her a little on one side and struck by the beauty of the unexpected apparition had bent low elevating his joint hands above his head in a sign of respect accorded by malays only to the great of this earth  the crude light of the lamp shone on the gold embroidery of his black silk jacket broke in a thousand sparkling rays on the jewelled hilt of his kriss protruding from under the many folds of the red sarong gathered into a sash round his waist and played on the precious stones of the many rings on his dark fingers  he straightened himself up quickly after the low bow putting his hand with a graceful ease on the hilt of his heavy short sword ornamented with brilliantly dyed fringes of horsehair  nina hesitating on the threshold saw an erect lithe figure of medium height with a breadth of shoulder suggesting great power  under the folds of a blue turban whose fringed ends hung gracefully over the left shoulder was a face full of determination and expressing a reckless goodhumour not devoid however of some dignity  the squareness of lower jaw the full red lips the mobile nostrils and the proud carriage of the head gave the impression of a being halfsavage untamed perhaps cruel and corrected the liquid softness of the almost feminine eye that general characteristic of the race  now the first surprise over nina saw those eyes fixed upon her with such an uncontrolled expression of admiration and desire that she felt a hitherto unknown feeling of shyness mixed with alarm and some delight enter and penetrate her whole being  confused by those unusual sensations she stopped in the doorway and instinctively drew the lower part of the curtain across her face leaving only half a rounded cheek a stray tress and one eye exposed wherewith to contemplate the gorgeous and bold being so unlike in appearance to the rare specimens of traders she had seen before on that same verandah  dain maroola dazzled by the unexpected vision forgot the confused almayer forgot his brig his escort staring in openmouthed admiration the object of his visit and all things else in his overpowering desire to prolong the contemplation of so much loveliness met so suddenly in such an unlikely placeas he thought  it is my daughter said almayer in an embarrassed manner  it is of no consequence  white women have their customs as you know tuan having travelled much as you say  however it is late we will finish our talk tomorrow  dain bent low trying to convey in a last glance towards the girl the bold expression of his overwhelming admiration  the next minute he was shaking almayers hand with grave courtesy his face wearing a look of stolid unconcern as to any feminine presence  his men filed off and he followed them quickly closely attended by a thickset savagelooking sumatrese he had introduced before as the commander of his brig  nina walked to the balustrade of the verandah and saw the sheen of moonlight on the steel spearheads and heard the rhythmic jingle of brass anklets as the men moved in single file towards the jetty  the boat shoved off after a little while looming large in the full light of the moon a black shapeless mass in the slight haze hanging over the water  nina fancied she could distinguish the graceful figure of the trader standing erect in the stern sheets but in a little while all the outlines got blurred confused and soon disappeared in the folds of white vapour shrouding the middle of the river  almayer had approached his daughter and leaning with both arms over the rail was looking moodily down on the heap of rubbish and broken bottles at the foot of the verandah  what was all that noise just now he growled peevishly without looking up  confound you and your mother  what did she want  what did you come out for  she did not want to let me come out said nina  she is angry  she says the man just gone is some rajah  i think she is right now  i believe all you women are crazy snarled almayer  whats that to you to her to anybody  the man wants to collect trepang and birds nests on the islands  he told me so that rajah of yours  he will come tomorrow  i want you both to keep away from the house and let me attend to my business in peace  dain maroola came the next day and had a long conversation with almayer this was the beginning of a close and friendly intercourse which at first was much remarked in sambir till the population got used to the frequent sight of many fires burning in almayers campong where maroolas men were warming themselves during the cold nights of the north east monsoon while their master had long conferences with the tuan putihas they styled almayer amongst themselves  great was the curiosity in sambir on the subject of the new trader  had he seen the sultan  what did the sultan say  had he given any presents  what would he sell  what would he buy  those were the questions broached eagerly by the inhabitants of bamboo houses built over the river  even in more substantial buildings in abdullas house in the residences of principal traders arab chinese and bugis the excitement ran high and lasted many days  with inborn suspicion they would not believe the simple account of himself the young trader was always ready to give  yet it had all the appearance of truth  he said he was a trader and sold rice  he did not want to buy guttapercha or beeswax because he intended to employ his numerous crew in collecting trepang on the coral reefs outside the river and also in seeking for birds nests on the mainland  those two articles he professed himself ready to buy if there were any to be obtained in that way  he said he was from bali and a brahmin which last statement he made good by refusing all food during his often repeated visits to lakambas and almayers houses  to lakamba he went generally at night and had long audiences  babalatchi who was always a third party at those meetings of potentate and trader knew how to resist all attempts on the part of the curious to ascertain the subject of so many long talks  when questioned with languid courtesy by the grave abdulla he sought refuge in a vacant stare of his one eye and in the affectation of extreme simplicity  i am only my masters slave murmured babalatchi in a hesitating manner  then as if making up his mind suddenly for a reckless confidence he would inform abdulla of some transaction in rice repeating the words a hundred big bags the sultan bought a hundred tuan in a tone of mysterious solemnity  abdulla firmly persuaded of the existence of some more important dealings received however the information with all the signs of respectful astonishment  and the two would separate the arab cursing inwardly the wily dog while babalatchi went on his way walking on the dusty path his body swaying his chin with its few grey hairs pushed forward resembling an inquisitive goat bent on some unlawful expedition  attentive eyes watched his movements  jimeng descrying babalatchi far away would shake off the stupor of an habitual opium smoker and tottering on to the middle of the road would await the approach of that important person ready with hospitable invitation  but babalatchis discretion was proof even against the combined assaults of good fellowship and of strong gin generously administered by the open hearted chinaman  jimeng owning himself beaten was left uninformed with the empty bottle and gazed sadly after the departing form of the statesman of sambir pursuing his devious and unsteady way which as usual led him to almayers compound  ever since a reconciliation had been effected by dain maroola between his white friend and the rajah the oneeyed diplomatist had again become a frequent guest in the dutchmans house  to almayers great disgust he was to be seen there at all times strolling about in an abstracted kind of way on the verandah skulking in the passages or else popping round unexpected corners always willing to engage mrs almayer in confidential conversation  he was very shy of the master himself as if suspicious that the pentup feelings of the white man towards his person might find vent in a sudden kick  but the cooking shed was his favourite place and he became an habitual guest there squatting for hours amongst the busy women with his chin resting on his knees his lean arms clasped round his legs and his one eye roving uneasilythe very picture of watchful ugliness  almayer wanted more than once to complain to lakamba of his prime ministers intrusion but dain dissuaded him  we cannot say a word here that he does not hear growled almayer  then come and talk on board the brig retorted dain with a quiet smile  it is good to let the man come here  lakamba thinks he knows much  perhaps the sultan thinks i want to run away  better let the one eyed crocodile sun himself in your campong tuan  and almayer assented unwillingly muttering vague threats of personal violence while he eyed malevolently the aged statesman sitting with quiet obstinacy by his domestic ricepot     chapter v   at last the excitement had died out in sambir  the inhabitants got used to the sight of comings and goings between almayers house and the vessel now moored to the opposite bank and speculation as to the feverish activity displayed by almayers boatmen in repairing old canoes ceased to interfere with the due discharge of domestic duties by the women of the settlement  even the baffled jimeng left off troubling his muddled brain with secrets of trade and relapsed by the aid of his opium pipe into a state of stupefied bliss letting babalatchi pursue his way past his house uninvited and seemingly unnoticed  so on that warm afternoon when the deserted river sparkled under the vertical sun the statesman of sambir could without any hindrance from friendly inquirers shove off his little canoe from under the bushes where it was usually hidden during his visits to almayers compound slowly and languidly babalatchi paddled crouching low in the boat making himself small under his as enormous sun hat to escape the scorching heat reflected from the water  he was not in a hurry his master lakamba was surely reposing at this time of the day  he would have ample time to cross over and greet him on his waking with important news  will he be displeased  will he strike his ebony wood staff angrily on the floor frightening him by the incoherent violence of his exclamations or will he squat down with a goodhumoured smile and rubbing his hands gently over his stomach with a familiar gesture expectorate copiously into the brass sirivessel giving vent to a low approbative murmur  such were babalatchis thoughts as he skilfully handled his paddle crossing the river on his way to the rajahs campong whose stockades showed from behind the dense foliage of the bank just opposite to almayers bungalow  indeed he had a report to make  something certain at last to confirm the daily tale of suspicions the daily hints of familiarity of stolen glances he had seen of short and burning words he had overheard exchanged between dain maroola and almayers daughter  lakamba had till then listened to it all calmly and with evident distrust now he was going to be convinced for babalatchi had the proof had it this very morning when fishing at break of day in the creek over which stood bulangis house  there from his skiff he saw ninas long canoe drift past the girl sitting in the stern bending over dain who was stretched in the bottom with his head resting on the girls knees  he saw it  he followed them but in a short time they took to the paddles and got away from under his observant eye  a few minutes afterwards he saw bulangis slavegirl paddling in a small dugout to the town with her cakes for sale  she also had seen them in the grey dawn  and babalatchi grinned confidentially to himself at the recollection of the slavegirls discomposed face of the hard look in her eyes of the tremble in her voice when answering his questions  that little taminah evidently admired dain maroola  that was good  and babalatchi laughed aloud at the notion then becoming suddenly serious he began by some strange association of ideas to speculate upon the price for which bulangi would possibly sell the girl  he shook his head sadly at the thought that bulangi was a hard man and had refused one hundred dollars for that same taminah only a few weeks ago then he became suddenly aware that the canoe had drifted too far down during his meditation  he shook off the despondency caused by the certitude of bulangis mercenary disposition and taking up his paddle in a few strokes sheered alongside the water gate of the rajahs house  that afternoon almayer as was his wont lately moved about on the water side overlooking the repairs to his boats  he had decided at last guided by the scraps of information contained in old lingards pocket book he was going to seek for the rich goldmine for that place where he had only to stoop to gather up an immense fortune and realise the dream of his young days  to obtain the necessary help he had shared his knowledge with dain maroola he had consented to be reconciled with lakamba who gave his support to the enterprise on condition of sharing the profits he had sacrificed his pride his honour and his loyalty in the face of the enormous risk of his undertaking dazzled by the greatness of the results to be achieved by this alliance so distasteful yet so necessary  the dangers were great but maroola was brave his men seemed as reckless as their chief and with lakambas aid success seemed assured  for the last fortnight almayer was absorbed in the preparations walking amongst his workmen and slaves in a kind of waking trance where practical details as to the fitting out of the boats were mixed up with vivid dreams of untold wealth where the present misery of burning sun of the muddy and malodorous river bank disappeared in a gorgeous vision of a splendid future existence for himself and nina  he hardly saw nina during these last days although the beloved daughter was ever present in his thoughts  he hardly took notice of dain whose constant presence in his house had become a matter of course to him now they were connected by a community of interests  when meeting the young chief he gave him an absent greeting and passed on seemingly wishing to avoid him bent upon forgetting the hated reality of the present by absorbing himself in his work or else by letting his imagination soar far above the treetops into the great white clouds away to the westward where the paradise of europe was awaiting the future eastern millionaire  and maroola now the bargain was struck and there was no more business to be talked over evidently did not care for the white mans company  yet dain was always about the house but he seldom stayed long by the riverside  on his daily visits to the white man the malay chief preferred to make his way quietly through the central passage of the house and would come out into the garden at the back where the fire was burning in the cooking shed with the rice kettle swinging over it under the watchful supervision of mrs almayer  avoiding that shed with its black smoke and the warbling of soft feminine voices dain would turn to the left  there on the edge of a banana plantation a clump of palms and mango trees formed a shady spot a few scattered bushes giving it a certain seclusion into which only the serving womens chatter or an occasional burst of laughter could penetrate  once in he was invisible and hidden there leaning against the smooth trunk of a tall palm he waited with gleaming eyes and an assured smile to hear the faint rustle of dried grass under the light footsteps of nina  from the very first moment when his eyes beheld thisto himperfection of loveliness he felt in his inmost heart the conviction that she would be his he felt the subtle breath of mutual understanding passing between their two savage natures and he did not want mrs almayers encouraging smiles to take every opportunity of approaching the girl and every time he spoke to her every time he looked into her eyes nina although averting her face felt as if this boldlooking being who spoke burning words into her willing ear was the embodiment of her fate the creature of her dreamsreckless ferocious ready with flashing kriss for his enemies and with passionate embrace for his belovedthe ideal malay chief of her mothers tradition  she recognised with a thrill of delicious fear the mysterious consciousness of her identity with that being  listening to his words it seemed to her she was born only then to a knowledge of a new existence that her life was complete only when near him and she abandoned herself to a feeling of dreamy happiness while with halfveiled face and in silenceas became a malay girlshe listened to dains words giving up to her the whole treasure of love and passion his nature was capable of with all the unrestrained enthusiasm of a man totally untrammelled by any influence of civilised selfdiscipline  and they used to pass many a delicious and fast fleeting hour under the mango trees behind the friendly curtain of bushes till mrs almayers shrill voice gave the signal of unwilling separation  mrs almayer had undertaken the easy task of watching her husband lest he should interrupt the smooth course of her daughters love affair in which she took a great and benignant interest  she was happy and proud to see dains infatuation believing him to be a great and powerful chief and she found also a gratification of her mercenary instincts in dains openhanded generosity  on the eve of the day when babalatchis suspicions were confirmed by ocular demonstration dain and nina had remained longer than usual in their shady retreat  only almayers heavy step on the verandah and his querulous clamour for food decided mrs almayer to lift a warning cry maroola leaped lightly over the low bamboo fence and made his way stealthily through the banana plantation down to the muddy shore of the back creek while nina walked slowly towards the house to minister to her fathers wants as was her wont every evening  almayer felt happy enough that evening the preparations were nearly completed tomorrow he would launch his boats  in his minds eye he saw the rich prize in his grasp and with tin spoon in his hand he was forgetting the plateful of rice before him in the fanciful arrangement of some splendid banquet to take place on his arrival in amsterdam  nina reclining in the long chair listened absently to the few disconnected words escaping from her fathers lips  expedition  gold  what did she care for all that  but at the name of maroola mentioned by her father she was all attention dain was going down the river with his brig tomorrow to remain away for a few days said almayer  it was very annoying this delay  as soon as dain returned they would have to start without loss of time for the river was rising  he would not be surprised if a great flood was coming and he pushed away his plate with an impatient gesture on rising from the table  but now nina heard him not  dain going away  thats why he had ordered her with that quiet masterfulness it was her delight to obey to meet him at break of day in bulangis creek  was there a paddle in her canoe she thought  was it ready  she would have to start earlyat four in the morning in a very few hours  she rose from her chair thinking she would require rest before the long pull in the early morning  the lamp was burning dimly and her father tired with the days labour was already in his hammock  nina put the lamp out and passed into a large room she shared with her mother on the left of the central passage  entering she saw that mrs almayer had deserted the pile of mats serving her as bed in one corner of the room and was now bending over the opened lid of her large wooden chest  half a shell of cocoanut filled with oil where a cotton rag floated for a wick stood on the floor surrounding her with a ruddy halo of light shining through the black and odorous smoke  mrs almayers back was bent and her head and shoulders hidden in the deep box  her hands rummaged in the interior where a soft clink as of silver money could be heard  she did not notice at first her daughters approach and nina standing silently by her looked down on many little canvas bags ranged in the bottom of the chest wherefrom her mother extracted handfuls of shining guilders and mexican dollars letting them stream slowly back again through her clawlike fingers  the music of tinkling silver seemed to delight her and her eyes sparkled with the reflected gleam of freshly minted coins  she was muttering to herself and this and this and yet this  soon he will give moreas much more as i ask  he is a great rajaha son of heaven  and she will be a raneehe gave all this for her  who ever gave anything for me  i am a slave  am i  i am the mother of a great ranee  she became aware suddenly of her daughters presence and ceased her droning shutting the lid down violently then without rising from her crouching position she looked up at the girl standing by with a vague smile on her dreamy face  you have seen  have you she shouted shrilly  that is all mine and for you  it is not enough  he will have to give more before he takes you away to the southern island where his father is king  you hear me you are worth more granddaughter of rajahs  more  more  the sleepy voice of almayer was heard on the verandah recommending silence  mrs almayer extinguished the light and crept into her corner of the room  nina laid down on her back on a pile of soft mats her hands entwined under her head gazing through the shutterless hole serving as a window at the stars twinkling on the black sky she was awaiting the time of start for her appointed meetingplace  with quiet happiness she thought of that meeting in the great forest far from all human eyes and sounds  her soul lapsing again into the savage mood which the genius of civilisation working by the hand of mrs vinck could never destroy experienced a feeling of pride and of some slight trouble at the high value her worldlywise mother had put upon her person but she remembered the expressive glances and words of dain and tranquillised she closed her eyes in a shiver of pleasant anticipation  there are some situations where the barbarian and the socalled civilised man meet upon the same ground  it may be supposed that dain maroola was not exceptionally delighted with his prospective motherin law nor that he actually approved of that worthy womans appetite for shining dollars  yet on that foggy morning when babalatchi laying aside the cares of state went to visit his fishbaskets in the bulangi creek maroola had no misgivings experienced no feelings but those of impatience and longing when paddling to the east side of the island forming the backwater in question  he hid his canoe in the bushes and strode rapidly across the islet pushing with impatience through the twigs of heavy undergrowth intercrossed over his path  from motives of prudence he would not take his canoe to the meetingplace as nina had done  he had left it in the main stream till his return from the other side of the island  the heavy warm fog was closing rapidly round him but he managed to catch a fleeting glimpse of a light away to the left proceeding from bulangis house  then he could see nothing in the thickening vapour and kept to the path only by a sort of instinct which also led him to the very point on the opposite shore he wished to reach a great log had stranded there at right angles to the bank forming a kind of jetty against which the swiftly flowing stream broke with a loud ripple  he stepped on it with a quick but steady motion and in two strides found himself at the outer end with the rush and swirl of the foaming water at his feet  standing there alone as if separated from the world the heavens earth the very water roaring under him swallowed up in the thick veil of the morning fog he breathed out the name of nina before him into the apparently limitless space sure of being heard instinctively sure of the nearness of the delightful creature certain of her being aware of his near presence as he was aware of hers  the bow of ninas canoe loomed up close to the log canted high out of the water by the weight of the sitter in the stern  maroola laid his hand on the stem and leaped lightly in giving it a vigorous shove off the light craft obeying the new impulse cleared the log by a hairs breadth and the river with obedient complicity swung it broadside to the current and bore it off silently and rapidly between the invisible banks  and once more dain at the feet of nina forgot the world felt himself carried away helpless by a great wave of supreme emotion by a rush of joy pride and desire understood once more with overpowering certitude that there was no life possible without that being he held clasped in his arms with passionate strength in a prolonged embrace  nina disengaged herself gently with a low laugh  you will overturn the boat dain she whispered  he looked into her eyes eagerly for a minute and let her go with a sigh then lying down in the canoe he put his head on her knees gazing upwards and stretching his arms backwards till his hands met round the girls waist  she bent over him and shaking her head framed both their faces in the falling locks of her long black hair  and so they drifted on he speaking with all the rude eloquence of a savage nature giving itself up without restraint to an overmastering passion she bending low to catch the murmur of words sweeter to her than life itself  to those two nothing existed then outside the gunwales of the narrow and fragile craft  it was their world filled with their intense and allabsorbing love  they took no heed of thickening mist or of the breeze dying away before sunrise they forgot the existence of the great forests surrounding them of all the tropical nature awaiting the advent of the sun in a solemn and impressive silence  over the low rivermist hiding the boat with its freight of young passionate life and allforgetful happiness the stars paled and a silverygrey tint crept over the sky from the eastward  there was not a breath of wind not a rustle of stirring leaf not a splash of leaping fish to disturb the serene repose of all living things on the banks of the great river  earth river and sky were wrapped up in a deep sleep from which it seemed there would be no waking  all the seething life and movement of tropical nature seemed concentrated in the ardent eyes in the tumultuously beating hearts of the two beings drifting in the canoe under the white canopy of mist over the smooth surface of the river  suddenly a great sheaf of yellow rays shot upwards from behind the black curtain of trees lining the banks of the pantai  the stars went out the little black clouds at the zenith glowed for a moment with crimson tints and the thick mist stirred by the gentle breeze the sigh of waking nature whirled round and broke into fantastically torn pieces disclosing the wrinkled surface of the river sparkling in the broad light of day  great flocks of white birds wheeled screaming above the swaying treetops  the sun had risen on the east coast  dain was the first to return to the cares of everyday life  he rose and glanced rapidly up and down the river  his eye detected babalatchis boat astern and another small black speck on the glittering water which was taminahs canoe  he moved cautiously forward and kneeling took up a paddle nina at the stern took hers  they bent their bodies to the work throwing up the water at every stroke and the small craft went swiftly ahead leaving a narrow wake fringed with a lacelike border of white and gleaming foam  without turning his head dain spoke  somebody behind us nina  we must not let him gain  i think he is too far to recognise us  somebody before us also panted out nina without ceasing to paddle  i think i know rejoined dain  the sun shines over there but i fancy it is the girl taminah  she comes down every morning to my brig to sell cakesstays often all day  it does not matter steer more into the bank we must get under the bushes  my canoe is hidden not far from here  as he spoke his eyes watched the broadleaved nipas which they were brushing in their swift and silent course  look out nina he said at last there where the water palms end and the twigs hang down under the leaning tree  steer for the big green branch  he stood up attentive and the boat drifted slowly in shore nina guiding it by a gentle and skilful movement of her paddle  when near enough dain laid hold of the big branch and leaning back shot the canoe under a low green archway of thickly matted creepers giving access to a miniature bay formed by the caving in of the bank during the last great flood  his own boat was there anchored by a stone and he stepped into it keeping his hand on the gunwale of ninas canoe  in a moment the two little nutshells with their occupants floated quietly side by side reflected by the black water in the dim light struggling through a high canopy of dense foliage while above away up in the broad day flamed immense red blossoms sending down on their heads a shower of great dewsparkling petals that descended rotating slowly in a continuous and perfumed stream and over them under them in the sleeping water all around them in a ring of luxuriant vegetation bathed in the warm air charged with strong and harsh perfumes the intense work of tropical nature went on plants shooting upward entwined interlaced in inextricable confusion climbing madly and brutally over each other in the terrible silence of a desperate struggle towards the lifegiving sunshine aboveas if struck with sudden horror at the seething mass of corruption below at the death and decay from which they sprang  we must part now said dain after a long silence  you must return at once nina  i will wait till the brig drifts down here and shall get on board then  and will you be long away dain asked nina in a low voice  long exclaimed dain  would a man willingly remain long in a dark place  when i am not near you nina i am like a man that is blind  what is life to me without light  nina leaned over and with a proud and happy smile took dains face between her hands looking into his eyes with a fond yet questioning gaze  apparently she found there the confirmation of the words just said for a feeling of grateful security lightened for her the weight of sorrow at the hour of parting  she believed that he the descendant of many great rajahs the son of a great chief the master of life and death knew the sunshine of life only in her presence  an immense wave of gratitude and love welled forth out of her heart towards him  how could she make an outward and visible sign of all she felt for the man who had filled her heart with so much joy and so much pride  and in the great tumult of passion like a flash of lightning came to her the reminiscence of that despised and almost forgotten civilisation she had only glanced at in her days of restraint of sorrow and of anger  in the cold ashes of that hateful and miserable past she would find the sign of love the fitting expression of the boundless felicity of the present the pledge of a bright and splendid future  she threw her arms around dains neck and pressed her lips to his in a long and burning kiss  he closed his eyes surprised and frightened at the storm raised in his breast by the strange and to him hitherto unknown contact and long after nina had pushed her canoe into the river he remained motionless without daring to open his eyes afraid to lose the sensation of intoxicating delight he had tasted for the first time  now he wanted but immortality he thought to be the equal of gods and the creature that could open so the gates of paradise must be hissoon would be his for ever  he opened his eyes in time to see through the archway of creepers the bows of his brig come slowly into view as the vessel drifted past on its way down the river  he must go on board now he thought yet he was loth to leave the place where he had learned to know what happiness meant time yet  let them go he muttered to himself and he closed his eyes again under the red shower of scented petals trying to recall the scene with all its delight and all its fear  he must have been able to join his brig in time after all and found much occupation outside for it was in vain that almayer looked for his friends speedy return  the lower reach of the river where he so often and so impatiently directed his eyes remained deserted save for the rapid flitting of some fishing canoe but down the upper reaches came black clouds and heavy showers heralding the final setting in of the rainy season with its thunderstorms and great floods making the river almost impossible of ascent for native canoes  almayer strolling along the muddy beach between his houses watched uneasily the river rising inch by inch creeping slowly nearer to the boats now ready and hauled up in a row under the cover of dripping kajangmats  fortune seemed to elude his grasp and in his weary tramp backwards and forwards under the steady rain falling from the lowering sky a sort of despairing indifference took possession of him  what did it matter  it was just his luck  those two infernal savages lakamba and dain induced him with their promises of help to spend his last dollar in the fitting out of boats and now one of them was gone somewhere and the other shut up in his stockade would give no sign of life  no not even the scoundrelly babalatchi thought almayer would show his face near him now they had sold him all the rice brass gongs and cloth necessary for his expedition  they had his very last coin and did not care whether he went or stayed  and with a gesture of abandoned discouragement almayer would climb up slowly to the verandah of his new house to get out of the rain and leaning on the front rail with his head sunk between his shoulders he would abandon himself to the current of bitter thoughts oblivious of the flight of time and the pangs of hunger deaf to the shrill cries of his wife calling him to the evening meal when roused from his sad meditations by the first roll of the evening thunderstorm he stumbled slowly towards the glimmering light of his old house his halfdead hope made his ears preternaturally acute to any sound on the river  several nights in succession he had heard the splash of paddles and had seen the indistinct form of a boat but when hailing the shadowy apparition his heart bounding with sudden hope of hearing dains voice he was disappointed each time by the sulky answer conveying to him the intelligence that the arabs were on the river bound on a visit to the homestaying lakamba  this caused him many sleepless nights spent in speculating upon the kind of villainy those estimable personages were hatching now  at last when all hope seemed dead he was overjoyed on hearing dains voice but dain also appeared very anxious to see lakamba and almayer felt uneasy owing to a deep and ineradicable distrust as to that rulers disposition towards himself  still dain had returned at last  evidently he meant to keep to his bargain  hope revived and that night almayer slept soundly while nina watched the angry river under the lash of the thunderstorm sweeping onward towards the sea     chapter vi   dain was not long in crossing the river after leaving almayer  he landed at the watergate of the stockade enclosing the group of houses which composed the residence of the rajah of sambir  evidently somebody was expected there for the gate was open and men with torches were ready to precede the visitor up the inclined plane of planks leading to the largest house where lakamba actually resided and where all the business of state was invariably transacted  the other buildings within the enclosure served only to accommodate the numerous household and the wives of the ruler  lakambas own house was a strong structure of solid planks raised on high piles with a verandah of split bamboos surrounding it on all sides the whole was covered in by an immensely highpitched roof of palmleaves resting on beams blackened by the smoke of many torches  the building stood parallel to the river one of its long sides facing the watergate of the stockade  there was a door in the short side looking up the river and the inclined plankway led straight from the gate to that door  by the uncertain light of smoky torches dain noticed the vague outlines of a group of armed men in the dark shadows to his right  from that group babalatchi stepped forward to open the door and dain entered the audience chamber of the rajahs residence  about one third of the house was curtained off by heavy stuff of european manufacture for that purpose close to the curtain there was a big arm chair of some black wood much carved and before it a rough deal table otherwise the room was only furnished with mats in great profusion  to the left of the entrance stood a rude armrack with three rifles with fixed bayonets in it  by the wall in the shadow the bodyguard of lakambaall friends or relationsslept in a confused heap of brown arms legs and multicoloured garments from whence issued an occasional snore or a subdued groan of some uneasy sleeper  an european lamp with a green shade standing on the table made all this indistinctly visible to dain  you are welcome to your rest here said babalatchi looking at dain interrogatively  i must speak to the rajah at once answered dain  babalatchi made a gesture of assent and turning to the brass gong suspended under the armrack struck two sharp blows  the earsplitting din woke up the guard  the snores ceased outstretched legs were drawn in the whole heap moved and slowly resolved itself into individual forms with much yawning and rubbing of sleepy eyes behind the curtains there was a burst of feminine chatter then the bass voice of lakamba was heard  is that the arab trader  no tuan answered babalatchi dain has returned at last  he is here for an important talk bitcharraif you mercifully consent  evidently lakambas mercy went so farfor in a short while he came out from behind the curtainbut it did not go to the length of inducing him to make an extensive toilet  a short red sarong tightened hastily round his hips was his only garment  the merciful ruler of sambir looked sleepy and rather sulky  he sat in the armchair his knees well apart his elbows on the armrests his chin on his breast breathing heavily and waiting malevolently for dain to open the important talk  but dain did not seem anxious to begin  he directed his gaze towards babalatchi squatting comfortably at the feet of his master and remained silent with a slightly bent head as if in attentive expectation of coming words of wisdom  babalatchi coughed discreetly and leaning forward pushed over a few mats for dain to sit upon then lifting up his squeaky voice he assured him with eager volubility of everybodys delight at this longlookedfor return  his heart had hungered for the sight of dains face and his ears were withering for the want of the refreshing sound of his voice everybodys hearts and ears were in the same sad predicament according to babalatchi as he indicated with a sweeping gesture the other bank of the river where the settlement slumbered peacefully unconscious of the great joy awaiting it on the morrow when dains presence amongst them would be disclosed  forwent on babalatchiwhat is the joy of a poor man if not the open hand of a generous trader or of a great  here he checked himself abruptly with a calculated embarrassment of manner and his roving eye sought the floor while an apologetic smile dwelt for a moment on his misshapen lips  once or twice during this opening speech an amused expression flitted across dains face soon to give way however to an appearance of grave concern  on lakambas brow a heavy frown had settled and his lips moved angrily as he listened to his prime ministers oratory  in the silence that fell upon the room when babalatchi ceased speaking arose a chorus of varied snores from the corner where the bodyguard had resumed their interrupted slumbers but the distant rumble of thunder filling then ninas heart with apprehension for the safety of her lover passed unheeded by those three men intent each on their own purposes for life or death  after a short silence babalatchi discarding now the flowers of polite eloquence spoke again but in short and hurried sentences and in a low voice  they had been very uneasy  why did dain remain so long absent the men dwelling on the lower reaches of the river heard the reports of big guns and saw a fireship of the dutch amongst the islands of the estuary  so they were anxious  rumours of a disaster had reached abdulla a few days ago and since then they had been waiting for dains return under the apprehension of some misfortune  for days they had closed their eyes in fear and woke up alarmed and walked abroad trembling like men before an enemy  and all on account of dain  would he not allay their fears for his safety not for themselves  they were quiet and faithful and devoted to the great rajah in bataviamay his fate lead him ever to victory for the joy and profit of his servants and here went on babalatchi lakamba my master was getting thin in his anxiety for the trader he had taken under his protection and so was abdulla for what would wicked men not say if perchance  be silent fool growled lakamba angrily  babalatchi subsided into silence with a satisfied smile while dain who had been watching him as if fascinated turned with a sigh of relief towards the ruler of sambir  lakamba did not move and without raising his head looked at dain from under his eyebrows breathing audibly with pouted lips in an air of general discontent  speak  o dain he said at last  we have heard many rumours  many nights in succession has my friend reshid come here with bad tidings news travels fast along the coast  but they may be untrue there are more lies in mens mouths in these days than when i was young but i am not easier to deceive now  all my words are true said dain carelessly  if you want to know what befell my brig then learn that it is in the hands of the dutch believe me rajah he went on with sudden energy the orang blanda have good friends in sambir or else how did they know i was coming thence  lakamba gave dain a short and hostile glance  babalatchi rose quietly and going to the armrack struck the gong violently  outside the door there was a shuffle of bare feet inside the guard woke up and sat staring in sleepy surprise  yes you faithful friend of the white rajah went on dain scornfully turning to babalatchi who had returned to his place i have escaped and i am here to gladden your heart  when i saw the dutch ship i ran the brig inside the reefs and put her ashore  they did not dare to follow with the ship so they sent the boats  we took to ours and tried to get away but the ship dropped fireballs at us and killed many of my men but i am left o babalatchi  the dutch are coming here  they are seeking for me  they are coming to ask their faithful friend lakamba and his slave babalatchi  rejoice  but neither of his hearers appeared to be in a joyful mood  lakamba had put one leg over his knee and went on gently scratching it with a meditative air while babalatchi sitting crosslegged seemed suddenly to become smaller and very limp staring straight before him vacantly the guard evinced some interest in the proceedings stretching themselves full length on the mats to be nearer the speaker  one of them got up and now stood leaning against the armrack playing absently with the fringes of his swordhilt  dain waited till the crash of thunder had died away in distant mutterings before he spoke again  are you dumb o ruler of sambir or is the son of a great rajah unworthy of your notice  i am come here to seek refuge and to warn you and want to know what you intend doing  you came here because of the white mans daughter retorted lakamba quickly  your refuge was with your father the rajah of bali the son of heaven the anak agong himself  what am i to protect great princes only yesterday i planted rice in a burnt clearing today you say i hold your life in my hand  babalatchi glanced at his master  no man can escape his fate he murmured piously  when love enters a mans heart he is like a childwithout any understanding  be merciful lakamba he added twitching the corner of the rajahs sarong warningly  lakamba snatched away the skirt of the sarong angrily  under the dawning comprehension of intolerable embarrassments caused by dains return to sambir he began to lose such composure as he had been till then able to maintain and now he raised his voice loudly above the whistling of the wind and the patter of rain on the roof in the hard squall passing over the house  you came here first as a trader with sweet words and great promises asking me to look the other way while you worked your will on the white man there  and i did  what do you want now  when i was young i fought now i am old and want peace  it is easier for me to have you killed than to fight the dutch  it is better for me  the squall had now passed and in the short stillness of the lull in the storm lakamba repeated softly as if to himself much easier  much better  dain did not seem greatly discomposed by the rajahs threatening words while lakamba was speaking he had glanced once rapidly over his shoulder just to make sure that there was nobody behind him and tranquillised in that respect he had extracted a siribox out of the folds of his waist cloth and was wrapping carefully the little bit of betelnut and a small pinch of lime in the green leaf tendered him politely by the watchful babalatchi  he accepted this as a peaceoffering from the silent statesmana kind of mute protest against his masters undiplomatic violence and as an omen of a possible understanding to be arrived at yet  otherwise dain was not uneasy  although recognising the justice of lakambas surmise that he had come back to sambir only for the sake of the white mans daughter yet he was not conscious of any childish lack of understanding as suggested by babalatchi  in fact dain knew very well that lakamba was too deeply implicated in the gunpowder smuggling to care for an investigation the dutch authorities into that matter  when sent off by his father the independent rajah of bali at the time when the hostilities between dutch and malays threatened to spread from sumatra over the whole archipelago dain had found all the big traders deaf to his guarded proposals and above the temptation of the great prices he was ready to give for gunpowder  he went to sambir as a last and almost hopeless resort having heard in macassar of the white man there and of the regular steamer trading from singaporeallured also by the fact that there was no dutch resident on the river which would make things easier no doubt  his hopes got nearly wrecked against the stubborn loyalty of lakamba arising from wellunderstood selfinterest but at last the young mans generosity his persuasive enthusiasm the prestige of his fathers great name overpowered the prudent hesitation of the ruler of sambir  lakamba would have nothing to do himself with any illegal traffic  he also objected to the arabs being made use of in that matter but he suggested almayer saying that he was a weak man easily persuaded and that his friend the english captain of the steamer could be made very usefulvery likely even would join in the business smuggling the powder in the steamer without abdullas knowledge  there again dain met in almayer with unexpected resistance lakamba had to send babalatchi over with the solemn promise that his eyes would be shut in friendship for the white man dain paying for the promise and the friendship in good silver guilders of the hated orang blanda  almayer at last consenting said the powder would be obtained but dain must trust him with dollars to send to singapore in payment for it  he would induce ford to buy and smuggle it in the steamer on board the brig  he did not want any money for himself out of the transaction but dain must help him in his great enterprise after sending off the brig  almayer had explained to dain that he could not trust lakamba alone in that matter he would be afraid of losing his treasure and his life through the cupidity of the rajah yet the rajah had to be told and insisted on taking a share in that operation or else his eyes would remain shut no longer  to this almayer had to submit  had dain not seen nina he would have probably refused to engage himself and his men in the projected expedition to gunong masthe mountain of gold  as it was he intended to return with half of his men as soon as the brig was clear of the reefs but the persistent chase given him by the dutch frigate had forced him to run south and ultimately to wreck and destroy his vessel in order to preserve his liberty or perhaps even his life  yes he had come back to sambir for nina although aware that the dutch would look for him there but he had also calculated his chances of safety in lakambas hands  for all his ferocious talk the merciful ruler would not kill him for he had long ago been impressed with the notion that dain possessed the secret of the white mans treasure neither would he give him up to the dutch for fear of some fatal disclosure of complicity in the treasonable trade  so dain felt tolerably secure as he sat meditating quietly his answer to the rajahs bloodthirsty speech  yes he would point out to him the aspect of his position should hedainfall into the hands of the dutch and should he speak the truth  he would have nothing more to lose then and he would speak the truth  and if he did return to sambir disturbing thereby lakambas peace of mind what then he came to look after his property  did he not pour a stream of silver into mrs almayers greedy lap  he had paid for the girl a price worthy of a great prince although unworthy of that delightfully maddening creature for whom his untamed soul longed in an intensity of desire far more tormenting than the sharpest pain  he wanted his happiness  he had the right to be in sambir  he rose and approaching the table leaned both his elbows on it lakamba responsively edged his seat a little closer while babalatchi scrambled to his feet and thrust his inquisitive head between his masters and dains  they interchanged their ideas rapidly speaking in whispers into each others faces very close now dain suggesting lakamba contradicting babalatchi conciliating and anxious in his vivid apprehension of coming difficulties  he spoke most whispering earnestly turning his head slowly from side to side so as to bring his solitary eye to bear upon each of his interlocutors in turn  why should there be strife said he  let tuan dain whom he loved only less than his master go trustfully into hiding  there were many places for that bulangis house away in the clearing was best  bulangi was a safe man  in the network of crooked channels no white man could find his way  white men were strong but very foolish  it was undesirable to fight them but deception was easy  they were like silly womenthey did not know the use of reason and he was a match for any of themwent on babalatchi with all the confidence of deficient experience  probably the dutch would seek almayer  maybe they would take away their countryman if they were suspicious of him  that would be good  after the dutch went away lakamba and dain would get the treasure without any trouble and there would be one person less to share it  did he not speak wisdom  will tuan dain go to bulangis house till the danger is over go at once  dain accepted this suggestion of going into hiding with a certain sense of conferring a favour upon lakamba and the anxious statesman but he met the proposal of going at once with a decided no looking babalatchi meaningly in the eye  the statesman sighed as a man accepting the inevitable would do and pointed silently towards the other bank of the river  dain bent his head slowly  yes i am going there he said  before the day comes asked babalatchi  i am going there now answered dain decisively  the orang blanda will not be here before tomorrow night perhaps and i must tell almayer of our arrangements  no tuan  no say nothing protested babalatchi  i will go over myself at sunrise and let him know  i will see said dain preparing to go  the thunderstorm was recommencing outside the heavy clouds hanging low overhead now  there was a constant rumble of distant thunder punctuated by the nearer sharp crashes and in the continuous play of blue lightning the woods and the river showed fitfully with all the elusive distinctness of detail characteristic of such a scene  outside the door of the rajahs house dain and babalatchi stood on the shaking verandah as if dazed and stunned by the violence of the storm  they stood there amongst the cowering forms of the rajahs slaves and retainers seeking shelter from the rain and dain called aloud to his boatmen who responded with an unanimous ada  tuan while they looked uneasily at the river  this is a great flood shouted babalatchi into dains ear  the river is very angry  look  look at the drifting logs  can you go  dain glanced doubtfully on the livid expanse of seething water bounded far away on the other side by the narrow black line of the forests suddenly in a vivid white flash the low point of land with the bending trees on it and almayers house leaped into view flickered and disappeared  dain pushed babalatchi aside and ran down to the watergate followed by his shivering boatmen  babalatchi backed slowly in and closed the door then turned round and looked silently upon lakamba  the rajah sat still glaring stonily upon the table and babalatchi gazed curiously at the perplexed mood of the man he had served so many years through good and evil fortune  no doubt the oneeyed statesman felt within his savage and much sophisticated breast the unwonted feelings of sympathy with and perhaps even pity for the man he called his master  from the safe position of a confidential adviser he could in the dim vista of past years see himselfa casual cutthroatfinding shelter under that mans roof in the modest riceclearing of early beginnings  then came a long period of unbroken success of wise counsels and deep plottings resolutely carried out by the fearless lakamba till the whole east coast from poulo laut to tanjong batu listened to babalatchis wisdom speaking through the mouth of the ruler of sambir  in those long years how many dangers escaped how many enemies bravely faced how many white men successfully circumvented  and now he looked upon the result of so many years of patient toil the fearless lakamba cowed by the shadow of an impending trouble  the ruler was growing old and babalatchi aware of an uneasy feeling at the pit of his stomach put both his hands there with a suddenly vivid and sad perception of the fact that he himself was growing old too that the time of reckless daring was past for both of them and that they had to seek refuge in prudent cunning  they wanted peace they were disposed to reform they were ready even to retrench so as to have the wherewithal to bribe the evil days away if bribed away they could be  babalatchi sighed for the second time that night as he squatted again at his masters feet and tendered him his betelnut box in mute sympathy  and they sat there in close yet silent communion of betelnut chewers moving their jaws slowly expectorating decorously into the wide mouthed brass vessel they passed to one another and listening to the awful din of the battling elements outside  there is a very great flood remarked babalatchi sadly  yes said lakamba  did dain go  he went tuan  he ran down to the river like a man possessed of the sheitan himself  there was another long pause  he may get drowned suggested lakamba at last with some show of interest  the floating logs are many answered babalatchi but he is a good swimmer he added languidly  he ought to live said lakamba he knows where the treasure is  babalatchi assented with an illhumoured grunt  his want of success in penetrating the white mans secret as to the locality where the gold was to be found was a sore point with the statesman of sambir as the only conspicuous failure in an otherwise brilliant career  a great peace had now succeeded the turmoil of the storm  only the little belated clouds which hurried past overhead to catch up the main body flashing silently in the distance sent down short showers that pattered softly with a soothing hiss over the palmleaf roof  lakamba roused himself from his apathy with an appearance of having grasped the situation at last  babalatchi he called briskly giving him a slight kick  ada tuan  i am listening  if the orang blanda come here babalatchi and take almayer to batavia to punish him for smuggling gunpowder what will he do you think  i do not know tuan  you are a fool commented lakamba exultingly  he will tell them where the treasure is so as to find mercy  he will  babalatchi looked up at his master and nodded his head with by no means a joyful surprise  he had not thought of this there was a new complication  almayer must die said lakamba decisively to make our secret safe he must die quietly babalatchi  you must do it  babalatchi assented and rose wearily to his feet  tomorrow he asked  yes before the dutch come  he drinks much coffee answered lakamba with seeming irrelevancy  babalatchi stretched himself yawning but lakamba in the flattering consciousness of a knotty problem solved by his own unaided intellectual efforts grew suddenly very wakeful  babalatchi he said to the exhausted statesman fetch the box of music the white captain gave me  i cannot sleep  at this order a deep shade of melancholy settled upon babalatchis features  he went reluctantly behind the curtain and soon reappeared carrying in his arms a small handorgan which he put down on the table with an air of deep dejection  lakamba settled himself comfortably in his armchair  turn babalatchi turn he murmured with closed eyes  babalatchis hand grasped the handle with the energy of despair and as he turned the deep gloom on his countenance changed into an expression of hopeless resignation  through the open shutter the notes of verdis music floated out on the great silence over the river and forest  lakamba listened with closed eyes and a delighted smile babalatchi turned at times dozing off and swaying over then catching himself up in a great fright with a few quick turns of the handle  nature slept in an exhausted repose after the fierce turmoil while under the unsteady hand of the statesman of sambir the trovatore fitfully wept wailed and bade goodbye to his leonore again and again in a mournful round of tearful and endless iteration     chapter vii   the bright sunshine of the clear mistless morning after the stormy night flooded the main path of the settlement leading from the low shore of the pantai branch of the river to the gate of abdullas compound  the path was deserted this morning it stretched its dark yellow surface hard beaten by the tramp of many bare feet between the clusters of palm trees whose tall trunks barred it with strong black lines at irregular intervals while the newly risen sun threw the shadows of their leafy heads far away over the roofs of the buildings lining the river even over the river itself as it flowed swiftly and silently past the deserted houses  for the houses were deserted too  on the narrow strip of trodden grass intervening between their open doors and the road the morning fires smouldered untended sending thin fluted columns of smoke into the cool air and spreading the thinnest veil of mysterious blue haze over the sunlit solitude of the settlement  almayer just out of his hammock gazed sleepily at the unwonted appearance of sambir wondering vaguely at the absence of life  his own house was very quiet he could not hear his wifes voice nor the sound of ninas footsteps in the big room opening on the verandah which he called his sittingroom whenever in the company of white men he wished to assert his claims to the commonplace decencies of civilisation  nobody ever sat there there was nothing there to sit upon for mrs almayer in her savage moods when excited by the reminiscences of the piratical period of her life had torn off the curtains to make sarongs for the slavegirls and had burnt the showy furniture piecemeal to cook the family rice  but almayer was not thinking of his furniture now  he was thinking of dains return of dains nocturnal interview with lakamba of its possible influence on his longmatured plans now nearing the period of their execution  he was also uneasy at the nonappearance of dain who had promised him an early visit  the fellow had plenty of time to cross the river he mused and there was so much to be done today  the settling of details for the early start on the morrow the launching of the boats the thousand and one finishing touches  for the expedition must start complete nothing should be forgotten nothing should  the sense of the unwonted solitude grew upon him suddenly and in the unusual silence he caught himself longing even for the usually unwelcome sound of his wifes voice to break the oppressive stillness which seemed to his frightened fancy to portend the advent of some new misfortune what has happened he muttered half aloud as he shuffled in his imperfectly adjusted slippers towards the balustrade of the verandah  is everybody asleep or dead  the settlement was alive and very much awake  it was awake ever since the early break of day when mahmat banjer in a fit of unheardof energy arose and taking up his hatchet stepped over the sleeping forms of his two wives and walked shivering to the waters edge to make sure that the new house he was building had not floated away during the night  the house was being built by the enterprising mahmat on a large raft and he had securely moored it just inside the muddy point of land at the junction of the two branches of the pantai so as to be out of the way of drifting logs that would no doubt strand on the point during the freshet mahmat walked through the wet grass saying bourrouh and cursing softly to himself the hard necessities of active life that drove him from his warm couch into the cold of the morning  a glance showed him that his house was still there and he congratulated himself on his foresight in hauling it out of harms way for the increasing light showed him a confused wrack of driftlogs halfstranded on the muddy flat interlocked into a shapeless raft by their branches tossing to and fro and grinding together in the eddy caused by the meeting currents of the two branches of the river  mahmat walked down to the waters edge to examine the rattan moorings of his house just as the sun cleared the trees of the forest on the opposite shore  as he bent over the fastenings he glanced again carelessly at the unquiet jumble of logs and saw there something that caused him to drop his hatchet and stand up shading his eyes with his hand from the rays of the rising sun  it was something red and the logs rolled over it at times closing round it sometimes hiding it  it looked to him at first like a strip of red cloth  the next moment mahmat had made it out and raised a great shout  ah ya  there yelled mahmat  theres a man amongst the logs  he put the palms of his hand to his lips and shouted enunciating distinctly his face turned towards the settlement theres a body of a man in the river  come and see  a deadstranger  the women of the nearest house were already outside kindling the fires and husking the morning rice  they took up the cry shrilly and it travelled so from house to house dying away in the distance  the men rushed out excited but silent and ran towards the muddy point where the unconscious logs tossed and ground and bumped and rolled over the dead stranger with the stupid persistency of inanimate things  the women followed neglecting their domestic duties and disregarding the possibilities of domestic discontent while groups of children brought up the rear warbling joyously in the delight of unexpected excitement  almayer called aloud for his wife and daughter but receiving no response stood listening intently  the murmur of the crowd reached him faintly bringing with it the assurance of some unusual event  he glanced at the river just as he was going to leave the verandah and checked himself at the sight of a small canoe crossing over from the rajahs landingplace  the solitary occupant in whom almayer soon recognised babalatchi effected the crossing a little below the house and paddled up to the lingard jetty in the dead water under the bank babalatchi clambered out slowly and went on fastening his canoe with fastidious care as if not in a hurry to meet almayer whom he saw looking at him from the verandah  this delay gave almayer time to notice and greatly wonder at babalatchis official getup  the statesman of sambir was clad in a costume befitting his high rank  a loudly checkered sarong encircled his waist and from its many folds peeped out the silver hilt of the kriss that saw the light only on great festivals or during official receptions  over the left shoulder and across the otherwise unclad breast of the aged diplomatist glistened a patent leather belt bearing a brass plate with the arms of netherlands under the inscription sultan of sambir  babalatchis head was covered by a red turban whose fringed ends falling over the left cheek and shoulder gave to his aged face a ludicrous expression of joyous recklessness  when the canoe was at last fastened to his satisfaction he straightened himself up shaking down the folds of his sarong and moved with long strides towards almayers house swinging regularly his long ebony staff whose gold head ornamented with precious stones flashed in the morning sun  almayer waved his hand to the right towards the point of land to him invisible but in full view from the jetty  oh babalatchi oh he called out what is the matter there can you see  babalatchi stopped and gazed intently at the crowd on the river bank and after a little while the astonished almayer saw him leave the path gather up his sarong in one hand and break into a trot through the grass towards the muddy point  almayer now greatly interested ran down the steps of the verandah  the murmur of mens voices and the shrill cries of women reached him quite distinctly now and as soon as he turned the corner of his house he could see the crowd on the low promontory swaying and pushing round some object of interest  he could indistinctly hear babalatchis voice then the crowd opened before the aged statesman and closed after him with an excited hum ending in a loud shout  as almayer approached the throng a man ran out and rushed past him towards the settlement unheeding his call to stop and explain the cause of this excitement  on the very outskirts of the crowd almayer found himself arrested by an unyielding mass of humanity regardless of his entreaties for a passage insensible to his gentle pushes as he tried to work his way through it towards the riverside  in the midst of his gentle and slow progress he fancied suddenly he had heard his wifes voice in the thickest of the throng  he could not mistake very well mrs almayers highpitched tones yet the words were too indistinct for him to understand their purport  he paused in his endeavours to make a passage for himself intending to get some intelligence from those around him when a long and piercing shriek rent the air silencing the murmurs of the crowd and the voices of his informants  for a moment almayer remained as if turned into stone with astonishment and horror for he was certain now that he had heard his wife wailing for the dead  he remembered ninas unusual absence and maddened by his apprehensions as to her safety he pushed blindly and violently forward the crowd falling back with cries of surprise and pain before his frantic advance  on the point of land in a little clear space lay the body of the stranger just hauled out from amongst the logs  on one side stood babalatchi his chin resting on the head of his staff and his one eye gazing steadily at the shapeless mass of broken limbs torn flesh and bloodstained rags  as almayer burst through the ring of horrified spectators mrs almayer threw her own headveil over the upturned face of the drowned man and squatting by it with another mournful howl sent a shiver through the now silent crowd  mahmat dripping wet turned to almayer eager to tell his tale  in the first moment of reaction from the anguish of his fear the sunshine seemed to waver before almayers eyes and he listened to words spoken around him without comprehending their meaning  when by a strong effort of will he regained the possession of his senses mahmat was saying  that is the way tuan  his sarong was caught in the broken branch and he hung with his head under water  when i saw what it was i did not want it here  i wanted it to get clear and drift away  why should we bury a stranger in the midst of our houses for his ghost to frighten our women and children  have we not enough ghosts about this place  a murmur of approval interrupted him here  mahmat looked reproachfully at babalatchi  but the tuan babalatchi ordered me to drag the body ashorehe went on looking round at his audience but addressing himself only to almayerand i dragged him by the feet in through the mud i have dragged him although my heart longed to see him float down the river to strand perchance on bulangis clearingmay his fathers grave be defiled  there was subdued laughter at this for the enmity of mahmat and bulangi was a matter of common notoriety and of undying interest to the inhabitants of sambir  in the midst of that mirth mrs almayer wailed suddenly again  allah  what ails the woman exclaimed mahmat angrily  here i have touched this carcass which came from nobody knows where and have most likely defiled myself before eating rice  by orders of tuan babalatchi i did this thing to please the white man  are you pleased o tuan almayer and what will be my recompense  tuan babalatchi said a recompense there will be and from you  now consider  i have been defiled and if not defiled i may be under the spell  look at his anklets  who ever heard of a corpse appearing during the night amongst the logs with gold anklets on its legs  there is witchcraft there  however added mahmat after a reflective pause i will have the anklet if there is permission for i have a charm against the ghosts and am not afraid  god is great  a fresh outburst of noisy grief from mrs almayer checked the flow of mahmats eloquence  almayer bewildered looked in turn at his wife at mahmat at babalatchi and at last arrested his fascinated gaze on the body lying on the mud with covered face in a grotesquely unnatural contortion of mangled and broken limbs one twisted and lacerated arm with white bones protruding in many places through the torn flesh stretched out the hand with outspread fingers nearly touching his foot  do you know who this is he asked of babalatchi in a low voice  babalatchi staring straight before him hardly moved his lips while mrs almayers persistent lamentations drowned the whisper of his murmured reply intended only for almayers ear  it was fate  look at your feet white man  i can see a ring on those torn fingers which i know well  saying this babalatchi stepped carelessly forward putting his foot as if accidentally on the hand of the corpse and pressing it into the soft mud  he swung his staff menacingly towards the crowd which fell back a little  go away he said sternly and send your women to their cooking fires which they ought not to have left to run after a dead stranger  this is mens work here  i take him now in the name of the rajah  let no man remain here but tuan almayers slaves  now go  the crowd reluctantly began to disperse  the women went first dragging away the children that hung back with all their weight on the maternal hand  the men strolled slowly after them in ever forming and changing groups that gradually dissolved as they neared the settlement and every man regained his own house with steps quickened by the hungry anticipation of the morning rice  only on the slight elevation where the land sloped down towards the muddy point a few men either friends or enemies of mahmat remained gazing curiously for some time longer at the small group standing around the body on the river bank  i do not understand what you mean babalatchi said almayer  what is the ring you are talking about  whoever he is you have trodden the poor fellows hand right into the mud  uncover his face he went on addressing mrs almayer who squatting by the head of the corpse rocked herself to and fro shaking from time to time her dishevelled grey locks and muttering mournfully  hai exclaimed mahmat who had lingered close by  look tuan the logs came together so and here he pressed the palms of his hands together and his head must have been between them and now there is no face for you to look at  there are his flesh and his bones the nose and the lips and maybe his eyes but nobody could tell the one from the other  it was written the day he was born that no man could look at him in death and be able to say this is my friends face  silence mahmat enough said babalatchi and take thy eyes off his anklet thou eater of pigs flesh  tuan almayer he went on lowering his voice have you seen dain this morning  almayer opened his eyes wide and looked alarmed  no he said quickly havent you seen him  is he not with the rajah  i am waiting why does he not come  babalatchi nodded his head sadly  he is come tuan  he left last night when the storm was great and the river spoke angrily  the night was very black but he had within him a light that showed the way to your house as smooth as a narrow backwater and the many logs no bigger than wisps of dried grass  therefore he went and now he lies here  and babalatchi nodded his head towards the body  how can you tell said almayer excitedly pushing his wife aside  he snatched the cover off and looked at the formless mass of flesh hair and drying mud where the face of the drowned man should have been nobody can tell he added turning away with a shudder  babalatchi was on his knees wiping the mud from the stiffened fingers of the outstretched hand  he rose to his feet and flashed before almayers eyes a gold ring set with a large green stone  you know this well he said  this never left dains hand  i had to tear the flesh now to get it off  do you believe now  almayer raised his hands to his head and let them fall listlessly by his side in the utter abandonment of despair  babalatchi looking at him curiously was astonished to see him smile  a strange fancy had taken possession of almayers brain distracted by this new misfortune  it seemed to him that for many years he had been falling into a deep precipice  day after day month after month year after year he had been falling falling falling it was a smooth round black thing and the black walls had been rushing upwards with wearisome rapidity  a great rush the noise of which he fancied he could hear yet and now with an awful shock he had reached the bottom and behold he was alive and whole and dain was dead with all his bones broken  it struck him as funny  a dead malay he had seen many dead malays without any emotion and now he felt inclined to weep but it was over the fate of a white man he knew a man that fell over a deep precipice and did not die  he seemed somehow to himself to be standing on one side a little way off looking at a certain almayer who was in great trouble  poor poor fellow  why doesnt he cut his throat  he wished to encourage him he was very anxious to see him lying dead over that other corpse  why does he not die and end this suffering  he groaned aloud unconsciously and started with affright at the sound of his own voice  was he going mad terrified by the thought he turned away and ran towards his house repeating to himself i am not going mad of course not no no no  he tried to keep a firm hold of the idea  not mad not mad  he stumbled as he ran blindly up the steps repeating fast and ever faster those words wherein seemed to lie his salvation  he saw nina standing there and wished to say something to her but could not remember what in his extreme anxiety not to forget that he was not going mad which he still kept repeating mentally as he ran round the table till he stumbled against one of the armchairs and dropped into it exhausted  he sat staring wildly at nina still assuring himself mentally of his own sanity and wondering why the girl shrank from him in openeyed alarm  what was the matter with her  this was foolish  he struck the table violently with his clenched fist and shouted hoarsely give me some gin  run  then while nina ran off he remained in the chair very still and quiet astonished at the noise he had made  nina returned with a tumbler half filled with gin and found her father staring absently before him  almayer felt very tired now as if he had come from a long journey  he felt as if he had walked miles and miles that morning and now wanted to rest very much  he took the tumbler with a shaking hand and as he drank his teeth chattered against the glass which he drained and set down heavily on the table  he turned his eyes slowly towards nina standing beside him and said steadily  now all is over nina  he is dead and i may as well burn all my boats  he felt very proud of being able to speak so calmly  decidedly he was not going mad  this certitude was very comforting and he went on talking about the finding of the body listening to his own voice complacently  nina stood quietly her hand resting lightly on her fathers shoulder her face unmoved but every line of her features the attitude of her whole body expressing the most keen and anxious attention  and so dain is dead she said coldly when her father ceased speaking  almayers elaborately calm demeanour gave way in a moment to an outburst of violent indignation  you stand there as if you were only half alive and talk to me he exclaimed angrily as if it was a matter of no importance  yes he is dead  do you understand  dead  what do you care  you never cared you saw me struggle and work and strive unmoved and my suffering you could never see  no never  you have no heart and you have no mind or you would have understood that it was for you for your happiness i was working  i wanted to be rich i wanted to get away from here  i wanted to see white men bowing low before the power of your beauty and your wealth  old as i am i wished to seek a strange land a civilisation to which i am a stranger so as to find a new life in the contemplation of your high fortunes of your triumphs of your happiness  for that i bore patiently the burden of work of disappointment of humiliation amongst these savages here and i had it all nearly in my grasp  he looked at his daughters attentive face and jumped to his feet upsetting the chair  do you hear  i had it all there so within reach of my hand  he paused trying to keep down his rising anger and failed  have you no feeling he went on  have you lived without hope  ninas silence exasperated him his voice rose although he tried to master his feelings  are you content to live in this misery and die in this wretched hole say something nina have you no sympathy  have you no word of comfort for me  i that loved you so  he waited for a while for an answer and receiving none shook his fist in his daughters face  i believe you are an idiot he yelled  he looked round for the chair picked it up and sat down stiffly  his anger was dead within him and he felt ashamed of his outburst yet relieved to think that now he had laid clear before his daughter the inner meaning of his life  he thought so in perfect good faith deceived by the emotional estimate of his motives unable to see the crookedness of his ways the unreality of his aims the futility of his regrets  and now his heart was filled only with a great tenderness and love for his daughter  he wanted to see her miserable and to share with her his despair but he wanted it only as all weak natures long for a companionship in misfortune with beings innocent of its cause  if she suffered herself she would understand and pity him but now she would not or could not find one word of comfort or love for him in his dire extremity  the sense of his absolute loneliness came home to his heart with a force that made him shudder  he swayed and fell forward with his face on the table his arms stretched straight out extended and rigid nina made a quick movement towards her father and stood looking at the grey head on the broad shoulders shaken convulsively by the violence of feelings that found relief at last in sobs and tears  nina sighed deeply and moved away from the table  her features lost the appearance of stony indifference that had exasperated her father into his outburst of anger and sorrow  the expression of her face now unseen by her father underwent a rapid change  she had listened to almayers appeal for sympathy for one word of comfort apparently indifferent yet with her breast torn by conflicting impulses raised unexpectedly by events she had not foreseen or at least did not expect to happen so soon  with her heart deeply moved by the sight of almayers misery knowing it in her power to end it with a word longing to bring peace to that troubled heart she heard with terror the voice of her overpowering love commanding her to be silent  and she submitted after a short and fierce struggle of her old self against the new principle of her life she wrapped herself up in absolute silence the only safeguard against some fatal admission  she could not trust herself to make a sign to murmur a word for fear of saying too much and the very violence of the feelings that stirred the innermost recesses of her soul seemed to turn her person into a stone  the dilated nostrils and the flashing eyes were the only signs of the storm raging within and those signs of his daughters emotion almayer did not see for his sight was dimmed by self pity by anger and by despair  had almayer looked at his daughter as she leant over the front rail of the verandah he could have seen the expression of indifference give way to a look of pain and that again pass away leaving the glorious beauty of her face marred by deepdrawn lines of watchful anxiety  the long grass in the neglected courtyard stood very straight before her eyes in the noonday heat  from the riverbank there were voices and a shuffle of bare feet approaching the house babalatchi could be heard giving directions to almayers men and mrs almayers subdued wailing became audible as the small procession bearing the body of the drowned man and headed by that sorrowful matron turned the corner of the house babalatchi had taken the broken anklet off the mans leg and now held it in his hand as he moved by the side of the bearers while mahmat lingered behind timidly in the hopes of the promised reward  lay him there said babalatchi to almayers men pointing to a pile of drying planks in front of the verandah  lay him there  he was a kaffir and the son of a dog and he was the white mans friend  he drank the white mans strong water he added with affected horror  that i have seen myself  the men stretched out the broken limbs on two planks they had laid level while mrs almayer covered the body with a piece of white cotton cloth and after whispering for some time with babalatchi departed to her domestic duties  almayers men after laying down their burden dispersed themselves in quest of shady spots wherein to idle the day away  babalatchi was left alone by the corpse that laid rigid under the white cloth in the bright sunshine  nina came down the steps and joined babalatchi who put his hand to his forehead and squatted down with great deference  you have a bangle there said nina looking down on babalatchis upturned face and into his solitary eye  i have mem putih returned the polite statesman  then turning towards mahmat he beckoned him closer calling out come here  mahmat approached with some hesitation  he avoided looking at nina but fixed his eyes on babalatchi  now listen said babalatchi sharply  the ring and the anklet you have seen and you know they belonged to dain the trader and to no other  dain returned last night in a canoe  he spoke with the rajah and in the middle of the night left to cross over to the white mans house  there was a great flood and this morning you found him in the river  by his feet i dragged him out muttered mahmat under his breath  tuan babalatchi there will be a recompense he exclaimed aloud  babalatchi held up the gold bangle before mahmats eyes  what i have told you mahmat is for all ears  what i give you now is for your eyes only  take  mahmat took the bangle eagerly and hid it in the folds of his waistcloth  am i a fool to show this thing in a house with three women in it he growled  but i shall tell them about dain the trader and there will be talk enough  he turned and went away increasing his pace as soon as he was outside almayers compound  babalatchi looked after him till he disappeared behind the bushes  have i done well mem putih he asked humbly addressing nina  you have answered nina  the ring you may keep yourself  babalatchi touched his lips and forehead and scrambled to his feet  he looked at nina as if expecting her to say something more but nina turned towards the house and went up the steps motioning him away with her hand  babalatchi picked up his staff and prepared to go  it was very warm and he did not care for the long pull to the rajahs house  yet he must go and tell the rajahtell of the event of the change in his plans of all his suspicions  he walked to the jetty and began casting off the rattan painter of his canoe  the broad expanse of the lower reach with its shimmering surface dotted by the black specks of the fishing canoes lay before his eyes  the fishermen seemed to be racing  babalatchi paused in his work and looked on with sudden interest  the man in the foremost canoe now within hail of the first houses of sambir laid in his paddle and stood up shouting  the boats the boats  the manofwars boats are coming  they are here  in a moment the settlement was again alive with people rushing to the riverside  the men began to unfasten their boats the women stood in groups looking towards the bend down the river  above the trees lining the reach a slight puff of smoke appeared like a black stain on the brilliant blue of the cloudless sky  babalatchi stood perplexed the painter in his hand  he looked down the reach then up towards almayers house and back again at the river as if undecided what to do  at last he made the canoe fast again hastily and ran towards the house and up the steps of the verandah  tuan  tuan he called eagerly  the boats are coming  the manof wars boats  you had better get ready  the officers will come here i know  almayer lifted his head slowly from the table and looked at him stupidly  mem putih exclaimed babalatchi to nina look at him  he does not hear  you must take care he added meaningly  nina nodded to him with an uncertain smile and was going to speak when a sharp report from the gun mounted in the bow of the steam launch that was just then coming into view arrested the words on her parted lips  the smile died out and was replaced by the old look of anxious attention from the hills far away the echo came back like a longdrawn and mournful sigh as if the land had sent it in answer to the voice of its masters     chapter viii   the news as to the identity of the body lying now in almayers compound spread rapidly over the settlement  during the forenoon most of the inhabitants remained in the long street discussing the mysterious return and the unexpected death of the man who had become known to them as the trader  his arrival during the northeast monsoon his long sojourn in their midst his sudden departure with his brig and above all the mysterious appearance of the body said to be his amongst the logs were subjects to wonder at and to talk over and over again with undiminished interest  mahmat moved from house to house and from group to group always ready to repeat his tale how he saw the body caught by the sarong in a forked log how mrs almayer coming one of the first at his cries recognised it even before he had it hauled on shore how babalatchi ordered him to bring it out of the water  by the feet i dragged him in and there was no head exclaimed mahmat and how could the white mans wife know who it was  she was a witch it was well known  and did you see how the white man himself ran away at the sight of the body  like a deer he ran  and here mahmat imitated almayers long strides to the great joy of the beholders  and for all his trouble he had nothing  the ring with the green stone tuan babalatchi kept  nothing  nothing  he spat down at his feet in sign of disgust and left that group to seek further on a fresh audience  the news spreading to the furthermost parts of the settlement found out abdulla in the cool recess of his godown where he sat overlooking his arab clerks and the men loading and unloading the upcountry canoes reshid who was busy on the jetty was summoned into his uncles presence and found him as usual very calm and even cheerful but very much surprised  the rumour of the capture or destruction of dains brig had reached the arabs ears three days before from the seafishermen and through the dwellers on the lower reaches of the river  it had been passed upstream from neighbour to neighbour till bulangi whose clearing was nearest to the settlement had brought that news himself to abdulla whose favour he courted  but rumour also spoke of a fight and of dains death on board his own vessel  and now all the settlement talked of dains visit to the rajah and of his death when crossing the river in the dark to see almayer  they could not understand this  reshid thought that it was very strange he felt uneasy and doubtful  but abdulla after the first shock of surprise with the old ages dislike for solving riddles showed a becoming resignation  he remarked that the man was dead now at all events and consequently no more dangerous  where was the use to wonder at the decrees of fate especially if they were propitious to the true believers  and with a pious ejaculation to allah the merciful the compassionate abdulla seemed to regard the incident as closed for the present  not so reshid  he lingered by his uncle pulling thoughtfully his neatly trimmed beard  there are many lies he murmured  he has been dead once before and came to life to die again now  the dutch will be here before many days and clamour for the man  shall i not believe my eyes sooner than the tongues of women and idle men  they say that the body is being taken to almayers compound said abdulla  if you want to go there you must go before the dutch arrive here  go late  it should not be said that we have been seen inside that mans enclosure lately  reshid assented to the truth of this last remark and left his uncles side  he leaned against the lintel of the big doorway and looked idly across the courtyard through the open gate on to the main road of the settlement  it lay empty straight and yellow under the flood of light in the hot noontide the smooth trunks of palm trees the outlines of the houses and away there at the other end of the road the roof of almayers house visible over the bushes on the dark background of forest seemed to quiver in the heat radiating from the steaming earth  swarms of yellow butterflies rose and settled to rise again in short flights before reshids halfclosed eyes  from under his feet arose the dull hum of insects in the long grass of the courtyard  he looked on sleepily  from one of the side paths amongst the houses a woman stepped out on the road a slight girlish figure walking under the shade of a large tray balanced on its head  the consciousness of something moving stirred reshids halfsleeping senses into a comparative wakefulness  he recognised taminah bulangis slavegirl with her tray of cakes for salean apparition of daily recurrence and of no importance whatever she was going towards almayers house  she could be made useful  he roused himself up and ran towards the gate calling out taminah o  the girl stopped hesitated and came back slowly  reshid waited signing to her impatiently to come nearer  when near reshid taminah stood with downcast eyes  reshid looked at her a while before he asked  are you going to almayers house  they say in the settlement that dain the trader he that was found drowned this morning is lying in the white mans campong  i have heard this talk whispered taminah and this morning by the riverside i saw the body  where it is now i do not know  so you have seen it asked reshid eagerly  is it dain  you have seen him many times  you would know him  the girls lips quivered and she remained silent for a while breathing quickly  i have seen him not a long time ago she said at last  the talk is true he is dead  what do you want from me tuan  i must go  just then the report of the gun fired on board the steam launch was heard interrupting reshids reply  leaving the girl he ran to the house and met in the courtyard abdulla coming towards the gate  the orang blanda are come said reshid and now we shall have our reward  abdulla shook his head doubtfully  the white mens rewards are long in coming he said  white men are quick in anger and slow in gratitude we shall see  he stood at the gate stroking his grey beard and listening to the distant cries of greeting at the other end of the settlement  as taminah was turning to go he called her back  listen girl he said there will be many white men in almayers house  you shall be there selling your cakes to the men of the sea  what you see and what you hear you may tell me  come here before the sun sets and i will give you a blue handkerchief with red spots  now go and forget not to return  he gave her a push with the end of his long staff as she was going away and made her stumble  this slave is very slow he remarked to his nephew looking after the girl with great disfavour  taminah walked on her tray on the head her eyes fixed on the ground from the open doors of the houses were heard as she passed friendly calls inviting her within for business purposes but she never heeded them neglecting her sales in the preoccupation of intense thinking since the very early morning she had heard much she had also seen much that filled her heart with a joy mingled with great suffering and fear before the dawn before she left bulangis house to paddle up to sambir she had heard voices outside the house when all in it but herself were asleep  and now with her knowledge of the words spoken in the darkness she held in her hand a life and carried in her breast a great sorrow  yet from her springy step erect figure and face veiled over by the everyday look of apathetic indifference nobody could have guessed of the double load she carried under the visible burden of the tray piled up high with cakes manufactured by the thrifty hands of bulangis wives  in that supple figure straight as an arrow so graceful and free in its walk behind those soft eyes that spoke of nothing but of unconscious resignation there slept all feelings and all passions all hopes and all fears the curse of life and the consolation of death  and she knew nothing of it all  she lived like the tall palms amongst whom she was passing now seeking the light desiring the sunshine fearing the storm unconscious of either  the slave had no hope and knew of no change  she knew of no other sky no other water no other forest no other world no other life  she had no wish no hope no love no fear except of a blow and no vivid feeling but that of occasional hunger which was seldom for bulangi was rich and rice was plentiful in the solitary house in his clearing  the absence of pain and hunger was her happiness and when she felt unhappy she was simply tired more than usual after the days labour  then in the hot nights of the southwest monsoon she slept dreamlessly under the bright stars on the platform built outside the house and over the river  inside they slept too bulangi by the door his wives further in the children with their mothers  she could hear their breathing bulangis sleepy voice the sharp cry of a child soon hushed with tender words  and she closed her eyes to the murmur of the water below her to the whisper of the warm wind above ignorant of the neverceasing life of that tropical nature that spoke to her in vain with the thousand faint voices of the near forest with the breath of tepid wind in the heavy scents that lingered around her head in the white wraiths of morning mist that hung over her in the solemn hush of all creation before the dawn  such had been her existence before the coming of the brig with the strangers  she remembered well that time the uproar in the settlement the neverending wonder the days and nights of talk and excitement  she remembered her own timidity with the strange men till the brig moored to the bank became in a manner part of the settlement and the fear wore off in the familiarity of constant intercourse  the call on board then became part of her daily round  she walked hesitatingly up the slanting planks of the gangway amidst the encouraging shouts and more or less decent jokes of the men idling over the bulwarks  there she sold her wares to those men that spoke so loud and carried themselves so free there was a throng a constant coming and going calls interchanged orders given and executed with shouts the rattle of blocks the flinging about of coils of rope  she sat out of the way under the shade of the awning with her tray before her the veil drawn well over her face feeling shy amongst so many men  she smiled at all buyers but spoke to none letting their jests pass with stolid unconcern  she heard many tales told around her of faroff countries of strange customs of events stranger still  those men were brave but the most fearless of them spoke of their chief with fear  often the man they called their master passed before her walking erect and indifferent in the pride of youth in the flash of rich dress with a tinkle of gold ornaments while everybody stood aside watching anxiously for a movement of his lips ready to do his bidding  then all her life seemed to rush into her eyes and from under her veil she gazed at him charmed yet fearful to attract attention  one day he noticed her and asked who is that girl  a slave tuan  a girl that sells cakes a dozen voices replied together she rose in terror to run on shore when he called her back and as she stood trembling with head hung down before him he spoke kind words lifting her chin with his hand and looking into her eyes with a smile do not be afraid he said  he never spoke to her any more  somebody called out from the river bank he turned away and forgot her existence taminah saw almayer standing on the shore with nina on his arm  she heard ninas voice calling out gaily and saw dains face brighten with joy as he leaped on shore  she hated the sound of that voice ever since  after that day she left off visiting almayers compound and passed the noon hours under the shade of the brig awning  she watched for his coming with heart beating quicker and quicker as he approached into a wild tumult of newlyaroused feelings of joy and hope and fear that died away with dains retreating figure leaving her tired out as if after a struggle sitting still for a long time in dreamy languor  then she paddled home slowly in the afternoon often letting her canoe float with the lazy stream in the quiet backwater of the river  the paddle hung idle in the water as she sat in the stern one hand supporting her chin her eyes wide open listening intently to the whispering of her heart that seemed to swell at last into a song of extreme sweetness  listening to that song she husked the rice at home it dulled her ears to the shrill bickerings of bulangis wives to the sound of angry reproaches addressed to herself  and when the sun was near its setting she walked to the bathingplace and heard it as she stood on the tender grass of the low bank her robe at her feet and looked at the reflection of her figure on the glasslike surface of the creek  listening to it she walked slowly back her wet hair hanging over her shoulders laying down to rest under the bright stars she closed her eyes to the murmur of the water below of the warm wind above to the voice of nature speaking through the faint noises of the great forest and to the song of her own heart  she heard but did not understand and drank in the dreamy joy of her new existence without troubling about its meaning or its end till the full consciousness of life came to her through pain and anger  and she suffered horribly the first time she saw ninas long canoe drift silently past the sleeping house of bulangi bearing the two lovers into the white mist of the great river  her jealousy and rage culminated into a paroxysm of physical pain that left her lying panting on the river bank in the dumb agony of a wounded animal  but she went on moving patiently in the enchanted circle of slavery going through her task day after day with all the pathos of the grief she could not express even to herself locked within her breast  she shrank from nina as she would have shrunk from the sharp blade of a knife cutting into her flesh but she kept on visiting the brig to feed her dumb ignorant soul on her own despair  she saw dain many times  he never spoke he never looked  could his eyes see only one womans image  could his ears hear only one womans voice he never noticed her not once  and then he went away  she saw him and nina for the last time on that morning when babalatchi while visiting his fish baskets had his suspicions of the white mans daughters love affair with dain confirmed beyond the shadow of doubt  dain disappeared and taminahs heart where lay useless and barren the seeds of all love and of all hate the possibilities of all passions and of all sacrifices forgot its joys and its sufferings when deprived of the help of the senses  her halfformed savage mind the slave of her bodyas her body was the slave of anothers willforgot the faint and vague image of the ideal that had found its beginning in the physical promptings of her savage nature  she dropped back into the torpor of her former life and found consolationeven a certain kind of happinessin the thought that now nina and dain were separated probably for ever  he would forget  this thought soothed the last pangs of dying jealousy that had nothing now to feed upon and taminah found peace  it was like the dreary tranquillity of a desert where there is peace only because there is no life  and now he had returned  she had recognised his voice calling aloud in the night for bulangi  she had crept out after her master to listen closer to the intoxicating sound  dain was there in a boat talking to bulangi  taminah listening with arrested breath heard another voice the maddening joy that only a second before she thought herself incapable of containing within her fastbeating heart died out and left her shivering in the old anguish of physical pain that she had suffered once before at the sight of dain and nina  nina spoke now ordering and entreating in turns and bulangi was refusing expostulating at last consenting  he went in to take a paddle from the heap lying behind the door  outside the murmur of two voices went on and she caught a word here and there  she understood that he was fleeing from white men that he was seeking a hidingplace that he was in some danger  but she heard also words which woke the rage of jealousy that had been asleep for so many days in her bosom  crouching low on the mud in the black darkness amongst the piles she heard the whisper in the boat that made light of toil of privation of danger of life itself if in exchange there could be but a short moment of close embrace a look from the eyes the feel of light breath the touch of soft lips  so spoke dain as he sat in the canoe holding ninas hands while waiting for bulangis return and taminah supporting herself by the slimy pile felt as if a heavy weight was crushing her down down into the black oily water at her feet  she wanted to cry out to rush at them and tear their vague shadows apart to throw nina into the smooth water cling to her close hold her to the bottom where that man could not find her  she could not cry she could not move  then footsteps were heard on the bamboo platform above her head she saw bulangi get into his smallest canoe and take the lead the other boat following paddled by dain and nina  with a slight splash of the paddles dipped stealthily into the water their indistinct forms passed before her aching eyes and vanished in the darkness of the creek  she remained there in the cold and wet powerless to move breathing painfully under the crushing weight that the mysterious hand of fate had laid so suddenly upon her slender shoulders and shivering she felt within a burning fire that seemed to feed upon her very life  when the breaking day had spread a pale golden ribbon over the black outline of the forests she took up her tray and departed towards the settlement going about her task purely from the force of habit  as she approached sambir she could see the excitement and she heard with momentary surprise of the finding of dains body  it was not true of course  she knew it well  she regretted that he was not dead  she should have liked dain to be dead so as to be parted from that womanfrom all women  she felt a strong desire to see nina but without any clear object  she hated her and feared her and she felt an irresistible impulse pushing her towards almayers house to see the white womans face to look close at those eyes to hear again that voice for the sound of which dain was ready to risk his liberty his life even  she had seen her many times she had heard her voice daily for many months past  what was there in her  what was there in that being to make a man speak as dain had spoken to make him blind to all other faces deaf to all other voices  she left the crowd by the riverside and wandered aimlessly among the empty houses resisting the impulse that pushed her towards almayers campong to seek there in ninas eyes the secret of her own misery  the sun mounting higher shortened the shadows and poured down upon her a flood of light and of stifling heat as she passed on from shadow to light from light to shadow amongst the houses the bushes the tall trees in her unconscious flight from the pain in her own heart  in the extremity of her distress she could find no words to pray for relief she knew of no heaven to send her prayer to and she wandered on with tired feet in the dumb surprise and terror at the injustice of the suffering inflicted upon her without cause and without redress  the short talk with reshid the proposal of abdulla steadied her a little and turned her thoughts into another channel  dain was in some danger he was hiding from white men  so much she had overheard last night  they all thought him dead  she knew he was alive and she knew of his hiding place  what did the arabs want to know about the white men  the white men want with dain  did they wish to kill him  she could tell them allno she would say nothing and in the night she would go to him and sell him his life for a word for a smile for a gesture even and be his slave in faroff countries away from nina  but there were dangers  the oneeyed babalatchi who knew everything the white mans wifeshe was a witch  perhaps they would tell  and then there was nina  she must hurry on and see  in her impatience she left the path and ran towards almayers dwelling through the undergrowth between the palm trees  she came out at the back of the house where a narrow ditch full of stagnant water that overflowed from the river separated almayers campong from the rest of the settlement  the thick bushes growing on the bank were hiding from her sight the large courtyard with its cooking shed  above them rose several thin columns of smoke and from behind the sound of strange voices informed taminah that the men of the sea belonging to the warship had already landed and were camped between the ditch and the house  to the left one of almayers slavegirls came down to the ditch and bent over the shiny water washing a kettle  to the right the tops of the banana plantation visible above the bushes swayed and shook under the touch of invisible hands gathering the fruit  on the calm water several canoes moored to a heavy stake were crowded together nearly bridging the ditch just at the place where taminah stood  the voices in the courtyard rose at times into an outburst of calls replies and laughter and then died away into a silence that soon was broken again by a fresh clamour now and again the thin blue smoke rushed out thicker and blacker and drove in odorous masses over the creek wrapping her for a moment in a suffocating veil then as the fresh wood caught well alight the smoke vanished in the bright sunlight and only the scent of aromatic wood drifted afar to leeward of the crackling fires  taminah rested her tray on a stump of a tree and remained standing with her eyes turned towards almayers house whose roof and part of a whitewashed wall were visible over the bushes  the slavegirl finished her work and after looking for a while curiously at taminah pushed her way through the dense thicket back to the courtyard  round taminah there was now a complete solitude  she threw herself down on the ground and hid her face in her hands  now when so close she had no courage to see nina  at every burst of louder voices from the courtyard she shivered in the fear of hearing ninas voice  she came to the resolution of waiting where she was till dark and then going straight to dains hidingplace from where she was she could watch the movements of white men of nina of all dains friends and of all his enemies  both were hateful alike to her for both would take him away beyond her reach  she hid herself in the long grass to wait anxiously for the sunset that seemed so slow to come  on the other side of the ditch behind the bush by the clear fires the seamen of the frigate had encamped on the hospitable invitation of almayer  almayer roused out of his apathy by the prayers and importunity of nina had managed to get down in time to the jetty so as to receive the officers at their landing  the lieutenant in command accepted his invitation to his house with the remark that in any case their business was with almayerand perhaps not very pleasant he added almayer hardly heard him  he shook hands with them absently and led the way towards the house  he was scarcely conscious of the polite words of welcome he greeted the strangers with and afterwards repeated several times over again in his efforts to appear at ease  the agitation of their host did not escape the officers eyes and the chief confided to his subordinate in a low voice his doubts as to almayers sobriety  the young sublieutenant laughed and expressed in a whisper the hope that the white man was not intoxicated enough to neglect the offer of some refreshments  he does not seem very dangerous he added as they followed almayer up the steps of the verandah  no he seems more of a fool than a knave i have heard of him returned the senior  they sat around the table  almayer with shaking hands made gin cocktails offered them all round and drank himself with every gulp feeling stronger steadier and better able to face all the difficulties of his position  ignorant of the fate of the brig he did not suspect the real object of the officers visit  he had a general notion that something must have leaked out about the gunpowder trade but apprehended nothing beyond some temporary inconveniences  after emptying his glass he began to chat easily lying back in his chair with one of his legs thrown negligently over the arm  the lieutenant astride on his chair a glowing cheroot in the corner of his mouth listened with a sly smile from behind the thick volumes of smoke that escaped from his compressed lips  the young sublieutenant leaning with both elbows on the table his head between his hands looked on sleepily in the torpor induced by fatigue and the gin  almayer talked on  it is a great pleasure to see white faces here  i have lived here many years in great solitude  the malays you understand are not company for a white man moreover they are not friendly they do not understand our ways  great rascals they are  i believe i am the only white man on the east coast that is a settled resident  we get visitors from macassar or singapore sometimestraders agents or explorers but they are rare there was a scientific explorer here a year or more ago  he lived in my house drank from morning to night  he lived joyously for a few months and when the liquor he brought with him was gone he returned to batavia with a report on the mineral wealth of the interior  ha ha ha  good is it not  he ceased abruptly and looked at his guests with a meaningless stare while they laughed he was reciting to himself the old story dain dead all my plans destroyed  this is the end of all hope and of all things his heart sank within him  he felt a kind of deadly sickness  very good  capital exclaimed both officers  almayer came out of his despondency with another burst of talk  eh what about the dinner  you have got a cook with you  thats all right  there is a cooking shed in the other courtyard  i can give you a goose  look at my geesethe only geese on the east coastperhaps on the whole island  is that your cook  very good  here ali show this chinaman the cooking place and tell mem almayer to let him have room there  my wife gentlemen does not come out my daughter may  meantime have some more drink  it is a hot day  the lieutenant took the cigar out of his mouth looked at the ash critically shook it off and turned towards almayer  we have a rather unpleasant business with you he said  i am sorry returned almayer  it can be nothing very serious surely  if you think an attempt to blow up forty men at least not a serious matter you will not find many people of your opinion retorted the officer sharply  blow up  what  i know nothing about it exclaimed almayer  who did that or tried to do it  a man with whom you had some dealings answered the lieutenant  he passed here under the name of dain maroola  you sold him the gunpowder he had in that brig we captured  how did you hear about the brig asked almayer  i know nothing about the powder he may have had  an arab trader of this place has sent the information about your goings on here to batavia a couple of months ago said the officer  we were waiting for the brig outside but he slipped past us at the mouth of the river and we had to chase the fellow to the southward  when he sighted us he ran inside the reefs and put the brig ashore  the crew escaped in boats before we could take possession  as our boats neared the craft it blew up with a tremendous explosion one of the boats being too near got swamped  two men drownedthat is the result of your speculation mr almayer  now we want this dain  we have good grounds to suppose he is hiding in sambir  do you know where he is  you had better put yourself right with the authorities as much as possible by being perfectly frank with me  where is this dain  almayer got up and walked towards the balustrade of the verandah  he seemed not to be thinking of the officers question  he looked at the body laying straight and rigid under its white cover on which the sun declining amongst the clouds to the westward threw a pale tinge of red the lieutenant waited for the answer taking quick pulls at his halfextinguished cigar  behind them ali moved noiselessly laying the table ranging solemnly the illassorted and shabby crockery the tin spoons the forks with broken prongs and the knives with sawlike blades and loose handles  he had almost forgotten how to prepare the table for white men  he felt aggrieved mem nina would not help him  he stepped back to look at his work admiringly feeling very proud  this must be right and if the master afterwards is angry and swears then so much the worse for mem nina  why did she not help  he left the verandah to fetch the dinner  well mr almayer will you answer my question as frankly as it is put to you asked the lieutenant after a long silence  almayer turned round and looked at his interlocutor steadily  if you catch this dain what will you do with him he asked  the officers face flushed  this is not an answer he said annoyed  and what will you do with me went on almayer not heeding the interruption  are you inclined to bargain growled the other  it would be bad policy i assure you  at present i have no orders about your person but we expected your assistance in catching this malay  ah interrupted almayer just so you can do nothing without me and i knowing the man well am to help you in finding him  this is exactly what we expect assented the officer  you have broken the law mr almayer and you ought to make amends  and save myself  well in a sense yes  your head is not in any danger said the lieutenant with a short laugh  very well said almayer with decision i shall deliver the man up to you  both officers rose to their feet quickly and looked for their sidearms which they had unbuckled  almayer laughed harshly  steady gentlemen he exclaimed  in my own time and in my own way after dinner gentlemen you shall have him  this is preposterous urged the lieutenant  mr almayer this is no joking matter  the man is a criminal  he deserves to hang  while we dine he may escape the rumour of our arrival  almayer walked towards the table  i give you my word of honour gentlemen that he shall not escape i have him safe enough  the arrest should be effected before dark remarked the young sub  i shall hold you responsible for any failure  we are ready but can do nothing just now without you added the senior with evident annoyance  almayer made a gesture of assent  on my word of honour he repeated vaguely  and now let us dine he added briskly  nina came through the doorway and stood for a moment holding the curtain aside for ali and the old malay woman bearing the dishes then she moved towards the three men by the table  allow me said almayer pompously  this is my daughter  nina these gentlemen officers of the frigate outside have done me the honour to accept my hospitality  nina answered the low bows of the two officers by a slow inclination of the head and took her place at the table opposite her father  all sat down  the coxswain of the steam launch came up carrying some bottles of wine  you will allow me to have this put upon the table said the lieutenant to almayer  what  wine  you are very kind  certainly i have none myself  times are very hard  the last words of his reply were spoken by almayer in a faltering voice the thought that dain was dead recurred to him vividly again and he felt as if an invisible hand was gripping his throat  he reached for the gin bottle while they were uncorking the wine and swallowed a big gulp  the lieutenant who was speaking to nina gave him a quick glance  the young sub began to recover from the astonishment and confusion caused by ninas unexpected appearance and great beauty  she was very beautiful and imposing he reflected but after all a halfcaste girl  this thought caused him to pluck up heart and look at nina sideways  nina with composed face was answering in a low even voice the elder officers polite questions as to the country and her mode of life  almayer pushed his plate away and drank his guests wine in gloomy silence     chapter ix   can i believe what you tell me  it is like a tale for men that listen only half awake by the camp fire and it seems to have run off a womans tongue  who is there here for me to deceive o rajah answered babalatchi without you i am nothing  all i have told you i believe to be true  i have been safe for many years in the hollow of your hand  this is no time to harbour suspicions  the danger is very great  we should advise and act at once before the sun sets  right  right muttered lakamba pensively  they had been sitting for the last hour together in the audience chamber of the rajahs house for babalatchi as soon as he had witnessed the landing of the dutch officers had crossed the river to report to his master the events of the morning and to confer with him upon the line of conduct to pursue in the face of altered circumstances  they were both puzzled and frightened by the unexpected turn the events had taken  the rajah sitting crosslegged on his chair looked fixedly at the floor babalatchi was squatting close by in an attitude of deep dejection  and where did you say he is hiding now asked lakamba breaking at last the silence full of gloomy forebodings in which they both had been lost for a long while  in bulangis clearingthe furthest one away from the house  they went there that very night  the white mans daughter took him there  she told me so herself speaking to me openly for she is half white and has no decency  she said she was waiting for him while he was here then after a long time he came out of the darkness and fell at her feet exhausted  he lay like one dead but she brought him back to life in her arms and made him breathe again with her own breath  that is what she said speaking to my face as i am speaking now to you rajah  she is like a white woman and knows no shame  he paused deeply shocked  lakamba nodded his head  well and then he asked  they called the old woman went on babalatchi and he told them allabout the brig and how he tried to kill many men  he knew the orang blanda were very near although he had said nothing to us about that he knew his great danger  he thought he had killed many but there were only two dead as i have heard from the men of the sea that came in the warships boats  and the other man he that was found in the river interrupted lakamba  that was one of his boatmen  when his canoe was overturned by the logs those two swam together but the other man must have been hurt  dain swam holding him up  he left him in the bushes when he went up to the house  when they all came down his heart had ceased to beat then the old woman spoke dain thought it was good  he took off his anklet and broke it twisting it round the mans foot  his ring he put on that slaves hand  he took off his sarong and clothed that thing that wanted no clothes the two women holding it up meanwhile their intent being to deceive all eyes and to mislead the minds in the settlement so that they could swear to the thing that was not and that there could be no treachery when the whitemen came  then dain and the white woman departed to call up bulangi and find a hidingplace  the old woman remained by the body  hai exclaimed lakamba  she has wisdom  yes she has a devil of her own to whisper counsel in her ear assented babalatchi  she dragged the body with great toil to the point where many logs were stranded  all these things were done in the darkness after the storm had passed away  then she waited  at the first sign of daylight she battered the face of the dead with a heavy stone and she pushed him amongst the logs  she remained near watching  at sunrise mahmat banjer came and found him  they all believed i myself was deceived but not for long  the white man believed and grieving fled to his house  when we were alone i having doubts spoke to the woman and she fearing my anger and your might told me all asking for help in saving dain  he must not fall into the hands of the orang blanda said lakamba but let him die if the thing can be done quietly  it cannot tuan  remember there is that woman who being half white is ungovernable and would raise a great outcry  also the officers are here  they are angry enough already  dain must escape he must go  we must help him now for our own safety  are the officers very angry inquired lakamba with interest  they are  the principal chief used strong words when speaking to meto me when i salaamed in your name  i do not think added babalatchi after a short pause and looking very worriedi do not think i saw a white chief so angry before  he said we were careless or even worse  he told me he would speak to the rajah and that i was of no account  speak to the rajah repeated lakamba thoughtfully  listen babalatchi i am sick and shall withdraw you cross over and tell the white men  yes said babalatchi i am going over at once and as to dain  you get him away as you can best  this is a great trouble in my heart sighed lakamba  babalatchi got up and going close to his master spoke earnestly  there is one of our praus at the southern mouth of the river  the dutch warship is to the northward watching the main entrance  i shall send dain off tonight in a canoe by the hidden channels on board the prau his father is a great prince and shall hear of our generosity  let the prau take him to ampanam  your glory shall be great and your reward in powerful friendship  almayer will no doubt deliver the dead body as dains to the officers and the foolish white men shall say this is very good let there be peace  and the trouble shall be removed from your heart rajah  true true said lakamba  and this being accomplished by me who am your slave you shall reward with a generous hand  that i know  the white man is grieving for the lost treasure in the manner of white men who thirst after dollars  now when all other things are in order we shall perhaps obtain the treasure from the white man  dain must escape and almayer must live  now go babalatchi go said lakamba getting off his chair  i am very sick and want medicine  tell the white chief so  but babalatchi was not to be got rid of in this summary manner  he knew that his master after the manner of the great liked to shift the burden of toil and danger on to his servants shoulders but in the difficult straits in which they were now the rajah must play his part  he may be very sick for the white men for all the world if he liked as long as he would take upon himself the execution of part at least of babalatchis carefully thoughtof plan  babalatchi wanted a big canoe manned by twelve men to be sent out after dark towards bulangis clearing  dain may have to be overpowered  a man in love cannot be expected to see clearly the path of safety if it leads him away from the object of his affections argued babalatchi and in that case they would have to use force in order to make him go  would the rajah see that trusty men manned the canoe  the thing must be done secretly  perhaps the rajah would come himself so as to bring all the weight of his authority to bear upon dain if he should prove obstinate and refuse to leave his hidingplace  the rajah would not commit himself to a definite promise and anxiously pressed babalatchi to go being afraid of the white men paying him an unexpected visit  the aged statesman reluctantly took his leave and went into the courtyard  before going down to his boat babalatchi stopped for a while in the big open space where the thickleaved trees put black patches of shadow which seemed to float on a flood of smooth intense light that rolled up to the houses and down to the stockade and over the river where it broke and sparkled in thousands of glittering wavelets like a band woven of azure and gold edged with the brilliant green of the forests guarding both banks of the pantai  in the perfect calm before the coming of the afternoon breeze the irregularly jagged line of treetops stood unchanging as if traced by an unsteady hand on the clear blue of the hot sky  in the space sheltered by the high palisades there lingered the smell of decaying blossoms from the surrounding forest a taint of drying fish with now and then a whiff of acrid smoke from the cooking fires when it eddied down from under the leafy boughs and clung lazily about the burntup grass  as babalatchi looked up at the flagstaff overtopping a group of low trees in the middle of the courtyard the tricolour flag of the netherlands stirred slightly for the first time since it had been hoisted that morning on the arrival of the manofwar boats  with a faint rustle of trees the breeze came down in light puffs playing capriciously for a time with this emblem of lakambas power that was also the mark of his servitude then the breeze freshened in a sharp gust of wind and the flag flew out straight and steady above the trees  a dark shadow ran along the river rolling over and covering up the sparkle of declining sunlight  a big white cloud sailed slowly across the darkening sky and hung to the westward as if waiting for the sun to join it there  men and things shook off the torpor of the hot afternoon and stirred into life under the first breath of the sea breeze  babalatchi hurried down to the watergate yet before he passed through it he paused to look round the courtyard with its light and shade with its cheery fires with the groups of lakambas soldiers and retainers scattered about  his own house stood amongst the other buildings in that enclosure and the statesman of sambir asked himself with a sinking heart when and how would it be given him to return to that house  he had to deal with a man more dangerous than any wild beast of his experience a proud man a man wilful after the manner of princes a man in love  and he was going forth to speak to that man words of cold and worldly wisdom could anything be more appalling  what if that man should take umbrage at some fancied slight to his honour or disregard of his affections and suddenly amok  the wise adviser would be the first victim no doubt and death would be his reward  and underlying the horror of this situation there was the danger of those meddlesome fools the white men a vision of comfortless exile in faroff madura rose up before babalatchi  wouldnt that be worse than death itself  and there was that halfwhite woman with threatening eyes  how could he tell what an incomprehensible creature of that sort would or would not do  she knew so much that she made the killing of dain an impossibility  that much was certain  and yet the sharp roughedged kriss is a good and discreet friend thought babalatchi as he examined his own lovingly and put it back in the sheath with a sigh of regret before unfastening his canoe as he cast off the painter pushed out into the stream and took up his paddle he realised vividly how unsatisfactory it was to have women mixed up in state affairs  young women of course  for mrs almayers mature wisdom and for the easy aptitude in intrigue that comes with years to the feminine mind he felt the most sincere respect  he paddled leisurely letting the canoe drift down as he crossed towards the point  the sun was high yet and nothing pressed  his work would commence only with the coming of darkness  avoiding the lingard jetty he rounded the point and paddled up the creek at the back of almayers house  there were many canoes lying there their noses all drawn together fastened all to the same stake  babalatchi pushed his little craft in amongst them and stepped on shore  on the other side of the ditch something moved in the grass  whos that hiding hailed babalatchi  come out and speak to me  nobody answered  babalatchi crossed over passing from boat to boat and poked his staff viciously in the suspicious place  taminah jumped up with a cry  what are you doing here he asked surprised  i have nearly stepped on your tray  am i a dyak that you should hide at my sight  i was weary andi slept whispered taminah confusedly  you slept  you have not sold anything today and you will be beaten when you return home said babalatchi  taminah stood before him abashed and silent  babalatchi looked her over carefully with great satisfaction  decidedly he would offer fifty dollars more to that thief bulangi  the girl pleased him  now you go home  it is late he said sharply  tell bulangi that i shall be near his house before the night is half over and that i want him to make all things ready for a long journey  you understand  a long journey to the southward  tell him that before sunset and do not forget my words  taminah made a gesture of assent and watched babalatchi recross the ditch and disappear through the bushes bordering almayers compound  she moved a little further off the creek and sank in the grass again lying down on her face shivering in dryeyed misery  babalatchi walked straight towards the cookingshed looking for mrs almayer  the courtyard was in a great uproar  a strange chinaman had possession of the kitchen fire and was noisily demanding another saucepan  he hurled objurgations in the canton dialect and bad malay against the group of slavegirls standing a little way off half frightened half amused at his violence  from the camping fires round which the seamen of the frigate were sitting came words of encouragement mingled with laughter and jeering  in the midst of this noise and confusion babalatchi met ali an empty dish in his hand  where are the white men asked babalatchi  they are eating in the front verandah answered ali  do not stop me tuan  i am giving the white men their food and am busy  wheres mem almayer  inside in the passage  she is listening to the talk  ali grinned and passed on babalatchi ascended the plankway to the rear verandah and beckoning out mrs almayer engaged her in earnest conversation  through the long passage closed at the further end by the red curtain they could hear from time to time almayers voice mingling in conversation with an abrupt loudness that made mrs almayer look significantly at babalatchi  listen she said  he has drunk much  he has whispered babalatchi  he will sleep heavily tonight  mrs almayer looked doubtful  sometimes the devil of strong gin makes him keep awake and he walks up and down the verandah all night cursing then we stand afar off explained mrs almayer with the fuller knowledge born of twenty odd years of married life  but then he does not hear nor understand and his hand of course has no strength  we do not want him to hear tonight  no assented mrs almayer energetically but in a cautiously subdued voice  if he hears he will kill  babalatchi looked incredulous  hai tuan you may believe me  have i not lived many years with that man  have i not seen death in that mans eyes more than once when i was younger and he guessed at many things  had he been a man of my own people i would not have seen such a look twice but he  with a contemptuous gesture she seemed to fling unutterable scorn on almayers weakminded aversion to sudden bloodshed  if he has the wish but not the strength then what do we fear asked babalatchi after a short silence during which they both listened to almayers loud talk till it subsided into the murmur of general conversation  what do we fear repeated babalatchi again  to keep the daughter whom he loves he would strike into your heart and mine without hesitation said mrs almayer  when the girl is gone he will be like the devil unchained  then you and i had better beware  i am an old man and fear not death answered babalatchi with a mendacious assumption of indifference  but what will you do  i am an old woman and wish to live retorted mrs almayer  she is my daughter also  i shall seek safety at the feet of our rajah speaking in the name of the past when we both were young and he  babalatchi raised his hand  enough  you shall be protected he said soothingly  again the sound of almayers voice was heard and again interrupting their talk they listened to the confused but loud utterance coming in bursts of unequal strength with unexpected pauses and noisy repetitions that made some words and sentences fall clear and distinct on their ears out of the meaningless jumble of excited shoutings emphasised by the thumping of almayers fist upon the table  on the short intervals of silence the high complaining note of tumblers standing close together and vibrating to the shock lingered growing fainter till it leapt up again into tumultuous ringing when a new idea started a new rush of words and brought down the heavy hand again  at last the quarrelsome shouting ceased and the thin plaint of disturbed glass died away into reluctant quietude  babalatchi and mrs almayer had listened curiously their bodies bent and their ears turned towards the passage  at every louder shout they nodded at each other with a ridiculous affectation of scandalised propriety and they remained in the same attitude for some time after the noise had ceased  this is the devil of gin whispered mrs almayer  yes he talks like that sometimes when there is nobody to hear him  what does he say inquired babalatchi eagerly  you ought to understand  i have forgotten their talk  a little i understood  he spoke without any respect of the white ruler in batavia and of protection and said he had been wronged he said that several times  more i did not understand listen  again he speaks  tse tse tse clicked babalatchi trying to appear shocked but with a joyous twinkle of his solitary eye  there will be great trouble between those white men  i will go round now and see  you tell your daughter that there is a sudden and a long journey before her with much glory and splendour at the end  and tell her that dain must go or he must die and that he will not go alone  no he will not go alone slowly repeated mrs almayer with a thoughtful air as she crept into the passage after seeing babalatchi disappear round the corner of the house  the statesman of sambir under the impulse of vivid curiosity made his way quickly to the front of the house but once there he moved slowly and cautiously as he crept step by step up the stairs of the verandah  on the highest step he sat down quietly his feet on the steps below ready for flight should his presence prove unwelcome  he felt pretty safe so the table stood nearly endways to him and he saw almayers back at nina he looked full face and had a side view of both officers but of the four persons sitting at the table only nina and the younger officer noticed his noiseless arrival  the momentary dropping of ninas eyelids acknowledged babalatchis presence she then spoke at once to the young sub who turned towards her with attentive alacrity but her gaze was fastened steadily on her fathers face while almayer was speaking uproariously      disloyalty and unscrupulousness  what have you ever done to make me loyal  you have no grip on this country  i had to take care of myself and when i asked for protection i was met with threats and contempt and had arab slander thrown in my face  i a white man  dont be violent almayer remonstrated the lieutenant i have heard all this already  then why do you talk to me about scruples  i wanted money and i gave powder in exchange  how could i know that some of your wretched men were going to be blown up  scruples  pah  he groped unsteadily amongst the bottles trying one after another grumbling to himself the while  no more wine he muttered discontentedly  you have had enough almayer said the lieutenant as he lighted a cigar  is it not time to deliver to us your prisoner  i take it you have that dain maroola stowed away safely somewhere  still we had better get that business over and then we shall have more drink  come dont look at me like this  almayer was staring with stony eyes his trembling fingers fumbling about his throat  gold he said with difficulty  hem  a hand on the windpipe you know  sure you will excuse  i wanted to saya little gold for a little powder  whats that  i know i know said the lieutenant soothingly  no  you dont know  not one of you knows shouted almayer  the government is a fool i tell you  heaps of gold  i am the man that knows i and another one  but he wont speak  he is  he checked himself with a feeble smile and making an unsuccessful attempt to pat the officer on the shoulder knocked over a couple of empty bottles  personally you are a fine fellow he said very distinctly in a patronising manner  his head nodded drowsily as he sat muttering to himself  the two officers looked at each other helplessly  this wont do said the lieutenant addressing his junior  have the men mustered in the compound here  i must get some sense out of him  hi almayer  wake up man  redeem your word  you gave your word  you gave your word of honour you know  almayer shook off the officers hand with impatience but his illhumour vanished at once and he looked up putting his forefinger to the side of his nose  you are very young there is time for all things he said with an air of great sagacity  the lieutenant turned towards nina who leaning back in her chair watched her father steadily  really i am very much distressed by all this for your sake he exclaimed  i do not know he went on speaking with some embarrassment whether i have any right to ask you anything unless perhaps to withdraw from this painful scene but i feel that i mustfor your fathers goodsuggest that you shouldi mean if you have any influence over him you ought to exert it now to make him keep the promise he gave me before hebefore he got into this state  he observed with discouragement that she seemed not to take any notice of what he said sitting still with halfclosed eyes  i trust he began again  what is the promise you speak of abruptly asked nina leaving her seat and moving towards her father  nothing that is not just and proper  he promised to deliver to us a man who in time of profound peace took the lives of innocent men to escape the punishment he deserved for breaking the law  he planned his mischief on a large scale  it is not his fault if it failed partially  of course you have heard of dain maroola  your father secured him i understand  we know he escaped up this river  perhaps you  and he killed white men interrupted nina  i regret to say they were white  yes two white men lost their lives through that scoundrels freak  two only exclaimed nina  the officer looked at her in amazement  why why  you he stammered confused  there might have been more interrupted nina  and when you get thisthis scoundrel will you go  the lieutenant still speechless bowed his assent  then i would get him for you if i had to seek him in a burning fire she burst out with intense energy  i hate the sight of your white faces  i hate the sound of your gentle voices  that is the way you speak to women dropping sweet words before any pretty face  i have heard your voices before  i hoped to live here without seeing any other white face but this she added in a gentler tone touching lightly her fathers cheek  almayer ceased his mumbling and opened his eyes  he caught hold of his daughters hand and pressed it to his face while nina with the other hand smoothed his rumpled grey hair looking defiantly over her fathers head at the officer who had now regained his composure and returned her look with a cool steady stare  below in front of the verandah they could hear the tramp of seamen mustering there according to orders  the sublieutenant came up the steps while babalatchi stood up uneasily and with finger on lip tried to catch ninas eye  you are a good girl whispered almayer absently dropping his daughters hand  father father she cried bending over him with passionate entreaty see those two men looking at us  send them away  i cannot bear it any more  send them away  do what they want and let them go  she caught sight of babalatchi and ceased speaking suddenly but her foot tapped the floor with rapid beats in a paroxysm of nervous restlessness the two officers stood close together looking on curiously  what has happened  what is the matter whispered the younger man  dont know answered the other under his breath  one is furious and the other is drunk  not so drunk either  queer this  look  almayer had risen holding on to his daughters arm  he hesitated a moment then he let go his hold and lurched halfway across the verandah there he pulled himself together and stood very straight breathing hard and glaring round angrily  are the men ready asked the lieutenant  all ready sir  now mr almayer lead the way said the lieutenant  almayer rested his eyes on him as if he saw him for the first time  two men he said thickly  the effort of speaking seemed to interfere with his equilibrium  he took a quick step to save himself from a fall and remained swaying backwards and forwards  two men he began again speaking with difficulty  two white menmen in uniformhonourable men  i want to saymen of honour  are you  come  none of that said the officer impatiently  let us have that friend of yours  what do you think i am asked almayer fiercely  you are drunk but not so drunk as not to know what you are doing enough of this tomfoolery said the officer sternly or i will have you put under arrest in your own house  arrest laughed almayer discordantly  ha ha ha  arrest  why i have been trying to get out of this infernal place for twenty years and i cant  you hear man  i cant and never shall  never  he ended his words with a sob and walked unsteadily down the stairs when in the courtyard the lieutenant approached him and took him by the arm  the sublieutenant and babalatchi followed close  thats better almayer said the officer encouragingly  where are you going to  there are only planks there  here he went on shaking him slightly do we want the boats  no answered almayer viciously  you want a grave  what  wild again  try to talk sense  grave roared almayer struggling to get himself free  a hole in the ground  dont you understand  you must be drunk  let me go  let go i tell you  he tore away from the officers grasp and reeled towards the planks where the body lay under its white cover then he turned round quickly and faced the semicircle of interested faces  the sun was sinking rapidly throwing long shadows of house and trees over the courtyard but the light lingered yet on the river where the logs went drifting past in midstream looking very distinct and black in the pale red glow  the trunks of the trees in the forest on the east bank were lost in gloom while their highest branches swayed gently in the departing sunlight  the air felt heavy and cold in the breeze expiring in slight puffs that came over the water  almayer shivered as he made an effort to speak and again with an uncertain gesture he seemed to free his throat from the grip of an invisible hand  his bloodshot eyes wandered aimlessly from face to face  there he said at last  are you all there  he is a dangerous man  he dragged at the cover with hasty violence and the body rolled stiffly off the planks and fell at his feet in rigid helplessness  cold perfectly cold said almayer looking round with a mirthless smile  sorry can do no better  and you cant hang him either  as you observe gentlemen he added gravely there is no head and hardly any neck  the last ray of light was snatched away from the treetops the river grew suddenly dark and in the great stillness the murmur of the flowing water seemed to fill the vast expanse of grey shadow that descended upon the land  this is dain went on almayer to the silent group that surrounded him and i have kept my word  first one hope then another and this is my last  nothing is left now  you think there is one dead man here mistake i sure you  i am much more dead  why dont you hang me he suggested suddenly in a friendly tone addressing the lieutenant  i assure assure you it would be a matmatter of form altogaltogether  these last words he muttered to himself and walked zigzaging towards his house  get out he thundered at ali who was approaching timidly with offers of assistance  from afar scared groups of men and women watched his devious progress  he dragged himself up the stairs by the banister and managed to reach a chair into which he fell heavily  he sat for awhile panting with exertion and anger and looking round vaguely for nina then making a threatening gesture towards the compound where he had heard babalatchis voice he overturned the table with his foot in a great crash of smashed crockery  he muttered yet menacingly to himself then his head fell on his breast his eyes closed and with a deep sigh he fell asleep  that nightfor the first time in its historythe peaceful and flourishing settlement of sambir saw the lights shining about almayers folly  these were the lanterns of the boats hung up by the seamen under the verandah where the two officers were holding a court of inquiry into the truth of the story related to them by babalatchi  babalatchi had regained all his importance  he was eloquent and persuasive calling heaven and earth to witness the truth of his statements  there were also other witnesses  mahmat banjer and a good many others underwent a close examination that dragged its weary length far into the evening  a messenger was sent for abdulla who excused himself from coming on the score of his venerable age but sent reshid  mahmat had to produce the bangle and saw with rage and mortification the lieutenant put it in his pocket as one of the proofs of dains death to be sent in with the official report of the mission  babalatchis ring was also impounded for the same purpose but the experienced statesman was resigned to that loss from the very beginning  he did not mind as long as he was sure that the white men believed  he put that question to himself earnestly as he left one of the last when the proceedings came to a close  he was not certain  still if they believed only for a night he would put dain beyond their reach and feel safe himself  he walked away fast looking from time to time over his shoulder in the fear of being followed but he saw and heard nothing  ten oclock said the lieutenant looking at his watch and yawning  i shall hear some of the captains complimentary remarks when we get back miserable business this  do you think all this is true asked the younger man  true  it is just possible  but if it isnt true what can we do  if we had a dozen boats we could patrol the creeks and that wouldnt be much good  that drunken madman was right we havent enough hold on this coast  they do what they like  are our hammocks slung  yes i told the coxswain  strange couple over there said the sub with a wave of his hand towards almayers house  hem  queer certainly  what have you been telling her  i was attending to the father most of the time  i assure you i have been perfectly civil protested the other warmly  all right  dont get excited  she objects to civility then from what i understand  i thought you might have been tender  you know we are on service  well of course  never forget that  coldly civil  thats all  they both laughed a little and not feeling sleepy began to pace the verandah side by side  the moon rose stealthily above the trees and suddenly changed the river into a stream of scintillating silver  the forest came out of the black void and stood sombre and pensive over the sparkling water  the breeze died away into a breathless calm  seamanlike the two officers tramped measuredly up and down without exchanging a word  the loose planks rattled rhythmically under their steps with obstrusive dry sound in the perfect silence of the night  as they were wheeling round again the younger man stood attentive  did you hear that he asked  no said the other  hear what  i thought i heard a cry  ever so faint  seemed a womans voice  in that other house  ah  again  hear it  no said the lieutenant after listening awhile  you young fellows always hear womens voices  if you are going to dream you had better get into your hammock  goodnight  the moon mounted higher and the warm shadows grew smaller and crept away as if hiding before the cold and cruel light     chapter x   it has set at last said nina to her mother pointing towards the hills behind which the sun had sunk  listen mother i am going now to bulangis creek and if i should never return  she interrupted herself and something like doubt dimmed for a moment the fire of suppressed exaltation that had glowed in her eyes and had illuminated the serene impassiveness of her features with a ray of eager life during all that long day of excitementthe day of joy and anxiety of hope and terror of vague grief and indistinct delight  while the sun shone with that dazzling light in which her love was born and grew till it possessed her whole being she was kept firm in her unwavering resolve by the mysterious whisperings of desire which filled her heart with impatient longing for the darkness that would mean the end of danger and strife the beginning of happiness the fulfilling of love the completeness of life  it had set at last  the short tropical twilight went out before she could draw the long breath of relief and now the sudden darkness seemed to be full of menacing voices calling upon her to rush headlong into the unknown to be true to her own impulses to give herself up to the passion she had evoked and shared  he was waiting  in the solitude of the secluded clearing in the vast silence of the forest he was waiting alone a fugitive in fear of his life  indifferent to his danger he was waiting for her  it was for her only that he had come and now as the time approached when he should have his reward she asked herself with dismay what meant that chilling doubt of her own will and of her own desire  with an effort she shook off the fear of the passing weakness  he should have his reward  her womans love and her womans honour overcame the faltering distrust of that unknown future waiting for her in the darkness of the river  no you will not return muttered mrs almayer prophetically  without you he will not go and if he remains here  she waved her hand towards the lights of almayers folly and the unfinished sentence died out in a threatening murmur  the two women had met behind the house and now were walking slowly together towards the creek where all the canoes were moored  arrived at the fringe of bushes they stopped by a common impulse and mrs almayer laying her hand on her daughters arm tried in vain to look close into the girls averted face  when she attempted to speak her first words were lost in a stifled sob that sounded strangely coming from that woman who of all human passions seemed to know only those of anger and hate  you are going away to be a great ranee she said at last in a voice that was steady enough now and if you be wise you shall have much power that will endure many days and even last into your old age  what have i been  a slave all my life and i have cooked rice for a man who had no courage and no wisdom  hai  i even i was given in gift by a chief and a warrior to a man that was neither  hai  hai  she wailed to herself softly lamenting the lost possibilities of murder and mischief that could have fallen to her lot had she been mated with a congenial spirit  nina bent down over mrs almayers slight form and scanned attentively under the stars that had rushed out on the black sky and now hung breathless over that strange parting her mothers shrivelled features and looked close into the sunken eyes that could see into her own dark future by the light of a long and a painful experience again she felt herself fascinated as of old by her mothers exalted mood and by the oracular certainty of expression which together with her fits of violence had contributed not a little to the reputation for witchcraft she enjoyed in the settlement        i was a slave and you shall be a queen went on mrs almayer looking straight before her but remember mens strength and their weakness tremble before his anger so that he may see your fear in the light of day but in your heart you may laugh for after sunset he is your slave  a slave  he  the master of life  you do not know him mother  mrs almayer condescended to laugh contemptuously  you speak like a fool of a white woman she exclaimed  what do you know of mens anger and of mens love  have you watched the sleep of men weary of dealing death  have you felt about you the strong arm that could drive a kriss deep into a beating heart  yah you are a white woman and ought to pray to a womangod  why do you say this  i have listened to your words so long that i have forgotten my old life  if i was white would i stand here ready to go mother i shall return to the house and look once more at my fathers face  no said mrs almayer violently  no he sleeps now the sleep of gin and if you went back he might awake and see you  no he shall never see you  when the terrible old man took you away from me when you were little you remember  it was such a long time ago murmured nina  i remember went on mrs almayer fiercely  i wanted to look at your face again  he said no  i heard you cry and jumped into the river  you were his daughter then you are my daughter now  never shall you go back to that house you shall never cross this courtyard again  no no  her voice rose almost to a shout  on the other side of the creek there was a rustle in the long grass  the two women heard it and listened for a while in startled silence  i shall go said nina in a cautious but intense whisper  what is your hate or your revenge to me  she moved towards the house mrs almayer clinging to her and trying to pull her back  stop you shall not go she gasped  nina pushed away her mother impatiently and gathered up her skirts for a quick run but mrs almayer ran forward and turned round facing her daughter with outstretched arms  if you move another step she exclaimed breathing quickly i shall cry out  do you see those lights in the big house  there sit two white men angry because they cannot have the blood of the man you love  and in those dark houses she continued more calmly as she pointed towards the settlement my voice could wake up men that would lead the orang blanda soldiers to him who is waitingfor you  she could not see her daughters face but the white figure before her stood silent and irresolute in the darkness  mrs almayer pursued her advantage  give up your old life  forget she said in entreating tones  forget that you ever looked at a white face forget their words forget their thoughts  they speak lies  and they think lies because they despise us that are better than they are but not so strong  forget their friendship and their contempt forget their many gods  girl why do you want to remember the past when there is a warrior and a chief ready to give many liveshis own lifefor one of your smiles  while she spoke she pushed gently her daughter towards the canoes hiding her own fear anxiety and doubt under the flood of passionate words that left nina no time to think and no opportunity to protest even if she had wished it  but she did not wish it now  at the bottom of that passing desire to look again at her fathers face there was no strong affection she felt no scruples and no remorse at leaving suddenly that man whose sentiment towards herself she could not understand she could not even see  there was only an instinctive clinging to old life to old habits to old faces that fear of finality which lurks in every human breast and prevents so many heroisms and so many crimes  for years she had stood between her mother and her father the one so strong in her weakness the other so weak where he could have been strong  between those two beings so dissimilar so antagonistic she stood with mute heart wondering and angry at the fact of her own existence  it seemed so unreasonable so humiliating to be flung there in that settlement and to see the days rush by into the past without a hope a desire or an aim that would justify the life she had to endure in evergrowing weariness  she had little belief and no sympathy for her fathers dreams but the savage ravings of her mother chanced to strike a responsive chord deep down somewhere in her despairing heart and she dreamed dreams of her own with the persistent absorption of a captive thinking of liberty within the walls of his prison cell  with the coming of dain she found the road to freedom by obeying the voice of the newborn impulses and with surprised joy she thought she could read in his eyes the answer to all the questionings of her heart  she understood now the reason and the aim of life and in the triumphant unveiling of that mystery she threw away disdainfully her past with its sad thoughts its bitter feelings and its faint affections now withered and dead in contact with her fierce passion  mrs almayer unmoored ninas own canoe and straightening herself painfully stood painter in hand looking at her daughter  quick she said get away before the moon rises while the river is dark  i am afraid of abdullas slaves  the wretches prowl in the night often and might see and follow you  there are two paddles in the canoe  nina approached her mother and hesitatingly touched lightly with her lips the wrinkled forehead  mrs almayer snorted contemptuously in protest against that tenderness which she nevertheless feared could be contagious  shall i ever see you again mother murmured nina  no said mrs almayer after a short silence  why should you return here where it is my fate to die  you will live far away in splendour and might  when i hear of white men driven from the islands then i shall know that you are alive and that you remember my words  i shall always remember returned nina earnestly but where is my power and what can i do  do not let him look too long in your eyes nor lay his head on your knees without reminding him that men should fight before they rest  and if he lingers give him his kriss yourself and bid him go as the wife of a mighty prince should do when the enemies are near  let him slay the white men that come to us to trade with prayers on their lips and loaded guns in their hands  ahshe ended with a sighthey are on every sea and on every shore and they are very many  she swung the bow of the canoe towards the river but did not let go the gunwale keeping her hand on it in irresolute thoughtfulness  nina put the point of the paddle against the bank ready to shove off into the stream  what is it mother she asked in a low voice  do you hear anything  no said mrs almayer absently  listen nina she continued abruptly after a slight pause in after years there will be other women  a stifled cry in the boat interrupted her and the paddle rattled in the canoe as it slipped from ninas hands which she put out in a protesting gesture  mrs almayer fell on her knees on the bank and leaned over the gunwale so as to bring her own face close to her daughters  there will be other women she repeated firmly i tell you that because you are half white and may forget that he is a great chief and that such things must be  hide your anger and do not let him see on your face the pain that will eat your heart  meet him with joy in your eyes and wisdom on your lips for to you he will turn in sadness or in doubt  as long as he looks upon many women your power will last but should there be one one only with whom he seems to forget you then  i could not live exclaimed nina covering her face with both her hands  do not speak so mother it could not be  then went on mrs almayer steadily to that woman nina show no mercy  she moved the canoe down towards the stream by the gunwale and gripped it with both her hands the bow pointing into the river  are you crying she asked sternly of her daughter who sat still with covered face  arise and take your paddle for he has waited long enough  and remember nina no mercy and if you must strike strike with a steady hand  she put out all her strength and swinging her body over the water shot the light craft far into the stream  when she recovered herself from the effort she tried vainly to catch a glimpse of the canoe that seemed to have dissolved suddenly into the white mist trailing over the heated waters of the pantai  after listening for a while intently on her knees mrs almayer rose with a deep sigh while two tears wandered slowly down her withered cheeks  she wiped them off quickly with a wisp of her grey hair as if ashamed of herself but could not stifle another loud sigh for her heart was heavy and she suffered much being unused to tender emotions  this time she fancied she had heard a faint noise like the echo of her own sigh and she stopped straining her ears to catch the slightest sound and peering apprehensively towards the bushes near her  who is there she asked in an unsteady voice while her imagination peopled the solitude of the riverside with ghostlike forms  who is there she repeated faintly  there was no answer only the voice of the river murmuring in sad monotone behind the white veil seemed to swell louder for a moment to die away again in a soft whisper of eddies washing against the bank  mrs almayer shook her head as if in answer to her own thoughts and walked quickly away from the bushes looking to the right and left watchfully  she went straight towards the cookingshed observing that the embers of the fire there glowed more brightly than usual as if somebody had been adding fresh fuel to the fires during the evening  as she approached babalatchi who had been squatting in the warm glow rose and met her in the shadow outside  is she gone asked the anxious statesman hastily  yes answered mrs almayer  what are the white men doing  when did you leave them  they are sleeping now i think  may they never wake exclaimed babalatchi fervently  oh but they are devils and made much talk and trouble over that carcase  the chief threatened me twice with his hand and said he would have me tied up to a tree  tie me up to a tree  me he repeated striking his breast violently  mrs almayer laughed tauntingly  and you salaamed and asked for mercy  men with arms by their side acted otherwise when i was young  and where are they the men of your youth  you mad woman retorted babalatchi angrily  killed by the dutch  aha  but i shall live to deceive them  a man knows when to fight and when to tell peaceful lies you would know that if you were not a woman  but mrs almayer did not seem to hear him  with bent body and outstretched arm she appeared to be listening to some noise behind the shed  there are strange sounds she whispered with evident alarm  i have heard in the air the sounds of grief as of a sigh and weeping  that was by the riverside  and now again i heard  where asked babalatchi in an altered voice  what did you hear  close here  it was like a breath long drawn  i wish i had burnt the paper over the body before it was buried  yes assented babalatchi  but the white men had him thrown into a hole at once  you know he found his death on the river he added cheerfully and his ghost may hail the canoes but would leave the land alone  mrs almayer who had been craning her neck to look round the corner of the shed drew back her head  there is nobody there she said reassured  is it not time for the rajah warcanoe to go to the clearing  i have been waiting for it here for i myself must go explained babalatchi  i think i will go over and see what makes them late  when will you come  the rajah gives you refuge  i shall paddle over before the break of day  i cannot leave my dollars behind muttered mrs almayer  they separated  babalatchi crossed the courtyard towards the creek to get his canoe and mrs almayer walked slowly to the house ascended the plankway and passing through the back verandah entered the passage leading to the front of the house but before going in she turned in the doorway and looked back at the empty and silent courtyard now lit up by the rays of the rising moon  no sooner she had disappeared however than a vague shape flitted out from amongst the stalks of the banana plantation darted over the moonlit space and fell in the darkness at the foot of the verandah  it might have been the shadow of a driving cloud so noiseless and rapid was its passage but for the trail of disturbed grass whose feathery heads trembled and swayed for a long time in the moonlight before they rested motionless and gleaming like a design of silver sprays embroidered on a sombre background  mrs almayer lighted the cocoanut lamp and lifting cautiously the red curtain gazed upon her husband shading the light with her hand  almayer huddled up in the chair one of his arms hanging down the other thrown across the lower part of his face as if to ward off an invisible enemy his legs stretched straight out slept heavily unconscious of the unfriendly eyes that looked upon him in disparaging criticism  at his feet lay the overturned table amongst a wreck of crockery and broken bottles  the appearance as of traces left by a desperate struggle was accentuated by the chairs which seemed to have been scattered violently all over the place and now lay about the verandah with a lamentable aspect of inebriety in their helpless attitudes  only ninas big rocking chair standing black and motionless on its high runners towered above the chaos of demoralised furniture unflinchingly dignified and patient waiting for its burden  with a last scornful look towards the sleeper mrs almayer passed behind the curtain into her own room  a couple of bats encouraged by the darkness and the peaceful state of affairs resumed their silent and oblique gambols above almayers head and for a long time the profound quiet of the house was unbroken save for the deep breathing of the sleeping man and the faint tinkle of silver in the hands of the woman preparing for flight  in the increasing light of the moon that had risen now above the night mist the objects on the verandah came out strongly outlined in black splashes of shadow with all the uncompromising ugliness of their disorder and a caricature of the sleeping almayer appeared on the dirty whitewash of the wall behind him in a grotesquely exaggerated detail of attitude and feature enlarged to a heroic size  the discontented bats departed in quest of darker places and a lizard came out in short nervous rushes and pleased with the white tablecloth stopped on it in breathless immobility that would have suggested sudden death had it not been for the melodious call he exchanged with a less adventurous friend hiding amongst the lumber in the courtyard  then the boards in the passage creaked the lizard vanished and almayer stirred uneasily with a sigh slowly out of the senseless annihilation of drunken sleep he was returning through the land of dreams to waking consciousness  almayers head rolled from shoulder to shoulder in the oppression of his dream the heavens had descended upon him like a heavy mantle and trailed in starred folds far under him  stars above stars all round him and from the stars under his feet rose a whisper full of entreaties and tears and sorrowful faces flitted amongst the clusters of light filling the infinite space below  how escape from the importunity of lamentable cries and from the look of staring sad eyes in the faces which pressed round him till he gasped for breath under the crushing weight of worlds that hung over his aching shoulders  get away  but how  if he attempted to move he would step off into nothing and perish in the crashing fall of that universe of which he was the only support and what were the voices saying  urging him to move  why  move to destruction  not likely  the absurdity of the thing filled him with indignation  he got a firmer foothold and stiffened his muscles in heroic resolve to carry his burden to all eternity  and ages passed in the superhuman labour amidst the rush of circling worlds in the plaintive murmur of sorrowful voices urging him to desist before it was too latetill the mysterious power that had laid upon him the giant task seemed at last to seek his destruction  with terror he felt an irresistible hand shaking him by the shoulder while the chorus of voices swelled louder into an agonised prayer to go go before it is too late he felt himself slipping losing his balance as something dragged at his legs and he fell  with a faint cry he glided out of the anguish of perishing creation into an imperfect waking that seemed to be still under the spell of his dream  what  what he murmured sleepily without moving or opening his eyes his head still felt heavy and he had not the courage to raise his eyelids  in his ears there still lingered the sound of entreating whisperam i awakewhy do i hear the voices he argued to himself hazilyi cannot get rid of the horrible nightmare yeti have been very drunkwhat is that shaking me  i am dreaming yeti must open my eyes and be done with it  i am only half awake it is evident  he made an effort to shake off his stupor and saw a face close to his glaring at him with staring eyeballs  he closed his eyes again in amazed horror and sat up straight in the chair trembling in every limb  what was this apparitionhis own fancy no doubthis nerves had been much tried the day beforeand then the drink  he would not see it again if he had the courage to lookhe would look directlyget a little steadier firstsonow  he looked  the figure of a woman standing in the steely light her hands stretched forth in a suppliant gesture confronted him from the faroff end of the verandah and in the space between him and the obstinate phantom floated the murmur of words that fell on his ears in a jumble of torturing sentences the meaning of which escaped the utmost efforts of his brain  who spoke the malay words  who ran away  why too lateand too late for what  what meant those words of hate and love mixed so strangely together the everrecurring names falling on his ears again and againnina dain dain nina  dain was dead and nina was sleeping unaware of the terrible experience through which he was now passing  was he going to be tormented for ever sleeping or waking and have no peace either night or day  what was the meaning of this  he shouted the last words aloud  the shadowy woman seemed to shrink and recede a little from him towards the doorway and there was a shriek exasperated by the incomprehensible nature of his torment almayer made a rush upon the apparition which eluded his grasp and he brought up heavily against the wall  quick as lightning he turned round and pursued fiercely the mysterious figure fleeing from him with piercing shrieks that were like fuel to the flames of his anger  over the furniture round the overturned table and now he had it cornered behind ninas chair  to the left to the right they dodged the chair rocking madly between them she sending out shriek after shriek at every feint and he growling meaningless curses through his hard set teeth  oh the fiendish noise that split his head and seemed to choke his breathit would kill himit must be stopped  an insane desire to crush that yelling thing induced him to cast himself recklessly over the chair with a desperate grab and they came down together in a cloud of dust amongst the splintered wood  the last shriek died out under him in a faint gurgle and he had secured the relief of absolute silence  he looked at the womans face under him  a real woman  he knew her  by all that is wonderful  taminah  he jumped up ashamed of his fury and stood perplexed wiping his forehead  the girl struggled to a kneeling posture and embraced his legs in a frenzied prayer for mercy  dont be afraid he said raising her  i shall not hurt you  why do you come to my house in the night  and if you had to come why not go behind the curtain where the women sleep  the place behind the curtain is empty gasped taminah catching her breath between the words  there are no women in your house any more tuan  i saw the old mem go away before i tried to wake you  i did not want your women i wanted you  old mem repeated almayer  do you mean my wife  she nodded her head  but of my daughter you are not afraid said almayer  have you not heard me she exclaimed  have i not spoken for a long time when you lay there with eyes half open  she is gone too  i was asleep  can you not tell when a man is sleeping and when awake  sometimes answered taminah in a low voice sometimes the spirit lingers close to a sleeping body and may hear  i spoke a long time before i touched you and i spoke softly for fear it would depart at a sudden noise and leave you sleeping for ever  i took you by the shoulder only when you began to mutter words i could not understand  have you not heard then and do you know nothing  nothing of what you said  what is it  tell again if you want me to know  he took her by the shoulder and led her unresisting to the front of the verandah into a stronger light  she wrung her hands with such an appearance of grief that he began to be alarmed  speak he said  you made noise enough to wake even dead men  and yet nobody living came he added to himself in an uneasy whisper  are you mute  speak he repeated  in a rush of words which broke out after a short struggle from her trembling lips she told him the tale of ninas love and her own jealousy several times he looked angrily into her face and told her to be silent but he could not stop the sounds that seemed to him to run out in a hot stream swirl about his feet and rise in scalding waves about him higher higher drowning his heart touching his lips with a feel of molten lead blotting out his sight in scorching vapour closing over his head merciless and deadly  when she spoke of the deception as to dains death of which he had been the victim only that day he glanced again at her with terrible eyes and made her falter for a second but he turned away directly and his face suddenly lost all expression in a stony stare far away over the river  ah the river  his old friend and his old enemy speaking always with the same voice as he runs from year to year bringing fortune or disappointment happiness or pain upon the same varying but unchanged surface of glancing currents and swirling eddies for many years he had listened to the passionless and soothing murmur that sometimes was the song of hope at times the song of triumph of encouragement more often the whisper of consolation that spoke of better days to come  for so many years  so many years  and now to the accompaniment of that murmur he listened to the slow and painful beating of his heart  he listened attentively wondering at the regularity of its beats  he began to count mechanically  one two  why count  at the next beat it must stop  no heart could suffer so and beat so steadily for long  those regular strokes as of a muffled hammer that rang in his ears must stop soon  still beating unceasing and cruel  no man can bear this and is this the last or will the next one be the lasthow much longer  o god how much longer  his hand weighed heavier unconsciously on the girls shoulder and she spoke the last words of her story crouching at his feet with tears of pain and shame and anger  was her revenge to fail her  this white man was like a senseless stone  too late  too late  and you saw her go almayers voice sounded harshly above her head  did i not tell you she sobbed trying to wriggle gently out from under his grip  did i not tell you that i saw the witchwoman push the canoe i lay hidden in the grass and heard all the words  she that we used to call the white mem wanted to return to look at your face but the witchwoman forbade her and  she sank lower yet on her elbow turning half round under the downward push of the heavy hand her face lifted up to him with spiteful eyes  and she obeyed she shouted out in a halflaugh halfcry of pain  let me go tuan  why are you angry with me  hasten or you shall be too late to show your anger to the deceitful woman  almayer dragged her up to her feet and looked close into her face while she struggled turning her head away from his wild stare  who sent you here to torment me he asked violently  i do not believe you  you lie  he straightened his arm suddenly and flung her across the verandah towards the doorway where she lay immobile and silent as if she had left her life in his grasp a dark heap without a sound or a stir  oh  nina whispered almayer in a voice in which reproach and love spoke together in pained tenderness  oh  nina  i do not believe  a light draught from the river ran over the courtyard in a wave of bowing grass and entering the verandah touched almayers forehead with its cool breath in a caress of infinite pity  the curtain in the womens doorway blew out and instantly collapsed with startling helplessness  he stared at the fluttering stuff  nina cried almayer  where are you nina  the wind passed out of the empty house in a tremulous sigh and all was still  almayer hid his face in his hands as if to shut out a loathsome sight when hearing a slight rustle he uncovered his eyes the dark heap by the door was gone     chapter xi   in the middle of a shadowless square of moonlight shining on a smooth and level expanse of young riceshoots a little shelterhut perched on high posts the pile of brushwood near by and the glowing embers of a fire with a man stretched before it seemed very small and as if lost in the pale green iridescence reflected from the ground  on three sides of the clearing appearing very far away in the deceptive light the big trees of the forest lashed together with manifold bonds by a mass of tangled creepers looked down at the growing young life at their feet with the sombre resignation of giants that had lost faith in their strength  and in the midst of them the merciless creepers clung to the big trunks in cablelike coils leaped from tree to tree hung in thorny festoons from the lower boughs and sending slender tendrils on high to seek out the smallest branches carried death to their victims in an exulting riot of silent destruction  on the fourth side following the curve of the bank of that branch of the pantai that formed the only access to the clearing ran a black line of young trees bushes and thick second growth unbroken save for a small gap chopped out in one place  at that gap began the narrow footpath leading from the waters edge to the grassbuilt shelter used by the night watchers when the ripening crop had to be protected from the wild pigs  the pathway ended at the foot of the piles on which the hut was built in a circular space covered with ashes and bits of burnt wood  in the middle of that space by the dim fire lay dain  he turned over on his side with an impatient sigh and pillowing his head on his bent arm lay quietly with his face to the dying fire  the glowing embers shone redly in a small circle throwing a gleam into his wideopen eyes and at every deep breath the fine white ash of bygone fires rose in a light cloud before his parted lips and danced away from the warm glow into the moonbeams pouring down upon bulangis clearing his body was weary with the exertion of the past few days his mind more weary still with the strain of solitary waiting for his fate  never before had he felt so helpless  he had heard the report of the gun fired on board the launch and he knew that his life was in untrustworthy hands and that his enemies were very near  during the slow hours of the afternoon he roamed about on the edge of the forest or hiding in the bushes watched the creek with unquiet eyes for some sign of danger  he feared not death yet he desired ardently to live for life to him was nina  she had promised to come to follow him to share his danger and his splendour  but with her by his side he cared not for danger and without her there could be no splendour and no joy in existence  crouching in his shady hidingplace he closed his eyes trying to evoke the gracious and charming image of the white figure that for him was the beginning and the end of life  with eyes shut tight his teeth hard set he tried in a great effort of passionate will to keep his hold on that vision of supreme delight  in vain  his heart grew heavy as the figure of nina faded away to be replaced by another vision this timea vision of armed men of angry faces of glittering armsand he seemed to hear the hum of excited and triumphant voices as they discovered him in his hidingplace  startled by the vividness of his fancy he would open his eyes and leaping out into the sunlight resume his aimless wanderings around the clearing  as he skirted in his weary march the edge of the forest he glanced now and then into its dark shade so enticing in its deceptive appearance of coolness so repellent with its unrelieved gloom where lay entombed and rotting countless generations of trees and where their successors stood as if mourning in dark green foliage immense and helpless awaiting their turn  only the parasites seemed to live there in a sinuous rush upwards into the air and sunshine feeding on the dead and the dying alike and crowning their victims with pink and blue flowers that gleamed amongst the boughs incongruous and cruel like a strident and mocking note in the solemn harmony of the doomed trees  a man could hide there thought dain as he approached a place where the creepers had been torn and hacked into an archway that might have been the beginning of a path  as he bent down to look through he heard angry grunting and a sounder of wild pig crashed away in the undergrowth  an acrid smell of damp earth and of decaying leaves took him by the throat and he drew back with a scared face as if he had been touched by the breath of death itself  the very air seemed dead in thereheavy and stagnating poisoned with the corruption of countless ages  he went on staggering on his way urged by the nervous restlessness that made him feel tired yet caused him to loathe the very idea of immobility and repose  was he a wild man to hide in the woods and perhaps be killed therein the darknesswhere there was no room to breathe  he would wait for his enemies in the sunlight where he could see the sky and feel the breeze  he knew how a malay chief should die  the sombre and desperate fury that peculiar inheritance of his race took possession of him and he glared savagely across the clearing towards the gap in the bushes by the riverside  they would come from there  in imagination he saw them now  he saw the bearded faces and the white jackets of the officers the light on the levelled barrels of the rifles  what is the bravery of the greatest warrior before the firearms in the hand of a slave  he would walk toward them with a smiling face with his hands held out in a sign of submission till he was very near them  he would speak friendly wordscome nearer yetyet nearerso near that they could touch him with their hands and stretch them out to make him a captive  that would be the time with a shout and a leap he would be in the midst of them kriss in hand killing killing killing and would die with the shouts of his enemies in his ears their warm blood spurting before his eyes  carried away by his excitement he snatched the kriss hidden in his sarong and drawing a long breath rushed forward struck at the empty air and fell on his face  he lay as if stunned in the sudden reaction from his exaltation thinking that even if he died thus gloriously it would have to be before he saw nina  better so  if he saw her again he felt that death would be too terrible  with horror he the descendant of rajahs and of conquerors had to face the doubt of his own bravery  his desire of life tormented him in a paroxysm of agonising remorse  he had not the courage to stir a limb  he had lost faith in himself and there was nothing else in him of what makes a man  the suffering remained for it is ordered that it should abide in the human body even to the last breath and fear remained  dimly he could look into the depths of his passionate love see its strength and its weakness and felt afraid  the sun went down slowly  the shadow of the western forest marched over the clearing covered the mans scorched shoulders with its cool mantle and went on hurriedly to mingle with the shadows of other forests on the eastern side  the sun lingered for a while amongst the light tracery of the higher branches as if in friendly reluctance to abandon the body stretched in the green paddyfield  then dain revived by the cool of the evening breeze sat up and stared round him  as he did so the sun dipped sharply as if ashamed of being detected in a sympathising attitude and the clearing which during the day was all light became suddenly all darkness where the fire gleamed like an eye  dain walked slowly towards the creek and divesting himself of his torn sarong his only garment entered the water cautiously  he had had nothing to eat that day and had not dared show himself in daylight by the waterside to drink  now as he swam silently he swallowed a few mouthfuls of water that lapped about his lips  this did him good and he walked with greater confidence in himself and others as he returned towards the fire had he been betrayed by lakamba all would have been over by this  he made up a big blaze and while it lasted dried himself and then lay down by the embers  he could not sleep but he felt a great numbness in all his limbs  his restlessness was gone and he was content to lay still measuring the time by watching the stars that rose in endless succession above the forests while the slight puffs of wind under the cloudless sky seemed to fan their twinkle into a greater brightness  dreamily he assured himself over and over again that she would come till the certitude crept into his heart and filled him with a great peace  yes when the next day broke they would be together on the great blue sea that was like lifeaway from the forests that were like death  he murmured the name of nina into the silent space with a tender smile this seemed to break the spell of stillness and far away by the creek a frog croaked loudly as if in answer  a chorus of loud roars and plaintive calls rose from the mud along the line of bushes  he laughed heartily doubtless it was their lovesong  he felt affectionate towards the frogs and listened pleased with the noisy life near him  when the moon peeped above the trees he felt the old impatience and the old restlessness steal over him  why was she so late  true it was a long way to come with a single paddle  with what skill and what endurance could those small hands manage a heavy paddle  it was very wonderfulsuch small hands such soft little palms that knew how to touch his cheek with a feel lighter than the fanning of a butterflys wing  wonderful  he lost himself lovingly in the contemplation of this tremendous mystery and when he looked at the moon again it had risen a hands breadth above the trees  would she come  he forced himself to lay still overcoming the impulse to rise and rush round the clearing again  he turned this way and that at last quivering with the effort he lay on his back and saw her face among the stars looking down on him  the croaking of frogs suddenly ceased  with the watchfulness of a hunted man dain sat up listening anxiously and heard several splashes in the water as the frogs took rapid headers into the creek  he knew that they had been alarmed by something and stood up suspicious and attentive  a slight grating noise then the dry sound as of two pieces of wood struck against each other  somebody was about to land  he took up an armful of brushwood and without taking his eyes from the path held it over the embers of his fire  he waited undecided and saw something gleam amongst the bushes then a white figure came out of the shadows and seemed to float towards him in the pale light  his heart gave a great leap and stood still then went on shaking his frame in furious beats  he dropped the brushwood upon the glowing coals and had an impression of shouting her nameof rushing to meet her yet he emitted no sound he stirred not an inch but he stood silent and motionless like chiselled bronze under the moonlight that streamed over his naked shoulders  as he stood still fighting with his breath as if bereft of his senses by the intensity of his delight she walked up to him with quick resolute steps and with the appearance of one about to leap from a dangerous height threw both her arms round his neck with a sudden gesture  a small blue gleam crept amongst the dry branches and the crackling of reviving fire was the only sound as they faced each other in the speechless emotion of that meeting then the dry fuel caught at once and a bright hot flame shot upwards in a blaze as high as their heads and in its light they saw each others eyes  neither of them spoke  he was regaining his senses in a slight tremor that ran upwards along his rigid body and hung about his trembling lips she drew back her head and fastened her eyes on his in one of those long looks that are a womans most terrible weapon a look that is more stirring than the closest touch and more dangerous than the thrust of a dagger because it also whips the soul out of the body but leaves the body alive and helpless to be swayed here and there by the capricious tempests of passion and desire a look that enwraps the whole body and that penetrates into the innermost recesses of the being bringing terrible defeat in the delirious uplifting of accomplished conquest  it has the same meaning for the man of the forests and the sea as for the man threading the paths of the more dangerous wilderness of houses and streets  men that had felt in their breasts the awful exultation such a look awakens become mere things of todaywhich is paradise forget yesterdaywhich was suffering care not for tomorrowwhich may be perdition  they wish to live under that look for ever  it is the look of womans surrender  he understood and as if suddenly released from his invisible bonds fell at her feet with a shout of joy and embracing her knees hid his head in the folds of her dress murmuring disjointed words of gratitude and love  never before had he felt so proud as now when at the feet of that woman that half belonged to his enemies  her fingers played with his hair in an absentminded caress as she stood absorbed in thought  the thing was done  her mother was right  the man was her slave  as she glanced down at his kneeling form she felt a great pitying tenderness for that man she was used to calleven in her thoughtsthe master of life she lifted her eyes and looked sadly at the southern heavens under which lay the path of their livesher own and that mans at her feet  did he not say himself is that she was the light of his life  she would be his light and his wisdom she would be his greatness and his strength yet hidden from the eyes of all men she would be above all his only and lasting weakness  a very woman  in the sublime vanity of her kind she was thinking already of moulding a god from the clay at her feet  a god for others to worship  she was content to see him as he was now and to feel him quiver at the slightest touch of her light fingers  and while her eyes looked sadly at the southern stars a faint smile seemed to be playing about her firm lips  who can tell in the fitful light of a camp fire  it might have been a smile of triumph or of conscious power or of tender pity or perhaps of love  she spoke softly to him and he rose to his feet putting his arm round her in quiet consciousness of his ownership she laid her head on his shoulder with a sense of defiance to all the world in the encircling protection of that arm  he was hers with all his qualities and all his faults  his strength and his courage his recklessness and his daring his simple wisdom and his savage cunningall were hers  as they passed together out of the red light of the fire into the silver shower of rays that fell upon the clearing he bent his head over her face and she saw in his eyes the dreamy intoxication of boundless felicity from the close touch of her slight figure clasped to his side  with a rhythmical swing of their bodies they walked through the light towards the outlying shadows of the forests that seemed to guard their happiness in solemn immobility  their forms melted in the play of light and shadow at the foot of the big trees but the murmur of tender words lingered over the empty clearing grew faint and died out  a sigh as of immense sorrow passed over the land in the last effort of the dying breeze and in the deep silence which succeeded the earth and the heavens were suddenly hushed up in the mournful contemplation of human love and human blindness  they walked slowly back to the fire  he made for her a seat out of the dry branches and throwing himself down at her feet lay his head in her lap and gave himself up to the dreamy delight of the passing hour  their voices rose and fell tender or animated as they spoke of their love and of their future  she with a few skilful words spoken from time to time guided his thoughts and he let his happiness flow in a stream of talk passionate and tender grave or menacing according to the mood which she evoked  he spoke to her of his own island where the gloomy forests and the muddy rivers were unknown  he spoke of its terraced fields of the murmuring clear rills of sparkling water that flowed down the sides of great mountains bringing life to the land and joy to its tillers  and he spoke also of the mountain peak that rising lonely above the belt of trees knew the secrets of the passing clouds and was the dwellingplace of the mysterious spirit of his race of the guardian genius of his house  he spoke of vast horizons swept by fierce winds that whistled high above the summits of burning mountains  he spoke of his forefathers that conquered ages ago the island of which he was to be the future ruler  and then as in her interest she brought her face nearer to his he touching lightly the thick tresses of her long hair felt a sudden impulse to speak to her of the sea he loved so well and he told her of its neverceasing voice to which he had listened as a child wondering at its hidden meaning that no living man has penetrated yet of its enchanting glitter of its senseless and capricious fury how its surface was for ever changing and yet always enticing while its depths were for ever the same cold and cruel and full of the wisdom of destroyed life he told her how it held men slaves of its charm for a lifetime and then regardless of their devotion swallowed them up angry at their fear of its mystery which it would never disclose not even to those that loved it most  while he talked ninas head had been gradually sinking lower and her face almost touched his now  her hair was over his eyes her breath was on his forehead her arms were about his body  no two beings could be closer to each other yet she guessed rather than understood the meaning of his last words that came out after a slight hesitation in a faint murmur dying out imperceptibly into a profound and significant silence  the sea o nina is like a womans heart  she closed his lips with a sudden kiss and answered in a steady voice  but to the men that have no fear o master of my life the sea is ever true  over their heads a film of dark threadlike clouds looking like immense cobwebs drifting under the stars darkened the sky with the presage of the coming thunderstorm  from the invisible hills the first distant rumble of thunder came in a prolonged roll which after tossing about from hill to hill lost itself in the forests of the pantai  dain and nina stood up and the former looked at the sky uneasily  it is time for babalatchi to be here he said  the night is more than half gone  our road is long and a bullet travels quicker than the best canoe  he will be here before the moon is hidden behind the clouds said nina i heard a splash in the water she added  did you hear it too  alligator answered dain shortly with a careless glance towards the creek  the darker the night he continued the shorter will be our road for then we could keep in the current of the main stream but if it is lighteven no more than nowwe must follow the small channels of sleeping water with nothing to help our paddles  dain interposed nina earnestly it was no alligator  i heard the bushes rustling near the landingplace  yes said dain after listening awhile  it cannot be babalatchi who would come in a big war canoe and openly  those that are coming whoever they are do not wish to make much noise  but you have heard and now i can see he went on quickly  it is but one man  stand behind me nina  if he is a friend he is welcome if he is an enemy you shall see him die  he laid his hand on his kriss and awaited the approach of his unexpected visitor  the fire was burning very low and small cloudsprecursors of the stormcrossed the face of the moon in rapid succession and their flying shadows darkened the clearing  he could not make out who the man might be but he felt uneasy at the steady advance of the tall figure walking on the path with a heavy tread and hailed it with a command to stop  the man stopped at some little distance and dain expected him to speak but all he could hear was his deep breathing  through a break in the flying clouds a sudden and fleeting brightness descended upon the clearing  before the darkness closed in again dain saw a hand holding some glittering object extended towards him heard ninas cry of father and in an instant the girl was between him and almayers revolver  ninas loud cry woke up the echoes of the sleeping woods and the three stood still as if waiting for the return of silence before they would give expression to their various feelings  at the appearance of nina almayers arm fell by his side and he made a step forward  dain pushed the girl gently aside  am i a wild beast that you should try to kill me suddenly and in the dark tuan almayer said dain breaking the strained silence  throw some brushwood on the fire he went on speaking to nina while i watch my white friend lest harm should come to you or to me o delight of my heart  almayer ground his teeth and raised his arm again  with a quick bound dain was at his side there was a short scuffle during which one chamber of the revolver went off harmlessly then the weapon wrenched out of almayers hand whirled through the air and fell in the bushes  the two men stood close together breathing hard  the replenished fire threw out an unsteady circle of light and shone on the terrified face of nina who looked at them with outstretched hands  dain she cried out warningly dain  he waved his hand towards her in a reassuring gesture and turning to almayer said with great courtesy  now we may talk tuan  it is easy to send out death but can your wisdom recall the life  she might have been harmed he continued indicating nina  your hand shook much for myself i was not afraid  nina exclaimed almayer come to me at once  what is this sudden madness  what bewitched you  come to your father and together we shall try to forget this horrible nightmare  he opened his arms with the certitude of clasping her to his breast in another second  she did not move  as it dawned upon him that she did not mean to obey he felt a deadly cold creep into his heart and pressing the palms of his hands to his temples he looked down on the ground in mute despair  dain took nina by the arm and led her towards her father  speak to him in the language of his people he said  he is grievingas who would not grieve at losing thee my pearl  speak to him the last words he shall hear spoken by that voice which must be very sweet to him but is all my life to me  he released her and stepping back a few paces out of the circle of light stood in the darkness looking at them with calm interest  the reflection of a distant flash of lightning lit up the clouds over their heads and was followed after a short interval by the faint rumble of thunder which mingled with almayers voice as he began to speak  do you know what you are doing  do you know what is waiting for you if you follow that man  have you no pity for yourself  do you know that you shall be at first his plaything and then a scorned slave a drudge and a servant of some new fancy of that man  she raised her hand to stop him and turning her head slightly asked  you hear this dain  is it true  by all the gods came the impassioned answer from the darknessby heaven and earth by my head and thine i swear this is a white mans lie  i have delivered my soul into your hands for ever i breathe with your breath i see with your eyes i think with your mind and i take you into my heart for ever  you thief shouted the exasperated almayer  a deep silence succeeded this outburst then the voice of dain was heard again  nay tuan he said in a gentle tone that is not true also  the girl came of her own will  i have done no more but to show her my love like a man she heard the cry of my heart and she came and the dowry i have given to the woman you call your wife  almayer groaned in his extremity of rage and shame  nina laid her hand lightly on his shoulder and the contact light as the touch of a falling leaf seemed to calm him  he spoke quickly and in english this time  tell me he saidtell me what have they done to you your mother and that man  what made you give yourself up to that savage  for he is a savage  between him and you there is a barrier that nothing can remove i can see in your eyes the look of those who commit suicide when they are mad  you are mad  dont smile  it breaks my heart  if i were to see you drowning before my eyes and i without the power to help you i could not suffer a greater torment  have you forgotten the teaching of so many years  no she interrupted i remember it well  i remember how it ended also  scorn for scorn contempt for contempt hate for hate  i am not of your race  between your people and me there is also a barrier that nothing can remove  you ask why i want to go and i ask you why i should stay  he staggered as if struck in the face but with a quick unhesitating grasp she caught him by the arm and steadied him  why you should stay he repeated slowly in a dazed manner and stopped short astounded at the completeness of his misfortune  you told me yesterday she went on again that i could not understand or see your love for me it is so  how can i  no two human beings understand each other  they can understand but their own voices  you wanted me to dream your dreams to see your own visionsthe visions of life amongst the white faces of those who cast me out from their midst in angry contempt  but while you spoke i listened to the voice of my own self then this man came and all was still there was only the murmur of his love  you call him a savage  what do you call my mother your wife  nina cried almayer take your eyes off my face  she looked down directly but continued speaking only a little above a whisper  in time she went on both our voices that mans and mine spoke together in a sweetness that was intelligible to our ears only  you were speaking of gold then but our ears were filled with the song of our love and we did not hear you  then i found that we could see through each others eyes that he saw things that nobody but myself and he could see  we entered a land where no one could follow us and least of all you  then i began to live  she paused  almayer sighed deeply  with her eyes still fixed on the ground she began speaking again  and i mean to live  i mean to follow him  i have been rejected with scorn by the white people and now i am a malay  he took me in his arms he laid his life at my feet  he is brave he will be powerful and i hold his bravery and his strength in my hand and i shall make him great his name shall be remembered long after both our bodies are laid in the dust  i love you no less than i did before but i shall never leave him for without him i cannot live  if he understood what you have said answered almayer scornfully he must be highly flattered  you want him as a tool for some incomprehensible ambition of yours  enough nina  if you do not go down at once to the creek where ali is waiting with my canoe i shall tell him to return to the settlement and bring the dutch officers here  you cannot escape from this clearing for i have cast adrift your canoe  if the dutch catch this hero of yours they will hang him as sure as i stand here  now go  he made a step towards his daughter and laid hold of her by the shoulder his other hand pointing down the path to the landingplace  beware exclaimed dain this woman belongs to me  nina wrenched herself free and looked straight at almayers angry face  no i will not go she said with desperate energy  if he dies i shall die too  you die said almayer contemptuously  oh no  you shall live a life of lies and deception till some other vagabond comes along to sing how did you say that  the song of love to you  make up your mind quickly  he waited for a while and then added meaningly  shall i call out to ali  call out she answered in malay you that cannot be true to your own countrymen  only a few days ago you were selling the powder for their destruction now you want to give up to them the man that yesterday you called your friend  oh dain she said turning towards the motionless but attentive figure in the darkness instead of bringing you life i bring you death for he will betray unless i leave you for ever  dain came into the circle of light and throwing his arm around ninas neck whispered in her eari can kill him where he stands before a sound can pass his lips  for you it is to say yes or no  babalatchi cannot be far now  he straightened himself up taking his arm off her shoulder and confronted almayer who looked at them both with an expression of concentrated fury  no she cried clinging to dain in wild alarm  no  kill me  then perhaps he will let you go  you do not know the mind of a white man  he would rather see me dead than standing where i am  forgive me your slave but you must not  she fell at his feet sobbing violently and repeating kill me  kill me  i want you alive said almayer speaking also in malay with sombre calmness  you go or he hangs  will you obey  dain shook nina off and making a sudden lunge struck almayer full in the chest with the handle of his kriss keeping the point towards himself  hai look  it was easy for me to turn the point the other way he said in his even voice  go tuan putih he added with dignity  i give you your life my life and her life  i am the slave of this womans desire and she wills it so  there was not a glimmer of light in the sky now and the tops of the trees were as invisible as their trunks being lost in the mass of clouds that hung low over the woods the clearing and the river  every outline had disappeared in the intense blackness that seemed to have destroyed everything but space  only the fire glimmered like a star forgotten in this annihilation of all visible things and nothing was heard after dain ceased speaking but the sobs of nina whom he held in his arms kneeling beside the fire  almayer stood looking down at them in gloomy thoughtfulness  as he was opening his lips to speak they were startled by a cry of warning by the riverside followed by the splash of many paddles and the sound of voices  babalatchi shouted dain lifting up nina as he got upon his feet quickly  ada  ada came the answer from the panting statesman who ran up the path and stood amongst them  run to my canoe he said to dain excitedly without taking any notice of almayer  run we must go  that woman has told them all  what woman asked dain looking at nina  just then there was only one woman in the whole world for him  the shedog with white teeth the seven times accursed slave of bulangi she yelled at abdullas gate till she woke up all sambir  now the white officers are coming guided by her and reshid  if you want to live do not look at me but go  how do you know this asked almayer  oh tuan what matters how i know  i have only one eye but i saw lights in abdullas house and in his campong as we were paddling past  i have ears and while we lay under the bank i have heard the messengers sent out to the white mens house  will you depart without that woman who is my daughter said almayer addressing dain while babalatchi stamped with impatience muttering run  run at once  no answered dain steadily i will not go to no man will i abandon this woman  then kill me and escape yourself sobbed out nina  he clasped her close looking at her tenderly and whispered we will never part o nina  i shall not stay here any longer broke in babalatchi angrily  this is great foolishness  no woman is worth a mans life  i am an old man and i know  he picked up his staff and turning to go looked at dain as if offering him his last chance of escape  but dains face was hidden amongst ninas black tresses and he did not see this last appealing glance  babalatchi vanished in the darkness  shortly after his disappearance they heard the war canoe leave the landingplace in the swish of the numerous paddles dipped in the water together  almost at the same time ali came up from the riverside two paddles on his shoulder  our canoe is hidden up the creek tuan almayer he said in the dense bush where the forest comes down to the water  i took it there because i heard from babalatchis paddlers that the white men are coming here  wait for me there said almayer but keep the canoe hidden  he remained silent listening to alis footsteps then turned to nina  nina he said sadly will you have no pity for me  there was no answer  she did not even turn her head which was pressed close to dains breast  he made a movement as if to leave them and stopped  by the dim glow of the burningout fire he saw their two motionless figures  the womans back turned to him with the long black hair streaming down over the white dress and dains calm face looking at him above her head  i cannot he muttered to himself  after a long pause he spoke again a little lower but in an unsteady voice it would be too great a disgrace  i am a white man  he broke down completely there and went on tearfully i am a white man and of good family  very good family he repeated weeping bitterly  it would be a disgrace    all over the islands    the only white man on the east coast  no it cannot be    white men finding my daughter with this malay  my daughter he cried aloud with a ring of despair in his voice  he recovered his composure after a while and said distinctly  i will never forgive you ninanever  if you were to come back to me now the memory of this night would poison all my life  i shall try to forget  i have no daughter  there used to be a halfcaste woman in my house but she is going even now  you dain or whatever your name may be i shall take you and that woman to the island at the mouth of the river myself  come with me  he led the way following the bank as far as the forest  ali answered to his call and pushing their way through the dense bush they stepped into the canoe hidden under the overhanging branches  dain laid nina in the bottom and sat holding her head on his knees  almayer and ali each took up a paddle  as they were going to push out ali hissed warningly all listened  in the great stillness before the bursting out of the thunderstorm they could hear the sound of oars working regularly in their rowlocks  the sound approached steadily and dain looking through the branches could see the faint shape of a big white boat  a womans voice said in a cautious tone  there is the place where you may land white men a little higherthere  the boat was passing them so close in the narrow creek that the blades of the long oars nearly touched the canoe  way enough  stand by to jump on shore  he is alone and unarmed was the quiet order in a mans voice and in dutch  somebody else whispered i think i can see a glimmer of a fire through the bush  and then the boat floated past them disappearing instantly in the darkness  now whispered ali eagerly let us push out and paddle away  the little canoe swung into the stream and as it sprung forward in response to the vigorous dig of the paddles they could hear an angry shout  he is not by the fire  spread out men and search for him  blue lights blazed out in different parts of the clearing and the shrill voice of a woman cried in accents of rage and pain  too late  o senseless white men  he has escaped     chapter xii   that is the place said dain indicating with the blade of his paddle a small islet about a mile ahead of the canoethat is the place where babalatchi promised that a boat from the prau would come for me when the sun is overhead  we will wait for that boat there  almayer who was steering nodded without speaking and by a slight sweep of his paddle laid the head of the canoe in the required direction  they were just leaving the southern outlet of the pantai which lay behind them in a straight and long vista of water shining between two walls of thick verdure that ran downwards and towards each other till at last they joined and sank together in the faraway distance  the sun rising above the calm waters of the straits marked its own path by a streak of light that glided upon the sea and darted up the wide reach of the river a hurried messenger of light and life to the gloomy forests of the coast and in this radiance of the suns pathway floated the black canoe heading for the islet which lay bathed in sunshine the yellow sands of its encircling beach shining like an inlaid golden disc on the polished steel of the unwrinkled sea  to the north and south of it rose other islets joyous in their brilliant colouring of green and yellow and on the main coast the sombre line of mangrove bushes ended to the southward in the reddish cliffs of tanjong mirrah advancing into the sea steep and shadowless under the clear light of the early morning  the bottom of the canoe grated upon the sand as the little craft ran upon the beach  ali leaped on shore and held on while dain stepped out carrying nina in his arms exhausted by the events and the long travelling during the night  almayer was the last to leave the boat and together with ali ran it higher up on the beach  then ali tired out by the long paddling laid down in the shade of the canoe and incontinently fell asleep  almayer sat sideways on the gunwale and with his arms crossed on his breast looked to the southward upon the sea  after carefully laying nina down in the shade of the bushes growing in the middle of the islet dain threw himself beside her and watched in silent concern the tears that ran down from under her closed eyelids and lost themselves in that fine sand upon which they both were lying face to face  these tears and this sorrow were for him a profound and disquieting mystery  now when the danger was past why should she grieve  he doubted her love no more than he would have doubted the fact of his own existence but as he lay looking ardently in her face watching her tears her parted lips her very breath he was uneasily conscious of something in her he could not understand  doubtless she had the wisdom of perfect beings  he sighed  he felt something invisible that stood between them something that would let him approach her so far but no farther  no desire no longing no effort of will or length of life could destroy this vague feeling of their difference  with awe but also with great pride he concluded that it was her own incomparable perfection  she was his and yet she was like a woman from another world  his  his  he exulted in the glorious thought nevertheless her tears pained him  with a wisp of her own hair which he took in his hand with timid reverence he tried in an access of clumsy tenderness to dry the tears that trembled on her eyelashes  he had his reward in a fleeting smile that brightened her face for the short fraction of a second but soon the tears fell faster than ever and he could bear it no more  he rose and walked towards almayer who still sat absorbed in his contemplation of the sea  it was a very very long time since he had seen the seathat sea that leads everywhere brings everything and takes away so much  he had almost forgotten why he was there and dreamily he could see all his past life on the smooth and boundless surface that glittered before his eyes  dains hand laid on almayers shoulder recalled him with a start from some country very far away indeed  he turned round but his eyes seemed to look rather at the place where dain stood than at the man himself dain felt uneasy under the unconscious gaze  what said almayer  she is crying murmured dain softly  she is crying  why asked almayer indifferently  i came to ask you  my ranee smiles when looking at the man she loves it is the white woman that is crying now  you would know  almayer shrugged his shoulders and turned away again towards the sea  go tuan putih urged dain  go to her her tears are more terrible to me than the anger of gods  are they  you will see them more than once  she told me she could not live without you answered almayer speaking without the faintest spark of expression in his face so it behoves you to go to her quick for fear you may find her dead  he burst into a loud and unpleasant laugh which made dain stare at him with some apprehension but got off the gunwale of the boat and moved slowly towards nina glancing up at the sun as he walked  and you go when the sun is overhead he said  yes tuan  then we go answered dain  i have not long to wait muttered almayer  it is most important for me to see you go  both of you  most important he repeated stopping short and looking at dain fixedly  he went on again towards nina and dain remained behind  almayer approached his daughter and stood for a time looking down on her  she did not open her eyes but hearing footsteps near her murmured in a low sob dain  almayer hesitated for a minute and then sank on the sand by her side she not hearing a responsive word not feeling a touch opened her eyessaw her father and sat up suddenly with a movement of terror  oh father she murmured faintly and in that word there was expressed regret and fear and dawning hope  i shall never forgive you nina said almayer in a dispassionate voice  you have torn my heart from me while i dreamt of your happiness you have deceived me  your eyes that for me were like truth itself lied to me in every glancefor how long  you know that best  when you were caressing my cheek you were counting the minutes to the sunset that was the signal for your meeting with that manthere  he ceased and they both sat silent side by side not looking at each other but gazing at the vast expanse of the sea  almayers words had dried ninas tears and her look grew hard as she stared before her into the limitless sheet of blue that shone limpid unwaving and steady like heaven itself  he looked at it also but his features had lost all expression and life in his eyes seemed to have gone out  the face was a blank without a sign of emotion feeling reason or even knowledge of itself  all passion regret grief hope or angerall were gone erased by the hand of fate as if after this last stroke everything was over and there was no need for any record  those few who saw almayer during the short period of his remaining days were always impressed by the sight of that face that seemed to know nothing of what went on within like the blank wall of a prison enclosing sin regrets and pain and wasted life in the cold indifference of mortar and stones  what is there to forgive asked nina not addressing almayer directly but more as if arguing with herself  can i not live my own life as you have lived yours  the path you would have wished me to follow has been closed to me by no fault of mine  you never told me muttered almayer  you never asked me she answered and i thought you were like the others and did not care  i bore the memory of my humiliation alone and why should i tell you that it came to me because i am your daughter  i knew you could not avenge me  and yet i was thinking of that only interrupted almayer and i wanted to give you years of happiness for the short day of your suffering  i only knew of one way  ah but it was not my way she replied  could you give me happiness without life  life she repeated with sudden energy that sent the word ringing over the sea  life that means power and love she added in a low voice  that said almayer pointing his finger at dain standing close by and looking at them in curious wonder  yes that she replied looking her father full in the face and noticing for the first time with a slight gasp of fear the unnatural rigidity of his features  i would have rather strangled you with my own hands said almayer in an expressionless voice which was such a contrast to the desperate bitterness of his feelings that it surprised even himself  he asked himself who spoke and after looking slowly round as if expecting to see somebody turned again his eyes towards the sea  you say that because you do not understand the meaning of my words she said sadly  between you and my mother there never was any love  when i returned to sambir i found the place which i thought would be a peaceful refuge for my heart filled with weariness and hatredand mutual contempt  i have listened to your voice and to her voice  then i saw that you could not understand me for was i not part of that woman  of her who was the regret and shame of your life  i had to choosei hesitated  why were you so blind  did you not see me struggling before your eyes  but when he came all doubt disappeared and i saw only the light of the blue and cloudless heaven  i will tell you the rest interrupted almayer  when that man came i also saw the blue and the sunshine of the sky  a thunderbolt has fallen from that sky and suddenly all is still and dark around me for ever  i will never forgive you nina and tomorrow i shall forget you  i shall never forgive you he repeated with mechanical obstinacy while she sat her head bowed down as if afraid to look at her father  to him it seemed of the utmost importance that he should assure her of his intention of never forgiving  he was convinced that his faith in her had been the foundation of his hopes the motive of his courage of his determination to live and struggle and to be victorious for her sake and now his faith was gone destroyed by her own hands destroyed cruelly treacherously in the dark in the very moment of success  in the utter wreck of his affections and of all his feelings in the chaotic disorder of his thoughts above the confused sensation of physical pain that wrapped him up in a sting as of a whiplash curling round him from his shoulders down to his feet only one idea remained clear and definitenot to forgive her only one vivid desireto forget her  and this must be made clear to herand to himselfby frequent repetition that was his idea of his duty to himselfto his raceto his respectable connections to the whole universe unsettled and shaken by this frightful catastrophe of his life  he saw it clearly and believed he was a strong man  he had always prided himself upon his unflinching firmness  and yet he was afraid  she had been all in all to him  what if he should let the memory of his love for her weaken the sense of his dignity  she was a remarkable woman he could see that all the latent greatness of his naturein which he honestly believedhad been transfused into that slight girlish figure  great things could be done  what if he should suddenly take her to his heart forget his shame and pain and anger andfollow her  what if he changed his heart if not his skin and made her life easier between the two loves that would guard her from any mischance  his heart yearned for her  what if he should say that his love for her was greater than     i will never forgive you nina he shouted leaping up madly in the sudden fear of his dream  this was the last time in his life that he was heard to raise his voice henceforth he spoke always in a monotonous whisper like an instrument of which all the strings but one are broken in a last ringing clamour under a heavy blow  she rose to her feet and looked at him  the very violence of his cry soothed her in an intuitive conviction of his love and she hugged to her breast the lamentable remnants of that affection with the unscrupulous greediness of women who cling desperately to the very scraps and rags of love any kind of love as a thing that of right belongs to them and is the very breath of their life  she put both her hands on almayers shoulders and looking at him half tenderly half playfully she said  you speak so because you love me  almayer shook his head  yes you do she insisted softly then after a short pause she added and you will never forget me  almayer shivered slightly  she could not have said a more cruel thing  here is the boat coming now said dain his arm outstretched towards a black speck on the water between the coast and the islet  they all looked at it and remained standing in silence till the little canoe came gently on the beach and a man landed and walked towards them he stopped some distance off and hesitated  what news asked dain  we have had orders secretly and in the night to take off from this islet a man and a woman  i see the woman  which of you is the man  come delight of my eyes said dain to nina  now we go and your voice shall be for my ears only  you have spoken your last words to the tuan putih your father  come  she hesitated for a while looking at almayer who kept his eyes steadily on the sea then she touched his forehead in a lingering kiss and a tearone of her tearsfell on his cheek and ran down his immovable face  goodbye she whispered and remained irresolute till he pushed her suddenly into dains arms  if you have any pity for me murmured almayer as if repeating some sentence learned by heart take that woman away  he stood very straight his shoulders thrown back his head held high and looked at them as they went down the beach to the canoe walking enlaced in each others arms  he looked at the line of their footsteps marked in the sand  he followed their figures moving in the crude blaze of the vertical sun in that light violent and vibrating like a triumphal flourish of brazen trumpets  he looked at the mans brown shoulders at the red sarong round his waist at the tall slender dazzling white figure he supported  he looked at the white dress at the falling masses of the long black hair  he looked at them embarking and at the canoe growing smaller in the distance with rage despair and regret in his heart and on his face a peace as that of a carved image of oblivion  inwardly he felt himself torn to pieces but aliwho now arousedstood close to his master saw on his features the blank expression of those who live in that hopeless calm which sightless eyes only can give  the canoe disappeared and almayer stood motionless with his eyes fixed on its wake  ali from under the shade of his hand examined the coast curiously  as the sun declined the seabreeze sprang up from the northward and shivered with its breath the glassy surface of the water  dapat exclaimed ali joyously  got him master  got prau  not there  look more tanah mirrah side  aha  that way  master see  now plain  see  almayer followed alis forefinger with his eyes for a long time in vain at last he sighted a triangular patch of yellow light on the red background of the cliffs of tanjong mirrah  it was the sail of the prau that had caught the sunlight and stood out distinct with its gay tint on the dark red of the cape  the yellow triangle crept slowly from cliff to cliff till it cleared the last point of land and shone brilliantly for a fleeting minute on the blue of the open sea  then the prau bore up to the southward the light went out of the sail and all at once the vessel itself disappeared vanishing in the shadow of the steep headland that looked on patient and lonely watching over the empty sea  almayer never moved  round the little islet the air was full of the talk of the rippling water  the crested wavelets ran up the beach audaciously joyously with the lightness of young life and died quickly unresistingly and graciously in the wide curves of transparent foam on the yellow sand  above the white clouds sailed rapidly southwards as if intent upon overtaking something  ali seemed anxious  master he said timidly time to get house now  long way off to pull all ready sir  wait whispered almayer  now she was gone his business was to forget and he had a strange notion that it should be done systematically and in order  to alis great dismay he fell on his hands and knees and creeping along the sand erased carefully with his hand all traces of ninas footsteps  he piled up small heaps of sand leaving behind him a line of miniature graves right down to the water  after burying the last slight imprint of ninas slipper he stood up and turning his face towards the headland where he had last seen the prau he made an effort to shout out loud again his firm resolve to never forgive  ali watching him uneasily saw only his lips move but heard no sound  he brought his foot down with a stamp  he was a firm manfirm as a rock  let her go  he never had a daughter  he would forget  he was forgetting already  ali approached him again insisting on immediate departure and this time he consented and they went together towards their canoe almayer leading  for all his firmness he looked very dejected and feeble as he dragged his feet slowly through the sand on the beach and by his sideinvisible to alistalked that particular fiend whose mission it is to jog the memories of men lest they should forget the meaning of life he whispered into almayers ear a childish prattle of many years ago almayer his head bent on one side seemed to listen to his invisible companion but his face was like the face of a man that has died struck from behinda face from which all feelings and all expression are suddenly wiped off by the hand of unexpected death        they slept on the river that night mooring their canoe under the bushes and lying down in the bottom side by side in the absolute exhaustion that kills hunger thirst all feeling and all thought in the overpowering desire for that deep sleep which is like the temporary annihilation of the tired body  next day they started again and fought doggedly with the current all the morning till about midday they reached the settlement and made fast their little craft to the jetty of lingard and co  almayer walked straight to the house and ali followed paddles on shoulder thinking that he would like to eat something  as they crossed the front courtyard they noticed the abandoned look of the place ali looked in at the different servants houses all were empty  in the back courtyard there was the same absence of sound and life  in the cookingshed the fire was out and the black embers were cold  a tall lean man came stealthily out of the banana plantation and went away rapidly across the open space looking at them with big frightened eyes over his shoulder  some vagabond without a master there were many such in the settlement and they looked upon almayer as their patron  they prowled about his premises and picked their living there sure that nothing worse could befall them than a shower of curses when they got in the way of the white man whom they trusted and liked and called a fool amongst themselves  in the house which almayer entered through the back verandah the only living thing that met his eyes was his small monkey which hungry and unnoticed for the last two days began to cry and complain in monkey language as soon as it caught sight of the familiar face  almayer soothed it with a few words and ordered ali to bring in some bananas then while ali was gone to get them he stood in the doorway of the front verandah looking at the chaos of overturned furniture finally he picked up the table and sat on it while the monkey let itself down from the roofstick by its chain and perched on his shoulder  when the bananas came they had their breakfast together both hungry both eating greedily and showering the skins round them recklessly in the trusting silence of perfect friendship  ali went away grumbling to cook some rice himself for all the women about the house had disappeared he did not know where  almayer did not seem to care and after he finished eating he sat on the table swinging his legs and staring at the river as if lost in thought  after some time he got up and went to the door of a room on the right of the verandah  that was the office  the office of lingard and co  he very seldom went in there  there was no business now and he did not want an office  the door was locked and he stood biting his lower lip trying to think of the place where the key could be  suddenly he remembered in the womens room hung upon a nail  he went over to the doorway where the red curtain hung down in motionless folds and hesitated for a moment before pushing it aside with his shoulder as if breaking down some solid obstacle  a great square of sunshine entering through the window lay on the floor  on the left he saw mrs almayers big wooden chest the lid thrown back empty near it the brass nails of ninas european trunk shone in the large initials n a on the cover  a few of ninas dresses hung on wooden pegs stiffened in a look of offended dignity at their abandonment  he remembered making the pegs himself and noticed that they were very good pegs  where was the key  he looked round and saw it near the door where he stood  it was red with rust  he felt very much annoyed at that and directly afterwards wondered at his own feeling  what did it matter  there soon would be no keyno doornothing  he paused key in hand and asked himself whether he knew well what he was about  he went out again on the verandah and stood by the table thinking  the monkey jumped down and snatching a banana skin absorbed itself in picking it to shreds industriously  forget muttered almayer and that word started before him a sequence of events a detailed programme of things to do  he knew perfectly well what was to be done now  first this then that and then forgetfulness would come easy  very easy  he had a fixed idea that if he should not forget before he died he would have to remember to all eternity  certain things had to be taken out of his life stamped out of sight destroyed forgotten  for a long time he stood in deep thought lost in the alarming possibilities of unconquerable memory with the fear of death and eternity before him  eternity he said aloud and the sound of that word recalled him out of his reverie  the monkey started dropped the skin and grinned up at him amicably  he went towards the office door and with some difficulty managed to open it  he entered in a cloud of dust that rose under his feet  books open with torn pages bestrewed the floor other books lay about grimy and black looking as if they had never been opened  account books  in those books he had intended to keep day by day a record of his rising fortunes  long time ago  a very long time  for many years there has been no record to keep on the blue and red ruled pages  in the middle of the room the big office desk with one of its legs broken careened over like the hull of a stranded ship most of the drawers had fallen out disclosing heaps of paper yellow with age and dirt  the revolving office chair stood in its place but he found the pivot set fast when he tried to turn it  no matter  he desisted and his eyes wandered slowly from object to object  all those things had cost a lot of money at the time  the desk the paper the torn books and the broken shelves all under a thick coat of dust  the very dust and bones of a dead and gone business  he looked at all these things all that was left after so many years of work of strife of weariness of discouragement conquered so many times  and all for what  he stood thinking mournfully of his past life till he heard distinctly the clear voice of a child speaking amongst all this wreck ruin and waste  he started with a great fear in his heart and feverishly began to rake in the papers scattered on the floor broke the chair into bits splintered the drawers by banging them against the desk and made a big heap of all that rubbish in one corner of the room  he came out quickly slammed the door after him turned the key and taking it out ran to the front rail of the verandah and with a great swing of his arm sent the key whizzing into the river  this done he went back slowly to the table called the monkey down unhooked its chain and induced it to remain quiet in the breast of his jacket  then he sat again on the table and looked fixedly at the door of the room he had just left  he listened also intently  he heard a dry sound of rustling sharp cracks as of dry wood snapping a whirr like of a birds wings when it rises suddenly and then he saw a thin stream of smoke come through the keyhole  the monkey struggled under his coat  ali appeared with his eyes starting out of his head  master  house burn he shouted  almayer stood up holding by the table  he could hear the yells of alarm and surprise in the settlement  ali wrung his hands lamenting aloud  stop this noise fool said almayer quietly  pick up my hammock and blankets and take them to the other house  quick now  the smoke burst through the crevices of the door and ali with the hammock in his arms cleared in one bound the steps of the verandah  it has caught well muttered almayer to himself  be quiet jack he added as the monkey made a frantic effort to escape from its confinement  the door split from top to bottom and a rush of flame and smoke drove almayer away from the table to the front rail of the verandah  he held on there till a great roar overhead assured him that the roof was ablaze then he ran down the steps of the verandah coughing half choked with the smoke that pursued him in bluish wreaths curling about his head  on the other side of the ditch separating almayers courtyard from the settlement a crowd of the inhabitants of sambir looked at the burning house of the white man  in the calm air the flames rushed up on high coloured pale brickred with violet gleams in the strong sunshine  the thin column of smoke ascended straight and unwavering till it lost itself in the clear blue of the sky and in the great empty space between the two houses the interested spectators could see the tall figure of the tuan putih with bowed head and dragging feet walking slowly away from the fire towards the shelter of almayers folly  in that manner did almayer move into his new house  he took possession of the new ruin and in the undying folly of his heart set himself to wait in anxiety and pain for that forgetfulness which was so slow to come  he had done all he could  every vestige of ninas existence had been destroyed and now with every sunrise he asked himself whether the longedfor oblivion would come before sunset whether it would come before he died  he wanted to live only long enough to be able to forget and the tenacity of his memory filled him with dread and horror of death for should it come before he could accomplish the purpose of his life he would have to remember for ever  he also longed for loneliness  he wanted to be alone  but he was not  in the dim light of the rooms with their closed shutters in the bright sunshine of the verandah wherever he went whichever way he turned he saw the small figure of a little maiden with pretty olive face with long black hair her little pink robe slipping off her shoulders her big eyes looking up at him in the tender trustfulness of a petted child  ali did not see anything but he also was aware of the presence of a child in the house  in his long talks by the evening fires of the settlement he used to tell his intimate friends of almayers strange doings  his master had turned sorcerer in his old age  ali said that often when tuan putih had retired for the night he could hear him talking to something in his room  ali thought that it was a spirit in the shape of a child  he knew his master spoke to a child from certain expressions and words his master used  his master spoke in malay a little but mostly in english which he ali could understand master spoke to the child at times tenderly then he would weep over it laugh at it scold it beg of it to go away curse it  it was a bad and stubborn spirit  ali thought his master had imprudently called it up and now could not get rid of it  his master was very brave he was not afraid to curse this spirit in the very presence and once he fought with it  ali had heard a great noise as of running about inside the room and groans  his master groaned  spirits do not groan  his master was brave but foolish  you cannot hurt a spirit  ali expected to find his master dead next morning but he came out very early looking much older than the day before and had no food all day  so far ali to the settlement  to captain ford he was much more communicative for the good reason that captain ford had the purse and gave orders  on each of fords monthly visits to sambir ali had to go on board with a report about the inhabitant of almayers folly  on his first visit to sambir after ninas departure ford had taken charge of almayers affairs  they were not cumbersome  the shed for the storage of goods was empty the boats had disappeared appropriatedgenerally in nighttimeby various citizens of sambir in need of means of transport during a great flood the jetty of lingard and co left the bank and floated down the river probably in search of more cheerful surroundings even the flock of geesethe only geese on the east coastdeparted somewhere preferring the unknown dangers of the bush to the desolation of their old home  as time went on the grass grew over the black patch of ground where the old house used to stand and nothing remained to mark the place of the dwelling that had sheltered almayers young hopes his foolish dream of splendid future his awakening and his despair  ford did not often visit almayer for visiting almayer was not a pleasant task  at first he used to respond listlessly to the old seamans boisterous inquiries about his health he even made efforts to talk asking for news in a voice that made it perfectly clear that no news from this world had any interest for him  then gradually he became more silentnot sulkilybut as if he was forgetting how to speak  he used also to hide in the darkest rooms of the house where ford had to seek him out guided by the patter of the monkey galloping before him  the monkey was always there to receive and introduce ford  the little animal seemed to have taken complete charge of its master and whenever it wished for his presence on the verandah it would tug perseveringly at his jacket till almayer obediently came out into the sunshine which he seemed to dislike so much  one morning ford found him sitting on the floor of the verandah his back against the wall his legs stretched stiffly out his arms hanging by his side  his expressionless face his eyes open wide with immobile pupils and the rigidity of his pose made him look like an immense mandoll broken and flung there out of the way  as ford came up the steps he turned his head slowly  ford he murmured from the floor i cannot forget  cant you said ford innocently with an attempt at joviality i wish i was like you  i am losing my memoryage i suppose only the other day my mate  he stopped for almayer had got up stumbled and steadied himself on his friends arm  hallo  you are better today  soon be all right said ford cheerfully but feeling rather scared  almayer let go his arm and stood very straight with his head up and shoulders thrown back looking stonily at the multitude of suns shining in ripples of the river  his jacket and his loose trousers flapped in the breeze on his thin limbs  let her go he whispered in a grating voice  let her go  tomorrow i shall forget  i am a firm man    firm as a    rock    firm     ford looked at his faceand fled  the skipper was a tolerably firm man himselfas those who had sailed with him could testifybut almayers firmness was altogether too much for his fortitude  next time the steamer called in sambir ali came on board early with a grievance  he complained to ford that jimeng the chinaman had invaded almayers house and actually had lived there for the last month  and they both smoke added ali  phew  opium you mean  ali nodded and ford remained thoughtful then he muttered to himself poor devil  the sooner the better now  in the afternoon he walked up to the house  what are you doing here he asked of jimeng whom he found strolling about on the verandah  jimeng explained in bad malay and speaking in that monotonous uninterested voice of an opium smoker pretty far gone that his house was old the roof leaked and the floor was rotten  so being an old friend for many many years he took his money his opium and two pipes and came to live in this big house  there is plenty of room  he smokes and i live here  he will not smoke long he concluded  where is he now asked ford  inside  he sleeps answered jimeng wearily  ford glanced in through the doorway  in the dim light of the room he could see almayer lying on his back on the floor his head on a wooden pillow the long white beard scattered over his breast the yellow skin of the face the halfclosed eyelids showing the whites of the eye only     he shuddered and turned away  as he was leaving he noticed a long strip of faded red silk with some chinese letters on it which jimeng had just fastened to one of the pillars  whats that he asked  that said jimeng in his colourless voice that is the name of the house  all the same like my house  very good name  ford looked at him for awhile and went away  he did not know what the crazylooking maze of the chinese inscription on the red silk meant  had he asked jimeng that patient chinaman would have informed him with proper pride that its meaning was house of heavenly delight  in the evening of the same day babalatchi called on captain ford  the captains cabin opened on deck and babalatchi sat astride on the high step while ford smoked his pipe on the settee inside  the steamer was leaving next morning and the old statesman came as usual for a last chat  we had news from bali last moon remarked babalatchi  a grandson is born to the old rajah and there is great rejoicing  ford sat up interested  yes went on babalatchi in answer to fords look  i told him  that was before he began to smoke  well and what asked ford  i escaped with my life said babalatchi with perfect gravity because the white man is very weak and fell as he rushed upon me  then after a pause he added she is mad with joy  mrs almayer you mean  yes she lives in our rajahs house  she will not die soon  such women live a long time said babalatchi with a slight tinge of regret in his voice  she has dollars and she has buried them but we know where  we had much trouble with those people  we had to pay a fine and listen to threats from the white men and now we have to be careful  he sighed and remained silent for a long while  then with energy  there will be fighting  there is a breath of war on the islands  shall i live long enough to see    ah tuan he went on more quietly the old times were best  even i have sailed with lanun men and boarded in the night silent ships with white sails  that was before an english rajah ruled in kuching then we fought amongst ourselves and were happy now when we fight with you we can only die  he rose to go  tuan he said you remember the girl that man bulangi had  her that caused all the trouble  yes said ford  what of her  she grew thin and could not work  then bulangi who is a thief and a pigeater gave her to me for fifty dollars  i sent her amongst my women to grow fat  i wanted to hear the sound of her laughter but she must have been bewitched and    she died two days ago  nay tuan  why do you speak bad words  i am oldthat is truebut why should i not like the sight of a young face and the sound of a young voice in my house  he paused and then added with a little mournful laugh i am like a white man talking too much of what is not mens talk when they speak to one another  and he went off

there succeeded a breathless silence  abdulla made a few paces forward and found himself for the last time face to face with his old enemy  whatever he might have been once he was not dangerous now lying stiff and lifeless in the tender light of the early day  the only white man on the east coast was dead and his soul delivered from the trammels of his earthly folly stood now in the presence of infinite wisdom  on the upturned face there was that serene look which follows the sudden relief from anguish and pain and it testified silently before the cloudless heaven that the man lying there under the gaze of indifferent eyes had been permitted to forget before he died  abdulla looked down sadly at this infidel he had fought so long and had bested so many times  such was the reward of the faithful  yet in the arabs old heart there was a feeling of regret for that thing gone out of his life  he was leaving fast behind him friendships and enmities successes and disappointmentsall that

like this in the morning said ali in a low and awed voice  abdulla glanced coldly once more at the serene face  let us go he said addressing reshid  and as they passed through the crowd that fell back before them the beads in abdullas hand clicked while in a solemn whisper he breathed out piously the name of allah  the merciful  the compassionate
