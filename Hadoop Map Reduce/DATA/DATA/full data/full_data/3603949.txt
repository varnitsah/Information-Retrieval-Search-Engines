3603949	true to himself   roger strongs struggle for place   by  edward stratemeyer     preface  true to himself while a complete story in itself forms the third volume of the ship and shore series tales of adventure on land and sea written for both boys and girls  in this story we are introduced to roger strong a typical american country lad and his sister kate who by an unhappy combination of events are thrown upon their own resources and compelled to make their own way in the world  to make ones way in the world is ordinarily difficult enough but when one is handicapped by a cloud on the family name the difficulty becomes far greater with his father thrown into prison on a serious charge roger finds that few people will have anything to do with either himself or his sister and the jeers flung at him are at times almost more than he can bear but he is true to himself in the best meaning of that saying rising above those who would pull him down and in the end not only succeeds in making a place for himself in the world but also scores a worthy triumph over those who had caused his parents downfall  when this story was first printed as a serial the author has every reason to believe it was well received by the boys and girls for whom it was written in its present revised form he hopes it will meet with equal commendation                                                     edward stratemeyer       newark nj           april 15 1900       chapter i   the trouble in the orchard  hi there duncan woodward i called out what are you doing in widow canbys orchard  none of your business roger strong replied the only son of the wealthiest merchant in darbyville  you are stealing her pears i went on your pockets are full of them  see here roger strong just you mind your own business and leave me alone  i am minding my business i rejoined warmly  indeed and duncan put as much of a sneer as was possible in the word  yes indeed widow canby pays me for taking care of her orchard and that includes keeping an eye on these pear trees and i approached the tree upon the lowest branch of which duncan was standing  humph you think youre mighty big he blustered as he jumped to the ground what right has a fellow like you to talk to me in this manner you are getting too big for your boots  i dont think so im guarding this property and i want you to hand over what youve taken and leave the premises i retorted for i did not fancy the style in which i was being addressed  pooh do you expect me to pay any attention to that  you had better duncan if you dont you may get into trouble  i suppose you intend to tell the widow what ive done  i certainly shall unless you do as ive told you to  duncan bit his lip how do you know but what the widow said i could have the pears he ventured  if she did its all right i returned astonished not so much over the fact that widow canby had granted the permission as that such a hightoned young gentleman as duncan woodward should desire that privilege  youve no business to jump at conclusions he added sharply  if i judged you wrongly i beg your pardon duncan ill speak to the widow about it  i began to move off toward the house duncan hurried after me and caught me by the arm  you fool you what do you mean he demanded  im going to find out if you are telling the truth  isnt my word enough  it will do no harm to ask i replied evasively not caring to pick a quarrel and yet morally sure that he was prevaricating  so you think im telling you a falsehood ive a good mind to give you a sound drubbing he cried angrily  duncan woodward had many of the traits of a bully about him he was the only son of a widower who nearly idolized him and lacking a mothers guiding influence he had grown up wayward in the extreme  he was a tall wellbuilt fellow strong from constant athletic exercise and given on this account to having his way among his associates  yet i was not afraid of him indeed to tell the truth i was not afraid of any one for eight years i had been shoved in life from pillar to post until now threats had no terrors for me  both of my parents were dead to me my mother died when i was but five years old she was of a delicate nature and strange as it may seem i am inclined to believe that it was for the best that her death occurred when it did the reason i believe this is because she was thus spared the disgrace that came upon our family several years later  at her death my father was employed as head clerk by the firm of holland  mack wholesale provision merchants of newville a thriving city which was but a few miles from darbyville a pretty village located on the pass river  we occupied a handsome house in the centre of the village our family besides my parents and myself contained but one other member my sister kate who was several years my senior  when our beloved mother died kate took the management of our home upon her shoulders and as she had learned during my mothers long illness how everything should be done our domestic affairs ran smoothly all this time i attended the darbyville school and was laying the foundation for a commercial education intending at some later day to follow in the footsteps of my father  two years passed and then my fathers manner changed from being bright and cheerful toward us he became moody and silent what the cause was i could not guess and it did not help matters to be told by duncan woodward whose father was also employed by holland  mack that some folks would soon learn what was what and no mistake  at length the thunderbolt fell returning from school one day i found kate in tears  oh roger she burst out they say father has stolen money from holland  mack and they have just arrested him for a thief  the blow was a terrible one i was but a boy of fourteen and the news completely bewildered me i put on my cap and together with kate took the first horse car to newville to find out what it all meant  we found my father in jail where he had been placed to await the action of the grand jury it was with difficulty that we obtained permission to see him and ascertained the facts of the case  the charge against him was for raising money upon forged cheeks eight in number the total amount being nearly twelve thousand dollars the name of the firm had been forged and the money collected in new york and brooklyn i was not old enough to understand the particulars  my father protested his innocence but it was of no avail the forgery was declared to be his work and though it was said that he must have had an accomplice to obtain the money he was adjudged the guilty party  ten years in the states prison that was the penalty my father grew deadly white while as for me my very heart seemed to stop beating kate fainted and two days later the doctor announced that she had an attack of brain fever  two months dragged slowly by then my sister was declared to be out of danger next the house was sold over our heads and we were turned out upon the world branded as the children of a thief to get a living as best we could  both of us would willingly have left darbyville but where should we go the only relation we had was an uncle captain enos moss and he was on an extended trip to south america and when he would return no one knew  all the friends we had had before deserted us the girls turned up their noses at kate which made my blood boil and the boys fought shy of me  i tried to find work but without success even in places where help was wanted excuses were made to me trivial excuses that meant but one thing that they did not desire any one in their employ who had a stain upon his name  kate was equally unsuccessful and we might have starved but for a lucky incident that happened just as we were ready to give up in despair  walking along the road one day i saw farmer tilfords bull tearing across the field toward a gate which had been accidentally left open the widow canby absorbed in thought and quite unconscious of the danger that threatened her was just passing this gate when i darted forward and closed it just a second before the bull reached it i did not consider my act an heroic one but the widow canby declared it otherwise  you are a brave boy she said who are you  i told her coloring as i spoke but she laid a kindly hand upon my shoulder  even if your father was guilty you are not to blame she said and she made me tell her all about myself and about kate and the hard luck we were having  the widow canby lived in an oldfashioned house surrounded on three sides by orchards several acres in extent she was well to do but made no pretence to style many thought her extremely eccentric but that was only because they did not know her  the day i came to her assistance she made me stay to supper and when i left it was under promise to call the next day and bring my sister along  this i did and a long conversation took place which resulted in kate and myself going to live with the widow i to take care of the garden and the orchards and my sister to help with the housekeeping for which we received our board and joint wages of fifteen dollars per month  we could not have fallen into better hands mrs canby was as considerate as one would wish and had it not been for the cloud upon our name we would have been content  but the stain upon our family was a source of unpleasantness to us i fully believed my father innocent and i wondered if the time would ever come when his character would be cleared  my duties around widow canbys place were not onerous and i had plenty of chance for selfimprovement i had finished my course at the village school in spite of the calumny that was cast upon me and now i continued my studies in private whenever the opportunity offered  i was looked down upon by nearly every one in the village to strangers i was pointed out as the convicts son and people reckoned that the widder canby wasnt right sharp when she took in them as wasnt to be trusted  i was not oversensitive but these remarks which generally reached my ears sooner or later made me very angry what right had people to look down on my sister and myself it was not fair to kate and me and i proposed to stand it no longer  it was a lovely morning in september but i was in no mood to enjoy the bright sunshine and clear air that flooded the orchard i had just come from the depot with the mail for mrs canby and down there i had heard two men pass opinions on my fathers case that were not only uncharitable but unjust  i was therefore in no frame of mind to put up with duncan woodwards actions and when he spoke of giving me a good drubbing i prepared to defend myself  two can play at that game duncan i replied  ho ho do you mean to say you can stand up against me he asked derisively  i can try i returned stoutly im sure now that you have no business here  why you miserable little thief  stop that im no thief if you please  well youre the son of one and thats the same thing  my father is innocent and i wont allow any one big or little to call him a thief i burst out some day he will be cleared  not much laughed duncan my father knows all about the case i can tell you that  then perhaps he knows where the money went to i replied quickly i know he was very intimate with my father at that time  had i stopped to think i would not have spoken as i did my remark made the young man furious and i had hardly spoken before duncan hit me a stinging blow on the forehead and springing upon me bore me to the ground    chapter ii   an assault on the road  i knew duncan woodward would not hesitate to attack me he was a much larger fellow than myself and always ready to fight any one he thought he could whip  yet i was not prepared for the sudden onslaught that had been made had i been i might have parried his blow  but i did not intend to be subdued as easily as he imagined the blow on my forehead pained not a little and it made me mad clear through  get off of me i cried as duncan brought his full weight down upon my chest  not much not until you promise to keep quiet about this affair he replied  if you dont get off youll be mighty sorry was my reply as i squirmed around in an effort to throw him aside  suddenly he caught me by the ear and gave that member a twist that caused me to cry out with pain  now will you do as i say he demanded  no  again he caught my ear but now i was ready for him it was useless to try to shake him off he was too heavy and powerful for that so i brought a small but effective weapon into play the weapon was nothing more than a pin that held together a rent in my trousers made the day previous without hesitation i pulled it out and ran it a good halfinch into his leg  the yell be gave would have done credit to a wild indian and he bounded a distance of several feet i was not slow to take advantage of this movement and in an instant i was on my feet and several yards away  duncans rage knew no bounds he was mad enough to chew me up and with a loud exclamation he sprang after me aiming a blow at my head as he did so  i dodged his arm and then gathering myself together landed my fist fairly and squarely upon the tip of his nose a blow that knocked him off his feet and sent him rolling to the ground  to say that i was astonished at what i had done would not express my entire feelings i was amazed and could hardly credit my own eyesight yet there he lay the blood flowing from the end of his nasal organ he was completely knocked out and i had done the deed i did not fear for consequences i felt justified in what i had done but i wondered how duncan would stand the punishment  with a look of intense bitterness on his face he rose slowly to his feet the blood was running down his chin and there were several stains upon his white collar and his shirt front if a look could have crushed me i would have been instantly annihilated  ill fix you for that he roared roger strong ill get even with you if it takes ten years  do what you please duncan woodward i rejoined i dont fear you only beware how you address me in the future you will get yourself into trouble  i imagine you will be the one to get into trouble he returned insinuatingly  im not afraid but hold up there i added for duncan had begun to move off toward the fence  what for  i want you to hand over the pears you picked  i wont  very well then ill report the case to mrs canby  duncan grew white  take your confounded fruit he howled throwing a dozen or more of the luscious pears at my feet if i dont get even with you my name isnt duncan woodward  and with this parting threat he turned to the fence jumped over and strode down the road  in spite of the seriousness of the affair i could not help but laugh duncan had no doubt thought it a great lark to rob the widows orchard never dreaming of the wrong he was doing or of the injury to the trees now his nose was swollen his clothes soiled and he had suffered defeat in every way  i had no doubt that he would do all in his power to get even with me he hated me and always had at school i had surpassed him in our studies and on the ball field i had proved myself a superior player i do not wish to brag about what i did but it is necessary to show why duncan disliked me  nor was there much love lost on my side though i always treated him fairly the reason for this was plain  as i have stated his father aaron woodward was at one tune a fellowclerk with my father at the time my father was arrested woodward was one of his principal accusers duncan had of course taken up the matter since then mr woodward had received a large legacy from a dead relative in chicago or its suburbs and started the finest general store in darbyville but his bitterness toward us still continued  that the man knew something about the money that had been stolen i did not doubt but how to prove it was a difficult problem that i had pondered many times without arriving at any satisfactory conclusion  i watched duncan out of sight and then turned and walked slowly toward the house  roger  it was mrs canby who called me she stood on the side porch with a letter in her hand  you want me  yes i have quite important news she continued my sister in norfolk is very ill and i must go to her at once i have spoken to kate about it do you think you can get along while i am gone  yes maam how long do you expect to be away  if she is not seriously ill i shall be back by day after tomorrow you can hitch up jerry at once the train leaves in an hour  ill have him at the door in five minutes  and roger you and kate must take good care of things while i am gone there are several hundred dollars locked up in my desk i would take the money to the bank in newville only i hate to lose the time  i reckon it will be safe i replied ill keep good watch against burglars  do you think you can handle a pistol she went on  i think i could i replied with all the interest of the average american boy in firearms  there is a pistol upstairs in my bureau that belonged to mr canby i will let you have that though of course i trust you wont need it  is it loaded  yes i loaded it last week i will lay it out before i go be very careful with it  i will i promised her  i hurried down to the barn and in a few moments had jerry hooked up to the family turnout as i was about to jump in and drive to the house a man confronted me  he was a stranger about forty years of age with black hair and shaggy beard and eyebrows he was seedily dressed and altogether looked to be a disreputable character  say young man can you help a fellow as is down on his luck he asked in a hoarse tone  who are you i responded  im a moulder from factoryville the shops shut down and im out of money and out of work  how long have you been out  two weeks  and you havent found work anywhere  not a stroke  been to newville  all through it and everything full  i thought this was queer i had glanced at the want column of a newville newspaper and had noted that moulders were wanted in several places  the mans appearance did not strike me favorably and when he came closer to me i noted that his breath smelt strongly of liquor  i dont think i can help you said i i have nothing for you to do  give me a quarter then will you i aint had nothing to eat since yesterday  but youve had something to drink i could not help remark  the man scowled how do you know  i can smell it on you  i only had one glass just to knock out a cold i caught come make it half a dollar ill pay you back when i get work  i dont care to lend  make it ten cents  not a cent  youre mighty independent about it he sneered  i have to be when such fellows as you tackle me i returned with spirit  youre mighty high toned for a boy of your age  im too high toned to let you talk to me in this fashion i want you to leave at once  the tramp for the man was nothing else scowled worse than before  ill leave when i please he returned coolly  i was nonplussed i was in a hurry to get away to drive widow canby to the station to leave the man hanging about the house with no one but my sister kate home was simply out of the question  suddenly an idea struck me like most people who live in the country mrs canby kept a watchdog a large and powerful mastiff called major he was tied up near the back stoop out of sight but could be pressed into service on short notice  if you dont go at once ill set the dog on you  huh you cant fool me  no fooling about it major major i called  there was a rattling of chain as the animal tried to break away and then a loud barking the noise seemed to strike terror to the tramps heart  ill get even with you young fellow he growled and running to the fence he scrambled over and out of sight i did not wait to see in what direction he went  when i reached the porch i found mrs canby bidding my sister goodby a moment more and she was on the seat i touched up jerry and we were off  it took you a long time to hitch up the widow remarked as we drove along  it wasnt that i replied and told her about the tramp  you must be very careful of those men she said anxiously some of them will not stop at anything  ill be wide awake i rejoined reassuringly  it was not a long drive to the station when we arrived there mrs canby had over five minutes to spare and this time was spent in buying a ticket and giving me final instructions  at length the train came along and she was off i waited a few moments longer and then drove away  i had several purchases to make in the village a pruningknife a bag of feed and some groceries and these took some time to buy so it was nearly noon when i started home  several times i imagined that a couple of the village young men noticed me very closely but i paid no attention and went on my way never dreaming of what was in store for me  the road to the widows house ran for half a mile or more through a heavy belt of timber land we were jogging along at a fair pace and i was looking over a newspaper i had picked up on the station platform suddenly some one sprang out from the bushes and seized jerry by the bridle  astonished and alarmed i sprang up to see what was the matter as i did so i received a stinging blow on the side of the head and the next instant was dragged rudely from the carriage    chapter iii   the models  i had been taken completely off my guard but by instinct i tried to ward off my assailants my effort was a useless one in a trice i found myself on the ground surrounded by half a dozen of the fastest young men to be found in darbyville  prominent among them was duncan woodward and i rightfully guessed that it was he who had organized the attack  take it easy strong exclaimed a fellow named moran unless you want to be all broke up  what do you mean by treating me in this way i cried indignantly  youll find out soon enough said phillips another of the young men come stop your struggling  ill do nothing of the kind you have no right to molest me  pooh sniffed duncan the models have a right to do anything  the models i queried in perplexity who are they  the models are a band of young gentlemen organized for the purpose of social enjoyment and to teach cads lessons that they are not likely to forget replied moran  i suppose you are the members i said surveying the halfdozen  we have that honor rejoined a boy named barton who had not yet spoken  and we intend to teach you a lesson added pultzer a short stout chap whose father had once been a butcher  what for  for your unwarranted attack upon our illustrious president  your president you mean duncan  mr woodward if you please interrupted duncan loftily i wont have such a lowbred fellow as you calling me by my first name  im no lower bred than you are i retorted  come none of thatcried moran we all know you well we shall at once proceed to teach you a lesson  i could not help smile the whole affair seemed so ridiculous that had it not been for the rough handling i had received when pulled from the carriage i would have considered it a joke  youll find it no laughing matter said duncan savagely angry no doubt because i did not show more signs of fear just wait till we are through with you youll grin on the other side of your face  what do you intend to do with me  youll see soon enough  i began to think the affair might be more serious than i had imagined six to one was heavy odds and who could tell what these wild fellows would not do  i want you to let me go at once i said decidedly if you dont it will be the worse for you  not a bit of it we intend that you shall remember this occasion as long as you live returned moran come march along with us  where to  never mind march  for reply i turned and made a hasty jump for the carriage intending to utilize jerry in a bold dash for liberty i had just placed my foot upon the step and called to the horse when moran caught me by the jacket and dragged me to the ground  no you dont he ejaculated roughly  there dunc catch hold of him and you too ellery we mustnt let him escape after weve watched two hours to catch him  in an instant i was surrounded now that duncan had his friends to back him he was brave enough and held my arm in a grip of iron  any one bring a rope went on moran  heres one replied ellery blake  hand it over we had better bind his hands  knowing that it would be folly to resist i allowed them to do as moran had advised my wrists were knotted together behind my back and then the cord was drawn tightly about my waist  now march  how about the horse and carriage  theyll be o k  there seemed to be no help for it so i walked along with them had there been the slightest chance offered to escape i would have taken it but warned by experience all six kept close watch over me  away we went through the woods that lined the east side of the road it was bad walking and with both my hands behind me i was several times in danger of stumbling indeed once i did go down but the firm grasp of my captors saved me from injury  presently we came to a long clearing where it had once been the intention of some capitalists to build a railroad but the matter had drifted into litigation and nothing was done but to build a tool house and cut away the trees and brush  the building had often been the resort of tramps and was in a dilapidated condition it was probably fifteen feet square having a door at one end and a window at the other the roof was flat and full of holes but otherwise the building was fairly strong  here we are fellows said duncan as we stopped in front of the door just let go of him  the others did as he requested but they formed a small circle around me that i might not escape  now that i have got you in a place free from interruption i intend to square up accounts with you continued the president of the models you hit me a foul blow this morning  you brought it on yourself duncan i replied as coolly as i could though i was keenly interested  stop how many times must i tell you not to call me by my first name  well then woodward if that suits you better  mr woodward if you please  oh come dunc hurry up interrupted moran we dont want to stay here all day  im only teaching this fellow a lesson in politeness  all right only cut it short  see here moran whos the president of this club  you are  well then ill take my own time replied duncan loftily  go ahead then but youll have to do without me rejoined moran considerably provoked by the others domineering tone  i will  yes ive got other things to do besides standing here gassing all day  indeed sneered duncan  yes indeed  i enjoyed the scene it looked very much as if there would be lively times without my aid  youre getting up on your dignity mighty quick dan moran  i dont intend to play servantinwaiting for any one duncan woodward  who asked you to   actions speak louder than words   im the president of the models am i not  yes but youre not a model president  i could not help smiling at morans pun he was not a bad chap and had he not been to a great extent under duncans influence he might have been a firstrate fellow  of course as is the fashion among men as well as boys all the others groaned at the pun and then ellery broke in  come come this will never do go ahead with strong dunc  i intend to was the presidents rejoinder but you all promised to stick by me and i dont want any one to back out  im not backing out put in moran i only want to hurry matters up  there was a pause after this speech then duncan addressed me  perhaps you are anxious to know why i brought you here  not particularly i returned coldly  duncan gave a sniff  i guess thats all put on  not at all what i am anxious to know is what you intend to do with me  well first of all i want you to get down on your knees and apologize for your conduct toward me this morning  not much i cried  you are in my power  i dont care go ahead and do your worst i replied recklessly willing to suffer almost anything rather than apologize to such a chap as duncan woodward  besides what had i done to call for an apology i had certainly treated him no worse than he deserved he was a spoilt boy and a bully and i would die rather than go down on my knees to him  you dont know whats in store for you said dunce nonplussed by my manner  as i said before ill risk it  very well where is the rope boys  here you are answered pultzer plenty of it  as he spoke he produced a stout clothes line five or six yards in length  well bind his hands a little tighter first instructed duncan and then his legs be sure and make the knots strong so they wont slip he must not escape us  i tried to protest against these proceedings but with my hands already bound it was useless  in five minutes the clothes line had been passed around my body from head to feet and i was almost as stiff as an egyptian mummy  now catch hold and well carry him into the tool house said duncan i guess after he has spent twentyfour hours in that place without food or water hell be mighty anxious to come to terms  i was half dragged and half carried to the tool house and dropped upon the floor then the door was closed upon me and i was left to my fate    chapter iv   the tramp again  i am sure that all will admit that the prospect before me was not a particularly bright one i was bound hand and foot and left without food or water  yet as i lay upon the hard floor of the tool house i was not so much concerned about myself as i was about matters at widow canbys house it would be a hardship to pass the night where i was to say nothing of how i might be treated when duncan woodward and his followers returned but in the meantime how would kate fare  i knew that my sister would be greatly alarmed at my continued absence she fully expected me to be home long before this as near as i could judge it was now an hour or so after noon and she would have dinner kept warm on the kitchen stove expecting every minute to see me drive up the lane  then again i was worried over the fact that the widow had left the house and her money in my charge to be sure the latter was locked up in her private secretary but i felt it to be as much in my care as if it had been placed in my shirt bosom or the bottom of my trunk  i concluded that it was my duty then to free myself as quickly as possible from the bonds which the members of the model club had placed upon me but this idea was more easily conceived than carried out  in vain i tugged at the clothes line that held my arms and hands fast to my body duncan and the others had done their work well and the only result of my efforts was to make the cord cut so deep into my flesh that several times i was ready to cry out from pain  in my attempts i tried to rise to my feet but found it an impossibility and only succeeded in bumping my head severely against the wall  there was no use in calling for help and though i halloed several times i soon gave it up i was fully threequarters of a mile from any house and half that distance from the road and who would be likely to hear me so far off  the afternoon dragged slowly along and finally the sun went down and the evening shadows crept up by this time i was quite hungry and tremendously thirsty but with nothing at hand to satisfy the one or allay the other i resolutely put all thoughts of both out of my head  in the old tool house there had been left several empty barrels behind which was a quantity of shavings that i found far more comfortable to rest upon than the bare floor  as the evening wore on i wondered if i would be able to sleep there was no use worrying about matters as it would do no good so i was inclined to treat the affair philosophically and make the best of it  an hour passed and i was just dropping into a light doze when a noise outside attracted my attention i listened intently and heard a mans footsteps  i was inclined to call out and in fact was on the point of so doing when the door of the tool house opened and in the dim light i recognized the form of the tramp moulder who earlier in the day had so impudently asked me for help  i was not greatly surprised to see him for as mentioned before the old tool house was frequently used by men of his stamp he had as much right there as i had and though i was chagrined to see him enter i was in no position to protest  on the contrary i deemed it advisable to keep quiet if he did not see me so much the better if he did who could tell what indignities he might visit upon me  so i crouched down behind the empty barrels hardly daring to breathe the man stumbled into the building leaving the door wide open  by his manner i was certain that he had been drinking heavily and his rambling soliloquy proved it  the same old shebang he mumbled to himself as he swayed around in the middle of the floor the same old shebang where aaron woodward and i parted company four years ago hes took care of his money and ive gone to the dogs and he gave a yawn and sat down on top of a barrel  i was thoroughly surprised at his words was it possible that this seedylooking individual had once been intimate with duncan woodwards father it hardly seemed reasonable i made a rapid calculation and concluded that the meeting must have had something to do with the proposed railroad in which i knew mr woodward had held an interest perhaps this tramp had once been a prosperous contractor  great times them were plenty of money and nothing to do continued the man wonder if any one in darbyville would recognize hold up stumpy you mustnt repeat that name too often or youll be mentioning it in public when it aint no interest for you to do it stumpy john stumpy is good enough for the likes of you  and with great deliberation mr john stumpy brought forth a short clay pipe which he proceeded to fill and light with evident satisfaction  during the brief period of lighting up i caught a good glance at his face and fancied that i saw beneath the surface of dirt and dissipation a look of shrewdness and intelligence evidently he was one of the unfortunates who allowed drink to make off with their brains  mr john stumpy puffed on in silence for several minutes i wondered what he intended to do and was not prepared for the surprises that were to follow  times are changed and no mistake he went on here i am down at the bottom nick weaver dead woodward a rich man and carson strong in jail humph but times do change  carson strong my heart gave a bound this man was speaking of my father what did it mean what did the tramp know of the events of the past as i lay behind the barrels i earnestly hoped he would go on with his talk i had heard just enough to arouse my curiosity  i was certain that i had never until that day seen the man what then could he have in common with my father  instinctively i connected the man with the cause of my fathers imprisonment i will not say downfall because i firmly believed him innocent why i should do so i cannot to this day explain but from the instant he mentioned my parents name the man was firmly fixed in my memory  in a few moments mr john stumpy had puffed his pipe out leaving the place filled with a heavy and vile smoke which gave me all i could do to keep from coughing then he slowly knocked the ashes from the bowl and restored the pipe to his pocket  now i reckon im in pretty good trim to go ahead he muttered as he arose no use of talking there aint anything like a good puff to steady a mans nerves was a time when i didnt need it but them times are gone and the least little job on hand upsets me wonder how much that old woman left behind  i nearly uttered an ejaculation of astonishment was this man speaking of mrs canby what was the job that he contemplated  clearly there could be but one answer to that question he knew the widow had gone away and in her absence he contemplated robbing her house perhaps he had overheard her make mention of the money locked up in her desk and the temptation to obtain possession of it was too strong to resist  ill have to get rid of that boy and the dog i suppose he went on if it wasnt for the noise id shoot the dog but it wont do to arouse the neighborhood as for the lad i reckon the sight of a pistol will scare him to death  i was not so sure of that and i grated my teeth at the thought of my present helplessness had i been free i am sure i could have escaped easily and perhaps have had the tramp arrested  it was an alarming prospect kate was the only occupant of the house and the nearest neighbor lived a full five hundred feet away if attacked in the middle of the night what would my sister do  for a moment i felt like exposing myself but then i reflected that such a course would not liberate me and he would know that he had nothing to fear from me at the house whereas if i kept quiet he might by some lucky incident be kept at bay  so i lay still wondering when he would start on his criminal quest  now one more drink and then ill be off he continued and producing a bottle he took a deep draught ha thats the stuff to brace a mans nerves but you mustnt drink too much john stumpy or youll be no good at all if youd only let liquor alone you might be as rich as aaron woodward remember that he gave something like a sigh oh well let it pass ill get the tools and be on the way the money in my pocket ill take the first train in the morning for the west he paused a moment but no i wont go until ive seen woodward he owes me a little on the old score and ill not go until he has settled up  there was an interval of silence during which stumpy must have been feeling around in his pockets for a match for a moment later there were several slight scratches and then a tiny flame lit up the interior of the tool house  lets see where did i leave them tools ah yes i remember now behind those barrels  and stumpy moved over to where i was in hiding    chapter v   following john stumpy  i expected to be discovered i could not see how it could possibly be avoided john stumpy was but a few feet away in a second more he would be in full sight of me  what the outcome of the discovery would be i could not imagine i was at the mans mercy and i was inclined to think that our interview of the morning would not tend to soften his feelings toward me  but at that instant a small yet extremely lucky incident occurred a draught of wind came in at the partly open door and blew out the match leaving the place in darkness  confound the luck ejaculated john stumpy in high irritation there goes the light and its the last match ive got too  this bit of information was gratifying to me and without making any noise i rolled back into the corner as far as possible  well ill have to find them tools in the dark thats all he groped around for several seconds during which i held my breath ah here they are just as i left em last night reckon no one visits this shanty and maybe it will be a good place to bring the booty especially if i happen to be closely pushed  i sincerely hoped that he would be closely pushed and in fact so closely pushed that he would have no booty to bring but if he did succeed in his nefarious plans i was glad that i would know where to look for him  no sooner had the man found the bag of tools which was nothing more nor less than a burglars kit than he quitted the place and i was left to my own reflections  my thoughts alarmed me beyond a doubt john stumpy intended to rob the widow canbys house the only one at home was kate and i groaned as i thought of the alarm and terror that she might be called upon to suffer as it was i was sure she was worried about my continued absence in my anguish i strove with all my might to burst asunder the bonds that held me at the end of five minutes struggle i remained as securely tied as ever  what was to be done it was a puzzling but pertinent question by hook or by crook i must get free at great risk of hurting my head i rolled to the door of the tool house which stumpy had left wide open outside the stars were shining brightly and in the southwest the pale crescent of the new moon was falling behind the treetops casting ghostly shadows that would have made a timid person shiver but as the reader may by this time know i was not of a timid nature and i gave the shadows scant attention until a sudden movement among the trees attracted my notice it was the figure of some person coming rapidly toward me  at first i judged it must be stumpy returning and i was on the point of rolling back to my hidingplace when i saw that the newcomer was a boy  when he reached the edge of the clearing he paused and approached slowly  roger strong he called out i instantly recognized the voice of dick blair one of the youngest members of the models who during my capture had had little to say or do he was the son of a wealthy farmer who lived but a short distance down the road from the widow canbys place  i had always considered dick a pretty good chap and had been disagreeably surprised to see him in company with duncan woodwards crowd how duncan had ever taken up with him i could not imagine except it might have been on account of the money dicks father allowed him to have  roger strong he repeated are you still here  i could not imagine what had brought him to this place at such an hour of the night yet i answered at once  yes i am dick blair  i thought maybe you had managed to get away he continued as he came closer  no you fellows did your work pretty well i replied as lightly as i could for i did not want to show the white feather  precious little i had to do with it he went on as he struck a match and lit a lantern that he carried  you were with the crowd  i know it but i wouldnt have been if id known what they were up to i hope you will not think too badly of me roger  i thought it was strange you would go into anything of this kind dick what brings you back tonight  i am ashamed of the whole thing he answered earnestly and i came to release you that is on certain conditions  my heart gave a bound what conditions dick  i want you to promise that you wont tell who set you free he explained if dunc or the rest heard of it they would never forgive me  what of it dick their opinion isnt worth anything  i know it now but they could tell mighty mean stories about me if they wanted to and dick blair turned away and shuffled his foot on the ground to hide his shame  dont mind them dick if they start any bad report about you do as im doing with the stain on our name live it down  ill try it but youll promise wont you  if you wish it yes  all right i know i can trust you said dick producing his pocket knife he quickly cut the cords that bound me somewhat stiff from the position in which i had been forced to remain i rose slowly to my feet  i dont know whether to thank you or not for what youve done for me dick i began but i appreciate your actions  i dont deserve any thanks it was a mean trick and i guess legally i was as guilty as any one just keep quiet about it and dont think too hard of me  ill do both i responded quickly  its a mighty lonely place to spend the night in he went on im no coward but i wouldnt care to do it all alone  i havent been alone  no and dick looked intensely surprised who has been here  i hesitated should i tell him  a tramp i began  why didnt he untie you  he didnt see me  oh i suppose you hid away what did he want i wonder  he was after some tools  tools there are none here any more  but there were  what kind of tools  i hesitated again should i tell dick the secret perhaps he might give me some timely assistance  will you promise to keep silent if i tell  why what do you mean roger  it is very important  all right fire away  he came after some burglars tools  dick stepped back in astonishment you surely dont mean it he gasped who was he going to rob  the widows house he knows she is away and has left considerable money in her desk  and in a rapid manner i told dick of what i had overheard omitting the mentioning of my fathers and mr woodwards names of course he was tremendously excited what healthy country boy would not be  what are you going to do about it he questioned  now im free im going to catch the fellow i returned decidedly he shall not rob mrs canbys house if i can help it  arent you afraid  i intend to be cautious  he may have a pistol  the widow left one in the house maybe i can secure it then well be on an equal footing  ive got a pistol roger  you  yes the models all carry them dunc always insisted that it was the proper thing  as dick spoke he produced a highly polished nickelplated fiveshooter  it looks like a good one i said after examining it is it loaded  oh yes and ive got a box of cartridges in my pocket besides  lend it to me dick  if you dont mind ill ill go along with you roger he returned you wont find me such a terrible coward  all right but we must hurry that fellow has got a good start and he may even now be in the house  hardly hell want to take a look around first  nevertheless we lost no time in getting away from the tool house we walked side by side i with the pistol in the pocket of my jacket and dick with the lantern held aloft that we might see to make rapid progress over the unaccustomed road  it was a good walk to the widows and once dick stumbled down in a heap while the lantern rolled several yards away but he picked himself up without grumbling and went along faster than ever  if im not mistaken i saw that tramp down at the depot this morning said he as we drew near to the main road he was hanging around and i thought he looked like a suspicious character  did you see him yesterday  no  did you ever hear of him before  i guess not he was near the baggage room when i saw him then mr woodward came up to see about a trunk and the tramp made right off  i was interested john stumpy had intimately that he intended to have an interview with duncan woodwards father and if this was so why had he not taken advantage of the opportunity thus offered  i could arrive at but one conclusion the tramp wished their meeting to be a strictly private one he did not care to be seen in mr woodwards presence or else the wealthy merchant would not tolerate such a thing  if the meeting was to be of a private nature it would no doubt be of importance had my fathers name not been mentioned i would not have cared but as it was i was deeply interested  perhaps it would be better to merely scare the fellow off if he was captured all chance of finding out his secrets might be lost  by this time the reader may be aware that i thought john stumpys secrets important such was a fact try as hard as i was able i could not but imagine that they concerned my father and his alleged downfall  in five minutes dick and i came within sight of widow canbys house there was a light burning in the kitchen and another in the diningroom  everything seems to be all right said dick as we stood near a corner of the front fence i guess the fellow hasnt put in an appearance yet  i dont know see i the side porch door is open we generally keep it closed and kate would certainly have it shut if she was alone  what do you intend to do go into the house  guess we had better id like to know where that fellow is i replied likely as not he is prowling about here somewhere if we can only catch sight of him we can hark  as i uttered the last word a shrill cry reached our ears it was kates voice and with my heart jumping wildly i made a dash for the house with dick blair following me    chapter vi   a strange envelope  i was sure that my sisters cry could mean but one thing that the tramp had made a raid on the house i was thoroughly alarmed and ran with all possible speed in the direction of the diningroom from whence the sound proceeded  as i tore across the lawn regardless of the bed of flowers which was mrs canbys pride kates cry was repeated this time in a more intense tone an instant later i dashed across the porch and into the room through the door that as i have said stood wide open  i found my sister standing in the middle of the floor holding in her hand a heavy umbrella with which she had evidently been defending herself she was pale and trembled from head to foot  what is it kate i exclaimed where is the fellow  oh roger she gasped im so glad youve come a tramp was here he robbed robbed the desk the window  she pointed to the open window on the opposite side of the room then her breast heaved the umbrella slipped from her grasp and she sank into a chair  are you hurt i cried anxiously  no no but the money it is gone what will mrs canby say  and overcome with the dreadful thought my sister fainted dead away  as for myself i felt sick at heart john stumpy had been there the widows money had been stolen what could be done  meanwhile dick blair had come in his common sense told him what had happened and he set to work to restore my sister to consciousness  will you stay here with kate i asked  certainly he returned promptly but where are you going after that tramp  yes  be careful for he may be a desperate character  im not afraid of him im going to get that money back or know the reason why was my determined reply and i meant every word i said  to my mind it was absolutely necessary that i recover the stolen property it would have been bad enough to have had it taken when the widow canby was at home but it had been stolen when left in my charge and that was enough to make me turn darbyville district up side down before letting the matter drop  besides there was still another important factor in the case i knew well enough that if the money was not recovered there would be plenty of people mean enough to intimate that i had had something to do with its disappearance the strong honor was considered low by many and they would not hesitate to declare that i was only following in my fathers footsteps  to a person already suffering under an unjust accusation such an intimation is doubly stinging and when i told dick that i was not afraid of mr john stumpy i meant that i would rather face the robber now than the darbyville people later on  i want to take the pistol i added  all right there is the box of extra cartridges do you want the lantern  yes i may want to use it before i return ill blow it out now  our conversation had lasted but a few seconds and an instant after i was on my way the lantern on my left arm and the pistol in my right hand  take good care of kate i called back as i passed out  i will replied dick dont stay away too long if you dont find the fellow  i passed around to the other side of the garden where an open gateway led to the pear orchard i felt pretty certain that john stumpy had pursued this course and i entered the orchard on a run  the thief i reckoned was not over five minutes ahead of me to be sure he could easily hide but it was not likely that he would care to remain in the neighborhood unless it was really necessary for him to see mr aaron woodward  when i got well into the orchard where it was darker than in the garden i listened intently hoping that i might hear some sound that would guide me  but all was silent occasionally a night bird fluttered through the trees and a frog gave a dismal croak but otherwise not a sound broke the stillness  i continued on my way toward the road and reaching the fence paused again  had the thief jumped over if so which way had he gone up down or into the woods beyond it was a perplexing question perhaps if i had been in a story book i might have found some clew to direct me but i was not that kind of a hero i was only an everyday boy and consequently no clew presented itself  i stood by the fence for several minutes my eyes and ears on the alert to catch anything worthy of notice i judged it was near midnight and hardly had i thought of the matter before the distant town bells tolled the hour of twelve  as the echo of the last stroke died away two figures came slowly up the road as they drew nearer i recognized moran and pultzer the two models members who had assisted at my capture  i was astonished at their appearance what on earth could they be doing out at this time of night  as they drew near i thought for many reasons that it would not be advisable to show myself and i stepped behind a tree  i dont care what you say said pultzer dunc was half scared to death when we came away  i guess he didnt think what a serious matter it was when he asked us to go into it returned moran its the worst affair i ever got into  ditto myself responded pultzer  and if we get out without being caught youll never find me in another such continued the other earnestly  i wonder what duncs father will say when he hears of it  and all the rest of the darbyville people of course theyve got to lay it to some one  i surmised that they must be speaking of what they had done to me i never dreamed that they were discussing a subject much more serious  im glad dick blair wasnt along tonight went on moran dick is not to be trusted any more he kicked awfully at the idea of tying up strong this noon  i was gratified to hear this bit of news i liked dick in many respects and now i was almost ready to look upon him as a friend  strong didnt give in quite as much as dunc thought he would hang it if i didnt admire his grit  so did i wonder how hes getting along in the old tool house we must release him first thing in the morning  no need of doing that gentlemen i put in stepping out from behind the tree i am  but it would have been useless for me to say more as no one would have heard me  at the first sound of my voice both of the models had started in alarm and then led by pultzer they dashed up the road as fast as their feet could carry them  at first i was amazed at their actions and then as the ridiculousness of the situation presented itself i smiled a guilty conscience needeth no accuser it is said and this truth was verified to the letter  yet i was sorry that i had not had a chance to speak to them i wanted to question them in regard to the thief perhaps they had seen him and if so i did not want to miss my chance of getting upon his track  jumping over the fence i walked slowly down the road but not in hopes of meeting john stumpy if he was anywhere near the approach of the two boys had certainly driven him into hiding  suddenly i thought of the tool house the tramp had spoken of returning to the place he evidently knew the road i determined to go to the spot and make a search at once  it was no easy matter to find my way back to the tool house and at the risk of being seen i lit the lantern  as i walked along i wondered how my sister and dick were faring no doubt kate had been much surprised to see who was with her on her recovery and i sincerely hoped that the shock stumpy had given her would not have any evil effects she was a sensitive girl and such happenings were calculated to try her nerves severely  at length i came within sight of the clearing here i hesitated for an instant and then pistol in hand approached the tool house boldly  the door was still open and i entered only to find the place empty  with a sigh i realized that my journey thither was a useless one nothing remained but to go back to the road and i was about to leave again when the rays of the lantern fell upon a white object lying on the floor  i picked it up it was a common square envelope thinking it contained a letter i turned it over to read the address judge of my astonishment when i read the following  dying statement of nicholas weaver concerning the forgeries for which carson strong was sent to states prison    chapter vii   a war of words  no words of mine can express the feeling that came over me as i read the superscription written on the envelope i had picked up in the old tool house  was it possible that this envelope contained the solution of the mystery that had taken away our good name and sent my father to prison the very thought made me tremble  the packet was not a thick one in fact it was so thin that for an instant i imagined the envelope was empty but a hasty examination proved my fears groundless  in nervous excitement i put the lantern down on the top of a barrel and then drew from the envelope the single shoot of foolscap that it contained a glance showed me that the pages were closely written in a cramped hand extremely difficult to read  for the moment i forgot everything else forgot that the widow canbys house had been robbed and that i was on the track of the robber and drawing close to the feeble light the lantern afforded strove with straining eyes and palpitating heart to decipher the contents of the written pages    i nicholas weaver being on the point of death from pneumonia do   make this my last statement which i hereby swear is true in every   particular  this was the beginning of the document which i hoped would in some way free my fathers character from the stain that now rested on it  exactly who nicholas weaver was i did not know though it ran in my mind that i had heard this name mentioned by my father during the trial  beyond the opening paragraph i have quoted the handwriting was almost illegible and in the dim light it was only here and there that i could pick out such words as bank assumed risk name and so forth which gave but an inkling of the real contents of the precious document  its too bad was my thought id give all i possess to be able to read this right off word for word  hardly had the reflection crossed my mind when a noise outside startled me i had just time enough to thrust the paper into my pocket when the door was swung open and the tramp appeared  he was evidently as much surprised as i was for he stopped short in amazement while the short pipe he carried between his lips fell unnoticed to the floor  i rightly conjectured he had not noticed the light of the lantern and fully believed the tool house tenantless  you here he cried  it looks like it doesnt it was all i could find to reply and as i spoke my hand sought the pistol i carried  what brought you here he demanded roughly  i came after you i returned as coolly as i could and by this time i had the pistol where it could be brought into instant use  what do you want of me  i want you to hand over the money you stole awhile ago  what are you talking about i never stole any money  you did you broke into the widow canbys house less than an hour ago come hand over that money  the fellow gave a coarse laugh ha ha do you think im to be bluffed by a boy get home with you before i hammer you for calling me a thief  thats just what you are and i dont intend to go until you hand over the money john stumpy i returned decidedly  ha you know my name  i bit my lip i was sorry for the slip i had made but i put on a bold front i know what you are called i replied  what i am called  yes  what do you mean come out with it  i will when i please in the meantime hand over that money  you talk like a fool he cried  never mind youll find i wont act like one  what do you know about me he went on curiously believing no doubt that he was perfectly safe from attack  i know more than you think i know you are a burglar and may be worse  ill kill you he cried rushing forward  stand where you are i returned pulling out the pistol dont stir a step  he did not see the weapon until he was fairly upon me the glint of the nickeled steel made him shiver  dont shoot he cried in sudden terror that showed he was a coward at heart dont dont shoot  i wont if you do as i tell you  do what  give up the widows money  see here young fellow youve made a mistake i never was near the widows house cepting this morning  i know better you just broke open her desk and stole over two hundred dollars  its a mistake put down the pistol and ill tell you all about it  im not such a fool mr john stumpy or whatever your name is was my decided reply  the tone of my voice disconcerted the man for he paused as if not knowing what to say next  say young feller do you want to make some money he asked suddenly after a short pause  the change in his manner surprised me  how i asked although i knew about what was coming  ive got nearly three hundred dollars in cash with me ill give you fifty of it if youll go home and say you couldnt find me  thank you im not doing business that way i rejoined coldly  fifty dollars aint to be sneezed at he went on insinuatingly  i wouldnt care if you offered me fifty thousand i cried sharply im no thief  humph dont you suppose i know who you are he went on youre the son of a thief do you hear that the son of a thief what right have you got to set yourself up to be any better than your father was afore you  take care i cried my blood fairly boiling as i spoke he saw his mistake  i didnt mean no harm partner but whats the use of being high toned when it dont pay  it always pays to be honest i said firmly  there are those who dont think so any more than i he replied  my father never was a thief they may say all they please i will always think him innocent  humph  if it hadnt been for men like you and nicholas weaver my father would never be in prison  the words were out before i knew it they were most injudicious ones  what do you mean gasped the man what do you know about nick weaver  more than you imagine when he died he made a confession  its false nick weaver wasnt in his right mind when he died anyhow  perhaps he was  what you began the man then he paused and began a rapid search in his pockets youve got that paper he cried hoarsely give it up and as he spoke john stumpy took a threatening step toward me  stand back and i raised the pistol  i was trembling in every limb but i actually believe i would have fired it if he had rushed upon me  i wont give up that paper  never ill die first  and die i would his earnestness convinced me of the letters worth if it contained that which could clear my fathers name only death would be the means of parting me from it  give it up i say do you think im to be defeated by a boy  stand back  i raised the pistol on a level with his head as i did so he made a dash forward and caught up a stick which was lying near  ill fix you he roared and swinging the billet over his head he brought it down with all his force on my arm causing the pistol to fly from my hand into a corner beyond  now well see whos master here he cried exultingly youre a smart boy but you dont know everything rushing over to the corner he secured the pistol and aimed it at me now well settle this matter according to my notions he went on triumphantly    chapter viii   the struggle  i was deeply chagrined at the unexpected turn affairs had taken and i felt decidedly uncomfortable as john stumpy levelled the weapon at my head i could readily see that the battle of words was at an end action was now the order of the day i wondered what the fellow would do next but i was not kept long in suspense  now its my turn young fellow he remarked with a shrewd grin as i fell back  well what do you want i asked as coolly as i could recognizing the fact that nothing was to be gained by stirring him up  youll see fast enough in the first place hand over that paper  i was silent i did not intend to tell a falsehood by saying i did not have it nor did i intend to give it up if it could possibly be avoided  did you hear what i said continued stumpy after a pause  i thought you said the paper wasnt valuable i returned more to gain time than anything else  neither it aint but just the same i want it come hand it over  he was getting ugly now and no mistake what was to be done  as i have mentioned before it would have been useless to call for help as no one would have heard the calls  suddenly the thought struck me to try a bit of deception i put my hand in my pocket and drew out the empty envelope  is that what you want i asked holding it up  reckon it is he returned eagerly just toss it over  somewhat disappointed that he did not approach me and thus give me a chance of attacking him i did as requested it fell at his feet and he was not long in transferring it to his pocket  next time dont try to walk over a man like me he said sharply i know a thing or two and im not to be downed by a boy  are you satisfied i asked calmly though secretly exultant that he had not discovered my trick  not yet you followed me when you had no business to and now youve got to take the consequences  what are you going to do  youll see soon enough i aint the one to make many mistakes years ago i made a few but i aint making no more  you knew my father quite well didnt you i inquired in deep curiosity  as the old saying goes ask me no questions and ill tell you no lies maybe i didnt maybe i did  i know you did  well what of it so did lots of other people  but not quite as well as you and nicholas weaver and mr aaron woodward i continued determined to learn all i could  ha what do you know of them he scowled at me reckon youve been reading that paper of nicks putty closely i was a fool for not tearing it up long ago  why did you keep it to deliver it to mr wentworth  it was a bold stroke and it told stumpy grew pale in spite of the dirt that covered his face and the hand that held the pistol trembled  say young fellow you know too much you do i suppose you read that paper clear through did you  as you say maybe i didnt maybe i did  perhaps you wasnt careful of it maybe id better examine it he added  my heart sank within me in another moment the deception i had practised would be known and then  he fumbled in his pocket and drew forth the envelope he could not extract the letter he supposed it contained with one hand very well and so lowered the pistol for a moment  this was my chance unarmed i was evidently in his power if i could only escape from the tool house  the door still stood partly open and the darkness of night for the moon had gone down was beyond a dash and i would be outside still the tramp stood between me and liberty should i attack him or endeavor to slip to one side  i had but an instant to think another and it would be too late john stumpy was fumbling in the envelope his eyes were searching for the precious document  with a single bound i sprang against him knocking him completely off his feet then i made another jump for the door  but he was too quick for me dropping the envelope and the pistol he caught me by the foot and in an instant both of us were rolling on the floor  it was an unequal struggle strong as i was for a boy of my age i was no match for this burly man turn and twist all i could he held me in his grip while he heaped loud imprecations upon my head  in our movements on the floor we came in contact with the lantern and upset it smashing the frame as well as the glass  for a moment darkness reigned then a tiny light from the corner lit up the place the flames had caught the shavings  the place is on fire i cried in horror  yes and you did it replied the tramp  it was you i returned stoutly and as a matter of fact it may be as well to state that john stumpys foot had caused the accident  not much it was your fault and youve got to take the blame  as the rascal spoke he caught me by the throat squeezing it so tightly that i was in great danger of being choked to death  let let up i gasped  the choking continued my head began to grow dizzy and strange lights danced before my eyes i protested against this proceeding as vigorously as i could by kicking the man sharply and rapidly  but stumpy now meant to do me real injury he realized that i knew too much for his future welfare in fact he no doubt imagined i knew far more than i really did if i was out of the way for all time so much the better for him  take that he suddenly cried and springing up he brought his heel down with great force on my head  i cannot describe the sensation that followed it was as if a sharp blinding pain had stung me to the very heart then my senses forsook me  how long i lay in a comatose state i do not know certainly it could not have been a very long time probably not over five or six minutes  in the meantime the fire rapidly spread igniting the barrels that were stored in the tool house and climbing up the walls of the building to the roof  when i recovered my senses my face was fairly scorched and no sooner had i opened my eyes than they were blinded by smoke and flame  by instinct rather than reason i staggered to my feet i was so weak i could hardly stand and my head spun around like a top where was the door  i tottered to one side and felt around there was the window tightly closed the door i knew was opposite  reeling i made my way through the smoke that now seemed to fill my lungs to where i knew the door to be oh horror it was closed and secured  heaven help me now burst from my parched lips am i to be roasted alive  with all my remaining strength i threw myself against the door once and again and still it did not budge  help help i called at the top of my voice  no answer came to my cry the fire behind me became hotter and hotter the roof had now caught and the sparks fell down upon me in a perfect shower  another moment and it would be all over with a brief prayer to god for help in my dire need i attacked the door for the last time  at first it did not budge then there was a creaking a sharp crack and at last it flew wide open  oh how grateful was the breath of fresh air that struck me i stumbled out into the clearing and opened wide my throat to take in the pure draught  then for the first time i realized how nearly i had been overcome i could no longer stand and swooning sank in a heap to the ground    chapter ix   new trouble  hes alive boys  these were the words that greeted my ears on recovering my senses i opened my eyes and saw that i was surrounded by a number of boys and men  how did you come here asked henry morse a sturdy farmer who lived in the neighborhood  i was too much confused to make any intelligent reply rising to a sitting position i gazed around  the tool house had burned to the ground there being no means at hand to extinguish the fire the glare of the conflagration had called out several dozens of people from darbyville and the vicinity several of whom had stumbled upon me as i lay in the clearing  whats the matter roger asked larry simpson a young man who kept a bookstore in the town  the matter is that i nearly lost my life in that fire i replied  how did you come here  as briefly as i could i related my story leaving out all references to my personal affairs and the finding of nicholas weavers statement at present i considered it would do no good to disclose what i knew on those points  i think i saw that tramp yesterday said larry after i had finished he bought a sheet of paper and an envelope in my store and then asked if he could write a letter there  and did he i asked in curiosity  yes at first i hated to let him do it he looked so disreputable but then i thought it might be an application for a position and so told him to go ahead  who did he write to do you know  somebody in chicago i think  do you remember the name  he tried the pen on a slip of paper first it wouldnt work very well but i think the name was holtzmann or something similar  i determined to remember the name thinking it might prove of value sometime  the thing of it is broke in henry morse what has become of this stumpy if he stole the widow canbys money its high time somebody was after him  thats true ejaculated another have you any idea which way the fellow went  of course i had not indeed i was hardly in condition to do any rational thinking much less form an opinion the thief might be in hiding close at hand or he might be miles away  some of us had better make a search put in another come boys well spread out and scour the woods  thats a good idea said tony parsons the constable of the town meanwhile roger strong let us go to judge penfolds house and put the case in his hands hell get out a warrant and perhaps a reward  i thought this was a good idea and readily assented first however getting one of the boys to promise that he would call at the widows house and quiet kates fears concerning my whereabouts  it was now early morning and we had no difficulty in making our way through the woods to the main road  guess we wont find the judge up yet remarked tony parsons as we hurried along ive never yet found him out of bed afore seven oclock it will make him mighty mad to get up afore this time  im sorry to disturb him i replied with something of awe at the thought of rousing a magistrate of the law  but its got to be done went on parsons with a grave shake of his head unless we all want to be murdered and robbed in our beds  thats true id give all im worth to catch that tramp  reckon widow canbyll be dreadfully cut up when she hears about the robbery  i suppose so  she may blame you roger you see if it was anybody else it would be different but being as its you why  i know what you mean i returned bitterly no one in darbyville believes i can be honest  i aint saying nothing against you roger returned parsons hastily i reckon you aint no worse than any other boy but you know what public sentiment is  so i do but public sentiment isnt always right was my spirited answer  who did you say those boys were that tied you up went on the constable to change the subject  duncan woodward was the principal one  phew reckon he didnt think tying you up would prove such a serious matter  if it hadnt been for that the robbery might have been prevented i would have been home guarding the widows property as she expected me to do  reckon so you would  in a certain sense i hold duncan woodward and his followers responsible for what has occurred  phew what will mr woodward say to that i wonder  i cant help what he says im not going to bear all the blame when it isnt my fault  no neither would i  at length we reached the outskirts of the town judge penfold lived at the top of what was termed the hill the aristocratic district of the place and thither we made our way  indeed but the judge aint stirring yet exclaimed the irish girl who came to answer our summons at the door  then wake him at once said parsons tell him there has been a most atrocious robbery and assault committed  mercy on us said the girl lifting up her hands in horror and who was it mr parsons  never mind who it was go at once  i will that robbery and assault mercy on us  and leaving us standing in the hall the hired girl sped up the front stairway  the judge will be down as soon as he can she reported on her return  we waited as patiently as we could while doing so i revolved what had occurred over in my mind and came to the conclusion that the crime would be a difficult one to trace john stumpy had probably made good use of his time knowing that even if i had lost my life in the fire my sister would still recognize him as the thief  suddenly i thought of the written confession that must yet remain in my pocket and i was on the point of assuring myself that it was still safe when a heavy footstep sounded overhead and judge penfold came down  the judge was a tall slender men of fifty with hollow cheeks a pointed nose and a sharp chin his voice was of a peculiarly high and rasping tone and his manner far from agreeable  whats the trouble he demanded and it was plain to see that he did not relish having his early morning sleep broken  widow canbys house was robbed last night replied the constable and he gave the particulars  judge penfold was all ears at once indeed it may be as well to state that he was a widower and had paid widow canby much attention which however i well knew that good lady heartily resented no doubt he thought if he could render her any assistance it would help along his suit  we must catch the fellow at once he said parsons you must catch him without fail  easier said than done judge replied the constable doubtfully where am i to look for him the country around here is pretty large  no matter you are constable and it is your duty to seek him out i will sign the warrant for his arrest and you must have him in jail by tonight without fail  ill do what i can judge returns parsons meekly  strong ill have to bind you over as a witness  bind me over i queried in perplexity what do you mean  hold you unless you can give a bond to appear when wanted  but i had nothing to do with the burglary  you are principal accuser of this john stumpy  well ill promise to be on hand whenever wanted  that is not sufficient your character is is not ahem of the best and  why is my character not of the best i demanded  well ahem your father you see  is innocent  perhaps perhaps but nevertheless i will have to hold you parsons i will leave him in your charge  you have no right to arrest me i cried for i knew very little of the law  whats that demanded judge penfold pompously you forget i am the judge of that  i dont care i burst out i have done no wrong  it aint that roger many innocent men are held as witnesses put in parsons  but ive got to attend to mrs canbys business i explained  i fancy mrs canby would rather get on the track of her money said judge penfold severely can you furnish bail  i did not know that i could the woman who had been robbed was my only friend and she was away  then youll have to take him to the lockup parsons  this news was far from agreeable it would be no pleasant thing to be confined in the darbyville jail not to say anything of the anxiety it might cause kate besides i wanted to follow up john stumpy i was certain i could do it fully as well as the constable  come roger there is no help for it said parsons as i still lingered its the law and it wont do any good to kick  maybe not but nevertheless it isnt fair  we walked out into the front hall the judge following us  of course if you can get bail any time during the day i will let you go he said i will be down in my office from nine to twelve and two to four  will you offer a reward for the capture of the man i asked  i cannot do that the freeholders of the county attend to all such matters parsons no doubt will find the scoundrel  as the judge finished there was a violent ringing of the door bell judge penfold opened the door and was confronted by mr aaron woodward who looked pale and excited  judge i want you hello that boy judge i want that boy arrested at once dont you let him escape  want me arrested i ejaculated in astonishment what for  you know well enough you thought to hide your tracks but i have found you out parsons dont let him get out of the door hes a worse villain than his father was    chapter x   under arrest  i will not hesitate to state that i was nearly stunned by mr aaron woodwards unexpected statement i knew that when he announced that i was a worse villain than my father he meant a good deal  yet try as hard as i could it was impossible for me to discover what he really did mean i was not conscious of having done him any injury either bodily or otherwise indeed of late i had hardly seen the man the widow canby was not partial to dealings with him and i never went near him on my own account  it was plain to see that the merchant was thoroughly aroused his face was pale with anger and the look he cast upon me was one of bitter resentment for the instant he eyed me as if he intended to spring upon me and choke the life out of my body and involuntarily i shrank back but then i recollected that the minions of the law who stood beside me would not allow such a course of procedure and this made me breathe more freely  yes sir hes a worse villain than his father repeated mr aaron woodward turning to judge penfold a most accomplished villain sir and he shook his fist within an inch of my nose  what have i done to you mr woodward i demanded as soon as i could speak  done sir you know very well what youve done you young rascal puffed the merchant oh but ill make you pay dearly for your villainy  ive committed no villainy i returned warmly if you refer to the way i treated duncan this morning why all ive got to say is that it was his own fault and i can prove it  treated duncan oh pshaw this is far more serious affair than a boys quarrel dont let him escape parsons the last to the constable who had his hand on my shoulder  no fear sir was parsons reply hes already under arrest  under arrest repeated the merchant quickly then youve already heard  he is ahem only under detention as a witness spoke up judge penfold i do not think he had anything to do with the theft of the widows money  widows money what do you mean  in a few words judge penfold explained the situation isnt this what you came about he asked then  indeed no sir my affair is far more important at least to me but you can make up your mind that strongs story is purely fiction he is undoubtedly the real culprit undoubtedly takes after his father  my father was an honest man i cried out i dont care what you or any one may say some day he will be cleared of the stain on his name  oh undoubtedly sneered mr woodward mean while however the community at large had better keep a sharp eye on his son whom do you assert stole the widow canbys money  a tramp  humph a likely story  its true his name was john stumpy  john stumpy  as mr aaron woodwind uttered the name all the color forsook his face  yes sir and he claimed to know you i went on my curiosity amused over the merchants show of feeling  its a falsehood i never heard of such a man cried mr woodward but his face belied his words  well what is your charge against strong asked judge penfold impatiently probably tired of being so utterly ignored in the discussion  the merchant hesitated  i prefer to speak to you about the matter in private he said sourly  that isnt fair he ought to tell me what i am accused of i cried every one who is arrested has a right to know that i have done no wrong and i am not afraid  all assumed bravery judge penfold quite assumed sir  no sir tell me why you want me locked up i repeated  but instead of replying mr woodward drew judge penfold to the rear end of the hall and began to speak in so low a tone that i could not catch a word  you dont mean it i heard the judge say presently come into the library and give me the particulars  the two men passed into the room closing the door tightly behind them they were gone nearly quarter of an hour a long wait for me i wondered what could be the nature of mr woodwards accusation against me but failed to solve the mystery  at length they came out judge penfolds face was a trifle sterner than before mr woodward looked pleased as if his argument had proven conclusive  you will take strong to the jail at once said the judge to parsons and tell booth to be careful of his prisoner  yes sir  dont let him escape added aaron woodward anxiously dont let him escape sir under any circumstances  no fear was parsonss ready answer i never had one of em give me the slip yet  and with great gravity he drew from his pocket a pair of ancient handcuffs one of which he attached to my wrist and the other to his own  come roger better take it easy he said no use of kicking march  but id like to know something about this i protested what right  it is all quite legal put in judge penfold pompously i understand the law perfectly  but  say no more parsons take him away  i shall see you later whispered mr woodward in my ear as the constable hurried me off  the next instant we were on the street arrests in darbyville were rare and by the time we reached the jail we had a goodly following of boys and idle men all anxious to know what was up  he stole the widow canbys money i heard one man whisper to which another replied  light fingered eh must take after his father i always knew the strongs couldnt be trusted  the jail was a small affair being nothing more than the loft over a carpenter shop the jailer was a roundfaced man named booth who filled in his spare time by doing odd jobs of carpentering in the shop downstairs we found him hard at work glueing some doors together i knew him tolerably well and he evinced considerable surprise at seeing me in custody  what roger arrested what for  thats what i would like to know i returned  in a few words parsons told him what was to be done and booth led the way upstairs   taint a very secure place he returned reckon ill have to nail down some of the windows unless youll give me your word not to run away  ill promise nothing was my reply im being treated unfairly and i shall do as i think best  then ill fasten everything as tight as a drum returned booth  going below he secured a hammer and some nails with which he secured the windows and the scuttle on the roof  reckon its tight enough now he said just wait parsons till i get him a bucket of water  this was done and then the two men left me closing and locking the door of the enclosed staircase behind them  the loft was empty saving a nail keg that stood in one corner of the floor pulling this out i sat down to think matters over  try my best i could not imagine what charge mr aaron woodward had brought against me yet such had been his earnestness that for the nonce everything else was driven from my mind  the sounds of talking below interrupted my meditations i recognized kates voice and the next moment my sister stood beside me  oh roger was all she could say and catching me by the arm she burst into tears  dont take it so hard kate i said make sure it will all come out right in the end  but to be arrested like like a thief oh roger it is dreadful  never mind i have done no wrong and im not afraid of the result have they heard anything of john stumpy yet  dick blair says not mr parsons and the rest are after him but he seems to have disappeared for good and mrs canbys money with him  have you heard from her yet  no but ive written her a letter and just posted it to norfolk  she wont get it till day after tomorrow  what will she say oh roger do you think  no i dont the widow always trusted me and i know shell take my word now she is not so narrowminded as the very folks who look down on her  but it is awful over two hundred dollars we can never make it up weve only got twentyeight  we cant exactly be called upon to make it up i began  but well want to put in kate hastily  id feel better if we did the widow has always been so kind to us  how long must you stay here  i dont know as long as judge penfold sees fit i suppose  if only they could catch this john stumpy  i hope so for other reasons than those you know kate  other reasons  yes very important ones too john stumpy knew father well and he was mixed up in that that miserable affair  oh roger how do you know  i heard him say so besides he dropped a letter that proved it i have the letter in my pocket now its the dying statement of one nicholas weaver  nicholas weaver he was a clerk with father  so i thought who stumpy is though i dont know do you  no but his face im sure ive seen before let me see the letter have you read it  no i hadnt time to spell it out it is so badly written maybe you can read it  ill try replied kate hand it over  i put my hand in my pocket to do so the statement was gone    chapter xi   aaron woodwards visit  puzzled and dismayed i made a rapid search of my clothes first one pocket and then another it was useless beyond a doubt the statement was nowhere about my person  i was quite sure it had not been taken from me strange as it may seem neither parsons nor booth had searched me perhaps they deemed it useless to take away the possessions of a poor country boy my jackknife and other odds and ends were still in their accustomed places  its gone i gasped when i was certain that such was a fact  gone repeated kate  yes gone and i dont know where they didnt take it from me i must have lost it  oh roger and it was so important  i know it kate it must have dropped from my pocket down at the tool house perhaps if i go down i can find it  go down she queried  oh i forgot i was a prisoner  never mind roger ill go down myself  arent you afraid  not now i wouldnt have been of this stumpy only he came on me so suddenly ill go at once  youd better said a voice behind her your five minutes is up miss kate and booth appeared at the head of the stairs and motioned her down  goodby roger im so sorry to leave you here alone  its not such a dreadful place i rejoined lightly if you discover anything let me know at once  be sure i will and with this assurance kate was gone  i was as sorry for her as i was for myself i knew all she would have to face in public the mean things people would say to her the snubbing she would be called on to bear  the loss of the statement rendered me doubly downhearted oh how much i had counted on it assuring myself over and over again that it would surely clear my fathers name  hardly had my sister left me than there were more voices below and i heard mr woodward tell booth that he had an order from judge penfold for a private interview with me  better go right upstairs then mr woodward was the jailers reply hes all alone  i wondered what the merchants visit could portend but had little time for speculation  so sir theyve got you fast said mr woodward sharply as he faced me fast and no mistake  what do you want i demanded boldly coming at once to the front  what do i want repeated the merchant looking behind him to make sure that booth had not followed him what do i want why i want to help you strong thats what i want  i could not help but smile the idea of mr woodward helping any one least of all myself  the only way you can help me is to set me free i returned  oh i cant do that you are held on the canby charge solely  but you told me you wanted me arrested  so i did but i intend to give you a chance that is if you will do what i want  but why did you want me arrested  you know well enough strong  on the contrary i havent the least idea  stuff and nonsense see here if you want to get off without further trouble hand over those papers  what papers  the papers you took last night replied mr woodward sharply  i was truly astonished how in the world had he found out about the statement dropped by stumpy was it possible there had been a meeting between the two it looked like it  i havent got the papers i rejoined  dont tell me a falsehood sir he thundered  its true  do you deny you have the packet  i do  come strong that story wont answer hand it over  i havent it  where is it  i lost it i replied before i had time to think  lost it he cried anxiously  yes sir i returned boldly resolved to make the best of it now the cat was out of the bag either that or it was stolen from me  he looked at me in silence for a moment  do you expect me to believe all your lies he demanded finally  i dont care what you believe i answered i tell the truth and one question i want to ask you aaron woodward why are you so anxious to gain possession of nicholas weavers dying statement  the merchant gave a cry of astonishment nay horror he turned pale and glared at me fiercely  nicholas weavers dying statement he ejaculated what do you know of nicholas weaver  now i had spoken i was almost sorry i had said what i had yet i could not but notice the tremendous effect my words had produced  never mind what i know i replied why do you take an interest in it  i i dont know anything about it he faltered i hardly knew nicholas weaver  indeed yet you want his statement  no i dont i dont know anything about his statement he continued doggedly i want my papers i dont care a rap about any one elses  it was now my turn to be astonished evidently i had been on the wrong track from the beginning  if you dont want his statement im sure i dont know what you do want i rejoined and i spoke the exact truth  dont tell lies strong you know well enough hand them over  hand what over  the packet of papers  i havent any packet  strong if you dont do as i demand ill send you to prison after your father  i cant help it i havent any papers if you dont believe me search me  where have you hidden them  i never had them to hide  i know better sir i know better he fumed  i made no reply what could i say  do you hear me strong  for reply i walked over to the slatted window and began to whistle my action only increased the merchants anger  for the last time strong will you give up the papers he cried  for the last time mr woodward let me say i havent got them never had them and therefore cannot possibly give them up  then you shall go to prison sir mark my word you shall go to prison  and with this parting threat the merchant hurried down the loft steps and rapped loudly for booth to come and let him out  when he was gone i sat down again to think over the demand he had made upon me to what papers did he refer in vain i cudgelled my brain to elicit an answer  he spoke about sending me to prison and in such tones as if it were an easy matter to do assuredly he must have some grounds upon which to base so positive an assertion  no doubt he was now on his way to judge penfolds office to swear out the necessary papers i did not know much about the law but i objected strongly to going to prison once in a regular lockup the chances of getting out would be indeed slim  i reasoned that the best thing to do was to escape while there was a chance perhaps i was wrong in this conclusion but i was only a country boy and i had a horror of stone walls and iron bars  escape no sooner had the thought entered my mind than i was wrapped up in it undoubtedly it was the best thing to do freedom meant not only liberty but also a chance to hunt down john stumpy and clear my fathers name  i looked about the loft for the best means of accomplishing my purpose as i have said the place was over a carpenter shop the roof was sloping to the floor and at each end was a small window heavily slatted  the distance to the ground from the window was not less than fifteen feet rather a long drop even if i could manage to get the slats loose which i doubted for i had no tools at hand  i resolved to try the door and was about to do so when i heard the bolts shoot back and booth appeared  for an instant i thought to trip him up and rush past him but he stood on the steps completely blocking the way  all right roger he asked  yes sir  quite comtable boy  as comfortable as any one could be in such a place i rejoined lightly   taint exactly a parlor he chuckled no easy chairs or sofys but the foods good im agoing to get it for you now then after that maybe the judge will call around ill bring the dinner in a minute  he climbed downstairs bolting the door after him  in five minutes or ten at the most i knew he would be back after that there was no telling how long he would stay  now therefore was the proper time to escape now or never    chapter xii   a surprise  no time must be lost booth lived but a short hundred feet from the jail if such it might be called and if his wife had dinner ready it would not take him long to bring it  i surveyed the room in which i was incarcerated critically escape by either window was as i have intimated out of the question on account of its height the scuttle was also not to be considered  apparently nothing remained to try but the door running down the steps i looked it over it was of solid oak planking an inch thick and fastened at both top and bottom  it was a hard thing to tackle especially with no tools and after surveying it i went upstairs again to search for something that might do as a pry  i could see nothing but the empty nail keg and i could discover no use at first in this until the idea struck me of wedging it between one of the lower steps and the door and by jumping upon it forcing the bottom bolt  with some difficulty i placed the keg in position and brought down my full weight upon it the first time the bolt merely creaked but the second there was a snap and the lower part of the door burst outward several inches  the bottom bolt had yielded and now only the top one remained but to reach this was a difficult matter as no purchase could be had against it  while considering the situation i imagined i heard my jailer returning and my heart jumped into my throat what if booth should see the damage i had done i reckoned that things would go hard with me if it became known that i had attempted to break jail judge penfold would surely give me the full penalty of the law  but the approach of booth was only imaginary and after a brief interval of silence i breathed freer  i ascends the stairs once more to see if i could not find something besides the keg to assist me if only i had a plank or a beam i might use it as a batteringram  the thought of a plank led me to examine the floor and going over it carefully i soon came to a short board one end of which was loose raising it i pulled with all my might and the board came up  i was astonished to see that it made an opening into the shop below i had imagined that the floor or ceiling was of double thickness  this gave me a new idea why not escape through the floor to pry up another board would perhaps be easier than to force the door  i tried the board next to the opening the end was somewhat rotted and it came up with hardly an effort  in another moment the opening would be large enough to allow the passage of my body putting the first board under the edge of the second i bore down upon it  as i did so i heard a noise that alarmed me greatly it was the sound of booth returning and the next instant the carpenter had opened the outer door and entered  in one hand he carried a tray containing my dinner he crossed the floor directly under me without looking up then his eyes caught the shattered door and he gave a loud exclamation  by ginger if that boy aint gone and escaped  he set down the tray with a rattle and tried to pull the door open but the top bolt had become displaced and it was several seconds before it could be shot back  meanwhile i was not idle as quietly as i could i tore up the second board the deed was done just as booth stumbled over the keg on his way up the stairs  as my jailer appeared at the top i let my body through the opening it was a tight squeeze especially when accomplished in a hurry i landed in a heap on a pile of shavings  stop stop called out booth roger dont you hear me  i certainly did hear him but paid no attention to his words my one thought was to get away as quickly as possible  if you dont stop ill shoot you went on booth at the top of his voice dont you know breaking jail is a a felony  i did not know what kind of a crime it was i had made up my mind to escape and intended to do so even if such a deed constituted manslaughter i made a break for the door and passed out just as booth came tramping down the stairs  i ran across the yard that separated the carpenter shop from the house as i did so mrs booth appeared at the back door upon seeing me she held up her hands in horror  mercy on us roger strong where be you arunning to zekel zekel the prisoners broke loose  i know it mandy i heard ezekiel booth answer dunno how he did it though stop roger its best now jest you mark my word  i heard no more jumping the side fence i ran through a bit of orchard and across a stony lot until i reached the pass river  at this point this body of water was several hundred feet wide the bank sloped directly to the waters edge near at hand were several private boathouses one belonging to mr aaron woodward he having built it to please duncan  at the end of the boathouse pier lay a skiff the oars resting upon the seats i knew it was wrong to make use of the craft but necessity knows no law and my need was great  running down to the end of the pier i dropped into the boat and shoved off as i did so duncan woodward accompanied by pultzer came out of the boathouse  hi there what are you doing in my boat he sang out what roger strong he continued as he came nearer  you must lend me the boat duncan i returned ive got to cross the river in a hurry  not much i thought you were in jail  not just now i replied you can get your boat on the other side  hold up you shant have her come back  but i was already pulling out into the stream he continued to shout after me and presently i saw the two joined by booth and all watched me in dismay as i made for the opposite shore  reaching the bank i beached the boat high up and then climbed to the roadway that ran beside the stream trees and bushes were thick here and i had but little difficulty in hiding from the view of those opposite  for a moment i hesitated as to which way to proceed a number of miles down the stream lay newville of which i have already spoken probably my pursuers would think i had gone in that direction if so they would hasten to the bridge below with the intention of cutting me off  i therefore started immediately on my way up the river road resolved to put as much ground as possible between myself and my pursuers i had no definite destination in view but thought to gain some hidingplace where i might rest secure and think things over  it was now going on to two oclock in the afternoon and as i had not had anything to eat since the noon previous i began to feel decidedly hungry i felt in my pocket and discovered that i was the possessor of sixtyfive cents and with this amount of cash i did not see any reason for my remaining hungry any longer  presently i came to a small white cottage upon the front porch of which was displayed the sign                                 boarding  ascending the steps i knocked at the door and a comely middleaged woman answered my summons  i see that you take boarders here i said i am hungry and several miles from any restaurant can you furnish me with dinner  she looked me over rather sharply before replying then i realize for the first time that my appearance was not of the best my clothes were considerably the worse for having rolled over and over in the old tool house and in escaping from my prison i had made several rents in my coat  i will pay you whatever you charge i added hastily and i would like to wash and brush up too i have had a tumble which was literally true  i can let you have dinner for twentyfive cent she said finally i wont charge you anything for cleaning up she added with something like a smile will you mind paying in advance  no maam and i handed over the money i suppose i wont have to wait very long  oh no the regular boarders have just finished you can sit right down  if you dont mind ill take a wash first  the woman led the way to an anteroom in which were placed a bowl of water towel and soap as well as a dust brush it did not take me long to fix myself up and then i flattered myself i did not present an unbecoming appearance  the dinner that the woman served was not as good as that which my sister kate helped to prepare at the widow canbys but it was wholesome food and my sharpened appetite made it disappear rapidly  as i ate i reflected upon my situation for the life of me i did not know what to do next i longed to see my sister and tell her that i was safe this done i intended to devote my time to hunting up the man who i firmly believed held my fathers reputation in his hand i was sure i would discover him sooner or later and this accomplished i would not let him out of my sight until he had confessed his secret i wondered if kate had succeeded in finding that precious statement i had lost heartily did i reproach myself for not having taken better care of it  having satisfied myself upon the substantial things set before me i finished my meal with a small cut of apple pie  as i was swallowing the last mouthful i glanced out of the window up the road and gave a cry of surprise and no wonder for coming toward the house was mr aaron woodward and beside him walked john stumpy    chapter xiii   an interesting conversation  i could hardly believe the evidence of my senses when i saw mr aaron woodward coming up the road with john stumpy beside him it would have astonished me to have seen the merchant alone but to see him in company with the very man i was looking for was more than i had thought possible  yet i reflected that the tramp or whatever the man was had evinced a determination to secure an interview with mr woodward before quitting darbyville there was important business to be transacted between them mr john stumpy intended to have his say whatever that might mean  what was to be done it would never do for me to be seen nothing short of arrest would follow i must get out of the way as quickly as possible  during the time i had been eating the sky had become overcast as if a shower was imminent taking advantage of this fact i rose quickly and reached for my hat  guess were going to have a thunder shower i remarked hope it holds off i dont want to get wet  then youll have to hurry rejoined the woman as she looked out of the door looks as if it would be here in less than quarter of an hour  then im off good day  good day come again  i slipped out of the door and passing behind a hedge made my way to the road as i did so mr woodward and stumpy turned from the highway and walked directly up the gravel path that led to the house  i was dumfounded by this movement what did they mean by going to the very place i had just vacated was it possible they had seen me  i earnestly hoped not for if so it would spoil a little plan that had just come to me which was to follow them see what they were up to and if possible overhear whatever might be said  i was soon convinced that neither of the men was aware of my presence they were talking earnestly and stepped up on the porch just as ordinary visitors would have done in a moment the woman let them in and the door closed behind them  my curiosity was aroused to its highest pitch and at the risk of being discovered by any one who might chance to be passing by i walked cautiously back along the hedge until i reached a clump of rose bushes that grew directly under one of the diningroom windows  the window was open and by a little manoeuvring i easily managed to see and hear what was going on within  you came for the rent i suppose mr woodward the woman was saying joel was going to bring it up tonight he would have brought it over this morning only he thought it was going to rain and he had some hay he wanted to get in  yes i did come for the rent mrs decker replied the merchant its due several days now  i have it here thirty dollars here is the receipt book  there was the rustle of bills and the scratching of a pen  here you are mrs decker  thank you sir now well be worry free for another month  so you are nothing like being prompt  my husband was going to speak to you about the roof it leaks dreadfully  pooh that cant be why it was patched only two years ago  you are wrong mr woodward it is four years and then but very little was done to it  it cost near twelve dollars growled the merchant you cant expect me to be fixing up the house all the time  it leaks very badly  then your husband will have to attend to it i cant spend any more money this year  i dont know what well do i wish you would just step outside and look up at the shingles nearly all of them are ready to fall off  i was alarmed by mrs deckers request suppose the trio should come out i would surely be discovered but my fears were groundless as the next words of mr woodward proved  i cant go out now madam not now i havent time i have a little business to transact with this man and then i must return to darbyville  im sorry began the woman  so am i but it cannot be helped can i use this room for a while  by the look upon mrs deckers face it was plain to see she wanted to say no you cant but she hardly dared to speak the words so she gave an icy assent and withdrew  the merchant followed her to the door and saw that it was closed tightly behind her then he strode across the room and faced john stumpy  wall sir now well have an accounting he began in an authoritative voice  so we will woody returned john stumpy in no wise abashed by the others manner  the merchant winced at the use of a nickname but after an instants hesitation passed it over  what do you mean by coming to darbyville sir when i have repeatedly written you to stay away  oh come woody dont get on your high horse was stumpys response as he swung back in the rocker he occupied you know i never could stand your hightoned ways  i flatter myself i am a trifle above common people returned mr woodward and it was plain to see where duncan got his arrogant manner  oh pshaw dont make me tired yawned stumpy come lets to business  i am at business why did you come here  you know well enough didnt i write to you  yes and got my answer weve squared up accounts sir  dont sir me it dont go down cried stumpy angrily we havent squared up not by a jugful not till you hand over some more cash  ive handed over enough now  no you haint do you think im going to do all your work for nothing  you were well paid  its only you as thinks so i dont  how much more do you want  a thousand dollars  the largeness of the demand fairly took away my breath as for mr aaron woodward he was beside himself  a thousand dollars he said why youre crazy sir  no i aint i mean just what i say  you expect me to pay you a thousand dollars  of course i do i wouldnt ask it if i didnt  see here fer  sh john stumpy if you please  thats so i forgot but see here a thousand dollars why ive already paid you that  so you have now i want another thousand and then well cry quits  mr aaron woodward grew white with rage i never heard of such an outrageous demand he cried ill never pay it  oh yes you will rejoined the other coolly aaron woodward never yet acted rashly  suppose i refuse to pay  better not im a bad man when i am aroused  i dont fear you you can do nothing to me  oh yes i can i can tell ugly stories about mr aaron woodward stories concerning his doings when he was collector for holland  mack  and who would believe you sneered the merchant you a common tramp  tramp am i interrupted john stumpy with a scowl if i am who made me so  your own self and the bottle do you think you can hurt me nonsense  i can try  and who will believe you i repeat a common tramp whom the police are now hunting for because of a robbery that occurred only last night   taint so  it is you broke into the widow canbys house and stole over two hundred dollars  in spite of the dirt on his face john stumpy grew pale  who can prove it  several people carson strongs son for one  stumpy sprang to his feet then almost as suddenly sat down  didnt know he had a son he said as carelessly as he could  yes you did returned the merchant flatly i think fer stumpy i know a little more about you than you do about me  bitter hatred spread itself over the tramps face  oh ho you do do you well well see them laughs best as laughs last if you wont pay im off  he rose to his feet and reached for his hat mr woodward intercepted him  where are you going  thats my business i want you to know i didnt come on all the way from chicago for nothing  are you hard up  yes i am i want money and im going to have it  how about the two hundred dollars you stole last night  stumpy hesitated  well if you want to know the truth i lost the money he said    chapter xiv   the price of silence  for a moment i was staggered by john stumpys announcement was it possible he was telling the truth if so the chances of recovering the widow canbys money would assume a different shape to arrest him would prove a moral satisfaction but it would not restore the stolen dollars  occupying the position i did i was more interested in restoring the stolen money than i was in having the tramp incarcerated  nothing would have given me greater satisfaction than to have met the widow canby at the depot with the two hundred odd dollars in my pocket it would have silenced the public tongue and made my breaking jail of no consequence  but perhaps john stumpy was telling a falsehood he was not above such a thing and would not hesitate if he thought anything could be gained thereby that mr aaron woodward also guessed such to be a fact was proven by the words that followed stumpys statement  lost the money he ejaculated do you expect me to believe you sir  its true  nonsense sir jack fer  sh  john stumpy isnt the one to lose over two hundred dollars  just what i always said myself partner and  dont partner  me sir  well wasnt we all partners in the good times gone by  no sir  i reckon we were howsomever let it pass well as i was saying i reckoned id never lose any money leasewise a small pile but thats what i have done and thats why i want you to come down  and john stumpy leaned back in the rocker in a defiant fashion  the merchant eyed him sharply in silence for a moment  where did you lose the money he asked at length  how do i know if i did dont you suppose id go back and pick it up  i thought perhaps you were afraid of discovery  humph im not skeered of any such constables as they have in darbyville  but you must have some idea where you dropped it went on mr woodward and i was astonished to see how coolly this man who always pretended to be so straightforward could inquire about stolen money  not the least responded john stumpy there was two hundred and sixty dollars in all i took out ten and left the rest in the pocketbook it was in ive got the ten dollars and thats all and thats why youve got to come down he went on deliberately im off for chicago tonight and im not going back empty handed  you think i ought to pay you for your own carelessness returned mr woodward coolly  not a bit of it you owe me every cent i ask  i dont owe you a penny  you owe me a thousand dollars and for the last time let me tell you youve got to pay or take the consequences and john stumpy brought his fist down on the table with a bang  hold on dont make so much noise cried mr aaron woodward in alarm there is no use of rousing the household  i dont care either youll come down or ill rouse the whole of darbyville cried the tramp vehemently  i havent any money  you cant tell me that  its true times are getting worse every day  didnt the woman who lives here just pay you  yes thirty dollars  and didnt you put the bills in with a big roll in your vest pocket went on stumpy triumphantly  the merchant bit his lip  that money is to pay a bill that falls due tomorrow he replied  well my bill falls due today and its got to be met so come no more beating about the bush weve talked long enough now to business do you intend to pay or not  the merchant hesitated evidently he was afraid to oppose the other too strongly  well i dont want to let you go without anything he began ill let you have twentyfive dollars  john stumpy jumped up in a passion that settles it im done with you tonight ill send a letter to chris holtzmann 897 sherman street chicago and tell him a few things he wants to know and  you dare almost shrieked mr woodward write a single word to him and ill ill  so ho youre afraid of him are you  no im not but whats the use of letting him know anything  humph do you suppose id tell him without pay not much i can easily get him to fork over fifty or a hundred dollars and hell make you pay it back ten times over  mr aaron woodward sank back in a chair without a word evidently he was completely baffled and knew not which way to turn  as for myself i was very much in the dark as to what all this was about i was certain the past events spoken of pertained to my fathers affairs but failed to make connections  one thing however i did do and that was to make a note of mr chris holtzmanns address he was the man stumpy had written to just previous to the robbery and he was perhaps one of the persons concerned in my fathers downfall  see here said the merchant at last its too late for us to quarrel what good would an exposure to holtzmann do  never mind if you wont come to time i shall do as i please growled stumpy  but a thousand dollars i havent got it in cash  you can easily get it  not so easily as you think tell you what i will do ill give you a hundred but you must give up all evidence you have against me  stumpy gave a short contemptuous laugh you must think me as green as grass he sneered im not giving up any evidence im holding on to all ive got and gathering more  you have nicholas weavers statement went on mr woodward with interest  so i have nick told the truth in it too  i would like to see it  of course you would so would some other people carson strongs boy for instance  sh not so loud  well then dont bring the subject up  have you the statement with you  maybe i havent maybe i have  perhaps it was taken from you went on mr woodward curiously  what do you know about that stumpy again jumped to his feet youve been talking to that strong boy he cried  supposing i have  well it didnt do you no good say how much does the young cub know  he knows too much for the good of either of us responded the merchant  sorry he wasnt found in the ruins of that tool house growled the tramp savagely  this was certainly a fine assertion for me to hear yet it was no more than i would expect from john stumpy he was a villain through and through  you meant to burn him up did you asked mr woodward  and if i had mr aaron woodward would never have shed a tear laughed john stumpy  let me see the statement  john stumpy hesitated hand over the money first and maybe i will  the hundred dollars  no a thousand  do you suppose i carry so much money with me  give me what you have in that roll and ill take your word for the rest  the merchant gave something that sounded very much like a groan  well i suppose if you insist on it i must he said ill give you what i have but i wont promise you any more  hand it over was stumpys laconic reply he probably thought half a loaf better than no bread at all  with a heavy sigh mr woodward drew the roll of bills from his pocket and began to count them over i was eager to catch sight of them i stood on tiptoe and peered into the window it was an interesting scene the sour look upon the merchants face the look of greed in the tramps eye in a moment the counting was finished  a hundred and seventy dollars said mr aaron woodward here you are and he held them out stumpy almost snatched them from his hand  there now thats settled he said now about what was that  a noise had disturbed him while absorbed in what the two were doing i had given an involuntary cough  somebody listening he declared as he thrust the money into his pocket  we ought to be more careful  only some one coughing in the next room returned mr woodward dont get scared  i aint scared but i dont want other folks to know my business reckon you dont either  no indeed its bad enough for me to be seen in your company returned mr aaron woodward with just a trace of his former lofty manner  no insinuations please was the ready reply my hands aint any dirtier than yours  well well lets stop quarrelling let me see the statement  will you promise to hand it back if i do  why not let me have it  never mind why will you give it back  if you insist on it you shall have it back was mr woodwards final reply seeing that he could gain nothing by parleying  stumpy drew forth the envelope i anticipated what was coming  here it is he said and handed it over as he supposed  the envelope is empty said mr woodward  stumpy looked dumfounded    chapter xv   an odd statement  before mr woodward made the announcement just recorded he had walked close up to the window probably to get into the light for the sky was now darkening rapidly portending the near breaking out of the storm i have mentioned  in doing this the merchants back was turned upon his companion and for an instant stumpy had been unable to see what the other was doing  when therefore mr woodward declared the envelope to be empty every action of the tramp indicated that he did not believe the statement  empty he cried hoarsely  yes empty replied the merchant and you knew it he added  no such thing the statement was inside woody youre trying to play a sharp game but it wont work  what do you mean sir  youre trying to rob me  nonsense i say the envelope was empty  and i say it wasnt come hand over my property  i tell you fer stumpy i havent it  i dont care what you say you cant play any such game off on me rejoined john stumpy with increasing anger  im only speaking the truth  you aint hand it over or ill  john stumpy caught the merchant by the coat collar  what would you do cried mr woodward in alarm and it was plain to see he was a coward at heart  ill choke the life out of you thats what ill do hand over the statement  i havent it upon my honor  your honor bah what does that amount to  john stumpy suddenly shifted his hand from its grasp on the collar to the merchants throat for a moment i thought mr woodward was in danger of being choked to death  stop stop se search me if you you want to he gasped  but john stumpys passion seemed to have got the better of his reason he did not relax his hold in the least  a short struggle ensued the two backed up against the table and presently a chair was upset of course all this made considerable noise yet neither of the men heeded it  presently the door from the other room swung open and the two had hardly time to separate before a tall lank farmer entered  hello whats up he asked in a loud drawling tone  for an instant neither spoke evidently not knowing what to say  we were were ahem trying to to catch a rat replied mr woodward with an effort  a rat  exactly sir had a terrible time with him mr decker  the farmer looked surprised so i supposed by the row that was going on he said curious i knew there were rats down to the barn but i didnt suppose they came up to the house what became of him  slipped out of the door just now put in john stumpy there he goes he added pointing out into the hall  mr decker made a spring out of the room  i must ketch him by gopher he cried theres enough eat up here now without having the vermin taking a hand in  mr woodward closed the door after the man  now see to what your actions have brought us he exclaimed if it hadnt been for my quick wit wed been in a pretty mess  not my fault growled john stumpy why dont you give up the statement  i could not help but feel amused at his persistency his demands upon the merchant were about on a footing with those mr woodward had made upon me  if youll only listen to reason began the merchant i will prove  the rest of his remark was drowned out in a clap of thunder somewhat startled i looked up at the sky  the black clouds in the south had rolled up rapidly until now the entire horizon was covered the first burst of thunder was succeeded directly by several others and then large drops of rain began to fall  the wind blew the drops directly into the window i crouched down out of sight and the next moment mr woodward said  its raining in the window wed better close it up  of course directly the window was closed i could hear no longer i remained in my position for half a minute or more and then as the rain began to pour down rapidly i made a break for better shelter  i sought the barn it was a low rambling structure with great wide doors no one seemed to be around and i rushed in without ceremony i was pretty fairly soaked but as it was warm i did not mind the ducking i shook out my hat and coat and then sat down to think matters over  what i had heard had not given me much satisfaction to be sure it had proved beyond a doubt that mr aaron woodward was a thorough scoundrel but of this i had been already satisfied in my own mind  what was i to do i had asked myself that question several times and now i asked it again  if only i could get john stumpy arrested perhaps it would be possible to force him to make a confession but how was this to be done  while i sat on the edge of a feed box a form darkened the doorway and farmer decker appeared  hello he exclaimed what are you doing here  i took the liberty to come in out of the rain i replied have you any objections to my remaining until the shower is over  no guess not its a mighty heavy one wherere you from newville  no sir darbyville  yes had quite a robbery down there i understand  is that so  yes a chap named strong robbed an old woman of nearly five hundred dollars do you know him or the woman  i know the woman quite well was my reply and i hoped he would not question me further  theyve got him in jail i believe the fellow and his sister tried to make out that a tramp had taken the money but i understand no one would listen to the story  no  no it seems this strong boys father is in jail now for stealing so it aint strange the boys a thief  but maybe he isnt guilty i put in by way of a mild protest  maybe of course its rather tough on him if he isnt but you cant tell nowadays boys is so allfired high toned and want to play big fiddle  some boys are but not all of them  some of them now theres our landlord who is in the house now hes got a son as extravagant as can be and if it wasnt for mr woodward keeping him in funds i dont know what that boy might not do he whoa there billy whoa  the last remark was addressed to a horse standing in one of the stalls a clap of thunder had set the animal to prancing  your horse feels rather uneasy i remarked glad of a chance to change the subject  allers acts that way when theres a storm going on too bad too for i want to hitch him up and take mr woodward and another man thats with him over to darbyville  as mr decker spoke he led the horse from the stall and backed him up between the shafts of the carriage that stood near the rear of the barn  while he was hitching up i set myself to thinking while i was perfectly willing that mr woodward should return to darbyville i did not wish to allow john stumpy out of my sight once away and i might not be able to lay hands on him  had i been sure that kate had succeeded in finding the lost statement i would not have cared but the chances in her favor were slim and i did not wish to run any risks  are you going to drive around to the house for them i asked as the farmer finished the job  guess ill have to it will be a beastly drive sorry i cant offer you a seat it would be better than walking  i think ill wait till it clears off i returned im not on business and  say decker how long is it going to take you to hitch up interrupted a voice from the doorway and the next instant mr woodward strode into the barn followed by john stumpy  i did not have time to conceal myself i tried to step behind a partition but before i could do so the merchants eye was on me  roger strong he exclaimed  yes sir i replied as boldly as i could  how did you get here he demanded  walked just as you did  thought you were in jail  so do most people  who is this chap asked the farmer staring at me with open eyes  its the boy who was arrested for that robbery last night explained the merchant  shoo you dont say and i was talking to him about that very thing you rascal you  how did you get out put in john stumpy  none of your business i replied briskly if youd had your way id been burnt up in the tool house last night  no such thing was the tramps reply never saw you before  youre the fellow who stole the widow canbys money  you must be crazy young fellow i dont know anything about the widow canby or her money  i can prove it my sister can prove it too  then your sister must be as crazy as yourself  stop there youre the thief and you know it  i know nothing of the kind  your story is nonsensical strong broke in mr woodward gentlemen like mr stumpy here do not break into peoples houses and commit robberies  gentlemen hes nothing but a tramp and you know it  tramp how dare you cried stumpy in suddenly assumed dignity put on for the farmers benefit i am a ranchero from texas and an honest man i am visiting mr woodward and know nothing more of the robbery excepting having heard that it occurred ahem and john stumpy drew himself up  under other circumstances i would have laughed at his effrontery but the situation was too serious to indulge in any humor  being placed under arrest has turned your head strong said the merchant you seem to be quite out of your mind  when was the robbery committed put in john stumpy suddenly  you know well enough i cried  i heard it was about two oclock in the morning vouchsafed farmer decker  then i can easily prove an alibi said the tramp triumphantly i can prove i was with my esteemed friend mr woodward at that hour isnt it so aaron  the merchant hesitated i fairly held my breath to catch his answer would he commit deliberate perjury  quite true he replied slowly mr stumpy was with me last night we sat up in the library smoking and playing cards until after midnight and then i showed him to bed he could not possibly have committed the crime of which strong speaks  then the boy must be the guilty one hisself said the farmer and so young too who would athought it what shall we do with him mr woodward  you had better help me take him back to darbyville jail responded the merchant    chapter xvi   my uncle enos  john stumpy gave a smile of triumph as for myself i stood aghast mr aaron woodward had committed deliberate perjury or at least something that amounted to the same thing he had positively declared that john stumpy was at his house at the time of the robbery of widow canbys house and could not therefore be the guilty party  it was easy to guess that in this statement it was his intention to screen his partner in iniquity to be sure he had been forced to take the position by stumpy himself but once having taken it i was morally certain he would not back down  his action would make it harder than ever for me to clear myself and bring the tramp to justice his word in a court of law would carry more weight than mine or my sisters and consequently our case would fall to the ground  i was glad that dick blair could testify concerning my whereabouts and the scene in the dining room directly after the robbery the merchant knew nothing of blairs presence on the occasion at least i imagined so from his conversation and might by saying too much put his foot in it  but now my mind was filled with only one thought the three men intended to take me to the darbyville jail i was to be ignominiously dragged back to the prison from which i had escaped  once again in ezekiel booths custody i was certain he would keep so strict a guard over me that further breaking away would be out of the question perhaps judge penfold would consider me so dangerous a prisoner as to send me to the county jail for safe keeping in which case it would be harder than ever for me to clear myself or see kate  for an instant i meditated taking to my legs and running my chances but this idea was knocked in the head by farmer decker grasping me by the collar  maybe he might take a notion and run away he explained he did it once you say  a good idea to hold him said mr woodward have you finished hitching up  yes sir  have you room for him  i might put in another seat  do so and hurry the rain has slackened up a bit and we may reach darbyville before it starts again  the extra seat was soon placed in the carriage then the farmer procured a couple of rubber blankets  all ready now he said how shall we sit  you and mr stumpy sit in front i and the boy will occupy the back seat come strong get in  for an instant i thought of refusing the merchant had no right to order me but then i reflected that a refusal would do no good and might do harm so without a word i entered the carriage  the others were not slow to follow then farmer decker chirruped to billy and we rolled out of the farm yard and down the road  but little was said on the way i was busy with my own thoughts and so were mr woodward and stumpy the farmer asked several questions but the merchant said he would learn all he wished to know at the judges office and this quieted him  about five oclock in the afternoon we rolled into darbyville while crossing the pass river the sun had burst through the clouds and now all was as bright and fresh as ever  judge penfolds office was situated in the centre of the principal business block when we arrived there we found a number of men standing about the door no doubt discussing my escape for they uttered many exclamations of surprise on seeing me  chief among them was parsons who looked pale and worried  roger strong he exclaimed where have you been  took a walk for my health i replied as lightly as i could though my heart was heavy  well i guess well make sure it shant happen again he returned hi there booth heres your prisoner come back  in a moment the carpenter appeared upon the scene  you rascal you he cried in angry tones a fine peck of trouble youve got yourself into  whats all this about asked a heavy voice from the stairs and judge penfold stood before me  i have brought your prisoner back judge replied mr woodward  so i see well strong what have you to say for yourself do you know breaking jail is a serious offence  i dont know anything about it i know i was locked up for nothing at all and i escaped at the first chance offered  there was no chance offered at all judge broke in booth fearful of having a reflection cast upon his character he just went and ripped the hull floor up thats what he did  silence booth come upstairs and we will hear the particulars  in a moment we were in judge penfolds office i was told to take a seat on a bench with booth on one side of me and parsons on the other  then mr woodward introduced john stumpy as a friend from san antonio texas and the two told their story corroborated at its end by farmer decker who trembled from head to foot at the idea of addressing as high a dignitary as judge penfold  what have you to say to this strong i was asked  in a plain straightforward way i told my story from beginning to end told it in a manner that did not fail to impress nearly every one in the courtroom but the judge and my accusers  of course mr woodward and john stumpy stoutly denied all i said and their denial carried the day  until we can have a real trial i will send you back to jail said judge penfold  why dont you send john stumpy to jail too i asked he is as much accused as i  we have only your word for that  then let me send for my sister kate and dick blair  judge penfold rubbed his chin reflectively  i think ill have to put you under bonds he said to john stumpy  why so the boys word doesnt amount to anything put in mr woodward  only a matter of form mr woodward i will make it a thousand dollars will you go his bondsman  of course he will said john stumpy hastily wont you  the merchant winced i i guess so he stammered but its a strange proceeding  in a few moments by the aid of two other men the bond was made out  i will make your bail a thousand dollars also said judge penfold turning to me i suppose its quite useless though he added sarcastically  not quite so useless as you might think exclaimed a hearty voice from the rear of the courtroom  i thought i recognized the tones and turned hastily there beside my sister kate stood my uncle enos moss of whom i have already spoken  he was a grizzly bearded seacaptain of seventy with manner and speech suggestive of the brine  breaking from parsons and booth i ran to meet him he shook both my hands and then clapped me on the shoulder  cast up on a lee shore are you roger he exclaimed and the wind ablowing a hurricane  yes i am i replied and im mighty glad youve come uncle enos  just dropped anchor in time he went on judge penfold do you remember me  you are carson strongs brotherinlaw i believe replied the judge  youve hit it captain enos moss part owner and sailing master of the hattie baker as trim a craft as ever rounded the horn been away for three years and now on shore to stay  youre not going on any more voyages i queried  no my hearty ive made enough to keep me and im getting too old to walk the quarterdeck besides ive heard of your fathers troubles from kate and i reckon they need sounding  indeed they do  well now about your difficulty a thousanddollar bond eh its pretty stiff but i guess i can stand it  thank you sir was all i could say  dont say a word didnt your father put in a good word for me when i was acourting your aunt thats dead and gone god bless her indeed he did and ill stand by you roger no matter how hard the gale blows  then you dont think im guilty  what a lad with your bearing a thief not much the people in this village must be asleep not to know bettern that  ahem coughed judge penfold sternly he considered my uncles remarks decidedly impertinent are you able to go his bail he asked  reckon i am ive just deposited ten thousand dollars in the bank here and ive got twenty and more in new york how will you have it in cash  a conditional check certified will do replied judge penfold shortly  what he meant had to be explained and then we all went to the bankers office my uncles account was found to be as he had stated and about ten minutes later my bond was signed and i was at liberty to go where i pleased until called upon to appear  mr aaron woodward and john stumpy apparently did not relish the turn affairs had taken but i paid no attention to them and the business over i hurried off with my sister and my newly arrived uncle  did you find the statement i asked of kate as soon as we were out of hearing of the crowd  no roger i looked and looked but it wasnt anywhere either at the tool house or on the way to judge penfolds  have you heard from mrs canby yet  yes she is coming home  does she blame me for what has happened  she doesnt say  never mind roger well stick up for you put in uncle enos kindly  i was considerably disturbed what if mrs canby should consider me at fault  as we drew near to the cottage i saw a lady standing by the gate watching our approach it was the widow canby    chapter xvii   a sudden resolve  my heart beat rapidly as i walked up to the gate how would the good lady who had done so much for kate and myself receive me  an unkind word or an unfavorable insinuation from her would have hurt me worse than a thousand from any one else she had been so generous that to have her turn would have made me feel as if i had lost my last friend on earth  but as she had taken me in before when others had cast me out so she now proved the friend in need  so theyve thought better of it and set you free roger she said as i hurried up  yes mrs canby i returned i hope i hope i began and then came to a full stop  what and she caught my hand  i hope you dont think i had anything to do with the robbery i stammered  no roger i dont i think youre an honest boy and ive got to have more proof against you than ive heard yet before ill believe otherwise  thank you maam oh thank you i blurted out and the tears started to my eyes and rolled down my cheeks  the events of which i am writing occurred several years ago but i am not ashamed of those tears they were the outcome of longpentup feelings and i could not hold them back my sister cried too and the widow canby and uncle enos looked very much as if they wished to join in  i knew you wouldnt think roger did it cried kate i said all along you wouldnt though everybody said you would  folks dont appear to know me very well returned widow canby with a bit of grim humor in her tone i dont always think as others do come into the house and give me full particulars who is this man why really captain moss i believe  yes maam captain moss rogers uncle at your service replied he taking off his cap and bowing low i thought youd remember me your husband as was once sailed to boston with me  oh yes i remember you will you come in  thank you reckon i will i have no home now and hotels is scarce in darbyville i only arrived this noon and ive been with kate ever since i must hunt up a boardinghouse to stay at do you know of any close at hand  perhaps i do let us talk of that later on i want to hear rogers story first  just as you say maam only i must get a place to stop at tonight  you shall be provided for captain moss i have a spare room  you are very kind to an old seadog like myself mrs canby said uncle enos  the widow led the way into the dining room the lamp was already lighted and while my sister kate busied herself with preparing supper mrs canby and my uncle sat down to listen to my story  for the first time i told it with all the details that concerned myself how i had been waylaid by the models how dick blair had released me what stumpy had done at the tool house and all not forgetting about the statement kate and i wished so much to find  the widow canby and my uncle listened with close attention until i had finished  its a strange story roger said the widow at its conclusion one hard to believe but i know you tell the truth  what a rascal this woodward must be broke in my uncle hes a far greater villain in his way than this john stumpy i am strongly inclined to figure that youre right and he is the one that ran your father up on a lee shore  i dont think father did a single thing that was wrong that is knowingly i returned if he did do wrong im sure mr woodward made it appear as if it was all right  no doubt no doubt if you could only get to the bottom of this weavers statement  and when is this trial to come off put in mrs canby really i dont see what good it will do me if this man has lost the money  id like to find that too i returned  presently kate announced that supper was ready and we all sat down the widow said that she had found her sister much better and on receiving kates letter had started for her home at once the loss of the money did not disturb her as much as i had anticipated and as every one was hungry the meal passed off tolerably well  when we had nearly finished there was a knock on the door and kate admitted mr woodwards errand boy he had a note for me it contained but a single sentence  please call at my house this evening about nine oclock  i read the note over with interest and then informed the others of what it contained  shall you go asked kate anxiously  i suppose i might  maybe its a plot suggested the widow  might waylay you added uncle enos a man like him is liable to do most anything  i dont think he would dare do me any bodily injury i replied he would know i had told some one where i was going and that my absence would be noticed  if you go take me in tow said my uncle i neednt go in with you but i can hang around outside and if anything goes wrong all youve got to do is to holler like all creation and ill come to the rescue  oh if roger runs any risk id rather he wouldnt go exclaimed kate in alarm  i dont think the risk is very great i returned besides i may find the missing statement that is worth trying for  i shall be in dread until you return she replied with a grave shake of her head  when will you start asked uncle enos  about half past eight it wont take over half an hour to reach his house  we continued to discuss mr woodward for some time and also the action of the models and what i should do on their score my uncle enos was for prosecuting them but the widow canby said that the future would bring its own punishment and on this we rested  and now about my board began uncle enos during a dull in the conversation i must find a boardinghouse for after tonight  wouldnt you like to stay with the children asked mrs canby  yes maam indeed i would to tell the truth its my intention sooner or later to offer them a home with me  i should hate to have them leave me returned the widow quickly  i suppose so  how would you like to board with me as i have said there is lots of room and you have just eaten a sample meal we do not live in style but  plenty good enough style interrupted captain enos and better grub then we had on the hattie baker ill be bound id like it first rate here if the terms wasnt too high  what do you think fair  im sure i dont know maam i havent paid a weeks board in three years  would five dollars a week be too much  no maam are you sure its enough i dont want to crowd your hospitality  id be satisfied with five dollars of course boarders are out of my line but there are exceptions to all cases besides ill feel safer with another man about the house no reflection on you roger but you wont always be here together  no maam replied my uncle i must visit my brotherinlaw at the prison that will take several days  will you take me with you asked kate eagerly  certainly and you too roger if you want to go  i would like to very much was my reply but i want to ask even a bigger favor than that uncle enos  yes  yes sir you may think it a good deal but youve been so kind and i havent any one else to go to  well what is it my boy ill do it if i can  lend me about fifty dollars  my uncle enos raised his eyebrows in surprise  fifty dollars he repeated  yes sir that is if you can spare it ill promise to pay it back some day  and what do you intend to do with it  i want to go to chicago sir  to chicago  all three of my listeners repeated the words in chorus then captain enos continued  and what are you going to do there  i want to hunt up this holtzmann and find out what he knows about my fathers affairs im satisfied that he is as deep in it as mr woodward or john stumpy and if i can only by some means get him to tell what he knows i may accomplish a good deal  my uncle enos put his hand upon my shoulder well roger youre a brave boy and ill trust you you shall have fifty dollars and a hundred if you want it to do as you think best only dont get into trouble  thank you uncle enos thank you i cried heartily some day ill pay you back  i dont want it back my lad if you can catch any proofs that will help clear your father i shall be more than satisfied  and when shall you go asked kate  i dont know it will depend on my interview with mr woodward and also on what john stumpy does not inside of several days at least besides we want to see father first you know  of course  we can go to trenton tomorrow said uncle enos at trenton was located the state prison after consulting a time table printed in the darbyville record we found we could catch a train for that city at 825 from newville the next morning and this we decided to take  having settled this matter we returned again to the discussion of the incidents surrounding the robbery and what would probably be the next movements of those fighting against me uncle enos grew greatly interested and said he knew a lawyer in new york who might secure some good private detective who could take the case in hand  finally it came half past eight and putting on my hat i started for mr woodwards residence    chapter xviii   in mr woodwards library  though outwardly calm i was considerably agitated as i walked to darbyville why the merchant had sent for me i could not surmise of course it was on account of the robbery but so far as i knew both of us had taken a separate stand and neither would turn back i thought it barely possible that he wished to intimidate me into receding from my position he was as much of a bully in his way as duncan and would not hesitate to use every means in his power to bring me to terms  arriving at mr woodwards house i ascended the steps and rang the bell  is mr woodward in i asked of the girl who answered the summons  ill see sir she replied who shall i say it is  roger strong  the girl left me standing in the hall while waiting for her return i could not help but remember the old lines     will you walk into my parlor      said the spider to the fly  but if i was walking into the spiders parlor it would be my own fault if i got hurt for i was entering with my eyes open i determined to be on my guard and take nothing for granted  mr woodward will be pleased to see you in his library said the girl upon her return and then having indicated the door she vanished down the back hall  as i put my hand upon the doorknob i heard steps upon the stairs and looking up saw duncan woodward descending  his face was still swollen from the punishment i had inflicted upon him nevertheless he was faultlessly dressed in full evening costume and i rightly conjectured he was going to spend the night in some fashionable dissipation such as dancing or cardplaying  hello how did you get in here he exclaimed  was let in was my mild reply not caring to pick a quarrel with him  was eh and what for id like to know  thats your fathers business duncan  dont duncan me any more roger strong whats my fathers business  what i came for he sent for me  oh he did reckon hes going to square accounts with you  i dont know what accounts hes going to square i went on in curiosity  didnt you as much as try to intimate he was lying down in judge penfolds court this afternoon  i only told what i knew to be the truth i replied calmly  the truth humph i believe you took the widows money yourself  take care what youre saying i replied angrily i dont propose to stand any such talk from you  duncan grew speechless why you you he began  hold up now before you say something that youll be sorry for this is your house but you have no right to insult me in it  quite right strong quite right the library door had opened and mr woodward stood upon the threshold gazing sharply at his son strong is here upon my invitation duncan you ought to treat him with more politeness he added  if duncan was amazed at this speech so was i the merchant taking my part what did it mean  why i i began duncan but he could really get no further  no explanation is necessary interrupted his father coolly  strong please step in will you  yes sir and i suited the action to the word  as i did so duncan passed on to the front door  ill get even with you yet you cad he muttered under his breath but i paid no attention to his words i had bigger fish to fry  once inside of mr woodwards library the merchant closed the door behind me and then invited me to take a seat beside his desk at the same time throwing himself back in his easy chair  i suppose you thought it rather singular that i should send for you he said by way of an opening  yes sir i did was all i could reply  i thought as much it was only an impulse of mine sir only an impulse i wished to see if we cannot arrange this this little difficulty without publicity i would rather lose a good deal yes sir a good deal than have my name dragged into court  all i ask is for justice i replied calmly i am under arrest for a crime of which i am innocent on the other hand you are trying to shield a man i know is guilty  i expected a storm of indignation from mr woodward because of the last remark yet he showed no sign of resentment  dont you think you might be mistaken in your identification of mr stumpy he replied and i noticed that again he nearly stumbled in pronouncing the tramps name  no sir i replied promptly  remember that you saw him only by lantern light and then but for a few minutes  i saw him by daylight as well  when  in the morning he came as a beggar  a beggar impossible the merchant held up his hands in assumed amazement why strong the idea of mr stumpy begging is ridiculous  just the same it is true mr woodward and what is more he is the thief and you know it  thats a strong assertion to make sir a very strong assertion  nevertheless i believe i can prove my words  mr woodward turned slightly pale  you can prove no such thing he cried  yes i can didnt stumpy admit he had taken the money  never sir  he did  when  this afternoon while you were at deckers place  had i slapped the merchant in the face he would not have been more surprised he sprang to his feet and glared at me  you you who says he made such an admission  i say so  ah i see you were spying on us you rascal  it strikes me that you are the rascal i returned you try deliberately to shield a thief  what  yes its true  can you prove it  mr woodward asked the question sneeringly but there was much of curiosity in his tones  perhaps i can  the merchant pulled his mustache nervously  strong you are greatly mistaken but dont let us quarrel any more  i dont want to quarrel  i feel badly over the whole affair and mr stumpy is fairly sick i suppose you think you are right but you are mistaken now i have a proposition to make to you mr woodward leaned forward in his chair suppose you admit that you are mistaken that mr stumpy is not the man do this and i will not prosecute you for having taken my papers  i was surprised and indignant surprised that mr woodward should still insist upon my having taken his papers and indignant because of his outrageous offer  mr woodward i began firmly you can prosecute me or not stumpy is the guilty man and i shall always stick to it  then you will go to jail too  for the last time let me say i have not seen your papers  it is false you took them from this room last night at the very time you pretend you were after the robber at mrs canbys house you were here ransacking my desk  mr woodward  there is no use in denying it i have abundant proofs the girl who cleaned up here this morning found a handkerchief with your name on it lying on the floor if you werent here how did that come here  my handkerchief  yes sir your handkerchief and mary obrien can identify it and tell where she found it  some one else must have had it i stammered and then suddenly i know who the party is duncan  duncan  yes sir he took that handkerchief away from me when the models waylaid me  my son really strong you are mad but i will take you in hand sir yes indeed i will  no you wont aaron woodward i cried for once letting my temper get the better of me you are awfully cunning but i am not afraid of you i am willing to have all these matters sifted to the bottom and the sooner the better what papers have you missed were they the ones that holtzmann of chicago is after how is it that my father is in prison while you live in style on money you never earned who is the relative that left it to you did you ever make a clear statement concerning the transactions that took away my fathers honest name  stop stop  i will not stop you want an investigation so do i luckily my uncle captain enos moss has just returned from a voyage he has quite some money and i know he will use it to bring the guilty parties to justice and then  i did not finish mr woodward had strode over to the door and locked it putting the key in his pocket  you know too much strong he muttered between his set teeth as he caught me by the collar too much entirely we must come to a settlement before you leave this room    chapter xix   a clever ruse  i must confess i was frightened when mr woodward locked the door of his library and caught me by the collar was it possible that he contemplated doing me physical harm it looked that way  i was not accustomed to such rough treatment and i resented it instantly i was not very large for my age but i was strong and ducking my head i wrenched myself free from his grasp and sprang to the other side of the small table that stood in the centre of the room  what do you mean by treating me in this manner i cried unlock that door at once  not much sir replied mr woodward vehemently youve made some remarkable statements young man and i demand a clear explanation before you leave  well you demand too much aaron woodward i replied firmly unlock that door  not just yet i want to know what you know of holtzmann of chicago  you wont learn by treating me in this manner was my determined reply unlock that door or take my word for it ill arouse the whole neighborhood  youll do nothing of the kind young man he rejoined  i will  make the least disturbance and you shall pay dearly for it understand sir im not to be trifled with  and im not to be frightened into submission i returned with spirit i have a right to leave when i please and i shall do so  not till i am ready said he coolly  i was nonplussed and alarmed nonplussed over the question of how to get away and alarmed at the thought of what might happen if i was compelled to remain  i began to understand mr aaron woodwards true character like duncan he was not only a bully but also a brute words having failed he was now evidently going to see what physical force could accomplish  forewarned is forearmed is an old saying and now i applied it to myself in other words i prepared for an encounter on the centre table lay a photograph album it was thick and heavy and capable of proving quite a formidable article of defence i picked it up and stepping behind a large easy chair stood on my guard  seeing the action the merchant paused  what are going to do with that he asked  youll see if you keep on i replied i dont intend to stand this much longer you had better open the door  you think youre a brainy boy strong he sneered  ive got too much brain to let you ride over me  you think you have a case against me and mr stumpy and you intend to drag it into court and make a great fuss over it he went on  im going to get back my fathers honest name  what you mean is that you intend to drag my name in the mire he stormed  you can have it so if you please  i shall not allow it you a young upstart  take care mr woodward  do you think i will submit to it he glared at me and threw a hasty glance around the room not much  suddenly he stepped to the windows and pulled down the shades then he took out his watch and looked at the time i wondered what he was up to now i was not long in finding out  listen to me he said in a low intense tone we are alone in this house you and i and will be for half an hour or more you are in my power what will you do give up all the papers you possess and promise to keep silent about what you know or take the consequences  it would be telling an untruth to say i was not thoroughly startled by the merchants sudden change of manner he was about to assault me that was plain to see and he wished me to understand that no one was near either to assist me or to bear witness against his dark doings  i must fight my own battles not only in a war of words but also in a war of blows i was not afraid after the first shock was over my cause was a just one and i would stand by it no matter what the consequences might be  i dont fear you aaron woodward i replied as steadily as i could i am in the right and shall stick up for it no matter what comes  you defy me he cried in a rage  yes i do  i had hardly uttered the words before he caught up a heavy cane standing beside his desk and made for me there was a wicked determination in his eyes and i could see that all the evil passions within him were aroused  well see who is master here he went on  stand back i cried dont come a step nearer if you do youll be sorry for it  he paid no attention to my warning but kept on advancing raising the cane over his head as he did so  when he was within three feet of me he aimed a blow at my head had he hit me i am certain he would have cracked my skull open  but i was too quick for him i dodged and the cane struck the back of the chair  before he could recover from his onslaught i hurled the album at him with all force it struck him full in the face and must have loosened several of his teeth for he put his hand up to his mouth as he reeled over backward  i was not astonished i had accomplished just what i had set out to do my one thought now was to make my escape how was it to be done  the key to the door was in the merchants pocket and this i could not obtain the windows were closed and the blinds drawn down  i had but an instant to think spluttering to himself my assailant was endeavoring to rise to his feet  a hasty glance around the room revealed a door partly hidden by a curtain next the mantelpiece where it led to i did not know but concluding that any place would be better than to remain in the library i tried the door found it open and slipped out  stop stop roared mr woodward stop this instant  but i did not stop i found myself in the dining room and at once put the long table between us  dont you come any nearer i called out sharply if you do it may be at the cost of your life  as i spoke i picked up a fancy silver knife that lay on the table it had a rough resemblance to a pocket pistol and gave me the idea of palming it off as such  would you shoot me cried the merchant in sudden terror as he saw what he supposed was the barrel of a revolver pointed at his head  why shouldnt i was the reply you have no right to detain me  i dont want to detain you i only want to come to a settlement he returned lamely  and i want nothing more to do with you ill give you one minute to show me the way to the front door  yes but strong  no more talk if you please do you intend to show me the way out or shall i fire  then mr aaron woodward showed what a coward he really was he gave a cry of horror and sank completely out of sight  dont shoot strong i pray you take care ill show you the way out indeed i will  well hurry about it i dont intend to stand any more nonsense  here this way please stop pointing that pistol at me it might go off you know  then the sooner you show me the way out the better for you i returned coolly inwardly amused at his sudden change of manner  this way then i i trust you will keep this this little meeting of ours a secret  why should i  because it it would do no good to have it made public  ill see about it was my reply  by this time we had reached the front door and with unwilling hands the merchant opened it  now stand aside and let me pass i commanded  i will but strong  no more words are needed i returned i have had enough of you mr aaron woodward the next time you hear from me it will be in quite a different shape  what do you mean he cried in sudden alarm  you will find out soon enough in the meantime let me return your fancy knife i have no further use for it  i tossed the article over he looked at it and then at me clearly he was mad enough to chew me up bidding him a mocking good night i ran down the steps and hurried away    chapter xx   at the prison  mr woodwards actions had aroused me as i had never been aroused before my eyes were wide open at last i realized that if i ever expected to gain our family rights i must fight for them and fight unflinchingly to the bitter end  it was nearly ten oclock when i reached the widow canbys house i met my uncle enos on the porch he had grown impatient and was about to start for darbyville in search of me  in the dining room i told my story all laughed heartily at the ruse i had played upon the merchant but were indignant at the treatment i had received  wish id been with you remarked my uncle with a vigorous shake of his head id asmashed in his figurehead keelhaul me if i wouldnt  what do you intend to do now asked kate  lets see today is friday if you will take us to trenton tomorrow uncle enos ill start for chicago on monday  dont you think you had better have this woodward arrested first asked captain enos  no i would rather let him think that for the present i had dropped the whole matter it may throw him off his guard and enable me to pick up more clews against him  thats an idea roger youve got a level head on your shoulders and we cant do any better than follow your advice returned my uncle  i did but little sleeping that night for a long time i lay awake thinking over my future actions then when i did fall into a doze my rest was broken by dreams of the fire at the tool house and mr woodwards attack  i was up at five oclock in the morning attending to the regular chores i did not know who would do them during my absence and as soon as the widow appeared i spoke to her on the subject  your uncle mentioned the matter last night said mrs canby he said he would do all that was required until you came back he doesnt want to remain idle all day and thought the work would just suit him  this was kind of uncle enos and i told him so when an hour later he appeared dressed in his best his trunk having arrived the evening before  yes roger id rather do it than sit twirling my thumbs awaiting for you to come back said he i used to do such work years ago before i shipped on the anna siegel and to do it again will make me feel like a boy once more but come lets go to mess and then hoist anchor and away  a few minutes later we were at breakfast then i put on my good clothes and brought around the horse and carriage for the widow canby insisted upon driving us down to newville by way of darbyville just to show folks as she said that she had not lost confidence in me  kate was in a flutter of excitement she had wished to see my father every day since he had been taken away as for myself i was fully as impatient my father was very dear to me and every time i thought of him i prayed that god would place it within my power to clear his name from the stain that now rested upon him  we reached the station in newville five minutes before train time my uncle procured our tickets and also checked the basket of delicacies the widow canby had prepared  remember me to mr strong said the widow as we boarded the train tell him i dont believe hes guilty and perhaps other people in darbyville wont think so either before long  a moment later and we were off kate and uncle enos occupied one seat and i sat directly behind them a ride of an hour followed and finally after crossing a number of other railroads we rolled into a brick station and the conductor sang out  trenton  it was eleven oclock when we crossed the wooden footbridge of the station and emerged upon the street  well go to the prison at once said my uncle perhaps it isnt visiting day as they call it but i reckon i can fix it sailors on shore have special privileges he added with a laugh  which way is it asked kate  i dont know well take a carriage and trust to the driver  he called a coach and soon we were rolling off  finally the coach stopped and the driver sprang from his box  here you are sir he said as he opened the door  i looked up at the big stone buildings before us my father was behind those walls i glanced at kate the poor girl was in tears  you had better stay on board here till i go in and take soundings said captain enos i wont be gone long  jumping to the pavement he walked up to the big open door and entered  what a dreadful place said my sister as she strained her eyes to catch sight of some prisoner  my uncle was gone not over ten minutes yet the wait seemed an age he returned with a brightened face  i had hard work to get permission but we are to have half an hours talk with your father under the supervision of a deputy he explained  in another moment we were inside we walked along a wide corridor and into an office and then a short stout man mr carr the deputy joined us  this way please he said and gave a kindly glance at kate and myself you will have to leave the basket here i will see that it reaches the the your father  he led the way how my heart beat why i cannot tell  ill go in first said my uncle enos  we entered a room in a moment the deputy brought in a man dressed in striped clothing and with his hair cut close it was my father  my uncle and i rushed forward but we were too late with a cry kate was in his arms it was a great moment all around  my children my katie and my roger was all my father could say but the words went straight home  i am heartily glad that you are back he said then to my uncle you will look after them enos until i am free  indeed i will replied captain enos heartily but you must listen to roger he has a long story to tell  then tell it i am dying to hear news from home we sat down and i told my story perhaps the deputy ought not to have allowed me to say all i did but he pretended not to hear  my father listened with keen attention to every word and as i went on his eyes grew brighter and brighter  roger my faithful boy you almost make me hope for freedom he cried oh how i long to be set right before the world  god make it so put in my uncle solemnly to suffer unjustly is terrible  then i told of my interview with mr woodward in his library and of holtzmann  holtzmann was one of the principal witnesses against me said my father so was nicholas weaver who managed the brooklyn business for holland  mack who john stumpy can be i do not know perhaps i would if i saw him face to face there was another man he was quite bald with a red blotch on the front of his hand who was brought forward by woodward to prove that he had nothing to do with the presentation of the forged checks and notes but what his name was i have forgotten  this cant be the man for he has a heavy head of hair i replied but i am sure stumpy is not his true name  probably not well roger do your best not only for me but for katies sake and your own  then the conversation became general and all too soon the half hour was at an end my father sent his regards to mrs canby with many thanks for the basket of delicacies and then with a kiss for kate and a shake of the hand to uncle enos and me we parted  little was said on the way back no one cared to go to a restaurant and we took the first train homeward  it was dark when we reached newville the widow canbys carriage was at the depot waiting for us  suppose i get my ticket for chicago now said i it will save time monday and i can find out all about the train  a good idea returned my uncle ill go with you  so while kate joined mrs canby we entered the depot  the ticket was soon in my possession and then i asked the ticket seller a number of questions concerning the route and the time i would reach my destination  suddenly instinct prompted me to turn quickly i did so and found john stumpy at my shoulder    chapter xxi   a midnight adventure  mr john stumpy had evidently been watching my proceedings closely for when i turned to him he was quite startled however it did not take him long to recover and then bracing up he hurried away without a word  he was now neatly dressed and had had his face shaved i conjectured that mr woodward had advised this change in order to more fully carry out the deception in relation to the tramps real character  theres that stumpy i whispered to captain enos as i pointed my finger at the man he has been watching us  how do you know asked my uncle  because he was just looking over my shoulder i replied shall i speak to him id like to know what he intends to do next  it wont do any good it aint likely hed tell you anything and if he did it wouldnt be the truth  maybe it might  well do as you think best roger only dont be too long the widow and kate are waiting you know  pushing through the crowd i tapped stumpy on the shoulder he looked around in assumed surprise  hullo he exclaimed sharply what do you want  nothing much i returned i just saw you were greatly interested in what i was doing  why i didnt see you before  you were just looking over my shoulder  youre mistaken young man just as you are in several other things  im not mistaken in several other things  what do you intend to do he asked curiously  thats my business  where have you been  that is my business also  strong youre a fool he whispered do you think you can hurt men like mr woodward and myself  i can bring you to justice  bah i suppose you think you can do wonders by going to chicago  how do you know i am going to chicago i questioned quickly  stumpys face fell as he realized the slip he had made  never mind but you wont gain anything he went on better stay home and save your money  and to avoid further talk he pushed his way through the crowd and was lost to sight  a moment later i joined the others in the carriage while driving home i related the conversation recorded above  its too bad he found out you were going to chicago said my uncle he may try to stop you  ill keep my eyes open i replied  the remainder of the day was spent in active work around the widows place not only did i labor all the afternoon but far into the evening as well to show that i did not intend to shirk my duty even though i was going away besides mrs canby had treated me so well that i was almost willing to work my fingers to the bone to serve her  the following day was sunday kate and i were in the habit of attending church and sundayschool over in darbyville but we shrank from doing so now but uncle enos and i went to church and despite the many curious eyes levelled at me i managed to give attention to an excellent sermon i noticed that the woodward pew was empty but then this was of common occurrence and excited no comment  on sunday evening my handbag stood in my room packed ready for my departure dick blair came over to see me and brought strange and sad news  duncan woodward and pultzer his intimate crony had gotten into a row in a pool room down in newville and were both under arrest mr woodward and mr pultzer had gone off to get their sons out of jail dick did not know how the row had started but had heard that the young men had been drinking heavily  i was much shocked at the news and so were the others if affairs kept on like this mr aaron woodward would certainly have his hands full  i retired early so as to be on hand the next day sleep was out of the question i had never been a hundred miles away from darbyville and the prospect of leaving filled me with excitement  i was up long before it was necessary but found kate ahead of me  youre going to have a good hot breakfast before you go she said sit right down its all ready  presently as i was eating my uncle and mrs canby joined me they were full of advice as to what to do and what to avoid and i listened to all they had to say attentively  but all things must come to an end and at length breakfast was over my uncle enos and kate drove me to newville and waited till the train rolled in  goodby roger said kate please please now do keep out of trouble  i will kate i returned and kissed her then i shook hands with my uncle  keep a clear weather eye and a strong hand at the wheel roger my boy he said and youll make port all safe  ill try uncle enos  a moment more and i was on the cars then with an all aboard the conductor gave the signal and the train moved off  i passed into the car and took a vacant seat near the centre i had hardly sat down before a welldressed stranger took the seat beside me  hot day said he after he had arranged his bag on the floor beside my own  yes it is i replied and dry too  meanest part of the country ive struck yet he went on dont have any such climate as this out west  i should think that would depend on where you come from i returned with a short laugh  i hail from chicago its hot there but we get plenty of breeze from the lakes  i looked at the man with some attention he came from the city i intended to visit and perhaps he might give me some information  he was a burly man of middle age and as i have said well dressed though a trifle loud his hair was black as was also his mustache which he continually kept smoothing down with one hand i did not like his looks particularly nor his tone of voice they reminded me strongly of some one but whom i could not remember  you come from chicago i said i am going there  is that so then we can travel together i like to have some one going along dont you  i felt like saying that that would depend on who the some one was but thinking this would hardly be polite i returned  i dont know ive never travelled before  no well its fun at first but you soon get tired of it my name is allen price what is yours  roger strong  glad to meet you he extended his hand youre rather young to be travelling alone that is going a distance do you smoke well go into the smoker and take it easy i have some prime cigars  thank you i dont smoke  thats too bad nothing like a good cigar to quiet a mans nerves when hes riding so youre going to chicago on a visit  no sir on business  yes rather young for business excuse me for saying so  it is a personal business  oh i see going to claim a dead uncles property or something like that i suppose ha ha well i wish you luck  mr allen price rattled on in this fashion for some time and at length i grew interested in the man in spite of myself i was positive i had seen him before but where i could not tell i asked him if he had ever been to darbyville  never heard of the place he replied only been in jersey a month and that time was spent principally in jersey city and camden im in the pottery business our principal office is in chicago  do you know much about that city  lived there all my life  i was on the point of asking him about holtzmann but on second thought decided to remain silent  on and on sped the train making but few stops there was a diningcar attached but i was travelling on a cheap scale and made my dinner and supper from the generous lunch the widow had provided  mr price went to the diningcar and also the smoker he returned about nine oclock in the evening just as i was falling into a light doze  thought id get a sleeper he explained but they are all full so ill have to snooze beside you here  his breath smelt strongly of liquor but i had no right to object and he dropped heavily into the seat  presently i went sound asleep how long i slept i do not know when i awoke it was with a sharp stinging sensation in the head a pungent odor filled my nose the scent coming from a handkerchief some one had thrown over my face  with a gasp i pulled the handkerchief aside and sat up beside me sat mr allen price with my handbag on his lap he had a number of keys in his hand and was trying to unlock the bag    chapter xxii   a telegram  i was startled and indignant when i discovered mr allen price with my handbag trying to open it it looked very much as if my fellowpassenger was endeavoring to rob me  i had suspected from the start that this man was not straight there was that peculiar something about his manner which i did not like he had been altogether too familiar from the first too willing to make himself agreeable  what he expected to find in my bag i could not imagine if his mission was robbery pure and simple why had he not selected some one who looked richer than myself there was i am certain nothing about me to make him believe i had anything of great value in the bag  what are you doing with my valise i demanded as i straightened up  my sudden question made the man almost jump to his feet the bag dropped from his lap to the floor and the keys in his hand jingled after it  i i didnt think you were awake he stammered  you didnt i repeated puzzled as to what to say  no i i  you were trying to open my bag  so i was but its all a mistake i assure you  a mistake  quite a mistake strong he cleared his throat the fact is im suffering so from the toothache that im hardly able to judge of what im doing i thought your bag was my own  they are not much alike i returned bluntly  well you see mine is a new one and im not used to it yet i hope you dont think i was trying to rob you he went on with a look of reproach  i was silent i did think that that was just what he was trying to do but i hardly cared to say so  its awful to have such toothaches as i get he continued putting his hand to his cheek they come on me unawares and drive me frantic i wanted to get my teeth attended to in jersey city when i was there but i didnt have time  whats this on the handkerchief i asked  oh i guess i spilled some of my toothache cure on it he replied after some hesitation i used some and then put the bottle back in the valise thats how i came to look for the bottle again i hope youre not offended it was all a mistake  its all right if thats the case i returned coolly  holding my valise on my lap i settled back in the seat again but not to sleep the little adventure had aroused me thoroughly mr allen price sat beside me for a few moments in silence  guess ill go into the smoker he said finally as he rose maybe a cigar will help me and taking up his handbag he walked down the aisle  in a dreamy way i meditated over what had occurred i could not help but think that the handkerchief i had found spread over my face had been saturated with chloroform and that my fellowpassenger had endeavored to put me in a sound sleep and then rifle my bag of course i might be mistaken but still i was positive that mr allen price would bear watching  about four oclock in the morning the train came to a sudden stop the jar was so pronounced that it woke nearly all of the passengers  thinking that possibly we had arrived at our destination i raised the window and peered out  instead of being in the heart of a city however i soon discovered we were in a belt of timber land huge trees lined the road on both sides and ahead i could hear the flowing of a mountain stream  the train hands were out with their lanterns and by their movements it was plain to see that something was up  i waited in my seat for ten minutes or more and then as a number of passengers left the car i took up my bag and did the same  a walk to the front of the train soon made known the cause of the delay over a small mountain stream a strong wooden bridge with iron frame had been built near the bridge grew a number of tall trees and one of these had been washed loose by the water and overturned in such a manner that the largest branch blocked the progress of the locomotive the strong headlight had revealed the state of affairs to the engineer and he had stopped within five feet of the obstruction had he run on it is impossible to calculate what amount of damage might have been done  dont see what we are going to do except to run back to smalleyville said the engineer who was in consultation with the conductor  cant we roll the tree out of the way asked the latter official  the engineer shook his head  too heavy all the men on the train couldnt budge it  they stood in silence for a moment  if you had a rope you could make the engine haul it i suggested to the fireman who was a young fellow  a good idea he exclaimed and reported it to his superior  firstclass plan but we havent got the rope said the engineer  have you got an axe  yes  then why not chop it off  thats so larry bring the axes  it wont do any good said one of the brakemen who had just come up the bridge has shifted  an examination proved his assertion to be correct as soon as this became known a danger light was hung at either end of the structure and then we started running backward to smalleyville  how long will this delay us i asked of the conductor as he came through explaining matters  i cant tell perhaps only a few hours perhaps more it depends on how soon the wrecking gang arrive on the spot as soon as they get there they will go right to work and it wont take them long to fix matters up  smalleyville proved to be a small town of not over five hundred inhabitants there was quite an excitement around the depot when the train came in and despatches were sent in various directions  presently a shower came up and this drove the passengers to the cars and the station i got aboard the train at first to listen to what the train hands might have to say i found one of the brakemen quite a friendly fellow and willing to talk  this rain will make matters worse said he that tree was leaning against the bridge for all it was worth and if it loosens any more it will carry the thing away clean  isnt there danger of trains coming from the other way  not now weve telegraphed to chicago and no train will leave till everything is in running order  when does the next train arrive behind us  at 930 this morning  we chatted for quite a while then there was a commotion on the platform and we found that part of the wrecking gang had arrived on a handcar  they brought with them a great lot of tools and soon a flat car with a hoisting machine was run out of a shed and they were off  by this time it was raining in torrents and the station platform was deserted not caring to get wet i again took my seat in the car and presently fell asleep  when i awoke i found it was six oclock the rain still fell steadily without signs of abating  i was decidedly hungry and buttoning my coat up tightly about my neck i sallied forth in search of a restaurant  i found one within a block of the depot and entering i called for some coffee and muffins first however assuring myself that my train was not likely to leave for fully an hour  while busy with what the waiter had brought i saw mr allen price enter luckily the table i sat at was full and he was compelled to take a seat some distance from me  good morning my young friend said he as he stopped for an instant in front of me  i was surprised at his pleasant manner he acted as if nothing had ever happened to bring up a coolness between us  good morning i replied briefly  terrible rain this isnt it  it is  my toothaches much better he went on and i feel like myself once more funny i mistook your valise for mine last night wasnt it  i dont know i replied flatly  i returned to my breakfast and seeing i would not converse further the man passed on and sat down but i felt that his eyes were on me and instinctively i made up my mind to be on my guard  as i was about to leave the place several more passengers came in and by what they said i learned that the train would not start for chicago till noon the bridge being so badly damaged that the road engineer would not let anything cross until it was propped up  not caring to go back to the train i entered the waitingroom and took in all there was to be seen at one end of the place was a news stand and i walked up to this to look at the picture papers that were displayed  i was deeply interested in a cartoon on the middle pages of an illustrated paper when i heard mr prices voice asking for some chicago daily and then making inquiries as to where the telegraph once was located  he did not see me and i at once stepped out of sight behind him  having received his directions mr price sat down to write out his telegram evidently what he wrote did not satisfy him for he tore up several slips of paper before he managed to prepare one that suited him  then he arose and throwing the scraps in a wad on the floor walked away  unobserved i picked up the wad right or wrong i was bound to see what it contained perhaps it might be of no earthly interest to me on the other hand it might contain much i would desire to know strange things had happened lately and i was prepared for all sorts of surprises  a number of the slips of paper were missing and the remainder were so crumpled that the pencil marks were nearly illegible  at length i managed to fit one of the sheets together and then read these words    c hholtzmann chicago    look out for a young man claiming to    chapter xxiii   in chicago  i had not been mistaken in my opinion of mr allen price he was following me and doing it with no good intention  i concluded the man must be employed by mr woodward perhaps i had seen him at some time in darbyville and so thought his face familiar  i was glad that if he was a detective i was aware of the fact i would now know how to trust him and i made up my mind that if he got the best of me it would be my own fault  one thing struck me quite forcibly the merchant and john stumpy both considered my proposed visit to chris holtzmann of importance they would not have put themselves to the trouble and expense of hiring some one to follow me if this was not so though mr aaron woodward was rich he was close and did not spend an extra dollar except upon himself  i was chagrined at the thought that holtzmann would be prepared to receive me i had hoped to come upon him unawares and get into his confidence before he could realize what i was after  i began to wonder when the telegram would reach chicago perhaps something by good fortune might delay it  mr allen price walked over to the telegraph office and following him with my eyes i saw him pay for the message and then stroll away  hardly had he gone before i too stepped up to the counter  how long will it take to send a message to chicago i asked of the clerk in charge  probably till noon was the reply the storm has crippled us and we are having trouble with our lineman  it wont go before noon i repeated and my heart gave a bound are you sure  yes perhaps even longer  how about the message that gentleman just handed in  i told him i would send it as soon as possible  did you tell him it wouldnt go before noon  no he didnt ask returned the clerk coolly he was evidently not going to let any business slip if he could help it  is there any possible way i can get to chicago before noon i went on  the clerk shook his head i dont think there is he replied  what is the nearest station on the other side of the bridge  foley  and how far is that from chicago  twelve miles  thank you  i walked away from the counter filled with a sudden resolve i must reach chicago before the telegram or mr allen price if i did not my trip to the city of the lakes would be a failure  how was the thing to be accomplished walking out on the covered platform out of sight of the man who was following me i tried to solve the problem  smalleyville was a good ten miles from the misplaced bridge and in a soaking rain such a distance was too far to walk perhaps i might get a carriage to take me to the spot i supposed the cost would be several dollars but decided not to stand on that amount  i had about made up my mind to hunt up a livery stable when some workingmen rolled up to the station on a handcar  where are you going i inquired of one of them  down to the foley bridge was the reply  will you take a passenger i went on quickly  youll have to ask the boss  the boss proved to be a jolly german  vont ter haf a ride does you he laughed  im not over particular about the ride i explained ive got to get to chicago as soon as possible even if i have to walk  vell jump on den  i did so and a moment later we were off i was pretty confident that mr allen price had not witnessed my departure and i hoped he would not find it out for some hours to come  the rain had now slackened so there was no further danger of getting soaked to the skin there were four men on the car besides the boss and seeing they were short a hand i took hold with a will  fortunately the grade was downward and we had but little difficulty in sending the car on its way at the end of half an hour the stream came in sight and then as we slackened up i hopped off  down by the waters edge i found that the bridge had shifted fully six inches out of line with the roadbed it was however in a pretty safe condition and i had no difficulty in crossing to the other side  despite the storm a goodly number of men were assembled on the opposite bank anxiously watching the efforts of the workmen among them i found a man evidently a cabman standing near a coupe the horses of which were still smoking from a long run  are you from foley i asked stepping up  no just come all the way from chicago was the reply had to bring two men down that wanted to get to smalleyville  this was interesting news perhaps i could get the man to take me back with him of course he would take me if i hired him in the regular way but if i did this i was certain he would charge me a small fortune  i am going to chicago i said i just came from smalleyville  that so want to hire my rig  you charge too much i returned a fellow like me cant afford luxuries  take you there for two dollars its worth five those two men gave me ten  what time will you land me in chicago  where do you want to go  that question was a poser i knew no more of the city of chicago than i did of paris or pekin yet i did not wish to be set down on the outskirts and not to show my ignorance i answered cautiously  to the railroad depot  have you the time now  it is about seven oclock  ill be there by nine  all right land me there by that time and ill pay you the two dollars  its a go jump in he declared  i did so a moment later he gathered up the reins and we went whirling down the road  the ride was an easy one and as we bowled along i had ample opportunity to ponder over my situation i wondered what mr allen price would think when he discovered i was nowhere to be found i could well imagine his chagrin and i could not help smiling at the way i had outwitted him i was not certain what sort of a man chris holtzmann would prove to be and therefore it was utterly useless to plan a means of approaching him  at length we reached the suburbs of chicago and rolled down one of the broad avenues it was now clear and bright and the clean broad street with its handsome houses pleased me very much  in half an hour we reached the business portion of the city and soon the coupe came to a halt and the driver opened the door  here we are said he  i jumped to the ground and gazed around opposite was the railroad station true enough and beyond blocks and blocks of tall business buildings which reminded me strongly of new york  i paid the cabman the two dollars i had promised and he drove off  in chicago at last i looked around i was in the heart of a great city knowing no one and with no idea of where to go  yet my heart did not fail me my mind was too full of the object of my quest to allow me to become fainthearted i was there for a purpose and that purpose must be accomplished  my clothes were still damp but the sunshine was fast drying them near by was a bootblacks chair and dropping into this i had him polish my shoes and brush me up generally  while he was performing the operation i questioned him concerning the streets and gained considerable information  did you ever hear of a man by the name of chris holtzmann i asked  i dunno was the slow reply what does he do  i dont know what business he is in he came from brooklyn  the bootblack shook his head  this city is a big place there might be a dozen men by his name here the street what you spoke about has lots of saloons and theatres on it maybe hes in that business  maybe he is i returned i must find out somehow  you can look him up in the directory youll find one over in the drug store on the corner  thank you i guess thats what ill do i replied  when he had finished i paid him ten cents for his work and walked over to the place he had mentioned  a polite clerk waited on me and pointed out the directory lying on a stand  i looked it over carefully and three minutes later walked out with chris holtzmanns new address in my pocket  as i did so i saw a stream of people issue from the depot some of them looked familiar was it possible that the train from smalleyville had managed to come through after all it certainly looked like it  i was not kept long in doubt i crossed over to make sure and an instant later found myself face to face with allen price    chapter xxiv   who mr allen price was  i will not deny that i was considerably taken aback by my unexpected meeting with the man who had been following me i had been firmly under the impression that he was still lolling around smalleyville waiting for a chance to continue his journey  but if i was surprised so was mr allen price every indication showed that he had not missed me at my departure and that he was under the belief that i had been left behind  he stopped short and gazed at me in blank astonishment  why why where did you come from he stammered  from smalleyville i returned as coolly as i could and thats where you came from too i added  i didnt see you on the train he went on ignoring my last remark  i didnt come up by train  maybe you walked he went on with some anxiety  oh no i rode in a carriage  humph it seems to me you must have been in a tremendous hurry  perhaps i was  why you excite my curiosity may i ask the cause of your sudden impatience  he put the question in an apparently careless fashion but his sharp eyes betrayed his keen interest  you may  and what was it  i looked at him for a moment in silence  i came to see a man  ah a friend perhaps he is seriously sick  i dont know if he is sick or not  and yet you hurried to see him  yes  well that that is out of the ordinary he hesitated for a moment of course it is none of my business but i am interested perhaps i know the party and can help you may i ask his name  its the same man you telegraphed to i returned  mr allen price stopped short and nearly dropped his handbag my unexpected reply had taken the wind out of his sails  i telegraphed to he repeated  exactly  but but i telegraphed to no one  yes you did  why my dear young friend you are mistaken  im not your dear friend i returned with spirit you telegraphed to chris holtzmann to beware of me why did you do it  the mans face fell considerably and he did not answer i went on  you are following me and trying to defeat the object of my trip to chicago but you shall not do it you pretend to be an ordinary traveller but you are nothing more than a spy sent on by mr aaron woodward to stop me but i have found you out and now you can go back to him and tell him that his little plan didnt work  the mans brow grew black with anger he was very angry and i could see that it was with difficulty he kept his hands off me  think youre smart dont you he sneered  i was too smart for you  but you dont know it all he went on you dont know it all not by a jugful  i know enough to steer clear of you  maybe you do  the man evidently did not know what to say and as a matter of fact neither did i i had told him some plain truths and now i was anxious to get away from him and think out my future course of action  whats your idea of calling on chris holtzmann he went an after a long pause  thats my business  it wont do you any good  perhaps it may  i know it wont he replied in decided tones  what do you know about it i said sharply a moment ago you denied knowing anything about me now ive done with you and i want you to leave me alone  you neednt get mad about it  ill do as i please  no you wont he growled if you dont do as i want you to ill have you arrested  this was strong language and i hardly knew what to say in reply not that i was frightened by his threat but what made the man take such a strong personal interest in the matter  as i have said i was almost certain i had seen the fellow before though where and when was more than i could determine perhaps he was disguised  perhaps you dont think i know who you are i said quickly  my words were a perfect shock to mr allen price in spite of his bronzed face he turned pale  you know who i am why i am as i tell you allen price he faltered  really i replied with assumed sarcasm  yes really  i know better i returned boldly  i was hardly prepared for what was to follow the man caught me by the arm  then what you know shall cost you dear he cried im not to be outwitted by a country boy help police police  as he uttered his call for assistance he let drop his handbag and drew his purse from his pocket  ive got you you young thief he cried letting the purse fall to the sidewalk you didnt think to be caught as easily did you help po oh officer im glad youve come the last to a policeman who had just hurried to the scene  whats the matter here demanded the minion of the law  i just caught this young fellow picking my pocket exclaimed mr allen wheres my pocketbook  theres a pocketbook on the sidewalk put in a man in the crowd that had quickly gathered  so it is he picked it up you rascal you thought to get away in fine style didnt you he continued to me  for a moment i was too stunned to speak the unlookedfor turn of affairs took away my breath  i didnt pick his pocket i burst out  yes you did  it isnt so hes a swindler and is trying to get me into trouble  here here none of that broke in the officer tell me your story he said to mr allen price  i was coming along looking in the shop windows began my accuser when i felt a hand in my pocket i turned quickly and just in time to catch this fellow trying to make off with my pocketbook  it is a falsehood every word of it i declared  shut up said the officer sternly please go on  he is evidently a smart thief continued mr allen price i must see if i have lost anything else  he began a pretended examination of his clothes in the meantime the crowd began to grow larger and larger  we cant stay here all day said the policeman roughly what have you got to say to the charge  i say it isnt true i replied this man is a humbug he is following me for a purpose and is trying to get me into trouble  ridiculous cried my accuser why i never heard of such a thing before  that story wont wash said the officer to me do you make a charge he continued to mr allen price  my accuser hesitated i will if it is not necessary for me to go along he said i am pressed for time my name is sylvester manners i am a partner in the manners clothing company you know the firm i presume  oh yes sir replied the officer he knew the manners clothing company to be a rich concern  i will stop at the station house tomorrow morning and make a complaint continued mr allen price dont let the young rascal escape  no fear sir come on the last to me  ive done no wrong i want that man arrested i cried he is no more a merchant here in chicago than i am he  but the officer would not listen he took a strong hold upon my collar and began to march me off mr allen price walked beside us until we reached the corner  i will leave you here officer he said ill be down in the morning sure as for you he continued to me i trust you will soon see the error of your ways and try to mend them and he continued in a whisper as the officers attention was distracted for a moment never try to outwit john stumpy again    chapter xxv   an exciting adventure  mr allen price and john stumpy were one and the same person for a moment so great was my surprise that i forgot i was under arrest and walked on beside the officer without a protest  now that i knew the truth it was easy to trace the resemblance and i blamed myself greatly for not having discovered it when we first met  of a certainty the man was bent upon frustrating my plans partly for his own safety and more so upon mr aaron woodwards account no doubt the merchant was paying him well for his work and john stumpy intended to do all he could to crush me  but i was not to be crushed the forces brought against me only made my will stronger to go ahead it was do or die and that was all there was to it  i could easily understand why john stumpy wished to obtain possession of my handbag in it he hoped to find the papers mr woodward had lost and nicholas weavers confession i could not help but smile at the thought that notwithstanding all i had said to the contrary the two plotters still believed i had the lost documents  one thing perplexed me why was my visit to chris holtzmann considered of such importance that every possible means was taken to prevent it did this man possess the entire key to the situation and were they afraid he could be bought up or threatened into a confession it looked so  you are not from chicago young fellow said the policeman who had me in charge  no im from the east  humph got taken in short didnt you  im not guilty of any crime i returned and youll find it out when it comes to the examination  ill chance it replied the officer grimly  that man is a fraud if you call on the manners clothing company you will find it so  thats not part of my duty ill take you to the station house and you can tell the judge your story replied the policeman  yet i could see by the way his brow contracted that my assertion had had its effect upon him probably had he given the matter proper thought in the first place he would have compelled john stumpy to accompany him  still this did me no good here i was being taken to the jail while the man who should have been under arrest was free i would probably have to remain in confinement until the following morning and in the meantime john stumpy could call on chris holtzmann and arrange plans to suit himself  this would never do as it would defeat the whole object of my trip west and send me home to be laughed at by mr aaron woodward and duncan  can i ask for an examination at once i inquired  maybe if the judge is there  and if he isnt  youll have to wait till tomorrow morning you see it isnt hello thunder and lightning whats that  as the officer uttered the exclamation there was a wild cry on the streets and the next instant the crowds of people scattered in every direction  and no wonder for down the pavement came an infuriated bull charging everybody and everything before him  the animal had evidently broken away from a herd that was being driven to the stockyards and his nose where the ring was fastened was torn and covered with blood and he breathed hard as if he had run a great distance  its a mad bull i cried take care or hell horn both of us  my words of caution were unnecessary for no sooner had the bull turned in our direction than the officer let go his hold upon me and fled into a doorway near at hand  for an instant i was on the point of following him then came the sudden thought that now would be a good chance to escape  to think was to act no sooner had the policeman jumped into the doorway than i dodged through the crowd and hurried across the street reaching the opposite side i ran into an alley it was long and led directly into the back garden of a handsome stone mansion  the garden was filled with beautiful flowers and plants and in the centre a tiny fountain sent a thin spray into the air at one side under a small arbor stood a garden bench and on this sat a little girl playing with a number of dolls  her golden hair hung heavy over her shoulders and she looked supremely happy she greeted my entrance with a smile and took me at once into her confidence  this is my new dolly she explained holding the article up  is it i asked hardly knowing what to say  yes papa bringed it home yesterday does oo like dollies  oh yes nice ones like that you must have lots of fun i  i did not finish the sentence there was a noise in the alley and the next instant the mad bull came crashing into the garden  for a second i was too surprised to move or speak the little girl uttered a piercing scream and gathering her dolls in her arms huddled into a corner of the bench  why the animal had followed so closely behind me i could not tell but once in the garden it was plain to see he was bent upon doing considerable damage he was more enraged than ever and scattered the sodding about in every direction  at first some red flowers attracted his attention and he charged upon these with a fury that wrecked the entire flowerbed in which they were standing  while the bull was at this work i partly recovered my senses and then the first thought that came to my mind was the necessity of getting the little girl to a place of safety let the bull once get at her and her life might pay the penalty i was not many feet away from the little miss and a few bounds took me to her side  come let me take you into the house i said and picked her up  she made no reply but continued to scream and clung to me with all the strength of her little arms  there was a back piazza to the mansion five or six steps high i knew that if we once reached this we would be safe for no matter what the bull might do he could not climb  oh millie my child came s voice from the house and i saw a lady at one of the windows oh save her bring her here she cried as she caught sight of the bull  i uttered no reply but sprang toward the steps  but though i wasted no time the bull was too quick for me springing over the flowerbed he planted himself directly in my path  it made my blood run cold to have him face me with that vicious look and those glaring eyes one prod of those horns and all would be over  oh save millie save my child the lady had opened the door and now came running out upon the piazza  i will if i can i returned dont come down here hell tear you all to pieces  even as i spoke the bull made a plunge for me i darted to one side and sprang over to the edge of the piazza corner  give her to me hand her up exclaimed the lady as she rushed over and as i held the little one on my shoulder the lady drew her up and clasped the child dolls and all to her breast  hardly had i got rid of my charge than the bull came for me again the trick i had played on him only served to increase his rage and he snorted loudly  i was in a bad fix between the piazza and the nextdoor fence was a distance of but ten feet and behind me was the solid stone wall of the house escape on any side was impossible had i had time i might have climbed up to the piazza but now this was not to be thought of and another means of getting out of danger must be instantly devised  oh he will be killed cried the lady in horror help help  i glanced around for some weapon with which to defend myself i had nothing with me even my valise lay at the other end of the garden where i had dropped it when the animal first made his appearance  as i said i looked around and behind me found a heavy spade the gardener had at one time or another used for digging post holes it was a strong and sharp implement and i took it up with a good deal of satisfaction  the bull charged on me with fury as he did so i took the spade and held it on a level with my waist resting the butt end on the wall behind me  the next instant there was a terrific crash that made me sick from head to foot with all his force the bull had sprung forward only to receive the sharp end of the spade straight between his eyes  the blow was as if it had been delivered by an axe it made a frightful cut and the blood rushed forth in a torrent  with a mad cry of pain the bull backed out at first i thought he was going to charge me again but evidently the blow was too much for him for with several moans he turned and with his head hanging down he staggered across the garden to the alley and disappeared    chapter xxvi   sammy simpson  i gave a sigh of relief when the bull was gone the encounter with the mad animal had been no laughing matter i had once heard of a man being gored to death by just such an infuriated creature and i considered that i had had a narrow escape i put my hand to my forehead and found the cold sweat standing out upon it taking my handkerchief i mopped it away  are you hurt inquired the lady with great solicitation  no maam i replied but it was a close shave  indeed it was and you saved my millies life how can i thank you  i didnt do so much i guess shes scared a good bit  she hardly realized the danger dear child did you millie my pet  the bad cow wanted to eat up my dollies exclaimed the little miss with a grave shake of the head but oo helped me she added to me  im glad i was here i returned  may i ask how you happened to come in continued the lady  in a few words i told my story i had hardly finished when the back door opened and a gentleman stepped out  what is the trouble here he asked anxiously i just heard that a mad bull had run into the garden  so he did james a savage monster indeed this young man just beat him off and saved millies life  hardly that i put in modestly i did not want more praise than i was justly entitled to receive  indeed but he did see the spade covered with blood had he not hit the animal over the head with that something dreadful would have happened  i didnt hit him exactly i laughed i held it up and he ran against it and once more i told my story  you have done us a great service young man said the gentleman when i had concluded i was once in the butcher business myself in fact i am in it yet but only in the export trade and i know full well how dangerous bulls can get had it not been for you my little girl might have been torn to pieces one of her dolls is dressed in red and this would have attracted the bulls immediate attention i thank you deeply he grasped my hand warmly may i ask your name  roger strong sir  my name is harrison james harrison you live here in chicago i suppose  no sir i come from darbyville new jersey  darbyville he thought a moment i never heard of such a town  it is only a small place several miles from new york i came to chicago on business i arrived about half an hour ago  really your introduction into our city has been rather an exciting one  ive had other adventures fully as exciting in the past few days i returned  yes and mr harrison eyed me curiously  yes our train was delayed i almost had my handbag stolen and ive been arrested as a thief  and all in a half an hour the gentleman and his wife both looked incredulous  no sir since ive left home  i should like to hear your story that is if you care to tell it  i will tell you the whole thing if you care to listen i returned reflecting that my newly made friend might give me some material assistance in my quest  then come into the house  id better shut the alley gate first said i and running down i did so and picked up my handbag as well  mr harrison led the way inside i could not help but note the rich furnishings of the place the soft carpets artistically papered walls the costly pictures and bricabrac all telling of wealth  mrs harrison and the little girl had disappeared up the stairs mr harrison ushered me into his library and motioned me to a seat  i hardly knew how to begin my story to show how john stumpy had had me arrested it would be necessary to go back to affairs at darbyville and this i hesitated about doing  if you have time i would like to tell you about my affairs before i started to come to chicago i said i would like your advice  the gentleman looked at the clock resting upon the mantel shelf  i have an engagement at eleven oclock he returned until then i am entirely at your service and will be in the afternoon if you desire it ill promise to give you the best advice i can  thank you i am a stranger here and most people wont pay much attention to a boy i replied  then i told my story in full just as i have written it here mr harrison was deeply interested  it is a strange case he said when i had concluded these men must be thorough rascals every one of them of course it yet remains to be seen what this chris holtzmann has to do with the affair he may be made to give evidence for or against your father just as he is approached i think i would be careful at the first meeting  i did not intend to let him know who i was  a good plan  but now if i venture on the street i may be arrested i went on  it is not likely chicago is a big city and unless the officer who arrested you before meets you it is improbable that he can give an accurate enough description of you for others to identify you then again having failed in his duty he may not report the case at all  thats so but if i do run across him  then send for me here is my card if i can be of service to you i shall be glad  mr harrison gave me minute directions how to reach holtzmanns place then it was time for him to go and we left the house together i promised to call on him again before quitting chicago  it was with a lighter heart that i went on my way in some manner i felt that i had at least one friend in the big city to whom i could turn for advice and assistance  guided by the directions mr harrison had given me i had no difficulty in making my way in the direction of chris holtzmanns place of business or house whatever it might prove to be  as i passed up one street and down another i could not help but look about me with great curiosity if chicago was not new york it was next door to it and i could have easily spent the entire day in sightseeing  but though my eyes were taking in all that was to be seen my mind was busy speculating upon the future what would chris holtzmann think of my visit and what would be the result of our interview  at length i turned down the street upon which his place was located it was a wide and busy thoroughfare lined with shops of all kinds saloons were numerous and from several of them came the sounds of lively music  can you tell me where chris holtzmanns place is i asked of a man on the corner  holtzmanns sure down on the next corner  thank you  variety actor went on the man curiously  oh no i laughed  thought not theyre generally pretty tough the ones chris hires  does he have a variety theatre  thats what he calls it but its nothing but a concert hall with jugglers and tumblers thrown in  i did not relish the idea of going into such a place and i knew that my sister kate and the widow canby would be horrified when they heard of it  what kind of a man is this holtzmann i continued seeing that the man i had accosted was inclined to talk  oh hes a good enough kind of a fellow if you know how to take him was the reply hes a bit cranky if hes had a glass too much but that dont happen often  does he run the place himself  what tend bar and so  yes  oh no hes too hightoned for that he only bosses things they say hes rich be came from the east some years ago with quite a little money and hes been adding to it ever since  then you know him quite well  worked for him two years then he up one day and declared i was robbing him we had a big row and i got out  did he have you arrested  arrested not much he knew better than to try such a game on me when i was in his employ i kept my eyes and ears open and i knew too much about his private affairs for him to push me even if i had been guilty oh sammy simpson knows a thing or two  that is your name  yes samuel a simpson generally called sammy for short i was his bookkeeper and corresponding clerk  maybe youre just the man i want to see i said do you know anything about mr holtzmanns private affairs in the east  in brooklyn  yes  sammy simpson hesitated for a moment  maybe i do he replied with a shrewd look in his eyes is there anything to be made out of it  i will pay you for whatever you do for me  then im your huckleberry who are you and what do you want to know    chapter xxvii   the palace of pleasure  mr sammy simpson was a character he was tall and slim certainly not less than fifty years of age but with an evident desire to appear much younger his face was cleanly shaven and when he removed his hat to scratch his head i saw that he was nearly bald  he was dressed in a light check suit and wore patentleather shoes i put him down as a dandy but fond of drink and that he proved to be  whom do you work for now i asked  no one to tell the truth im down on my luck and im waiting for something to turn up  you say you worked for holtzmann two years ago  no i said i worked for him two years i only left last month  and he accused you of stealing  yes but it was only to get rid of me because i knew too much of his private affairs  what do you know of his private affairs  sammy simpson rubbed his chin  excuse me but who am i talking to he asked abruptly  never mind who i am i am here to get all the information i can about chris holtzmann and im willing to pay for it of course im not rich but ive got a few dollars if you cant help me ill have to go elsewhere  my plain speech startled sammy simpson  hold up dont get mad because i asked your name youve a perfect right to keep it to yourself if you want to only make it sure to me that ill get paid for what i tell and it will be all right  i was perplexed i had half a mind to mention mr harrisons name but if i did that the man might expect altogether too much  i will promise you that you lose nothing i said but we cant talk things over in the street tell me where i can meet you later on  want to see holtzmann first  yes  you wont get anything out of him ill wager you that  i dont expect to i want to see what kind of a man he is  well youll find me at 28 hallock street generally if im not in you can find out there where ive gone to  ill remember it in the meantime dont speak of this meeting to any one  mums the word rejoined sammy simpson  i went on my way deep in thought i considered it a stroke of luck that i had fallen in with chris holtzmanns former clerk no doubt the man knew much that would prove of value to me  i doubted if this man was perfectly honest i was satisfied that the concerthall manager had had good grounds for discharging him but it often takes a rogue to catch a rogue and i was willing to profit by any advantage that came to hand  at length i reached the next corner on it stood a splendid building of marble having over the door in raised letters                            chris holtzmanns                          palace of pleasure                   open all the time admission free  for a moment i hesitated should i enter such a hole of iniquity  then came the thought of my mission how i wished to clear the family name from the stain that rested upon it and free my father from imprisonment and i went in  i do not care to describe the scene that met my eyes the magnificent decorations of the place were to my mind entirely out of keeping with its character the foulness of a subcellar would have been more appropriate  in the back where a stage was located were a number of small tables i sat down at one of these and had a waiter bring me a glass of soda water  is mr holtzmann about i asked  yes sir there he is over by the cigar counter shall i call him  no  i paid for my soda and sipped it leisurely the place was about half full and all attention was being paid to master ardon the wonderful boy dancer who was doing a clog on the stage  mr chris holtzmann was very much the style of a man i had imagined him to be he was short and stout with a thick neck and a double chin he was loudly dressed including several seal rings and a heavy gold watch chain  i calculated that he would be a hard man to approach and now that i was face to face with him i hardly knew how to proceed  at first i thought to ask him for a situation of some kind and thus get on speaking terms with him but concluded that openness would pay best in the end and so rising i approached him  mr holtzmann i believe i began  yes he said slowly looking me over from head to foot  if you please i would like to have a talk with you i went on  what is it and he turned his ear toward me  i have come all the way from darbyville new jersey to see you  what he started and what is your business with me sir he went on sharply  i would like to see you in private and i glanced at the clerk and several others who were staring at us  come to my office he returned and led the way through a door at one side into a handsomely furnished apartment facing the side street  ross you can post the letters he said to a clerk who was writing at a desk be back in half an hour  it was a hint that we were to be left alone and the clerk was not long in gathering up the letters that had been written and leaving  i suppose woodward sent you began chris holtzmann when we were seated  this remark nearly took away my breath i thought he would deny all knowledge of having ever known the merchant and here he was mentioning the man at the very start  i hardly knew how to reply and he continued  ive been expecting him for several days  well you know there was an accident on the railroad i began as coolly as i could the bridge shifted and the trains couldnt run  yes i heard of that he paused for a moment what brought you  this was a home question i plunged in like a swimmer into a deep stream  i came to get the papers relating to the strong forgeries you have all of them i suppose  i was surprised at my own boldness so was my listener  sh not so loud he exclaimed who said i had the papers  john stumpy spoke about them to mr woodward  he did eh sneered chris holtzmann he had better keep his mouth shut how does he know but what the papers were destroyed long ago  i hope not i replied earnestly  what does woodward want of the papers  i dont know exactly the strong family are going to have the case opened again and hes afraid they may be dragged in  no one knows i have them but him stumpy and you he gave me a suspicious glance who are  the strongs know i put in hastily thus cutting him off  what he jumped up from his chair who was fool enough to tell them  nicholas weaver left a dying statement  the idiot i always said he was a weakminded fool cried chris holtzmann who has this statement  i dont know where it is now but carson strongs son had it  strongs son great scott then woodwards goose is cooked i always told him he hadnt covered up his tracks  yes but he paid you pretty well for your share of the work i returned i was getting mixed the deception could not be kept up much longer and i wondered what would happen when the truth became known  didnt pay me half of what i should have got i helped him not only in brooklyn but here in chicago as well how would he have accounted for all his money if i hadnt had a rich aunt die and leave it to him chris holtzmann gave a short laugh i reckon that was a neat plan of mine  you ran a big risk  so we did but it paid  and john stumpy helped too  he did in a way but he drank too much to be of any great use by the way do you drink  as holtzmann spoke he opened a closet at one side of the room behind a screen and brought forth a bottle of liquor and a pair of glasses  no thank you i replied  no have a cigar then  thank you i dont smoke  what dont smoke or drink thats queer wish i could say the same mighty expensive habits what did you say your name was  at this instant there was a knock on the door and chris holtzmann walked back of the screen and opened it  a man to see you sir i heard a voice say  who is it asked chris holtzmann  says his name is aaron woodward    chapter xxviii   a deal for a thousand dollars  i was thunderstruck by the announcement that mr aaron woodward was waiting to come in had it been john stumpy who was announced i would not have been so much surprised but aaron woodward the chase after me was indeed getting hot  evidently the merchant was not satisfied to leave affairs in chicago entirely in his confederates hands either he did not trust stumpy or else the matter was of too much importance  i did not give these thoughts close attention at the time but revolved them in my mind later just now i was trying to resolve what was best to do would it be advisable for me to remain or had i better get out  to retire precipitately might not be good form but it might save me a deal of trouble i had had one round with the merchant in his mansion in darbyville and i was not particularly anxious for another encounter i was but a boy and between the two men they might carry too many guns for me  i looked around for some immediate means of escape as i have said the office was located on the side street directly in front of the desk was a large window opened to let in the fresh morning air for me to think was to act in less than a minute i was seated on the desk with my legs dangling over the window sill  aaron woodward repeated chris holtzmann in evident surprise  yes sir and he says he must see you at once  did you hear that called out holtzmann to me  yes i did i returned as coolly as i could  did you expect him  no  humph  holtzmann made a movement as if to step into view and i prepared to vanish from the scene but he changed his mind and walked from the office  i was in a quandary to remain would place me in great peril yet i was anxious to know the result of the meeting between the two men they were the prime movers in my fathers downfall and nothing must be left undone to bring them to justice  i resolved to remain even if it were at the peril of my life i was not an overbrave boy but the thought of my father languishing in prison because of these mens misdeeds nerved me to stay  the closet door was still open and that gave me a sudden idea  as i jumped from the desk another idea struck me and without any hesitation i scattered the papers on the floor and upset the inkwell  then i squeezed myself into the closet crouching down into one corner behind several canes and umbrellas  i was not an instant too soon for hardly had i settled myself than the door opened and chris holtzmann reentered followed by mr aaron woodward  both men were highly excited and both uttered an exclamation when they saw the room was empty  hes gone cried holtzmann  gone repeated the merchant get out holtzmann he was never here  i say he was less than two minutes ago  well where is he now  i dont know ha i see it he has jumped through the windows see how he has upset the ink and scattered the papers its as clear as day  can you see anything of him outside  chris holtzmann leaned out of the window  no hes up and around the corner long ago  we must catch the rascal went on mr woodward in a high voice he knows too much he will ruin us both  ruin us both sneered the proprietor of the palace of pleasure i dont see how he can ruin me  youre in it just as deep as i am just as deep  not a bit of it returned holtzmann with spirit you are the only one who profited by the whole transaction and you are the one to take the blame  see here chris youre not going back on me in this way exclaimed the merchant in a tone of reproach  im not going back on you at all woody but you cant use me as you used john stumpy it wont go down  now dont get excited chris  im not excited but i know a thing or two just as well as you do if there is any exposure to take place you must stand the brunt of it you were a fool to let the boy get ahead of you  i didnt it was stumpy he let the boy get hold of nick weavers statement and that started the thing then the boy stole some of my papers that were in my desk and how much information he has now i dont know  all your own fault responded holtzmann coolly why dont you destroy all the evidence on hand  do you do that asked mr woodward furiously  i do when i think it isnt going to do me any more good replied holtzmann evasively  have you destroyed all the evidence in this matter  holtzmann closed one eye im not so green as you take me to be he replied impressively all my evidence against you is locked up in my safe  you intend to use it against me said the merchant  only if it becomes necessary  and yet you pretend to be a friend of mine  i was until you cheated me out of my fair share of the spoils but i am satisfied and willing to let the whole matter rest  what will you take for the papers you hold  wouldnt sell them at any price im not running my head into any trap  it will be all right  maybe it will but ill run no risk he paused a moment ill tell you what i will do give me a thousand dollars and ill let you see me burn them up  i was intensely surprised at this proposition more so i believe than was mr woodward  a thousand dollars he exclaimed chris youre crazy  no indeed i know a thing or two what do you suppose the strongs would pay for them  you dont mean to say you would play me false ejaculated the merchant hoarsely  i mean to say id do anything to save myself if you got us into a hole as far as i can see you have allowed this boy to get the best of you at every turn  humph you neednt talk you let him walk right into your confidence the first thing  only when he told me all about your affairs  well let that drop cant you let me have the papers cheaper  i said i wouldnt let you have the papers at all ill burn them up  will you let me see them  chris holtzmanns brow contracted  what for  oh i only want to make sure of what youve got  will you pay the price  make them cheaper  no  ill take them  you mean have them burnt up  yes but i must examine them first  im willing and i must have my check before they go into the fire  you are very suspicious chris very suspicious  no more so than you woody i wasnt born yesterday  well lets have the papers and ill write out the check but it must be understood that you give no more information to the boy  give him information cried holtzmann let him show his face here again and ill break every bone in his body he added grimly  this was certainly an interesting bit of news i made up my mind that to be seen would render matters decidedly warm for me  but i was even more interested over the fact that the two men intended to burn up part of the evidence that might clear my fathers name such a thing must not happen i must use every means in my power to prevent it  yet what was to be done if the documents were produced at once how could i save them from destruction  a bold dash for them seemed the only way once snatched from holtzmanns or aaron woodwards hands and escape through the window or the door would be difficult but not impossible  yet while i was revolving these thoughts over in my mind the same thing evidently suggested itself to the proprietor of the palace of pleasure  wait till i lock the door he said we dont want to be interrupted  no indeed returned mr woodward interruptions dont pay  and ill close the window too went on holtzmann its cool enough without having it open  so it is  so the window and the door were both closed and fastened i was chagrined but could do nothing  a moment later i heard chris holtzmann at his safe and then the rattle of something on his desk  the papers are in this tin box he said i placed them there over six months ago  he opened the box and i heard a rustling of documents  why why what does this mean he ejaculated they are not here  what cried mr aaron woodward aghast  the papers are not here holtzmann hurried over to his safe and began a hasty search as sure as youre born woody they have been stolen  its that boy exclaimed the merchant hes a wizard of a sly one he has stolen them and we are lost    chapter xxix   the precious papers  i was not as much surprised over the situation as were the two men i could put two and two together as quickly as any one and i knew exactly where the papers were to be found  sammy simpson of 28 hallock street was the thief he had intimated that he had evidence against chris holtzmann and these papers were that evidence  this being so there was no further use for my remaining in my cramped position in the closet and i longed for a chance for escape it was not long in coming  i dont see how that boy managed it said holtzmann he was alone only a few minutes  never mind hes as smart as a steel trap was the safe door open  yes my clerk left it open he is a new one and rather careless whats to be done  im going after the rascal cried aaron woodward  youd have a fine time finding him here in chicago  i must find him most likely when he discovers how valuable the papers are hell be off at once for home with them i can intercept him at the depot  thats an idea if you can locate the right depot  ill be off at once went on mr woodward  ill go with you returned chris holtzmann and three minutes later the two men quitted the office locking the door after them  i waited several minutes to make sure they were not returning and then emerged from my hidingplace  i was stiff in every joint and nearly stifled from the hot air in the closet but at present i gave these personal matters scant attention my mind being bent upon escape  even if the door had been unlocked i would not have chosen it as a means of egress it led into the main hall of the palace of pleasure and here i might meet some one to bar my escape  the window was close at hand and i threw it open the noise i made did not frighten me for in the main hall a loud orchestra was drowning out every other sound  i looked out and saw a number of people walking up and down the street no one appeared to be watching me and waiting a favorable opportunity i slid out of the window to the sidewalk below  with my ever present handbag beside me i hurried down the side street as fast as my feet would carry me the neighborhood of the palace of pleasure was dangerous for me and i wished to get away from it as quickly as possible  after travelling several blocks i slackened my pace and dropped into a rapid walk coming to a fruitstand i invested in a couple of bananas and then asked its proprietor where hallock street was  sure an its the first street beyant the cable road was the reply  and where is the cable road i queried  two squares that way sor and the woman pointed it out  i thanked her and hurried on when i reached the street i found the numbers ran in the three hundreds and i had quite a walk to the southward to reach no 28  at length i stood in front of the house it was a commonlooking affair and the vicinity was not one to be chosen by fastidious people the street sidewalks and doorways all looked dirty and neglected i concluded that since being discharged sammy simpson had come down in the world  does mr simpson live here i asked of a slip of a girl who sat on the stoop nursing a ragged doll  yes sir on the third floor in the front she replied  i climbed up the creaky stairs two flights and rapped on the door  come said a voice and i entered the room was the barest kind of a kitchen by the open window sat a thin pale woman holding a child  does mr samuel simpson live here i asked  yes sir but hes not in now she returned can i do anything for you  i guess not  i hope i hope there is nothing wrong she went on falteringly  wrong i queried i did not quite understand her  yes sir  not exactly what makes you think so  because he drinks so she replied  i wish to get some information from him that is all i returned  as i concluded a heavy step sounded in the hall and an instant later sammy simpson appeared he had evidently been imbibing freely for his voice was thick and his sentences muddled  hello he cried you here already eh what brought you want to find out all about chris holtzmann  yes  thought so saw it in your eye yes sir your optic betrayed you sit down mag give mr whatshisname a chair ill sit down myself and he sank heavily down on a low bench threw one leg over the other and clasped his hands on his knee  i want to see those documents you took from mr holtzmanns safe i began boldly  he started slightly and stared at me  who said i took any document out of his safe  didnt you say so i mean the ones relating to holtzmanns affairs in brooklyn  well yes i did  i want to see them  again i ask what is there in it he exclaimed dramatically  if they really prove of value to me i will pay you well for all your trouble i replied  is that straight he asked thickly  it is i replied and i may as well add i was thoroughly disgusted with the man  then im yours truly and no mistake excuse me till i get them  be rose unsteadily and left the room hardly had he gone before his wife hurried to my side  oh sir i hope you are not getting him into trouble she cried he is a good man when he is sober indeed he is  i am not going to harm him madam a great wrong has been done and i only want your husband to assist me in righting it he has papers that can do it  you are telling me the truth she questioned earnestly  yes maam  i think i can trust you she said slowly you look honest and these papers ought you to have them  yes if your husband does not give them up he will certainly get into great trouble  you are young and you dont look as if you would lie if sam has the papers he shall give them to you hes coming now  heres all the evidence in the case said sammy simpson on returning he held a thick and long envelope whats the value to you  i can tell better after i have examined them i returned  will you give them back if i let you see them  yes  he handed the precious papers to me and then sat down  oh how eagerly i grasped the envelope how much of importance it might contain for me  there were three letters and four legal papers like nicholas weavers statement all were badly written and i had a hard job to decipher even a portion of the manuscript  yet i made out enough to learn that aaron woodward was the forger of the notes and checks that had sent my father to prison and that the death of a relative in chicago was only a pretence the work had been done in brooklyn through that branch of holland  macks establishment chris holtzmann had helped in the scheme and john stumpy had presented one of the checks for which service he had received six hundred dollars this much was clear to me but two other points still remained dark  one was of a certain ferguson connected with the scheme who seemed to be intimate with my father he was probably the man my father had mentioned when we had visited him at the prison his connection with the affair was far from clear  the other dark point in the case was concerning agatha mitts of 648 vannack avenue brooklyn she was a boardingmistress and the three or four men had stopped at her house but how much she knew of their doings i could not tell  well what do you think muttered sammy simpson mighty important ill be bound  not so very important i returned as coolly as i could they will be if i can get hold of other papers to use with them  exactly sir just as i always said well you can get them easily enough no doubt  i dont know about that i said doubtfully  no trouble at all come what will you give  five dollars  ha ha theyre worth a million he blinked hard at me say youre a friend of mine a good boy meg shall i give them to him  you ought to do whats right sam replied his wife severely  so i ought youre a good woman big improvement on a chap like me say young man give my lady ten dollars keep the papers and clear out im drunk and when sammy simpsons drunk hes a fool  i handed over the money without a word perhaps i was taking advantage of the mans present state but i considered i was doing things for the best  a minute later with the precious papers in my pocket i left    chapter xxx   the train for new york  down in the street i hesitated as to where to go next i felt that the case on hand was getting too complicated for me and that i needed assistance  i did not relish calling on the police for help they were probably on the watch for me and even if not they would deem me only a boy and give me scant attention  my mind reverted to the adventure earlier in the day and i remembered mr harrisons kind offer i had done his little daughter a good turn and i was positive the gentleman would assist me to the best of his ability  i decided to call on him at once i had his address still in my pocket and though i was quite tired i hurried along at a rapid rate  on the way i revolved in my mind all that had occurred within the past two hours and by the time i reached mr harrisons place i had the matter in such shape that i could tell a clear straightforward story  i found the gentleman in and pleased at my return  i was afraid you had gotten into more difficulties he explained with a smile  so i did but i got out of them again i replied  sitting down i gave him the particulars of my visit to chris holtzmann and to sammy simpson and handed over the documents for inspection mr harrison was deeply interested and examined the papers with great care it took him nearly an hour to do so and then he plied me with numerous questions  do you know what my advice is he asked at length  no sir  i advise you to have both holtzmann and woodward arrested at once they are thorough rascals and your father is the innocent victim of their cupidity  but how can i do that no one knows me here in chicago  hold up you make a mistake i know you  yes but you dont know anything about me i began  i know you to be a brave fellow and brave people are generally honest besides your face speaks for itself  you are very kind  i have not forgotten the debt i owe you and whatever i do for you will never fully repay it  and you advise me  to put the case in the hands of the police without delay come i will go with you perhaps this holtzmann may be frightened into a confession  i trust so it will save a good deal of trouble  woodward can be taken into custody as soon as the necessary papers are made out concluded mr harrison  an instant later we were on the way i wondered what had become of john stumpy it was strange that he had not turned up at the palace of pleasure perhaps mr aaron woodward had intercepted him and either scared or bought him off  the fellow held much evidence that i wished to obtain for every letter or paper against mr woodward would make my fathers case so much stronger and i determined with all my heart that when once brought to trial there should be no failure to punish the guilty so that the innocent might be acquitted  at the police station we found the sergeant in charge mr harrison was well known in the locality and his presence gained at once for us a private audience  the officer of the law gave the case his closest attention and asked me even more questions than had been put to me before  i remember reading of this affair in the court records he said judge fowler and i were saying what a peculiar case it was chris holtzmann claims to keep a firstclass resort and i would hardly dare to proceed against him were it not for these papers and you mr harrison  you will arrest him at once questioned the gentleman  if you say so  i do most assuredly  you are interested in the case queried the sergeant as he prepared to leave  only on this young mans account he saved my little daughter from a horrible death this morning  indeed how so  there was a mad bull broke into my back garden from the street and was about to gore her when this young man who had been driven into the garden in the first place came between and drove the bull out  oh i heard of that bull  what became of him i put in curiously  he was killed by a couple of officers on the next block he was nearly dead before they shot him having received a terrible cut between the eyes  given by this young man explained mr harrison  you dont mean it cried the officer in admiration phew but you must be strong  it was more by good luck than strength i returned modestly  nonsense said mr harrison my wife witnessed the whole occurrence and she says it was pure bravery  five minutes later a cab was called and we all got in i was not sorry to ride for my long tramp from one place to another on the stone pavement had made me footsore i did not mind walking but the darbyville roads were softer than those of chicago  it did not take long to reach the palace of pleasure  just wait in the cab for a minute or two said the sergeant to me if he sees you first he may make a scene  most likely hes gone out i returned  the sergeant and mr harrison left the carriage and entered the building  i awaited their return impatiently would they get their man and would mr aaron woodward be along  five ten minutes dragged slowly by then the two returned  hes not in the place and no one knows where he has gone said the officer  he cant be far off i replied no doubt he and mr woodward have gone off to look for me  and where put in mr harrison i thought a moment  the depot i exclaimed he spoke about looking for me there  then well be off at once returned the sergeant  as he spoke a familiar figure came shambling around the corner it was sammy simpson  hello you he cried on catching sight of me i want those papers back  why do you want them back i asked  you didnt pay the value of em didnt pay enough he hiccoughed  i paid all i agreed to  cant say anything about that but taint enough he glared at me holtzmann said hed pay me a hundred dollars yes sir ten times as much as you  when de you see holtzmann i cried in great interest  saw him about half an hour ago he came to see me came to see sammy simpson climbed the stairs to my abode wanted the papers said i must have em went wild with rage when i let slip you had em so did the other gent  who mr woodward  thats the identical name yes sir the correct handle and they wanted the papers offered a hundred dollars for em think of it heres the ten dollars give em back  had sammy simpson been sober he would not have made such a simple proposition  no sir i replied decidedly a bargains a bargain ive got the papers and i intend to keep them  no you dont  whats that broke in the sergeant of police  i want those papers  do you know who i am  no and dont care  i am sergeant of police and i want you to behave yourself or ill run you in was the decided reply  at the mention of an officer sammy simpson grew pale  no no dont do that ive never been arrested in my life  the papers are in the hands of the proper parties went on the sergeant  then i cant have em back  no and the less you have to do with the whole matter the better off youll be where has holtzmann gone  to brooklyn  i was astonished to brooklyn and so soon  you are sure i queried  yes he and the other gent intended to take the first train  here was indeed news this sudden and unexpected departure must portend something of importance  we must catch them i exclaimed  do you know anything about the trains asked mr harrison  no  jump in and well be off to the depot said the sergeant  in an instant we had started leaving sammy simpson standing in the middle of the pavement too astonished to speak it was the last i ever saw of the man  we made the driver urge his horse at the top of his speed i calculated that the pair would take the same line that had brought me to chicago  i was not mistaken for when we reached the depot a few questions put by the sergeant revealed the fact that the two men had purchased tickets for new york but a minute before  and when does the train leave i asked  her times up now  at that instant a bell rang  theres the bell  we must catch her i cried and ran though the gate and on to the platform  but the train was already moving i tried to catch her but failed and a minute later the cars rolled out of sight  mr aaron woodward and chris holtzmann had escaped me  what was to be done next    chapter xxxi   in the metropolis  i was thoroughly chagrined when i stood on the platform and saw the train roll away now that i had mr harrison and the sergeant of police with me i had fondly hoped to capture the two men even if it was at the last minute  but now that chance was gone and as i turned back to my two companions i felt utterly nonplussed  one thing was perfectly clear in my mind the two men had gone to brooklyn to see mrs agatha mitts no doubt they thought that now i had the papers sammy simpson had stolen in my possession i would follow up the train of evidence by calling on the woman a thing i most likely would have done they intended to head me off and by this means break down my case against them at its last stage  yet though i was disappointed i was not disheartened i was fighting for honor and intended to keep on until not a single thing remained to do my evidence against woodward and holtzmann was gradually accumulating and sooner or later it must bring them to the bar of justice  well theyre gone i exclaimed as i joined the others that is if they were on that train  well ask the gateman and make sure said the sergeant  this was done and we soon learned that beyond a doubt mr woodward and chris holtzmann had been among the departed passengers  my work in chicago is at an end remarked the sergeant as we stood in the waitingroom discussing the situation  and so is mine i replied ive got the papers and now the two men are gone there is no use of my remaining  what do you intend to do asked mr harrison  follow them to brooklyn  to brooklyn its a good distance  i cant help it i must go as for the distance it is not many miles from my home  mr harrison mused for a moment  i have an idea of going along with you he said at length  going along with me i repeated astonished by his offer  yes i intended to take a trip to new york on special business next week but i can go today instead you no doubt need help and i want to give it to you  you are very kind i replied  i would like to see you and your family get your rights he went on i wonder when the next train leaves  ill find out at the ticket office i replied  i walked over to the box and at the window learned that the next train would not start for two hours and a half  that will give me time to go home pack my valise and arrange my affairs said mr harrison come you can go with me and we can dine together  thank you was my answer  and you sergeant i will be pleased to have you too continued mr harrison turning to the officer  youre kind mr harrison but duty calls me elsewhere ill have to return to the station but youve forgotten one thing  what  that you can telegraph to new york and have the two men arrested as soon as they arrive  thats so what do you say strong  i thought for a moment it would be the simplest way to do but would it be the best  dont you think we had better let them go ahead i returned we know exactly where they are going and by following them up may gain some additional information  i dont know but what you are right replied mr harrison  then in that case my duty here is at an end said the sergeant  im very much obliged for the trouble youve taken are there any charges to pay  none at all good day hope you will meet with success in the future  thank you if we do ill write you  now well jump into a cab at once said mr harrison when we were alone  a minute later we were whirling along in the direction of his mansion  i hope you are not taking too much trouble on my account i observed  i dont consider it too much he replied even if i had no business of my own to call me to new york i would go along if i thought i would be of service to you you saved my little girls life and that debt as i have told you before i can never repay you  we soon reached mr harrisons mansion of course mrs harrison was surprised at her husbands sudden determination but when the situation was explained to her she urged him to do his best for me  the dinner served was the most elegant i had ever eaten and despite the excited state of mind i was in i did ample justice to it little millie was present and during the progress of the meal we became great friends  but all good things must come to an end and an hour later each with his handbag we entered the cab and were off  on the way we stopped at mr harrisons office where that gentleman left directions concerning things to be done during his absence evidently he was a thorough business man and i could not help but wonder what he was worth when i saw him place several hundred dollars in bills in his pocketbook  arriving at the depot we found we had just five minutes to spare this mr harrison spent in the purchase of a ticket for himself i had mine and in getting parlorcar seats for both of us  it was a novelty to me to have such a soft chair to sit in and i thoroughly enjoyed it  as we rode along my kind friend questioned me closely about myself and i ended by giving him my entire history  youve had rather a hard row to hoe and no mistake he said it is a dreadful thing to have ones family honor assailed many a man has broken down completely under it  it is so with my father i replied he used to be as bright as any one but now he doesnt have much hope of any kind left  in the evening another surprise awaited me instead of remaining in the comfortable chair mr harrison bade me follow him to the sleepingcar and i was assigned as soft a bed as i had ever occupied i slept like a top resolved to get the full value of so elegant an accommodation when i awoke it was broad daylight  i climbed down from my bed and made my toilet leisurely when i had finished mr harrison appeared and together we had breakfast and five hours later dinner  it was six oclock in the evening when we rolled into the station at jersey city and alighted i was a little stiff from the long ride but not near as much so as i would have been had i travelled in the ordinary cars  well cross the ferry at once said mr harrison the sooner we get to new york the better  and the sooner we get to brooklyn the better i added do you think it will be advisable for me to hunt up mrs agatha mitts tonight  i think it would even if you dont call on her you can find out about her and see how the land lies we will find a hotel to stop at first  we were soon in new york and on our way up broadway opposite the postoffice we found an elegant hotel where mr harrison hired a room for himself  he insisted on my having supper with him then leaving our handbags in his room we started for the fulton street ferry to brooklyn  it was now growing dark and the streets were filled with people hurrying homeward i tried to keep as close to mr harrison as possible but something in a window attracted my attention and when i looked around he was gone  i supposed he had gone on ahead and hurried to catch him but in this i was mistaken for in no direction could i catch sight of the gentleman  deeply concerned i stood on the corner of a narrow street or alley undecided what to do should i go on to brooklyn or retrace my steps to the hotel  i had about made up my mind to go on when a disturbance down the alley attracted my attention  straining my eyes in the semidarkness i discovered several roughlooking young fellows in a group  give it to him bandy hit him over the head i heard one of them exclaim  fair share of plunder mickey cried another  and then i saw a helpless young man in their midst who was being beaten and no doubt robbed  i did not give thought to the great risk i ran but hurried at once to the scene  what are you doing here i asked  help me help me called out the young man in a beseeching voice  i stared at him in amazement and no wonder the young man was duncan woodward    chapter xxxii   a night at the hotel  duncan woodward i exclaimed is it possible  he gave me a quick look of wonder roger strong he gasped oh save me roger these rowdies want to kill me  even as he spoke he received a cruel blow in the side  ill help you all i can i replied promptly  i knew it would be a waste of words to try to argue with the gang of toughs so i simply went at them in a physical way  i hit out right and left with all my might and as quickly as i could repeated the blows  the suddenness of my attack disconcerted the three footpads and when duncan recovered sufficiently to lend a hand one of them took to his heels and disappeared up the alley  the two remaining ones stood their ground and called on their companions to come back and bring noxy an de rest  i received a blow in the shoulder that nearly threw me over on my back but i straightened up and in return gave my assailant a hard one in the nose that drew blood  duncan you clear out to the street i whispered ill come after  the young man followed my advice first however stopping to pick up several things he had dropped or that had been taken from him  when he was twenty or thirty feet away i started after him as i did so i noticed he had left a large notebook lying on the ground i took it up and hurried on for a moment more we were safe upon the street again and the two toughs slunk away up the alley  then for the first time i noted something about duncan that i thought shameful beyond words  he had been drinking heavily the smell of liquor was in his breath and it was with difficulty that he kept from staggering  youre my best friend he mumbled my enemy and my friend  what are you doing in new york duncan i asked  come on important business roger say take me to the hotel will you thats a good fellow  where are you staying  staying nowhere  then why dont you take the train to newville and go home  cant do that  why not  the old gent would kill me he says i spend too much money well maybe i do  youve bean drinking duncan  so i have roger take me to a hotel  will you promise to go to bed and not to drink any more if i do  yes ive had enough  then brace up and come with me  not without a good deal of difficulty did i manage to make him walk several blocks to a good though not stylish hotel here i took him into the office and explained the situation to the clerk in charge who promptly assigned us to a room on the third floor  the charge was three dollars which duncan with some difficulty managed to pay and then we took the elevator to the third floor  the room was a good one with a soft bed no sooner did duncan reach it than he sank down and in five minutes he was fast asleep  i was in a quandary as to what to do i did not care to leave him in his present state and at the same time i was anxious to find mr harrison and visit mrs agatha mitts in brooklyn  i wondered if my kind friend from chicago had gone on without me until i suddenly remembered that the brooklyn address was in my pocket and that he probably did not remember the street and number  this being the case he had no doubt returned to the hotel and was awaiting me  i looked at duncan and made up my mind that he would sleep several hours if not longer without awaking  making him as comfortable as possible on the bed i left the room locking the door behind me  down in the office i explained the situation to the clerk when i left the key and he promised to attend to matters if anything unusual happened  i was not very well acquainted with new york city and in trying to find my way to the hotel at which mr harrison was stopping i nearly lost my way  but several inquiries made here and there set me right and at length i reached the large open corridor  as i was about to step into the office a wellknown voice hailed me  well here you are at last of course it was mr harrison  yes sir  did i lose you or vice versa he went on  i dont know im sure it wasnt intentional anyway  have you been over to brooklyn he continued curiously  no sir  i thought you had it is so long since we parted  ive had quite an adventure in the meantime  indeed you didnt meet chris holtzmann or this aaron woodward did you  i met mr woodwards son i replied and in a brief way i related my adventures mr harrison listened with deep interest  it is too bad that the son has started in such a wrong path he said i trust it teaches him a lesson to let liquor alone what do you intend to do now  i suppose i had better go back and stay all night with him it is now too late to go to brooklyn  i think you are right i can call for you at say eight oclock in the morning  this was agreed upon and as it was then after nine oclock i hurried back to duncan at once i found him still sleeping and i did not disturb him there was a lounge in the room and throwing off my coat vest and shoes i made my bed upon this  for once i found it difficult to sleep it seemed to me that my adventures must soon come to an end was it the foreshadowing of coming events that disturbed me i could not tell i wondered how all were at home my sister kate uncle enos and the widow canby and i prayed god that i might be permitted to bring good news to them  about midnight i fell into a light doze half an hour later i awoke with a start some one was talking in the room sitting up i listened intently it was duncan muttering in his sleep  lift the spring pultzer he said in a whisper hist dont make so much noise the old gent may hear you he paused for a moment there wasnt any money but ive got the papers yes ive got the papers and when i find out their true value the old gent shall pay me to keep quiet  i could not help but start at duncans words like a flash of lightning came the revelation to me he had entered his fathers library and taken the papers which mr woodward had accused me of stealing  it was as clear as day it explained why pultzer accompanied by another who must have been of the party had been out so late the night of the robbery they had helped duncan in his nefarious work hoping they would be rewarded by the finding of a sum of money evidently the models were a bad set and i was thoroughly glad dick blair had turned his back upon them  i waited with bated breath for duncan to continue his speaking but was disappointed he turned over on his side and dreamed on without a word  at length i fell asleep when i awoke it was daylight i jumped up and looked at duncan he was just stirring and a moment later he opened his eyes  where am i he asked with a puzzled look at me  youre all right duncan i replied dont you remember  oh yes i do now how my head hurts is there any water around  i went over to the faucet and drew him a glass he sat up and gulped it down  have we been here all night  yes  you saved me from those toughs that wanted to rob me last night  yes  im not dreaming  no youre not i laughed i was just in the nick of time  i know it all you saved me brought me to this place and put me to bed roger youre a better fellow than i thought you were youre a better fellow than i am  you ought to turn over a new leaf i said  dont preach roger  im not preaching im only telling you something for your own good  i know it i dont blame you ive been doing wrong sowing my wild oats but theyre all gone now just let me get straightened out and ill be a different fellow see if im not  i hope so with all my heart what brought you to new york  he started  i i came i dont care to tell he stammered  were you going to brooklyn i questioned struck by a sudden idea  why how did you know he exclaimed  you have certain papers i continued  yes i he felt in his pockets why where are they  are they in this i asked suddenly remembering the notebook i had picked up and producing it  yes yes give them to me  i think i had better keep them i replied decidedly    chapter xxxiii   in brooklyn  i fully understood the value of the papers that were contained in the notebook mr aaron woodward would not have persecuted me so closely had he not deemed them of great importance  and when i told duncan i would keep them i meant what i said it might not be right legally but i was sure it was right morally and that was enough to quiet my conscience  better keep them repeated duncan as he sprang to his feet  exactly  you have no right to do that  i dont know about that i was arrested for having them and whats the use of my having the name without the game  duncan sank down on the edge of the bed again  if you had spoken to me like that yesterday id have wanted to punch your head he said but youre a good fellow roger and i dont blame you for acting as you do do you know what the papers contain  i think i do  they concern my fathers affairs he went on uneasily  and my fathers as well i added  not so very much  i think so  let me show you hand the papers over  excuse me duncan if i decline to do so you aided by pultzer and others stole them from your fathers library and then threw suspicion on me  i didnt throw suspicion on you my father did that himself  you had nothing to do with that handkerchief  i took the handkerchief by accident  then i beg your pardon for having said so i said heartily  never mind let that pass ill tell you what ill do give me the papers and i will restore them to my father and tell him the truth  i must decline your offer  why dont you believe ill confess if you dont ill give you a written confession  no it isnt that i am going to keep the papers because they are valuable to me  what do you mean by valuable asked duncan his curiosity increasing  just what i say  what will the old gent say when he hears of it  i dont care what he says hell hear of a good deal more before long  how about the robbery at the widow canbys  that will be straightened out too  there was a knock on the door and opening it i was confronted by one of the servants  mr strong here sir he asked  thats my name  a gentleman below to see you sir gave his name as mr harrison  tell him i will be down in a minute i said  now im ready to leave you i went on to duncan when the servant had departed i advise you to take a good wash get your breakfast and take the first train home goodby  yes but roger  by doing that you may be doing your father a greater service than in any other way you say you will turn over a new leaf and i hope you will if all goes as it should you will have a hard trial to stand before long but do as i did when things went wrong in our family bear up under it and if you do whats right somebody is bound to respect you  and without waiting for a reply i caught up my hat and hurried from the room  i found mr harrison waiting for me in the parlor  i thought id come over early he explained i know young blood is impatient and i half expected to find you gone  i didnt want to make a call before folks were up i answered besides i have made quite an important discovery since we parted  indeed  yes come away from this place and ill tell you i dont want to meet duncan woodward again  and as we walked away from the hotel i related the particulars about the notebook  you are gathering evidence by the wholesale laughed mr harrison youll have more than enough to convict  i dont want to make a failure of it i said firmly when i go to court i want a clear case from start to finish  good strong i admire your grit come in the restaurant and while we have a bit of breakfast let us look over the papers i declare i was never before so interested in some one elses affairs  and as we waited for our rolls eggs and coffee we read the papers through carefully  they gave much information the most startling of which was that john stumpy and ferguson were one and the same person  that explains why mr woodward made so many slips of the tongue when addressing him i said  here is another important thing remarked mr harrison a letter from this john woodward stating that mrs agatha mitts knows of the forgeries now if you can get this woman to testify against the two culprits i think you will have a clear case  and that is just what i will force her to do i said with strong determination  i could hardly wait to finish breakfast fortunately it did not take mr harrison long to do so and five minutes later we were on our way to the ferry the trip over the east river near the big bridge did not take long and we soon stood on the opposite shore vannack avenue was pretty well up town and we took the elevated train to reach it  there is no 648 said mr harrison pointing to a neat threestory brick building that stood in the middle of the block let us walk past first and see if there is any name on the door  we did so and found a highly polished silver plate bearing the words                            mrs agatha mitts                                boarding  perhaps it would be a good plan to find out something about the woman before we call on her suggested my companion after we had passed the house  there is a drug store on the corner i said we can stop in there no doubt theyll think we are looking for board  an excellent idea  we walked down to the drug store on entering mr harrison ordered a couple of glasses of soda water and then called the proprietor aside  can you tell me anything about the lady that keeps the boardinghouse below here he asked  which one  mrs agatha mitts  ive heard its a very good house was the noncommittal reply  you know the lady  she comes in here once in a while for drugs  may i ask what kind of a woman she is  well shes good enough in her way though rather eccentric i understand she furnishes good board however she has kept the house for many years  has she many boarders  eight or ten she used to have more but they were rather a lively set and hurt the reputation of the place  mr harrison paid for the soda and a second later we quitted the place  not much information gained there said my chicago friend when we were once again on the street  one thing is certain i replied she is the right party it would never have done to have tackled the wrong person  i guess the best thing for us to do is to call on the woman without waiting further  so i think  she may be a very hard person to manage strong you must be careful of what you say  i shall mr harrison i replied but that woman must do what is right or go to prison  i agree with you  ascending the steps of the house i rang the bell a tidy irish girl answered the summons  is mrs agatha mitts in i asked  yes sir  we would like to see her  will you please step into the parlor went on the girl and we did so  who shall i say it is  mr harrison put in my western friend  yes sir  the girl disappeared my heart beat strongly it seemed to me as if life and death hung upon the meeting that was to follow    chapter xxxiv   mrs agatha mitts  i could not help but wonder as i sat in the parlor with my friend mr harrison waiting for the appearance of mrs agatha mitts what kind of a person the keeper of the boardinghouse would prove to be  for some reason the name suggested to me a tall gaunt female with sharp features and i was taken by surprise when a short dumpy woman with a round face came wobbling in and asked what was wanted  this is mrs agatha mitts asked mr harrison as he arose  yes sir and you are mr harrison i suppose i dont remember you  i didnt think you would laughed my friend from chicago i am from the west and have never before been in brooklyn  yes then your business with me is  perhaps you desire board and she smiled first at him and then at me  no we do not wish board was the quiet reply we come to see you on business  and what is it  we would like to see you privately  certainly pray take a seat i will close the doors  she shut the folding doors leading to the sitting room and then the door to the hall  now i am quite at your service she said and peered at us rather sharply  there was an awkward pause for a moment and then mr harrison went on bluntly  has mr aaron woodward or chris holtzmann been here since yesterday madam  mrs mitts started at the mention of the two names then she recovered herself  whom did you say sir she queried innocently  mr harrison repeated his question  why i really havent heard of those two gentlemen in so long a time ive nearly forgotten them she said sweetly  they werent here yesterday i put in  no and this time her tone was a trifle cold  do you expect them today i went on  no i dont she paused a second is that all you wish to know  no maam i replied promptly there is a good deal more i wish to know  who are you if i may ask  my name is strong  she looked puzzled for a moment  i dont recognize the name she said and then she suddenly turned pale  i am the son of carson strong who was sent to prison for alleged forgery and the passing of worthless checks i continued i suppose you remember the case  har hardly she faltered i i heard something of it but not the particulars  that is strange when you were so interested in it  i she repeated in pretended surprise  yes madam said mr harrison you were very much interested  who says so  i say so said i  you you are only a boy  i suppose i am but that doesnt make any difference you know all about the great wrong that has been done and  it is false i know nothing she cried in anger  you know all and we want you to tell as all you know before we leave this house  mrs agatha mitts arose in a passion  i want you to get out of my house at once she ejaculated i wont stand your presence here another minute  excuse me madam not so fast said mr harrison calmly my young friend strong is quite right in what he says  i dont care what you think about it she snapped  oh yes you do perhaps you dont know who i am went on my western friend deliberately  the sly insinuation had its effect evidently the woman had a swift vision of a detective in citizens clothes before her minds eye  you come in authority she said faintly  we wont speak about that now said mr harrison all we want you to do is to make a complete confession of your knowledge of the affair  i havent any knowledge  you have i said you know everything i have papers here belonging to woodward holtzmann and ferguson to prove it there is no use for you to deny it and if you insist and make it necessary to call in the police  no no please dont do that i beg of you she cried  then will you do as i wish  but my reputation it will be gone forever she moaned  it will be gone anyway if you have to go to prison observed mr harrison sagely  and if i make a clean confession you will not prosecute me she asked eagerly  ill promise you that i said  you are not fooling me  no maam  she sprang to her feet and paced the room several times  ill do it she cried they have never treated me right and i do not care what becomes of them so long as i go clear what do you wish me to do gentlemen  i was nonplussed for an instant mr harrison helped me out  i will write out your confession and you can sign it he said have you ink and paper handy  yes  mrs mitts brought forth the material and we all sat down again  remember to give us only the plain facts i said  i will she returned sharply  in a rather roundabout way she made her confession if it could be called such it filled several sheets of paper and it took over half an hour it contained but little more than what my readers already know or suspect she knew positively that mr aaron woodward was the forger of the checks holtzmann had presented them and ferguson had so altered the daily reports that my father had unwittingly made a false showing on his books about weaver she knew nothing  when once explained the whole matter was as clear as day  when he had finished the writing mr harrison read the paper out loud and after some hesitation the woman signed it and then we both witnessed it  i guess our business here is at an end said my western friend  i think so i replied but one thing more mrs mitts i continued turning to her if mr woodward or chris holtzmann calls i think you will find it advisable to keep this affair a secret  i will not be at home to them she replied briefly  a good plan said mr harrison now that you have done the right thing the less you say about the matter the better for you  a few minutes later with the paper tucked safely in my pocket we left the house mrs mitts watched us sharply from behind the halfclosed blinds  in half an hour we were down town and across the ferry once more  i suppose you wish to get home as soon as possible said mr harrison as we boarded a streetcar to take us to his hotel  yes sir my sister and the rest will be anxious to hear how ive made out and besides im anxious to learn how things have gone since i have been away  ive no doubt of it  what do you intend to do  i hardly know i have some business but i am quite interested in your case and  would you like to go along youll be heartily welcome sir  thank you i will i want to see how this drama ends said mr harrison  a little later i procured my valise and we set out for darbyville    chapter xxxv   the widow canbys money  i am sure my readers will well understand why my thoughts were busy as the train rolled on its way to newville i could hardly realize that i held the proofs of my fathers innocence in my possession and i was strongly tempted several times to ask my kind western friend to pinch me to make sure that i was really awake and was not merely dreaming my good fortune  mr harrison probably guessed what was passing in my mind for he placed a kindly hand upon my shoulder and said with a smile  does it seem almost too good to be true  thats just it i returned the events of the past week have so crowded on each other that im in a perfect whirl  you will have a little more excitement before it is over  i suppose so but now that i know it is all right i shall not mind it i wonder if i couldnt send my father the good news by telegraph  you can easily enough but dont you think you had better wait until all is settled you might raise false hopes  no fear aaron woodward is guilty beyond a doubt but i will wait if you think best  it was not long before the train rolled into newville on alighting mr harrison insisted on hiring a cab and in this we bowled swiftly on our way to darbyville as we passed out of the city and up on the country road i wondered how matters had progressed during my absence had the merchant returned home  at darbyville a crowd of men gazed at us with curious eyes among them was parsons the constable and others who knew me  hello you back again shouted parsons  yes indeed i replied i suppose you didnt expect me so soon  ill allow as how i didnt expect you at all he returned with a grin  well you were mistaken im back and back to stay said i  my heart beat high as we turned into the side road that led to the widow canbys house i strained my eyes to catch sight of the first one who might appear it was my uncle enos he was doing a bit of mending on the front fence as soon as he saw me he threw down his hammer and ran toward us  well well roger struck port again have you glad youre back  and he shook my right hand hard  my friend mr harrison from chicago said i this is my uncle captain enos moss  they had hardly finished handshaking when kate and the widow canby came out of the house  oh roger im so glad youre back cried kate and then she looked earnestly into my eyes did you did you  yes kate ive succeeded fathers innocence can be proven  oh thank god cried my sister and the tears of joy started from her eyes i felt like crying too and soon somehow there was hardly a dry eye in the group  you must have had a hard time of it sail the widow canby  my kind friend here helped me a good deal i said  mr harrison was introduced to the others and soon we were seated on the piazza and i was relating my experiences  the interest of my listeners grew as i went on they could hardly believe it possible that mr aaron woodward with all his outward show of gentlemanliness was such a thoroughly bad man when i came to speak of john stumpy alias ferguson kate burst out  i declare ive almost forgotten ive got good news too this very morning i went hunting again and picked up the paper that was lost i was trying to read it when you drove up here it is  and my sister handed over nicholas weavers dying statement  it is hardly of use now i said still it will make the evidence against mr woodward so much stronger  ive discovered that this nick weaver was a chum of woodwards said uncle enos  a chum  yes he came from chicago  from chicago i ejaculated  exactly  meanwhile mr harrison was examining the statement which kate had produced from her dress pocket  i see it all he cried nicholas weaver was the man who helped holtzmann concoct the scheme whereby a relative in chicago was supposed to have died and willed aaron woodward all his money  i see but why did he leave the statement i asked  because he says here woodward did not treat him right this ferguson or stumpy was a friend to weaver and the paper was gotten up to bring woodward to terms  that explanation was clear enough and i could easily understand why john stumpy had come to darbyville and how it was the merchant had treated him with so much consideration  and there is another thing to tell you roger put in the widow canby something i know you will be greatly pleased to hear  what is it i asked in considerable curiosity  i have evidence to show that this john stumpy was the man who robbed me of my money of course i knew it was so when kate and you said so but outsiders now know it  and how  miles nanson saw the man running from the house he was hurrying to get a doctor for his wife who was very sick and he didnt stop to question the fellow  but why didnt he speak of it before i asked he might have saved us a deal of trouble  he never heard of the robbery until last night his wife has been so sick he can testify to seeing the man  im glad of that i said but unfortunately that doesnt restore the money  no i suppose not this stumpy still has it  no he claims to have lost it i returned and i related the particulars as i had overheard them in the boardinghouse on the opposite side of the pass river  i wish i could find it the money i mean as i did the papers put in kate  where did he jump over the fence i asked suddenly  down by the crabapple tree said uncle enos  have you looked there queried mr harrison  no said kate you dont think she began  there is nothing like looking said my western friend slowly  i guess youre right i replied and the sooner the better  in a minute i was out of the house kate was close on my heels and together we made our way to the orchard followed by the others  now let me see i went on if he went over the fence here he must have vaulted over ill try that and note how the money might have dropped  i placed my hands on the top rail and sprang up to vault over as my head bent over my eyes caught sight of an object lying in the hole of the fence post  i picked it up it was the widow canbys pocketbook    chapter xxxvi   alls well that ends well  of course i was highly delighted with the success of my search and as i brought forth the pocketbook all the others gave a cry of surprise  youve got it roger ejaculated my uncle youve got it just as sure as guns is guns  so i have i replied as coolly as i could though i was at the top notch of excitement  better examine it put in mr harrison cautiously it may be empty  empty cried kate in dismay and the word sent a chill through my own heart  with nervous fingers i tore the pocketbook open i suppose i ought to have given it to the widow but i was too excited to think of what was just right and what was not  the money was in a piece of newspaper said the widow canby i had ah there it is  and sure enough there it was nearly three hundred dollars safe and sound  i almost felt like dancing a jig and could not refrain from throwing up my hat which i did in such a way that it caught in a limb of a tree and forced me to climb up to recover it  as i was about jumping to the ground i heard a buggy pass on the road looking down i was surprised to see that it contained mr aaron woodward and chris holtzmann on seeing the party on the ground below the merchant stopped his horse and jumped out  how do you do mrs canby he said as he came over to the fence without catching sight of me  pretty well mr woodward was the widows reply  have you heard anything of your money yet went on the merchant with apparent concern  oh yes and the widow hesitated  my sister whispered something in her ear  it was just found said kate  the merchant gave a start  you dont mean it he cried where  down here by the fence  who put it there asked mr woodward sharply  no one it was dropped by john stumpy  humph perhaps so sneered the merchant  its true exclaimed kate stoutly  more likely by your brother roger  avast there cried uncle enos youre saying too much  i dont think so replied mr woodward in deep sarcasm of course you want to shield the boy all you can but i m sure in my mind that he is guilty  and im positive in my own mind that im innocent said i and i jumped to the ground  roger strong he cried stepping back in surprise and i saw chris holtzmann give a start where did you come from  i came from up a tree i returned lightly and i may add that never before had i felt in such particularly good humor  dont trifle with me he cried in anger answer my question  i will when i get ready  you refuse  oh no but im not compelled to answer understand that mr aaron woodward ill answer because i choose to do so  never mind he snapped where have you been  to chicago as you know and to brooklyn  to brooklyn he cried growing pale  yes sir to see mrs agatha mitts  and did you see her he faltered  yes sir  and she he began  what she said or did will be produced in court later on put in mr harrison  eh the merchant wheeled around who are you  my name is james harrison i am from chicago i am this boys friend and i am here to see justice done  what do you mean  i mean that you and your colleagues chris holtzmann there john stumpy alias ferguson and the late nicholas weaver have foully wronged this boys father  its a lie cried aaron woodward with a quivering lip  its the truth i said the plain truth and i can prove every word of it  prove it  yes in every detail mr aaron woodward i have worked hard fighting for honor but i have won soon my father shall be free and for aught i know to the contrary you will occupy his place in prison  i cried the merchant in horror a likely thing  we shall see i said in the meantime be careful of what you say against me or i will have you arrested before sundown  mr woodward gave me a look that was savageness itself apparently he was on the verge of giving way to a burst of temper but he seemed to think better of it and turning he jumped into his buggy and drove away  it was the last time i ever saw him on the following day mr harrison uncle enos and myself drove down to newville and engaged a firstclass lawyer to take up the case this legal gentleman pushed matters so fast that on the following monday all the papers necessary for woodwards arrest were ready for execution  the officers came to darbyville late in the afternoon to secure their man they were told that mr woodward had gone to new york on business they waited for him the remainder of the day and all of the next  it was useless the highly respected head merchant of darbyville did not appear and an examination showed that he had mortgaged his house and his business and taken every cent of cash with him  it was an open acknowledgment of his guilt and kate was for letting it go at that  it will do no good to have him locked up she said  one thing is certain sech a rascal aint fit to be at liberty put in my uncle enos  he may turn around and rob somebody else added the widow canby  thats just it i said and determined to bring the man to justice i set a detective on his track  the search was successful for in a week aaron woodward was caught in boston preparing to embark for europe he was brought back to newville to await the action of the grand jury but he never came to trial in less than a week he was found in his cell one morning dying rather than face the humiliation of going to jail he had taken his life what became of duncan i did not know for a long while until through mr harrison i learned that he was in chicago working for one of the railroads he had the making of a good fellow in him and i trust that he became one chris holtzmann disappeared and his palace of pleasure is a thing of the past john stumpy went to texas and i heard that pultzer went with him  it was not long before my father received his pardon and came home i cannot express the joy that all of us experienced when he came forth from prison not only a free man but also bearing the proofs of his innocence we were all there to greet him and as my sister kate rushed into his arms i felt that fighting for honor meant a good deal  five years have gone by my father and i are now in business in newville we live in darbyville along with my uncle who married the widow canby and my sister kate  holland  mack have recovered all that was stolen from them they were profuse in their apologies to my father and offered him a good situation which he declined  we are all happy especially kate and i during off hours we are all but inseparable i like my work and expect some day to be a leading merchant the clouds that hung over the family honor have passed and sunshine seems to have come to stay and that being so i will bid my readers goodby   the end
