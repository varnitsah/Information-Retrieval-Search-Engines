89493646	the dove in the eagles nest  by charlotte m yonge     introduction    in sending forth this little book i am inclined to add a few explanatory words as to the use i have made of historical personages the origin of the whole story was probably freytags first series of pictures of german life  probably i say for its first commencement was a dream dreamt some weeks after reading that most interesting collection of sketches  the return of the squire with the tidings of the death of the two knights was vividly depicted in sleep and though without local habitation or name the scene was most likely to have been a reflection from the wild scenes so lately read of  in fact waking thoughts decided that such a catastrophe could hardly have happened anywhere but in germany or in scotland and the contrast between the cultivation in the free cities and the savagery of the independent barons made the former the more suitable region for the adventures  the time could only be before the taming and bringing into order of the empire when the imperial cities were in their greatest splendour the last free nobles in course of being reduced from their lawless liberty and the house of austria beginning to acquire its preponderance over the other princely families  m freytags books and hegewischs history of maximilian will i think be found fully to bear out the picture i have tried to give of the state of things in the reign of the emperor friedrich iii when for want of any other law faust recht or fist right ruled ie an offended nobleman having once sent a fehdebrief to his adversary was thenceforth at liberty to revenge himself by a private war in which for the wrong inflicted no justice was exacted  hegewisch remarks that the only benefit of this custom was that the honour of subscribing a feudbrief was so highly esteemed that it induced the nobles to learn to write  the league of st george and the swabian league were the means of gradually putting down this authorized condition of deadly feud  this was in the days of maximilians youth  he is a prince who seems to have been almost as inferior in his foreign to what he was in his domestic policy as was queen elizabeth  he is chiefly familiar to us as failing to keep up his authority in flanders after the death of mary of burgundy as lingering to fulfil his engagement with anne of brittany till he lost her and her duchy as incurring ridicule by his illmanaged schemes in italy and the vast projects that he was always forming without either means or steadiness to carry them out by his perpetual impecuniosity and slippery dealing and in his old age he has become rather the laughingstock of historians  but there is much that is melancholy in the sight of a man endowed with genius unbalanced by the force of character that secures success and with an ardent nature whose intention overleapt obstacles that in practice he found insuperable  at home maximilian raised the imperial power from a mere cipher to considerable weight we judge him as if he had been born in the purple and succeeded to a defined power like his descendants  we forget that the head of the holy roman empire had been ever since the extinction of the swabian line a mere mark for ambitious princes to shoot at with everything expected from him and no means to do anything  maximilians own father was an avaricious undignified old man not until near his death archduke of even all austria and with anarchy prevailing everywhere under his nominal rule  it was in the time of maximilian that the empire became as compact and united a body as could be hoped of anything so unwieldy that law was at least acknowledged faust recht for ever abolished and the emperor became once more a real power  the man under whom all this was effected could have been no fool yet as he said himself he reigned over a nation of kings who each chose to rule for himself and the uncertainty of supplies of men or money to be gained from them made him so often fail necessarily in his engagements that he acquired a shiftiness and callousness to breaches of promise which became the worst flaw in his character but of the fascination of his manner there can be no doubt  even henry viiis english ambassadors when forced to own how little they could depend on him and how dangerous it was to let subsidies pass through his fingers still show themselves under a sort of enchantment of devotion to his person and this in his old age and when his conduct was most inexcusable and provoking  his variety of powers was wonderful  he was learned in many languagesin all those of his empire or hereditary states and in many besides and he had an ardent love of books both classical and modern  he delighted in music painting architecture and many arts of a more mechanical description wrote treatises on all these and on other subjects especially gardening and gunnery  he was the inventor of an improved lock to the arquebus and first divined how to adapt the disposition of his troops to the use of the newly discovered firearms  and in all these things his versatile head and ready hand were personally employed not by deputy while coupled with so much artistic taste was a violent passion for hunting which carried him through many hairbreadth scapes  it was plain he used to say that god almighty ruled the world or how could things go on with a rogue like alexander vi at the head of the church and a mere huntsman like himself at the head of the empire  his bon mots are numerous all thoroughly characteristic and showing that brilliancy in conversation must have been one of his greatest charms it seems as if only selfcontrol and resolution were wanting to have made him a charles or an alfred the great  the romance of his marriage with the heiress of burgundy is one of the best known parts of his life  he was scarcely twoandtwenty when he lost her who perhaps would have given him the stability he wanted but his tender hove for her endured through life  it is not improbable that it was this still abiding attachment that made him slack in overcoming difficulties in the way of other contracts and that he may have hoped that his engagement to bianca sforza would come to nothing like so many others  the most curious record of him is however in two books the materials for which he furnished and whose composition and illustration he superintended der weise king and theurdank of both of which he is well known to be the hero  the white or the wise king it is uncertain which is a history of his education and exploits in prose  every alternate page has its engraving showing how the young white king obtains instruction in painting architecture language and all arts and sciences the latter including magicwhich he learns of an old woman with a longtailed demon sitting like mother hubbards cat on her shoulderand astrology  in the illustration of this study an extraordinary figure of a cross within a circle appears in the sky which probably has some connection with his scheme of nativity for it also appears on the breast of ehrenhold his constant companion in the metrical history of his career under the name of theurdank  the poetry of theurdank was composed by maximilians old writing master melchior pfinznig but the adventures were the kaisars own communicated by himself and he superintended the woodcuts  the name is explained to mean craving glorygloriaememor  the germans laugh to scorn a french translator who rendered it chermerci  it was annotated very soon after its publication and each exploit explained and accounted for  it is remarkable and touching in a man who married at eighteen and was a widower at twentytwo that in both books the happy union with his lady love is placed at the endnot at the beginning of the book and in theurdank at least the eternal reunion is clearly meant  in this curious book konig romreich by whom every contemporary understood poor charles of burgundythus posthumously made king of rome by maximilian as the only honour in his power betroths his daughter ehrenreich rich in honour to the ritter theurdank  soon after by a most mild version of duke charless frightful end konig romreich is seen on his back dying in a garden and ehrenreich as mary really did despatches a ring to summon her betrothed  but here theurdank returns for answer that he means first to win honour by his exploits and sets out with his comrade ehrenhold in search thereof  ehrenhold never appears of the smallest use to him in any of the dire adventures into which he falls but only stands complacently by and in effect may represent fame or perhaps that literary sage whom don quixote always supposed to be at hand to record his deeds of prowess  next we are presented with the german impersonation of satan as a wise old magician only with claws instead of feet commissioning his three captains hauptleutern furwitz umfallo and neidelhard to beset and ruin theurdank  they are interpreted as the dangers of youth middle life and old agerashness disaster and distress or envy  one at a time they encounter himnot once but again and again and he has ranged under each head in entire contempt of real order of time the perils he thinks owing to each foe  furwitz most justly gets the credit of maximilians perils on the steeple of ulm though unfortunately the artist has represented the daring climber as standing not much above the shoulders of furwitz and ehrenhold and although the annotation tells us that his hinder half foot overhung the scaffold the danger in the print is not appalling furwitz likewise inveigles him into putting the point schnabel of his shoe into the wheel of a mill for turning stone balls where he certainly hardly deserved to lose nothing but the beak of his shoe this enemy also brings him into numerous unpleasant predicaments on precipices where he hangs by one hand while the chamois stand delighted on every available peak furwitz grins malevolently and ehrenhold stands pointing at him over his shoulder  time and place are given in the notes for all these escapes  after some twenty adventures furwitz is beaten off and umfallo tries his powers  here the misadventures do not involve so much folly on the heros part though to be sure he ventures into a lions den unarmed and has to beat off the inmates with a shovel  but the other adventures are more rational  he catches a jesterof admirably foolish expression putting a match to a powdermagazine he is wonderfully preserved in mountain avalanches and hurricanes reins up his horse on the verge of an abyss falls through ice in holland and shows nothing but his head above it cures himself of a fever by draughts of water to the great disgust of his physicians and escapes a fire bursting out of a tall stove  neidelhard brings his real battles and perils  from this last he is in danger of shipwreck of assassination of poison in single combat or in battle tumults of the people beset him he is imprisoned as at ghent  but finally neidelhard is beaten back and the hero is presented to ehrenreich  ehrenhold recounts his triumphs and accuses the three captains  one is hung another beheaded the third thrown headlong from a tower and a guardian angel then summons theurdank to his union with his queen  no doubt this reunion was the lifedream of the harassed busy inconsistent man who flashed through the turmoils of the early sixteenth century  the adventures of maximilian which have been adverted to in the story are all to be found in theurdank and in his early life he was probably the brilliant eager person we have tried in some degree to describe  in his latter years it is well known that he was much struck by luthers arguments and indeed he had long been conscious of need of church reform though his plans took the grotesque form of getting himself made pope and taking all into his own hands  perhaps it was unwise to have ever so faintly sketched ebbos career through the ensuing troubles but the history of the star and of the spark in the stubble seemed to need completion and the working out of the character of the survivor was unfinished till his course had been thought over from the dawn of the wittenberg teaching which must have seemed no novelty to an heir of the doctrine of tauler and of the veritably catholic divines of old times  the idea is of the supposed course of a thoughtful refined conscientious man through the earlier times of the reformation glad of the hope of cleansing the church but hoping to cleanse not to break away from hera hope that luther himself long cherished and which was not entirely frustrated till the reassembly at trent in the next generation justice has never been done to the men who feared to loose their hold on the church catholic as the one body to which the promises were made  their loyalty has been treated as blindness timidity or superstition but that there were many such persons and those among the very highest minds of their time no one can have any doubt after reading such lives as those of friedrich the wise of saxony of erasmus of vittoria colonna or of cardinal giustiniani  april 9 1836    chapter i  master gottfrieds workshop    the upper lattices of a tall narrow window were open and admitted the view of first some richlytinted vine leaves and purpling grapes then in dazzling freshness of new white stone the lacework fabric of a halfbuilt minster spire with a masons crane on the summit bending as though craving for a further supply of materials and beyond peeping through every crevice of the exquisite open fretwork was the intensely blue sky of early autumn  the lower longer panes of the window were closed and the glass divided into circles and quarrels made the scene less distinct but still the huge stone tower was traceable and farther off the slope of a gentlyrising hill clothed with vineyards blushing into autumn richness  below the view was closed by the gray wall of a court yard laden with fruittrees in full bearing and inclosing paved paths that radiated from a central fountain and left spaces between where a few summer flowers still lingered and the remains of others showed what their past glory had been  the interior of the room was wainscoted the floor paved with bright red and creamcoloured tiles and the tall stove in one corner decorated with the same  the eastern end of the apartment was adorned with an exquisite small group carved in oak representing the carpenters shop at nazareth with the holy child instructed by joseph in the use of tools and the mother sitting with her book pondering these things in her heart  all around were blocks of wood and carvings in varying states of progresssome scarcely shaped out and others in perfect completion  and the subjects were equally various  here was an adoring angel with folded wings clasped hands and rapt face here a majestic head of an apostle or prophet here a lovely virgin saint seeming to play smilingly with the instrument of her martyrdom here a grotesque miserere group illustrating a fairy tale or caricaturing a popular fable here a beauteous festoon of flowers and fruit emulating nature in all save colour and on the worktable itself growing under the masters hand was a long wreath entirely composed of leaves and seedvessels in their quaint and beauteous formsthe heartshaped shepherds purse the masklike skullcap and the crowned urn of the henbane  the starred cap of the poppy was actually being shaped under the tool copied from a green capsule surmounted with purple velvety rays which together with its rough and wavy leaf was held in the hand of a young maiden who knelt by the table watching the work with eager interest  she was not a beautiful girlnot one of those whose bright eyes rain influence and judge the prize  she was too small too slight too retiring for such a position  if there was something lilylike in her drooping grace it was not the queenlily of the garden that she resembled but the retiring lily of the valleyso purely transparently white was her skin scarcely tinted by a roseate blush on the cheek so tender and modest the whole effect of her slender figure and the soft downcast pensive brown eyes utterly dissimilar in hue from those of all her friends and kindred except perhaps the bright quick ones of her uncle the mastercarver otherwise his portly form open visage and goodnatured stateliness as well as his furred cap and gold chain were thoroughly those of the german burgomaster of the fifteenth century but those glittering black eyes had not ceased to betray their french or rather walloon origin though for several generations back the family had been settled at ulm  perhaps too it was walloon quickness and readiness of wit that had made them so soon as they became affiliated so prominent in all the councils of the good free city and so noted for excellence in art and learning  indeed the present head of the family master gottfried sorel was so much esteemed for his learning that he had once had serious thoughts of terming himself magister gothofredus oxalicus and might have carried it out but for the very decided objections of his wife dame johanna and his little niece christina to being dubbed by any such surname  master gottfried had had a scapegrace younger brother named hugh who had scorned both books and tools had been the plague of the workshop and instead of coming back from his wandering year of improvement had joined a band of roving lanzknechts  no more had been heard of him for a dozen or fifteen years when he suddenly arrived at the paternal mansion at ulm half dead with intermittent fever and with a young brokenhearted and nearly expiring wife his spoil in his italian campaigns  his rude affection had utterly failed to console her for her desolated home and slaughtered kindred and it had so soon turned to brutality that when brought to comparative peace and rest in his brothers home there was nothing left for the poor italian but to lie down and die commending her babe in broken german to hausfrau johanna and blessing master gottfried for his flowing latin assurances that the child should be to them even as the little maiden who was lying in the gods acre upon the hillside  and verily the little christina had been a precious gift to the bereaved couple  her father had no sooner recovered than he returned to his roving life and except for a report that he had been seen among the retainers of one of the robber barons of the swabian alps nothing had been heard of him and master gottfried only hoped to be spared the actual pain and scandal of knowing when his eyes were blinded and his head swept off at a blow or when he was tumbled headlong into a moat suspended from a tree or broken on the wheel a choice of fates that was sure sooner or later to befall him meantime both the burgomeister and burgomeisterinn did their utmost to forget that the gentle little girl was not their own they set all their hopes and joys on her and making her supply the place at once of son and daughter they bred her up in all the refinements and accomplishments in which the free citizens of germany took the lead in the middle and latter part of the fifteenth century  to aid her aunt in all housewifely arts to prepare dainty food and varied liquors and to spin weave and broider was only a part of christinas training her uncle likewise set great store by her sweet italian voice and caused her to be carefully taught to sing and play on the lute and he likewise delighted in hearing her read aloud to him from the hereditary store of mss and from the dark volumes that began to proceed from the press  nay master gottfried had made experiments in printing and woodengraving on his own account and had found no head so intelligent no hand so desirous to aid him as his little christinas who in all that needed taste and skill rather than strength was worth all his prentices and journeymen together  some fine bold woodcuts had been produced by their joint efforts but these less important occupations had of late been set aside by the engrossing interest of the interior fittings of the great dome kirk which for nearly a century had been rising by the united exertions of the burghers without any assistance from without  the foundation had been laid in 1377 and at length in the year of grace 1472 the crown of the apse had been closed in and matters were so forward that master gottfrieds stall work was already in requisition for the choir  three cubits more he reckoned  child hast thou found me fruits enough for the completing of this border  o yes mine uncle  i have the wild rosehip and the flat shield of the moonwort and a peapod and more whose names i know not  but should they all be seed and fruit  yea truly my stina for this wreath shall speak of the goodly fruits of a completed life  even as that which you carved in spring told of the blossom and fair promise of youth returned the maiden  methinks the one is the most beautiful as it ought to be then after a little pause and some reckoning i have scarce seedpods enough in store uncle might we not seek some rarer shapes in the herbgarden of master gerhard the physician  he too might tell me the names of some of these  true child or we might ride into the country beyond the walls and seek them  what little one wouldst thou not  so we go not far faltered christina colouring  ha thou hast not forgotten the fright thy companions had from the schlangenwald reitern when gathering maydew  fear not little coward if we go beyond the suburbs we will take hans and peter with their halberts  but i believe thy silly little heart can scarce be free for enjoyment if it can fancy a reiter within a dozen leagues of thee  at your side i would not fear  that is i would not vex thee by my folly and i might forget it replied christina looking down  my gentle child the old man said approvingly  moreover if our good raiser has his way we shall soon be free of the reitern of schlangenwald and adlerstein and all the rest of the mousetrap barons  he is hoping to form a league of us free imperial cities with all the more reasonable and honest nobles to preserve the peace of the country  even now a letter from him was read in the town hall to that effect and when all are united against them my lords mousers must needs become pledged to the league or go down before it  ah that will be well cried christina  then will our wagons be no longer set upon at the debateable ford by schlangenwald or adlerstein and our wares will come safely and there will be wealth enough to raise our spire  o uncle what a day of joy will that be when our ladys great statue will be set on the summit  a day that i shall scarce see and it will be well if thou dost returned her uncle unless the hearts of the burghers of ulm return to the liberality of their fathers who devised that spire  but what trampling do i hear  there was indeed a sudden confusion in the house and before the uncle and niece could rise the door was opened by a prosperous applefaced dame exclaiming in a hasty whisper housefather o housefather there are a troop of reitern at the door dismounting already and as the master came forward brushing from his furred vest the shavings and dust of his work she added in a more furtive startled accent and if i mistake not one is thy brother  he is welcome replied master gottfried in his cheery fearless voice he brought us a choice gift last time he came and it may be he is ready to seek peace among us after his wanderings  come hither christina my little one it is well to be abashed but thou art not a child who need fear to meet a father  christinas extreme timidity however made her pale and crimson by turns perhaps by the infection of anxiety from her aunt who could not conceal a certain dissatisfaction and alarm as the maiden led on either side by her adopted parents thus advanced from the little studio into a handsomelycarved wooden gallery projecting into a great wainscoated room with a broad carved stair leading down into it  down this stair the three proceeded and reached the stone hall that lay beyond it just as there entered from the trellised porch that covered the steps into the street a thin wiry man in a worn and greasy buff suit guarded on the breast and arms with rusty steel and a battered helmet with the vizor up disclosing a weather beaten bronzed face with somewhat wild dark eyes and a huge grizzled moustache forming a straight line over his lips  altogether he was a complete model of the lawless reiter or lanzknecht the terror of swabia and the bugbear of christinas imagination  the poor childs heart died within her as she perceived the mutual recognition between her uncle and the new comer and while master gottfried held out his hands with a cordial greeting of welcome home brother hugh she trembled from head to foot as she sank on her knees and murmured your blessing honoured father  ha  what this is my girl  what says she  my blessing eh  there then thou hast it child such as i have to give though theyll tell thee at adlerstein that i am more wont to give the other sort of blessing  now give me a kiss girl and let me see thee  how now as he folded her in his rough arms thou art a mere feather as slight as our sick jungfrau herself  and then regarding her as she stood drooping thou art not half the woman thy mother wasshe was stately and straight as a column and tall withal  true replied hausfrau johanna in a marked tone but both she and her poor babe had been so harassed and wasted with long journeys and hardships that with all our care of our christina she has never been strong or wellgrown  the marvel is that she lived at all  our christina is not beautiful we know added her uncle reassuringly taking her hand but she is a good and meek maiden  well well returned the lanzknecht she will answer the purpose well enough or better than if she were fair enough to set all our fellows together by the ears for her  camilla i sayno whats her name christinaput up thy gear and be ready to start with me to morrow morning for adlerstein  for adlerstein reechoed the housemother in a tone of horrified dismay and christina would have dropped on the floor but for her uncles sustaining hand and the cheering glance with which he met her imploring look  let us come up to the gallery and understand what you desire brother said master gottfried gravely  fill the cup of greeting hans  your followers shall be entertained in the hall he added  ay ay quoth hugh i will show you reason over a goblet of the old rosenburg  is it all gone yet brother goetz  no  i reckon there would not be the scouring of a glass left of it in a week if it were at adlerstein  so saying the trooper crossed the lower room which contained a huge tiled baking oven various brilliantlyburnished cooking utensils and a great carved cupboard like a wooden bedstead and passing the door of the bathroom clanked up the oaken stairs to the gallery the receptionroom of the house  it had tapestry hangings to the wall and cushions both to the carved chairs and deep windows which looked out into the street the whole storey projecting into close proximity with the corresponding apartment of the syndic moritz the goldsmith on the opposite side  an oaken table stood in the centre and the gallery was adorned with a dresser displaying not only bright pewter but goblets and drinking cups of beautifullyshaped and coloured glass and saltcellars tankards c of gold and silver  just as it was in the old mans time said the soldier throwing himself into the housefathers chair  a handful of lanzknechts would make short work with your pots and pans good sister johanna  heaven forbid said poor johanna under her breath  much good they do you up in a row there making you a slave to furbishing them theres more sense in a chair like thisthat does rest a mans bones  here camilla girl unlace my helmet  what knowst not how  what is a woman made for but to let a soldier free of his trappings  thou hast done it  there  now my boots stretching out his legs  hans shall draw off your boots fair brother began the dame but poor christina the more anxious to propitiate him in little things because of the horror and dread with which his main purpose inspired her was already on her knees pulling with her small quivering hands at the long steelguarded boota task to which she would have been utterly inadequate but for some lazy assistance from her fathers other foot  she further brought a pair of her uncles furred slippers while reiter hugh proceeded to dangle one of the boots in the air expatiating on its frail condition and expressing his intention of getting a new pair from master matthias the sutor ere he should leave ulm on the morrow  then again came the dreaded subject his daughter must go with him  what would you with christina brother gravely asked master gottfried seating himself on the opposite side of the stove while out of sight the frightened girl herself knelt on the floor her head on her aunts knees trying to derive comfort from dame johannas clasping hands and vehement murmurs that they would not let their child be taken from them  alas these assurances were little in accordance with hughs rough reply and what is it to you what i do with mine own  only this that having bred her up as my child and intended heiress i might have some voice  oh in choosing her mate  some mincing artificer i trow fiddling away with wood and wire to make gauds for the fairday  hast got him here  if i like him and she likes him ill bring her back when her work is done  there is no such person as yet in the case said gottfried christina is not yet seventeen and i would take my time to find an honest pious burgher who will value this precious jewel of mine  and let her polish his flagons to the end of her days laughed hugh grimly but manifestly somewhat influenced by the notion of his brothers wealth  what hast no child of thine own he added  none save in paradise answered gottfried crossing himself  and thus if christina should remain with me and be such as i would have her then brother my wealth after myself and my good housewife shall be hers with due provision for thee if thou shouldst weary of thy wild life  otherwise he added looking down and speaking in an under tone my poor savings should go to the completion of the dome kirk  and who told thee goetz that i would do ought with the girl that should hinder her from being the very same fat sourkroutcooking pewterscrubbing housewife of thy minds eye  i have heard nothing of thy designs as yet brother hugh save that thou wouldst take her to adlerstein which men greatly belie if it be not a nest of robbers  aha thou hast heard of adlerstein  we have made the backs of your jolly merchants tingle as well as they could through their welllined doublets  ulm knows of adlerstein and the debateable ford  it knows little to its credit said gottfried gravely and it knows also that the emperor is about to make a combination against all the swabian robberholds and that such as join not in it will fare the worse  let kaiser fritz catch his bear ere he sells its hide  he has never tried to mount the eagles ladder  why man adlerstein might be held against five hundred men by sister johanna with her rock and spindle  tis a free barony master gottfried i tell theehas never sworn allegiance to kaiser or duke of swabia either  freiherr eberhard is as much a king on his own rock as kaiser fritz ever was of the romans and more too for i never could find out that they thought much of our king at rome and as to gainsaying our old freiherr one might as well leap over the abyss at once  yes those old free barons are pitiless tyrants said gottfried and i scarce think i can understand thee aright when i hear thee say thou wouldst carry thy daughter to such an abode  it is the freiherrs command returned hugh  look you they have had wondrous illluck with their children the freiherrinn kunigunde has had a dozen at least and only two are alive my young freiherr and my young lady ermentrude and no wonder you would say if you could see the gracious freiherrinn for surely dame holda made a blunder when she fished her out of the fountain woman instead of man she is adlerstein herself by birth married her cousin and is prouder and more dour than our old freiherr himselffitter far to handle shield than swaddled babe  and now our jungfrau has fallen into a pining waste that tis a pity to see how her cheeks have fallen away and how she mopes and fades  now the old freiherr and her brother they both dote on her and would do anything for her they thought she was bewitched so we took old mother ilsebill and tried her with the ordeal of water but look you she sank as innocent as a puppy dog and ursel was at fault to fix on any one else  then one day when i looked into the chamber i saw the poor maiden sitting with her head hanging down as if twas too heavy for her on a highbacked chair no rest for her feet and the wind blowing keen all round her and nothing to taste but scorched beef or black bread and sour wine and her mother rating her for foolish fancies that gave trouble  and when my young freiherr was bemoaning himself that we could not hear of a jew physician passing our way to catch and bring up to cure her i said to him at last that no doctor could do for her what gentle tendance and nursing would for what the poor maiden needed was to be cosseted and laid down softly and fed with broths and possets and all that women know how to do with one another  a proper scowl and hard words i got from my gracious lady for wanting to put burgher softness into an adlerstein but my old lord and his son opened on the scent at once  thou hast a daughter quoth the freiherr  so please your gracious lordship quoth i that is if she still lives for i left her a puny infant well said my lord if thou wilt bring her here and her care restores my daughter to health and strength then will i make thee my body squire with a right to a fourth part of all the spoil and feed for two horses in my stable  and young freiherr eberhard gave his word upon it  gottfried suggested that a sick nurse was the person required rather than a child like christina but as hugh truly observed no nurse would voluntarily go to adlerstein and it was no use to wait for the hopes of capturing one by raid or foray  his daughter was at his own disposal and her services would be repaid by personal advantages to himself which he was not disposed to forego in effect these were the only means that the baron had of requiting any attendance upon his daughter  the citizens of old germany had the strongest and most stringent ideas of parental authority and regarded daughters as absolute chattels of their father and master gottfried sorel though he alone had done the part of a parent to his niece felt entirely unable to withstand the nearer claim except by representations and these fell utterly disregarded as in truth every counsel had hitherto done upon the ears of reiter hugh ever since he had emerged from his swaddling clothes  the plentiful supper full cup of wine the confections the soft chair together perhaps with his brothers grave speech soon however had the effect of sending him into a doze whence he started to accept civilly the proposal of being installed in the strangers room where he was speedily snoring between two feather beds  then there could be freedom of speech in the gallery where the uncle and aunt held anxious counsel over the poor little darktressed head that still lay upon good johannas knees  the dame was indignant and resolute  take the child back with him into a very nest of robbersher own innocent dove whom they had shielded from all evil like a very nun in a cloister  she should as soon think of yielding her up to be borne off by the great satan himself with his horns and hoofs  hugh is her father housewife said the mastercarver  the right of parents is with those that have done the duty of parents returned johanna  what said the kid in the fable to the goat that claimed her from the sheep that bred her up  i am ashamed of you housefather for not better loving your own niece  heaven knows how i love her said gottfried as the sweet face was raised up to him with a look acquitting him of the charge and he bent to smooth back the silken hair and kiss the ivory brow but heaven also knows that i see no means of withholding her from one whose claim is closer than my ownnone save one and to that even thou housemother wouldst not have me resort  what is it asked the dame sharply yet with some fear  to denounce him to the burgomasters as one of the adlerstein retainers who robbed philipp der schmidt and have him fast laid by the heels  christina shuddered and dame johanna herself recoiled but presently exclaimed nay you could not do that good man but wherefore not threaten him therewith  stand at his bedside in early dawn and tell him that if he be not off ere daylight with both his cutthroats the halberdiers will be upon him  threaten what i neither could nor would perform mother  that were a shrewish resource  yet would it save the child muttered johanna  but in the meantime christina was rising from the floor and stood before them with loose hair tearful eyes and wet flushed cheeks  it must be thus she said in a low but not unsteady voice  i can bear it better since i have heard of the poor young lady sick and with none to care for her  i will go with my father it is my duty  i will do my best but oh uncle so work with him that he may bring me back again  this from thee stina exclaimed her aunt from thee who art sick for fear of a lanzknecht  the saints will be with me and you will pray for me said christina still trembling  i tell thee child thou knowst not what these vile dens are heaven forfend thou shouldst exclaimed her aunt  go only to father balthazar housefather and see if he doth not call it a sending of a lamb among wolves  mindst thou the carving i did for father balthazars own oratory replied master gottfried  i talk not of carving  i talk of our child said the dame petulantly  ut agnus inter lupos softly said gottfried looking tenderly though sadly at his niece who not only understood the quotation but well remembered the carving of the crossmarked lamb going forth from its fold among the howling wolves  alas  i am not an apostle said she  nay but in the path of duty tis the same hand that sends thee forth answered her uncle and the same will guard thee  duty indeed exclaimed johanna  as if any duty could lead that silly helpless child among that herd of evil men and women yet worse with a goodfornothing father who would sell her for a good horse to the first dissolute junker who fell in his way  i will take care that he knows it is worth his while to restore her safe to us  nor do i think so ill of hugh as thou dost mother and for the rest heaven and the saints and her own discretion must be her guard till she shall return to us  how can heaven be expected to protect her when you are flying in its face by not taking counsel with father balthazar  that shalt thou do replied gottfried readily secure that father balthazar would see the matter in the same light as himself and tranquillize the good woman  it was not yet so late but that a servant could be despatched with a request that father balthazar who lived not many houses off in the same street would favour the burgomeisterinn sorel by coming to speak with her  in a few minutes he appearedan aged man with a sensible face of the fresh pure bloom preserved by a temperate life  he was a secular parishpriest and as well as his friend master gottfried held greatly by the views left by the famous strasburg preacher master john tauler after the good housemother had in strong terms laid the case before him she expected a trenchant decision on her own side but to her surprise and disappointment he declared that master gottfried was right and that unless hugh sorel demanded anything absolutely sinful of his daughter it was needful that she should submit  he repeated in stronger terms the assurance that she would be protected in the endeavour to do right and the divine promises which he quoted from the latin scriptures gave some comfort to the niece who understood them while they impressed the aunt who did not there was always the hope that whether the young lady died or recovered the conclusion of her illness would be the term of christinas stay at adlerstein and with this trust johanna must content herself  the priest took leave after appointing with christina to meet her in the confessional early in the morning before mass and half the night was spent by the aunt and niece in preparing christinas wardrobe for her sudden journey  many a tear was shed over the tokens of the little services she was wont to render her halfdone works and pleasant studies so suddenly broken off and all the time hausfrau johanna was running on with a lecture on the diligent preservation of her maiden discretion with plentiful warnings against swaggering menatarms drunken lanzknechts and above all against young barons who most assuredly could mean no good by any burgher maiden  the good aunt blessed the saints that her stina was likely only to be lovely in affectionate home eyes but for that matter idle men shut up in a castle with nothing but mischief to think of would be dangerous to little three eyes herself and christina had best never stir a yard from her ladys chair when forced to meet them  all this was interspersed with motherly advice how to treat the sick lady and receipts for cordials and possets for johanna began to regard the case as a sort of secondhand one of her own  nay she even turned it over in her mind whether she should not offer herself as the lady ermentrudes sicknurse as being a less dangerous commodity than her little niece  but fears for the wellbeing of the mastercarver and his wirthschaft and still more the notion of gossip gertrude grundt hearing that she had ridden off with a wild lanzknecht made her at once reject the plan without even mentioning it to her husband or his niece  by the time hugh sorel rolled out from between his feather beds and was about to don his greasy buff a handsome new suit finished point device and a pair of huge boots to correspond had been laid by his bedside  ho ho  master goetz said he as he stumbled into the stube i see thy game  thou wouldst make it worth my while to visit the fatherhouse at ulm  it shall be worth thy while indeed if thou bringest me back my white dove was gottfrieds answer  and how if i bring her back with a strapping reiter soninlaw laughed hugh  what welcome should the fellow receive  that would depend on what he might be replied gottfried and hugh his love of tormenting a little allayed by satisfaction in his buff suit and by an eye to a heavy purse that lay by his brothers hand on the table added little fear of that  our fellows would look for lustier brides than yon little pale face  tis whiter than ever this morningbut no tears  that is my brave girl  yes father i am ready to do your bidding replied christina meekly  that is well child  mark me no tears  thy mother wept day and night and when she had wept out her tears she was sullen when i would have been friendly towards her  it was the worse for her but so long as thou art good daughter to me thou shalt find me good father to thee and for a moment there was a kindliness in his eye which made it sufficiently like that of his brother to give some consolation to the shrinking heart that he was rending from all it loved and she steadied her voice for another gentle profession of obedience for which she felt strengthened by the mornings orisons  well said child  now canst sit on old nibelungs croup  his back bone is somewhat sharper than if he had battened in a citizens stall but if thine aunt can find thee some sort of pillion ill promise thee the best ride thou hast had since we came from innspruck ere thou canst remember  christina has her own mule replied her uncle without troubling nibelung to carry double  ho her own  an overfed burgomaster sort of a beast that will turn restive at the first sight of the eagles ladder  however he may carry her so far and if we cannot get him up the mountain i shall know what to do with him he muttered to himself  but hugh like many a gentleman after him was recusant at the sight of his daughters luggage and yet it only loaded one sumpter mule besides forming a few bundles which could be easily bestowed upon the saddles of his two knappen while her lute hung by a silken string on her arm  both she and her aunt thought she had been extremely moderate but his cry was what could she want with so much  her mother had never been allowed more than would go into a pair of saddlebags and his own jungfraushe had never seen so much gear together in her life he would be laughed to scorn for his presumption in bringing such a fine lady into the castle it would be well if freiherr eberhards bride brought half as much  still he had a certain pride in ithe was after all by birth and breeding a burgherand there had been evidently a softening and civilizing influence in the night spent beneath his paternal roof and old habits and perhaps likewise in the submission he had met with from his daughter  the attendants too who had been pleased with their quarters readily undertook to carry their share of the burthen and though he growled and muttered a little he at length was won over to consent chiefly as it seemed by christinas obliging readiness to leave behind the bundle that contained her holiday kirtle  he had been spared all needless irritation  before his waking christina had been at the priests cell and had received his last blessings and counsels and she had on the way back exchanged her farewells and tears with her two dearest friends barbara schmidt and regina grundt confiding to the former her cage of doves and to the latter the myrtle which like every german maiden she cherished in her window to supply her future bridal wreath  now pale as death but so resolutely composed as to be almost disappointing to her demonstrative aunt she quietly went through her home partings while hausfrau johanna adjured her father by all that was sacred to be a true guardian and protector of the child and he could not forbear from a few tormenting auguries about the lanzknecht sonin law  their effect was to make the good dame more passionate in her embraces and admonitions to christina to take care of herself  she would have a mass said every day that heaven might have a care of her  master gottfried was going to ride as far as the confines of the free citys territory and his round sleek creamcoloured palfrey used to ambling in civic processions was as great a contrast to raw boned wildeyed nibelung all dappled with misty grey as was the stately substantial burgher to his lean hungrylooking brother or dame johannas dignified curled white poodle which was forcibly withheld from following christina to the coarsebristled wolfish looking hound who glared at the household pet with angry and contemptuous eyes and made poor christinas heart throb with terror whenever it bounded near her  close to her uncle she kept as beneath the trellised porches that came down from the projecting gables of the burghers houses many a wellknown face gazed and nodded as they took their way through the crooked streets many a beggar or poor widow waved her a blessing out into the marketplace with its clear fountain adorned with arches and statues past the rising dome kirk where the swarms of workmen unbonneted to the mastercarver and the reiter paused with an irreverent sneer at the small progress made since he could first remember the building  how poor little christinas soul clung to every cusp of the lacework spire every arch of the window each of which she had hailed as an achievement  the tears had wellnigh blinded her in a gush of feeling that came on her unawares and her mule had his own way as he carried her under the arch of the tall and beautifullysculptured bridge tower and over the noble bridge across the danube  her uncle spoke much low and earnestly to his brother  she knew it was in commendation of her to his care and an endeavour to impress him with a sense of the kind of protection she would require and she kept out of earshot  it was enough for her to see her uncle still and feel that his tenderness was with her and around her  but at last he drew his rein  and now my little one the daughter of my heart i must bid thee farewell he said  christina could not be restrained from springing from her mule and kneeling on the grass to receive his blessing her face hidden in her hands that her father might not see her tears  the good god bless thee my child said gottfried who seldom invoked the saints bless thee and bring thee back in his own good time  thou hast been a good child to us be so to thine own father do thy work and come back to us again  the tears rained down his cheeks as christinas head lay on his bosom and then with a last kiss he lifted her again on her mule mounted his horse and turned back to the city with his servant  hugh was merciful enough to let his daughter gaze long after the retreating figure ere he summoned her on  all day they rode at first through meadow lands and then through more broken open ground where at midday they halted and dined upon the plentiful fare with which the housemother had provided them over which hugh smacked his lips and owned that they did live well in the old town  could christina make such sausages  not as well as my aunt  well do thy best and thou wilt win favour with the baron  the evening began to advance and christina was very weary as the purple mountains that she had long watched with a mixture of fear and hope began to look more distinct and the ground was often in abrupt ascents  her father without giving space for complaints hurried her on  he must reach the debateable ford ere dark  it was however twilight when they came to an open space where at the foot of thickly forestclad rising ground lay an expanse of turf and rich grass through which a stream made its way standing in a wide tranquil pool as if to rest after its rough course from the mountains  above rose like a dark wall crag upon crag peak on peak in purple masses blending with the sky and hugh pointing upwards to a turreted point apparently close above their heads where a star of light was burning told her that there was adlerstein and this was the debateable ford  in fact as he explained while splashing through the shallow expanse the stream had changed its course  it was the boundary between the lands of schlangenwald and adlerstein but it had within the last sixty years burst forth in a flood and had then declined to return to its own bed but had flowed in a fresh channel to the right of the former one  the freiherren von adlerstein claimed the ground to the old channel the graffen von schlangenwald held that the river was the landmark and the dispute had a greater importance than seemed explained from the worth of the rushy space of ground in question for this was the passage of the italian merchants on their way from constance and every load that was overthrown in the river was regarded as the lawful prey of the noble on whose banks the catastrophe befell  any freight of goods was anxiously watched by both nobles and it was not their fault if no disaster befell the travellers  hugh talked of the schlangenwald marauders with the bitterness of a deadly feud but manifestly did not breathe freely till his whole convoy were safe across both the wet and the dry channel  christina supposed they should now ascend to the castle but her father laughed saying that the castle was not such a step off as she fancied and that they must have daylight for the eagles stairs  he led the way through the trees up ground that she thought mountain already and finally arrived at a miserable little hut which served the purpose of an inn  he was received there with much obsequiousness and was plainly a great authority there  christina weary and frightened descended from her mule and was put under the protection of a wild rough looking peasant woman who stared at her like something from another world but at length showed her a nook behind a mud partition where she could spread her mantle and at least lie down and tell her beads unseen if she could not sleep in the stifling smoky atmosphere amid the sounds of carousal among her father and his fellows  the great hound came up and smelt to her  his outline was so wolfish that she had nearly screamed  but more in terror at the men who might have helped her than even at the beast she tried to smooth him with her trembling hand whispered his name of festhold and found him licking her hand and wagging his long rough tail  and he finally lay down at her feet as though to protect her  is it a sign that good angels will not let me be hurt she thought and wearied out she slept    chapter ii  the eyrie    christina sorel awoke to a scene most unlike that which had been wont to meet her eyes in her own little wainscoted chamber high in the gabled front of her uncles house  it was a time when the imperial free towns of germany had advanced nearly as far as those of italy in civilization and had reached a point whence they retrograded grievously during the thirty years war even to an extent that they have never entirely recovered  the country immediately around them shared the benefits of their civilization and the free peasant proprietors lived in great ease and prosperity in beautiful and picturesque farmsteads enjoying a careless abundance and keeping numerous rural or religious feasts where old teutonic mythological observances had received a christian colouring and adaptation  in the mountains or around the castles it was usually very different  the elective constitution of the empire the frequent change of dynasty the many disputed successions had combined to render the sovereign authority uncertain and feeble and it was seldom really felt save in the hereditary dominions of the kaiser for the time being  thus while the cities advanced in the power of selfgovernment and the education it conveyed the nobles especially those whose abodes were not easily accessible were often practically under no government at all and felt themselves accountable to no man  the old wild freedom of the suevi and other teutonic tribes still technically and in many cases practically existed  the heretogen heerzogen or as we call them dukes had indeed accepted employment from the kaiser as his generals and had received rewards from him the gerefen or graffen of all kinds were his judges the titles of both being proofs of their holding commissions from and being thus dependent on the court  but the freiherren a word very inadequately represented by our french term of baron were absolutely free never in bondage to any man holding their own and owing no duty no office poorer because unendowed by the royal authority but holding themselves infinitely higher than the pensioners of the court  left behind however by their neighbours who did their part by society and advanced with it the freiherren had been for the most part obliged to give up their independence and fall into the system but so far in the rear that they ranked like the barons of france and england as the last order of nobility  still however in the wilder and more mountainous parts of the country some of the old families of unreduced truly free freiherren lingered their hand against every man every mans hand against them and ever becoming more savage both positively and still more proportionately as their isolation and the general progress around them became greater  the house of austria by gradually absorbing hereditary states into its own possessions was however in the fifteenth century acquiring a preponderance that rendered its possession of the imperial throne almost a matter of inheritance and moreover rendered the supreme power far more effective than it had ever previously been  freidrich iii a man still in full vigour and with an able and enterprising son already elected to the succession was making his rule felt and it was fast becoming apparent that the days of the independent baronies were numbered and that the only choice that would soon be left them would be between making terms and being forcibly reduced  von adlerstein was one of the oldest of these free families  if the lords of the eagles stone had ever followed the great konrads and freidrichs of swabia in their imperial days their descendants had taken care to forget the weakness and believed themselves absolutely free from all allegiance  and the wildness of their territory was what might be expected from their hostility to all outward influences  the hostel if it deserved the name was little more than a charcoalburners hut hidden in the woods at the foot of the mountain serving as a haltingplace for the freiherrens retainers ere they attempted the ascent  the inhabitants were allowed to ply their trade of charring wood in the forest on condition of supplying the castle with charcoal and of affording a lodging to the followers on occasions like the present  grimy halfclad and brawny with the whites of his eyes gleaming out of his black face jobst the kohler startled christina terribly when she came into the outer room and met him returning from his nights work with his long stokingpole in his hand  her father shouted with laughter at her alarm  thou thinkest thyself in the land of the kobolds and dwarfs my girl  never mind thou wilt see worse than honest jobst before thou hast done  now eat a morsel and be readymountain air will make thee hungry ere thou art at the castle  and hark thee jobst thou must give stableroom to yon sumptermule for the present and let some of my daughters gear lie in the shed  o father exclaimed christina in dismay  well bring it up child by piecemeal he said in a low voice as we can but if such a freight came to the castle at once my lady would have her claws on it and little more wouldst thou ever see thereof  moreover i shall have enough to do to look after thee up the ascent without another of these citybred beasts  i hope the poor mule will be well cared for  i can pay for began christina but her father squeezed her arm and drowned her soft voice in his loud tones  jobst will take care of the beast as belonging to me  woe betide him if i find it the worseand his added imprecations seemed unnecessary so earnest were the asseverations of both the man and his wife that the animal should be well cared for  look you christina said hugh sorel as soon as he had placed her on her mule and led her out of hearing if thou hast any gold about thee let it be the last thing thou ownest to any living creature up there  then as she was about to speakdo not even tell me  i will not know  the caution did not add much to christinas comfort but she presently asked where is thy steed father  i sent him up to the castle with the schneiderlein and yellow lorentz answered the father  i shall have ado enough on foot with thee before we are up the ladder  the father and daughter were meantime proceeding along a dark path through oak and birch woods constantly ascending until the oak grew stunted and disappeared and the opening glades showed steep stony torrentfurrowed ramparts of hillside above them looking to christinas eyes as if she were set to climb up the cathedral side like a snail or a fly  she quite gasped for breath at the very sight and was told in return to wait and see what she would yet say to the adlerstreppe or eagles ladder  poor child she had no raptures for romantic scenery she knew that jagged peaks made very pretty backgrounds in illuminations but she had much rather have been in the smooth meadows of the environs of ulm  the danube looked much more agreeable to her silverwinding between its green banks than did the same waters leaping down with noisy voices in their stony worn beds to feed the river that she only knew in his grave breadth and majesty  yet alarmed as she was there was something in the exhilaration and elasticity of the mountain air that gave her an entirely new sensation of enjoyment and life and seemed to brace her limbs and spirits for whatever might be before her and willing to show herself ready to be gratified she observed on the freshness and sweetness of the air  thou findst it out child  ay tis worth all the featherbeds and pouncetboxes in ulm is it not  that accursed italian fever never left me till i came up here  a man can scarce draw breath in your foggy meadows below there  now then here is the view open  what think you of the eagles nest  for having passed beyond the region of wood they had come forth upon the mountainside  a not immoderately steep slope of boggy mossy looking ground covered with bilberries cranberries c and with bare rocks here and there rising went away above out of her ken but the path she was upon turned round the shoulder of the mountain and to the left on a ledge of rock cut off apparently on their side by a deep ravine and with a sheer precipice above and below it stood a red stone pile with one turret far above the rest  and this is schloss adlerstein she exclaimed  that is schloss adlerstein and there shalt thou be in two hours time unless the devil be more than usually busy or thou makst a fool of thyself  if so not satan himself could save thee  it was well that christina had resolution to prevent her making a fool of herself on the spot for the thought of the pathway turned her so dizzy that she could only shut her eyes trusting that her father did not see her terror  soon the turn round to the side of the mountain was made and the road became a mere track worn out on the turf on the hillside with an abyss beneath close to the edge of which the mule of course walked  when she ventured to look again she perceived that the ravine was like an enormous crack open on the mountainside and that the stream that formed the debateable ford flowed down the bottom of it  the ravine itself went probably all the way up the mountain growing shallower as it ascended higher but here where christina beheld it it was extremely deep and savagely desolate and bare  she now saw that the eagles ladder was a succession of bare gigantic terraces of rock of which the opposite side of the ravine was composed and on one of which stood the castle  it was no small mystery to her how it had ever been built or how she was ever to get there  she saw in the opening of the ravine the green meadows and woods far below and when her father pointed out to her the debateable ford apparently much nearer to the castle than they themselves were at present she asked why they had so far overpassed the castle and come by this circuitous course  because said hugh we are not eagles outright  seest thou not just beyond the castle court this whole crag of ours breaks off short falls like the town wall straight down into the plain  even this cleft that we are crossing by the only road a horse can pass breaks off short and sudden too so that the river is obliged to take leaps which nought else but a chamois could compass  a footpath there is and freiherr eberhard takes it at all times being born to it but even i am too stiff for the like  ha ha  thy uncle may talk of the kaiser and his league but he would change his note if we had him here  yet castles have been taken by hunger said christina  what knowest thou so muchtrue  but look you pointing to a white foamy thread that descended the opposite steeps yonder beck dashes through the castle court and it never dries and see you the ledge the castle stands on  it winds on out of your sight and forms a path which leads to the village of adlerstein out on the other slope of the mountains and ill were it for the serfs if they victualled not the castle well  the fearful steepness of the ground absorbed all christinas attention  the road or rather stairs came down to the stream at the bottom of the fissure and then went again on the other side up still more tremendous steeps which hugh climbed with a staff sometimes with his hand on the bridle but more often only keeping a watchful eye on the surefooted mule and an arm to steady his daughter in the saddle when she grew absolutely faint with giddiness at the abyss around her  she was too much in awe of him to utter cry or complaint and when he saw her effort to subdue her mortal terror he was far from unkind and let her feel his protecting strength  presently a voice was heard abovewhat sorel hast brought her trudchen is wearying for her  the words were in the most boorish dialect and pronunciation the stranger to christinas ears because intercourse with foreign merchants and a growing affectation of latinism had much refined the city language to which she was accustomed and she was surprised to perceive by her fathers gesture and address that the speaker must be one of the lords of the castle  she looked up and saw on the pathway above her a tall largeframed young man his skin dyed red with sun and wind in odd contrast with his pale shaggy hair moustache and beard as though the weather had tanned the one and bleached the other  his dress was a still shabbier buff suit than her father had worn but with a richlyembroidered belt sustaining a huntinghorn with finelychased ornaments of tarnished silver and an eagles plume was fastened into his cap with a large gold italian coin  he stared hard at the maiden but vouchsafed her no token of greetingonly distressed her considerably by distracting her fathers attention from her mule by his questions about the journey all in the same rude coarse tone and phraseology  some amount of illusion was dispelled  christina was quite prepared to find the mountain lords dangerous ruffians but she had expected the graces of courtesy and high birth but though there was certainly an air of command and freedom of bearing about the present specimen his manners and speech were more uncouth than those of any newlycaught apprentice of her uncle and she could not help thinking that her good aunt johanna need not have troubled herself about the danger of her taking a liking to any such young freiherr as she here beheld  by this time a last effort of the mule had climbed to the level of the castle  as her father had shown her there was precipice on two sides of the building on the third a sheer wall of rock going up to a huge height before it reached another of the eagles steps and on the fourth where the gateway was the little beck had been made to flow in a deep channel that had been hollowed out to serve as a moat before it bounded down to swell the larger watercourse in the ravine  a temporary bridge had been laid across the drawbridge was out of order and part of hughs business had been to procure materials for mending its apparatus  christina was told to dismount and cross on foot  the unrailed board so close to the abyss and with the wild water foaming above and below was dreadful to her and though she durst not speak she hung back with an involuntary shudder as her father occupied with the mule did not think of giving her a hand  the young baron burst out into an unrestrained laugha still greater shock to her feelings but at the same time he roughly took her hand and almost dragged her across saying city bredho ho  thanks sir she strove to say but she was very near weeping with the terror and strangeness of all around  the lowbrowed gateway barely high enough to admit a man on horseback opened before her almost to her feelings like the gate of the grave and she could not help crossing herself with a silent prayer for protection as she stepped under it and came into the castle courtnot such a court as gave its name to fair courtesy but if truth must be told far more resembling an illkept ill savoured stableyard with the piggeries opening into it  in unpleasantly close quarters the schneiderlein or little tailor ie the biggest and fiercest of all the knappen was grooming nibelung three longbacked longlegged frightful swine were grubbing in a heap of refuse four or five gaunt ferociouslooking dogs came bounding up to greet their comrade festhold and a great old longbearded goat stood on the top of the mixen looking much disposed to butt at any newcomer  the sorel family had brought cleanliness from flanders and hausfrau johanna was scrupulously dainty in all her appointments  christina scarcely knew how she conveyed herself and her blue kirtle across the bemired stones to the next and still darker portal under which a wide but rough illhewn stair ascended  the stables in fact occupied the lower floor of the main building and not till these stairs had ascended above them did they lead out into the castle hall  here were voicesvoices rude and harsh like those christina had shrunk from in passing drinking booths  there was a long table with rough menatarms lounging about and staring rudely at her and at the upper end by a great open chimney sat halfdozing an elderly man more rugged in feature than his son and yet when he roused himself and spoke to hugh there was a shade more of breeding and less of clownishness in his voice and deportment as if he had been less entirely devoid of training  a tall darklyrobed woman stood beside himit was her harsh tone of reproof and command that had so startled christina as she enteredand her huge towering cap made her look gigantic in the dim light of the smoky hall  her features had been handsome but had become hardened into a grim wooden aspect and with sinking spirits christina paused at the step of the dais and made her reverence wishing she could sink beneath the stones of the pavement out of sight of these terrible personages  so thats the wench you have taken all this trouble for was freiherrinn kunigundes greeting  she looks like another sick baby to nurse but ill have no trouble about herthat is all  take her up to ermentrude and thou girl have a care thou dost her will and puttest none of thy city fancies into her head  and hark thee girl added the old freiherr sitting up  so thou canst nurse her well thou shalt have a new gown and a stout husband  that way pointed the lady towards one of the four corner towers and christina moved doubtfully towards it reluctant to quit her father her only protector and afraid to introduce herself  the younger freiherr however stepped before her went striding two or three steps at a time up the turret stair and before christina had wound her way up she heard a thin impatient voice say thou saidst she was come ebbo  yes even so she heard freiherr eberhard return but she is slow and townbred  she was afraid of crossing the moat  and then both laughed so that christinas cheeks tingled as she emerged from the turret into another vaulted room  here she is quoth the brother now will she make thee quite well  it was a very bare and desolate room with no hangings to the rough stone walls and scarcely any furniture except a great carved bedstead one wooden chair a table and some stools  on the bare floor in front of the fire her arm under her head and a profusion of long hair falling round her like flax from a distaff lay wearily a little figure beside whom sir eberhard was kneeling on one knee  here is my sisterling said he looking up to the newcomer  they say you burgher women have ways of healing the sick  look at her think you you can heal her  in an excess of dumb shyness ermentrude half rose and effectually hindered any observations on her looks by hiding her face away upon her brothers knee  it was the gesture of a child of five years old but ermentrudes length of limb forbade christina to suppose her less than fourteen or fifteen  what wilt not look at her he said trying to raise her head and then holding out one of her wasted feverish hands to christina he again asked with a wistfulness that had a strange effect from the large tall man almost ten years her elder canst thou cure her maiden  i am no doctor sir replied christina but i could at least make her more comfortable  the stone is too hard for her  i will not go away i want the fire murmured the sick girl holding out her hands towards it and shivering  christina quickly took off her own thick cloth mantle well lined with dressed lambskins laid it on the floor rolled the collar of it over a small log of woodthe only substitute she could see for a pillowand showed an inviting couch in an instant  ermentrude let her brother lay her down and then was covered with the ample fold she smiled as she turned up her thin wasted face faded into the same whiteybrown tint as her hair  that is good she said but without thanks and feeling the soft lambswool  is that what you burgherwomen wear  father is to give me a furred mantle if only some court dame would pass the debateable ford  but the schlangenwaldern got the last before ever we could get down  jobst was so stupid  he did not give us warning in time but he is to be hanged next time if he does not  christinas blood curdled as she heard this speech in a weak little complaining tone that otherwise put her sadly in mind of barbara schmidts little sister who had pined and wasted to death  never mind trudchen answered the brother kindly meantime i have kept all the wild catskins for thee and may be thisthisshe could sew them up into a mantle for thee  o let me see cried the young lady eagerly and sir eberhard walking off presently returned with an armful of the beautiful brindled furs of the mountain cat reminding christina of her aunts gentle domestic favourite  ermentrude sat up and regarded the placing out of them with great interest and thus her brother left her employed and so much delighted that she had not flagged when a great bell proclaimed that it was the time for the noontide meal for which christina in spite of all her fears of the company below stairs had been constrained by mountain air to look forward with satisfaction  ermentrude she found meant to go down but with no notion of the personal arrangements that christina had been wont to think a needful preliminary  with all her hair streaming down she went and was so gladly welcomed by her father that it was plain that her presence was regarded as an unusual advance towards recovery and christina feared lest he might already be looking out for the stout husband  she had much to tell him about the catskin cloak and then she was seized with eager curiosity at the sight of christinas bundles and especially at her lute which she must hear at once  not now said her mother there will be jangling and jingling enough by and bymeat now  the whole establishment were taking their placesor rather tumbling into them  a battered shapeless metal vessel seemed to represent the saltcellar and next to it hugh sorel seated himself and kept a place for her beside him  otherwise she would hardly have had seat or food she was now able to survey the inmates of the castle besides the family themselves there were about a dozen men all ruffianlylooking and of much lower grade than her father and three women  one old ursel the wife of hatto the forester was a bent worn but not illlooking woman with a motherly face the younger ones were hard bold creatures from whom christina felt a shrinking recoil  the meal was dressed by ursel and her kitchen boy  from a great cauldron goats flesh and broth together were ladled out into wooden bowls  that every one provided their own spoon and knifeno forkwas only what christina was used to in the most refined society and she had the implements in a pouch hanging to her girdle but she was not prepared for the unwashed condition of the bowls nor for being obliged to share that of her fatherfar less for the absence of all blessing on the meal and the coarse boisterousness of manners prevailing thereat  hungry as she was she did not find it easy to take food under these circumstances and she was relieved when ermentrude overcome by the turmoil grew giddy and was carried upstairs by her father who laid her down upon her great bed and left her to the attendance of christina  ursel had followed but was petulantly repulsed by her young lady in favour of the newcomer and went away grumbling  nestled on her bed ermentrude insisted on hearing the lute and christina had to creep down to fetch it with some other of her goods in trembling haste and redoubled disgust at the aspect of the meal which looked even more repulsive in this later stage and to one who was no longer partaking of it  low and softly with a voice whence she could scarcely banish tears and in dread of attracting attention christina sung to the sick girl who listened with a sort of rude wonder and finally was lulled to sleep  christina ventured to lay down her instrument and move towards the window heavily mullioned with stone barred with iron and glazed with thick glass being in fact the only glazed window in the castle  to her great satisfaction it did not look out over the loathsome court but over the opening of the ravine  the apartment occupied the whole floor of the keep it was stonepaved but the roof was boarded and there was a round turret at each angle  one contained the staircase and was that which ran up above the keep served as a watchtower and supported the eagle banner  the other three were empty and one of these which had a strong door and a long loophole window looking out over the open country christina hoped that she might appropriate  the turret was immediately over the perpendicular cliff that descended into the plain  a stone thrown from the window would have gone straight down she knew not where  close to her ears rushed the descending waterfall in its leap over the rock side and her eyes could rest themselves on the green meadow land below and the smooth water of the debateable ford nay far far away beyond retreating ridges of wood and fieldshe thought she could track a silver line and guided by it a something that might be a city  her heart leapt towards it but she was recalled by ermentrudes fretfully imperious voice  i was only looking forth from the window lady she said returning  ah thou sawst no travellers at the ford cried ermentrude starting up with lively interest  no lady i was gazing at the far distance  know you if it be indeed ulm that we see from these windows  ulm  that is where thou comest from said ermentrude languidly  my happy home with my dear uncle and aunt  o if i can but see it hence it will be joy  i do not know  let me see said ermentrude rising but at the window her pale blue eyes gazed vacantly as if she did not know what she was looking at or for  ah if the steeple of the dome kirk were but finished i could not mistake it said christina  how beauteous the white spire will look from hence  dome kirk repeated ermentrude what is that  such an entire blank as the poor childs mind seemed to be was inconceivable to the maiden who had been bred up in the busy hum of men where the constant resort of strange merchants the daily interests of a selfgoverning municipality and the numerous festivals both secular and religious were an unconscious education even without that which had been bestowed upon her by teachers as well as by her companionship with her uncle and participation in his studies taste and arts  ermentrude von adlerstein had on the contrary not only never gone beyond the kohlers hut on the one side and the mountain village on the other but she never seen more of life than the festival at the wake the hermitage chapel there on midsummerday  the only strangers who ever came to the castle were disbanded lanzknechts who took service with her father or now and then a captive whom he put to ransom  she knew absolutely nothing of the world except for a general belief that freiherren lived there to do what they chose with other people and that the house of adlerstein was the freest and noblest in existence  also there was a very positive hatred to the house of schlangenwald and no less to that of adlerstein wildschloss for no reason that christina could discover save that being a younger branch of the family they had submitted to the emperor  to destroy either the graf von schlangenwald or her wildschloss cousin was evidently the highest gratification ermentrude could conceive and for the rest that her father and brother should make successful captures at the debateable ford was the more abiding because more practicable hope  she had no further ideas except perhaps to elude her mothers severity and to desire her brothers success in chamoishunting  the only mental culture she had ever received was that old ursel had taught her the credo pater noster and ave as correctly as might be expected from a long course of traditionary repetitions of an incomprehensible language and she knew besides a few german rhymes and jingles half christian half heathen with a legend or two which if the names were christian ran grossly wild from all christian meaning or morality as to the amenities nay almost the proprieties of life they were less known in that baronial castle than in any artisans house at ulm  so little had the sick girl figured them to herself that she did not even desire any greater means of ease than she possessed she moaned and fretted indeed with aching limbs and blank weariness but without the slightest formed desire for anything to remove her discomfort except the few ameliorations she knew such as sitting on her brothers knee with her head on his shoulder or tasting the mountain berries that he gathered for her  any other desire she exerted herself to frame was for finery to be gained from the spoils of travellers  and this was christinas charge whom she must look upon as the least alien spirit in this dreadful castle of banishment  the young and old lords seemed to her savage bandits who frightened her only less than did the proud sinister expression of the old lady for she had not even the merit of showing any tenderness towards the sickly girl of whom she was ashamed and evidently regarded the townbred attendant as a contemptible interloper  long long did the maiden weep and pray that night after ermentrude had sunk to sleep  she strained her eyes with homesick longings to detect lights where she thought ulm might be and as she thought of her uncle and aunt the poodle and the cat round the stove the maids spinning and the prentices knitting as her uncle read aloud some grave good book most probably the legend of the saint of the day and contrasted it with the rude gruff sounds of revelry that found their way up the turret stairs she could hardly restrain her sobs from awakening the young lady whose bed she was to share  she thought almost with envy of her own patroness who was cast into the lake of bolsena with a millstone about her necka better fate thought she than to live on in such an abode of loathsomeness and peril  but then had not st christina floated up alive bearing up her millstone with her  and had not she been put into a dungeon full of venomous reptiles who when they approached her had all been changed to harmless doves  christina had once asked father balthazar how this could be and had he not replied that the church did not teach these miracles as matters of faith but that she might there discern in figure how meek christian holiness rose above all crushing burthens and transformed the rudest natures  this poor maiden dying perhaps and oh how unfit to live or diemight it be her part to do some good work by her and infuse some christian hope some godly fear  could it be for this that the saints had led her hither    chapter iii  the flotsam and jetsam of the debateable ford    life in schloss adlerstein was little less intolerable than christinas imagination had depicted it  it was entirely devoid of all the graces of chivalry and its squalor and coarseness magnified into absurdity by haughtiness and violence were almost inconceivable  fortunately for her the inmates of the castle resided almost wholly below stairs in the hall and kitchen and in some dismal dens in the thickness of their walls  the height of the keep was intended for dignity and defence rather than for habitation and the upper chamber with its great statebed where everybody of the house of adlerstein was born and died was not otherwise used except when ermentrude unable to bear the oppressive confusion below stairs had escaped thither for quietness sake  no one else wished to inhabit it  the chamber above was filled with the various appliances for the defence of the castle and no one would have ever gone up the turret stairs had not a warder been usually kept on the roof to watch the roads leading to the ford  otherwise the adlersteiners had all the savage instinct of herding together in as small a space as possible  freiherrin kunigunde hardly ever mounted to her daughters chamber all her affection was centred on the strong and manly son of whom she was proud while the sickly pining girl who would hardly find a mate of her own rank and who had not even dowry enough for a convent was such a shame and burthen to her as to be almost a distasteful object  but perversely as it seemed to her the only daughter was the darling of both father and brother who were ready to do anything to gratify the girls sick fancies and hailed with delight her pleasure in her new attendant  old ursel was at first rather envious and contemptuous of the childish fragile stranger but her gentleness disarmed the old woman and when it was plain that the young ladys sufferings were greatly lessened by tender care dislike gave way to attachment and there was little more murmuring at the menial services that were needed by the two maidens even when ermentrudes feeble fancies or christinas views of dainty propriety rendered them more onerous than before  she was even heard to rejoice that some christian care and tenderness had at last reached her poor neglected child  it was well for christina that she had such an ally  the poor child never crept down stairs to the dinner or supper to fetch food for ermentrude or water for herself without a trembling and shrinking of heart and nerves  her fathers authority guarded her from rude actions but from rough tongues he neither could nor would guard her nor understand that what to some would have been a compliment seemed to her an alarming insult and her chief safeguard lay in her own insignificance and want of attraction and still more in the modesty that concealed her terror at rude jests sufficiently to prevent frightening her from becoming an entertainment  her father whom she looked on as a cultivated person in comparison with the rest of the world did his best for her after his own views and gradually brought her all the properties she had left at the kohlers hut  therewith she made a great difference in the aspect of the chamber under the full sanction of the lords of the castle wolf deer and sheep skins abounded and with these assisted by her father and old hatto she tapestried the lower part of the bare grim walls a great bears hide covered the neighbourhood of the hearth and cushions were made of these skins and stuffed from ursels stores of feathers  all these embellishments were watched with great delight by ermentrude who had never been made of so much importance and was as much surprised as relieved by such attentions  she was too young and too delicate to reject civilization and she let christina braid her hair bathe her and arrange her dress with sensations of comfort that were almost like health  to train her into occupying herself was however as christina soon found in her present state impossible  she could spin and sew a little but hated both and her clumsy listless fingers only soiled and wasted christinas needles silk and lute strings and such damage was not so easily remedied as in the streets of ulm  she was best provided for when looking on at her attendants busy hands and asking to be sung to or to hear tales of the active busy scenes of the city lifethe dresses fairs festivals and guild processions  the gentle nursing and the new interests made her improve in health so that her father was delighted and christina began to hope for a return home  sometimes the two girls would take the air either on still days upon the battlements where ermentrude watched the debateable ford and christina gazed at the danube and at ulm or they would find their way to a grassy nook on the mountainside where christina gathered gentians and saxifrage trying to teach her young lady that they were worth looking at and sighing at the thought of master gottfrieds wreath when she met with the asphodel seedvessels  once the quiet mule was brought into requisition and with her brother walking by her and sorel and his daughter in attendance ermentrude rode towards the village of adlerstein  it was a collection of miserable huts on a sheltered slope towards the south where there was earth enough to grow some wretched rye and buckwheat subject to severe toll from the lord of the soil  perched on a hollow rock above the slope was a rude little church over a cave where a hermit had once lived and died in such odour of sanctity that his day happening to coincide with that of st john the baptist the blessed freidmund had acquired the credit of the lions share both of the saints honours and of the old solstitial feast of midsummer  this wake was the one gaiety of the year and attracted a fair which was the sole occasion of coming honestly by anything from the outer world nor had his cell ever lacked a professional anchorite  the freiherr of his day had been a devout man who had gone a pilgrimage with kaiser friedrich of the red beard and had brought home a bit of stone from the council chamber of nicaea which he had presented to the little church that he had built over the cavern  he had named his son friedmund and there were dim memories of his days as of a golden age before the wildschlossen had carried off the best of the property and when all went well  this was christinas first sight of a church since her arrival except that in the chapel which was a dismal neglected vault where a ruinous altar and mouldering crucifix testified to its sacred purpose  the old baron had been excommunicated for twenty years ever since he had harried the wains of the bishop of augsburg on his way to the diet and though his household and family were not under the same sentence sunday didna come abune the pass  christinas entreaty obtained permission to enter the little building but she had knelt there only a few moments before her father came to hurry her away and her supplications that he would some day take her to mass there were whistled down the wind and indeed the hermit was a layman and the church was only served on great festivals by a monk from the convent of st ruprecht on the distant side of the mountain which was further supposed to be in the schlangenwald interest  her best chance lay in infusing the desire into ermentrude who by watching her prayers and asking a few questions had begun to acquire a few clearer ideas  and what ermentrude wished had always hitherto been acquiesced in by the two lords  the elder baron came little into christinas way  he meant to be kind to her but she was dreadfully afraid of him and when he came to visit his daughter shrank out of his notice as much as possible shuddering most of all at his attempts at civilities  his son she viewed as one of the thickwitted giants meant to be food for the heroism of good knights of romance  except that he was fairly conversant with the use of weapons and had occasionally ridden beyond the shadow of his own mountain his range was quite as limited as his sisters and he had an equal scorn for all beyond it  his unfailing kindness to his sister was however in his favour and he always eagerly followed up any suggestion christina made for her pleasure  much of his time was spent on the child whose chief nurse and playmate he had been throughout her malady and when she showed him the strangers arrangements or repeated to him in a wondering blundering way with constant appeals to her attendant the new tales she had heard he used to listen with a pleased awkward amazement at his little ermentrudes astonishing cleverness joined sometimes with real interest which was evinced by his inquiries of christina  he certainly did not admire the little slight pale bowermaiden but he seemed to look upon her like some strange almost uncanny wise spirit out of some other sphere and his manner towards her had none of the offensive freedom apparent in even the old mans patronage it was as ermentrude once said laughing almost as if he feared that she might do something to him  christina had expected to see a ruffian and had found a boor but she was to be convinced that the ruffian existed in him  notice came up to the castle of a convoy of waggons and all was excitement menatarms were mustered horses led down the eagles ladder and an ambush prepared in the woods  the autumn rains were already swelling the floods and the passage of the ford would be difficult enough to afford the assailants an easy prey  the freiherrinn kunigunde herself and all the women of the castle hurried into ermentrudes room to enjoy the view from her window the young lady herself was full of eager expectation but she knew enough of her maiden to expect no sympathy from her and loved her well enough not to bring down on her her mothers attention so christina crept into her turret unable to withdraw her eyes from the sight trembling weeping praying longing for power to give a warning signal  could they be her own townsmen stopped on the way to dear ulm  she could see the waggons in midstream the warriors on the bank she heard the triumphant outcries of the mother and daughter in the outer room  she saw the overthrow the struggle the flight of a few scattered dark figures on the farther side the drawing out of the goods on the nearer  oh were those leaping waves bearing down any good mens corpses to the danube slain foully slain by her own father and this gang of robbers  she was glad that ermentrude went down with her mother to watch the return of the victors  she crouched on the floor sobbing shuddering with grief and indignation and telling her beads alike for murdered and murderers till after the sounds of welcome and exultation she heard sir eberhards heavy tread as he carried his sister up stairs  ermentrude went up at once to christina  after all there was little for us she said  it was only a wain of wine barrels and now will the drunkards down stairs make good cheer  but ebbo could only win for me this gold chain and medal which was round the old merchants neck  was he slain christina asked with pale lips  i only know i did not kill him returned the baron i had him down and got the prize and that was enough for me  what the rest of the fellows may have done i cannot say  but he has brought thee something stina continued ermentrude show it to her brother  my father sends you this for your care of my sister said eberhard holding out a brooch that had doubtless fastened the band of the unfortunate winemerchants bonnet  thanks sir but indeed i may not take it said christina turning crimson and drawing back  so he exclaimed in amaze then bethinking himselfthey are no townsfolk of yours but constance cowards  take it take it stina or you will anger my father added ermentrude  no lady i thank the barons both but it were sin in me said christina with trembling voice  look you said eberhard we have the full righttis a seignorial rightto all the goods of every wayfarer that may be overthrown in our riveras i am a true knight he added earnestly  a true knight repeated christina pushed hard and very indignant in all her terror  the true knights part is to aid not rob the weak  and the dark eyes flashed a vivid light  christina exclaimed ermentrude in the extremity of her amazement know you what you have saidthat eberhard is no true knight  he meanwhile stood silent utterly taken by surprise and letting his little sister fight his battles  i cannot help it lady ermentrude said christina with trembling lips and eyes filling with tears  you may drive me from the castlei only long to be away from it but i cannot stain my soul by saying that spoil and rapine are the deeds of a true knight  my mother will beat you cried ermentrude passionately ready to fly to the head of the stairs but her brother laid his hand upon her  tush trudchen keep thy tongue still child  what does it hurt me  and he turned on his heels and went down stairs  christina crept into her turret weeping bitterly and with many a wild thought would they visit her offence on her father  would they turn them both out together  if so would not her father hurl her down the rocks rather than return her to ulm  could she escape  climb down the dizzy rocks it might be succour the merchant lying half dead on the meadows protect and be protected be once more among godfearing christians  and as she felt her helplessness the selfish thoughts passed into a gush of tears for the murdered man lying suffering there and for his possible wife and children watching for him presently ermentrude peeped in  stina stina dont cry i will not tell my mother  come out and finish my kerchief  come out  no one shall beat you  that is not what i wept for lady said christina  i do not think you would bring harm on me  but oh  i would i were at home  i grieve for the bloodshed that i must see and may not hinder and for that poor merchant  oh said ermentrude you need not fear for him  i saw his own folk return and lift him up  but what is he to thee or to us  i am a burgher maid lady said christina recovering herself and aware that it was of little use to bear testimony to such an auditor as poor little ermentrude against the deeds of her own father and brother which had in reality the sort of sanction sir eberhard had mentioned much akin to those coast rights that were the temptation of wreckers  still she could not but tremble at the thought of her speech and went down to supper in greater trepidation than usual dreading that she should be expected to thank the freiherr for his gift  but fortunately manners were too rare at adlerstein for any such omission to be remarkable and the whole establishment was in a state of noisy triumph and merriment over the excellence of the french wine they had captured so that she slipped into her seat unobserved  every available drinkinghorn and cup was full  ermentrude was eagerly presented with draughts by both father and brother and presently sir eberhard exclaimed turning towards the shrinking christina with a rough laugh maiden i trow thou wilt not taste  christina shook her head and framed a negative with her lips  whats this asked her father close to whom she sat  ist a fastday  there was a pause  many were present who regarded a fastday much more than the lives or goods of their neighbours  christina again shook her head  no matter said goodnatured sir eberhard evidently wishing to avert any ill consequence from her  tis only her loss  the mirth went on rough and loud and christina felt this the worst of all the miserable meals she had partaken of in fear and trembling at this place of her captivity  ermentrude too was soon in such a state of excitement that not only was christinas womanhood bitterly ashamed and grieved for her but there was serious danger that she might at any moment break out with some allusion to her maidens recusancy in her reply to sir eberhard  presently however ermentrude laid down her head and began to cry violent headache had come onand her brother took her in his arms to carry her up the stairs but his potations had begun before hers and his step was far from steady he stumbled more than once on the steps shook and frightened his sister and set her down weeping petulantly  and then came a more terrible moment his awe of christina had passed away he swore that she was a lovely maiden with only too free a tongue and that a kiss must be the seal of her pardon  a house full of intoxicated men no living creature who would care to protect her scarce even her father  but extremity of terror gave her strength  she spoke resolutelysir eberhard your sister is illyou are in no state to be here  go down at once nor insult a free maiden  probably the lowtoned softness of the voice so utterly different from the shrill wrangling notes of all the other women he had known took him by surprise  he was still sober enough to be subdued almost cowed by resistance of a description unlike all he had ever seen his alarm at christinas superior power returned in full force he staggered to the stairs christina rushed after him closed the heavy door with all her force fastened it inside and would have sunk down to weep but for ermentrudes peevish wail of distress  happily ermentrude was still a child and neglected as she had been she still had had no one to make her precocious in matters of this kind  she was quite willing to take christinas view of the case and not resent the exclusion of her brother indeed she was unwell enough to dread the loudness of his voice and rudeness of his revelry  so the door remained shut and christinas resolve was taken that she would so keep it while the wine lasted  and indeed ermentrude had so much fever all that night and the next day that no going down could be thought of  nobody came near the maidens but ursel and she described one continued orgie that made christina shudder again with fear and disgust  those below revelled without interval except for sleep and they took their sleep just where they happened to sink down then returned again to the liquor  the old baroness repaired to the kitchen when the revelry went beyond even her bearing but all the time the wine held out the swine in the court were as ursel averred better company than the men in the hall  yet there might have been worse even than this for old ursel whispered that at the bottom of the stairs there was a trapdoor  did the maiden know what it covered  it was an oubliette  there was once a strasburg armourer who had refused ransom and talked of appealing to the kaiser  he trod on that door andursel pointed downwards  but since that time she said my young lord has never brought home a prisoner  no wonder that all this time christina cowered at the discordant sounds below trembled and prayed while she waited on her poor young charge who tossed and moaned in fever and suffering  she was still far from recovered when the materials of the debauch failed and the household began to return to its usual state  she was soon restlessly pining for her brother and when her father came up to see her received him with scant welcome and entreaties for ebbo  she knew she should be better if she might only sit on his knee and lay her head on his shoulder  the old freiherr offered to accommodate her but she rejected him petulantly and still called for ebbo till he went down promising that her brother should come  with a fluttering heart christina awaited the noble whom she had perhaps insulted and whose advances had more certainly insulted her would he visit her with his anger or return to that more offensive familiarity  she longed to flee out of sight when after a long interval his heavy tread was heard but she could not even take refuge in her turret for ermentrude was leaning against her somehow the step was less assured than usual he absolutely knocked at the door and when he came in he acknowledged her by a slight inclination of the head  if she only had known it this was the first time that head had ever been bent to any being human or divine but all she did perceive was that sir eberhard was in neither of the moods she dreaded only desperately shy and sheepish and extremely ashamed not indeed of his excess which would have been even to a much tamer german baron only a happy accident but of what had passed between himself and her  he was much grieved to perceive how much ground ermentrude had lost and gave himself up to fondling and comforting her and in a few days more in their common cares for the sister christina lost her newly acquired horror of the brother and could not but be grateful for his forbearance while she was almost entertained by the increased awe of herself shown by this huge robber baron    chapter iv  snowwreaths when tis thaw    ermentrude had by no means recovered the ground she had lost before the winter set in and blinding snow came drifting down day and night rendering the whole view above and below one expanse of white only broken by the peaks of rock which were too steep to sustain the snow  the waterfall lengthened its icicles daily and the whole court was heaped with snow up even to the top of the high steps to the hall and thus christina was told would it continue all the winter  what had previously seemed to her a strangely door like window above the porch now became the only mode of egress when the barons went out bear or wolfhunting or the younger took his crossbow and hound to provide the wildfowl which under christinas skilful hands would tempt the feeble appetite of ermentrude when she was utterly unable to touch the salted meats and sausages of the household  in spite of all endeavours to guard the windows and keep up the fire the cold withered the poor child like a fading leaf and she needed more and more of tenderness and amusement to distract her attention from her ailments  christinas resources were unfailing  out of the softer pine and birch woods provided for the fire she carved a set of draughtsmen and made a board by ruling squares on the end of a settle and painting the alternate ones with a compound of oil and charcoal  even the old baron was delighted with this contrivance and the pleasure it gave his daughter  he remembered playing at draughts in that portion of his youth which had been a shade more polished and he felt as if the game were making ermentrude more hike a lady  christina was encouraged to proceed with a set of chessmen and the shaping of their characteristic heads under her dexterous fingers was watched by ermentrude like something magical  indeed the young lady entertained the belief that there was no limit to her attendants knowledge or capacity  truly there was a greater brightness and clearness beginning to dawn even upon poor little ermentrudes own dull mind  she took more interest in everything  songs were not solely lullabies but she cared to talk them over tales to which she would once have been incapable of paying attention were eagerly sought after and above all the spiritual vacancy that her mind had hitherto presented was beginning to be filled up  christina had brought her own booksa library of extraordinary extent for a maiden of the fifteenth century but which she owed to her uncles connexion with the arts of woodcutting and printing  a vulgate from dr faustuss own press a mass book and breviary thomas a kempiss imitation and the nuremburg chronicle all in latin and the poetry of the gentle minnesinger and bird lover walther von vogelweide in the vernacular  these were her stock which hausfrau johanna had viewed as a foolish encumbrance and hugh sorel would never have transported to the castle unless they had been so well concealed in christinas kirtles that he had taken them for parts of her wardrobe  most precious were they now when out of the reach of all teaching save her own she had to infuse into the sinking girls mind the great mysteries of life and death that so she might not leave the world without more hope or faith than her heathen forefathers  for that ermentrude would live christina had never hoped since that fleeting improvement had been cut short by the fever of the winecup the look voice and tone had become so completely the same as those of regina grundts little sister who had pined and died  she knew she could not cure but she could she felt she could comfort cheer and soften and she no longer repined at her enforced sojourn at adlerstein  she heartily loved her charge and could not bear to think how desolate ermentrude would be without her  and now the poor girl had become responsive to her care  she was infinitely softened in manner and treated her parents with forms of respect new to them she had learnt even to thank old ursel dropped her imperious tone and struggled with her petulance and towards her brother the domineering uncouth adherence was becoming real tender affection while the dependent reverent love she bestowed upon christina was touching and endearing in the extreme  freiherr von adlerstein saw the change and congratulated himself on the effect of having a townbred bower woman nay spoke of the advantage it would be to his daughter if he could persuade himself to make the submission to the kaiser which the late improvements decided on at the diet were rendering more and more inevitable  now how happy would be the winner of his gentle ermentrude  freiherrinn von adlerstein thought the alteration the mere change from child to woman and felt insulted by the supposition that any one might not have been proud to match with a daughter of adlerstein be she what she might  as to submission to the kaiser that was mere folly and weaknesskaisers kings dukes and counts had broken their teeth against the rock of adlerstein before now  what had come over her husband and her son to make them cravens  for freiherr eberhard was more strongly convinced than was his father of the untenableness of their present position  hugh sorels reports of what he heard at ulm had shown that the league that had been discussed at regensburg was far more formidable than anything that had ever previously threatened schloss adlerstein and that if the graf von schlangenwald joined in the coalition there would be private malice to direct its efforts against the adlerstein family feudletters or challenges had been made unlawful for ten years and was not adlerstein at feud with the world  nor did eberhard look on the submission with the sullen rage and grief that his father felt in bringing himself to such a declension from the pride of his ancestors  what the young baron heard up stairs was awakening in him a sense of the poorness and narrowness of his present life  ermentrude never spared him what interested her and partly from her lips partly through her appeals to her attendant he had learnt that life had better things to offer than independence on these bare rocks and that homage might open the way to higher and worthier exploits than preying upon overturned waggons  dietrich of berne and his two ancestors whose lengthy legend christina could sing in a low soft recitative were revelations to him of what she meant by a true knightthe lion in war the lamb in peace the quaint oftrepeated portraits and still quainter cities of the chronicle with her explanations and translations opened his mind to aspirations for intercourse with his fellows for an honourable name and for esteem in its degree such as was paid to sir parzival to karl the great or to rodolf of hapsburgh once a mountain lord like himself  nay as ermentrude said stroking his cheek and smoothing the flaxen beard that somehow had become much less rough and tangled than it used to be some day wilt thou be another good freiherr eberhard whom all the countryside loved and who gave bread at the castlegate to all that hungered  her brother believed nothing of her slow declension in strength ascribing all the change he saw to the bitter cold and seeing but little even of that alteration though he spent many hours in her room holding her in his arms amusing her or talking to her and to christina  all christinas fear of him was gone  as long as there was no liquor in the house and he was his true self she felt him to be a kind friend bound to her by strong sympathy in the love and care for his sister  she could talk almost as freely before him as when alone with her young lady and as ermentrudes religious feelings grew stronger and were freely expressed to him surely his attention was not merely kindness and patience with the sufferer  the girls soul ripened rapidly under the new influences during her bodily decay and as the days lengthened and the stern hold of winter relaxed upon the mountains christina looked with strange admiration upon the expression that had dawned upon the features once so vacant and dull and listened with the more depth of reverence to the sweet words of faith hope and love because she felt that a higher deeper teaching than she could give must have come to mould the spirit for the new world to which it was hastening   like an army defeated the snow had retreated   out of the valley whose rich green shone smiling round the pool into which the debateable ford spread  the waterfall had burst its icy bonds and dashed down with redoubled voice roaring rather than babbling  blue and pink hepaticasor as christina called them liverkrautshad pushed up their starry heads and had even been gathered by sir eberhard and laid on his sisters pillow  the dark peaks of rock came out all glistening with moisture and the snow only retained possession of the deep hollows and crevices into which however its retreat was far more graceful than when in the city it was trodden by horse and man and soiled with smoke  christina dreaded indeed that the roads should be open but she could not love the snow it spoke to her of dreariness savagery and captivity and she watched the dwindling stripes with satisfaction and hailed the fall of the petty avalanches from one eagles step to another as her forefathers might have rejoiced in the defeat of the frost giants  but ermentrude had a love for the white sheet that lay covering a gorge running up from the ravine  she watched its diminution day by day with a fancy that she was melting away with it and indeed it was on the very day that a succession of drifting showers had left the sheet alone and separated it from the masses of white above that it first fully dawned upon the rest of the family that for the little daughter of the house spring was only bringing languor and sinking instead of recovery  then it was that sir eberhard first really listened to her entreaty that she might not die without a priest and comforted her by passing his word to her that ifhe would not say whenthe time drew near he would bring her one of the priests who had only come from st ruprechts cloister on great days by a sort of sufferance to say mass at the blessed friedmunds hermitage chapel  the time was slow in coming  easter had passed with ermentrude far too ill for christina to make the effort she had intended of going to the church even if she could get no escort but old urselthe sheet of snow had dwindled to a mere wreaththe ford looked blue in the sunshinethe cascade tinkled merrily down its rockmountain primroses peeped out when as father norbert came forth from saying his illattended pentecostal mass and was parting with the infirm peasant hermit a tall figure strode up the pass and as the villagers fell back to make way stood before the startled priest and said in a voice choked with grief come with me  who needs me began the astonished monk  follow him not father whispered the hermit  it is the young freiherroh have mercy on him gracious sir he has done your noble lordships no wrong  i mean him no ill replied eberhard clearing his voice with difficulty i would but have him do his office  art thou afraid priest  who needs my office demanded father norbert  show me fit cause and what should i dread  wherefore dost thou seek me  for my sister replied eberhard his voice thickening again  my little sister lies at the point of death and i have sworn to her that a priest she shall have  wilt thou come or shall i drag thee down the pass  i come i come with all my heart sir knight was the ready response  a few moments and i am at your bidding  he stepped back into the hermits cave whence a stair led up to the chapel  the anchorite followed him whisperinggood father escape  there will be full time ere he misses you  the north door leads to the gemsbocks pass it is open now  why should i baulk him  why should i deny my office to the dying said norbert  alas holy father thou art new to this country and knowst not these men of blood  it is a snare to make the convent ransom thee if not worse  the freiherrinn is a fiend for malice and the freiherr is excommunicate  i know it my son said norbert but wherefore should their child perish unassoilzied  art coming priest shouted eberhard from his stand at the mouth of the cave  and as norbert at once appeared with the pyx and other appliances that he had gone to fetch the freiherr held out his hand with an offer to carry his gear for him and when the monk refused with an inward shudder at entrusting a sacred charge to such unhallowed hands replied you will have work enow for both hands ere the castle is reached  but father norbert was by birth a sturdy switzer and thought little of these swabian alps and he climbed after his guide through the most rugged passages of eberhards shortest and most perpendicular cut without a moments hesitation and with agility worthy of a chamois  the young baron turned for a moment when the level of the castle had been gained perhaps to see whether he were following but at the same time came to a sudden speechless pause  on the white masses of vapour that floated on the opposite side of the mountain was traced a gigantic shadowy outline of a hermit with head bent eagerly forward and arm outstretched  the monk crossed himself  eberhard stood still for a moment and then said hoarselythe blessed friedmund  he is come for her then strode on towards the postern gate followed by brother norbert a good deal reassured both as to the genuineness of the young barons message and the probable condition of the object of his journey since the patron saint of her race was evidently on the watch to speed her departing spirit  sir eberhard led the way up the turret stairs to the open door and the monk entered the deathchamber  the elder baron sat near the fire in the large wooden chair half turned towards his daughter as one who must needs be present but with his face buried in his hands unable to endure the spectacle  nearer was the tall form of his wife standing near the foot of the bed her stern harsh features somewhat softened by the feelings of the moment  ursel waited at hand with tears running down her furrowed cheeks  for such as these father norbert was prepared but he little expected to meet so pure and sweet a gaze of reverential welcome as beamed on him from the soft dark eyes of the little whitechecked maiden who sat on the bed holding the sufferer in her arms  still less had he anticipated the serene blessedness that sat on the wasted features of the dying girl and all the anguish of labouring breath  she smiled a smile of joy held up her hand and thanked her brother her father scarcely lifted his head her mother made a rigid curtsey and with a grim look of sorrow coming over her features laid her hand over the old barons shoulder  come away herr vater she said he is going to hear her confession and make her too holy for the like of us to touch  the old man rose up and stepped towards his child  ermentrude held out her arms to him and murmured   father father pardon me i would have been a better daughter if i had only known  he gathered her in his arms he was quite past speaking and they only heard his heavy breathing and one more whisper from ermentrudeand oh father one day wilt thou seek to be absolved  whether he answered or not they knew not he only gave her repeated kisses and laid her down on her pillows then rushed to the door and the passionate sobs of the strong mans uncontrolled nature might be heard upon the stair  the parting with the others was not necessarily so complete as they were not like him under censure of the church but kunigunde leant down to kiss her and in return to her repetition of her entreaty for pardon replied thou hast it child if it will ease thy mind but it is all along of these new fancies that ever an adlerstein thought of pardon  there there i blame thee not poor maid it thou wert to die it may be even best as it is  now must i to thy father he is troubled enough about this gear  but when eberhard moved towards his sister she turned to the priest and said imploringly not far not far  oh let them pointing to eberhard and christina let them not be quite out of sight  out of hearing is all that is needed daughter replied the priest and ermentrude looked content as christina moved towards the empty north turret where with the door open she was in full view and eberhard followed her thither  it was indeed fully out of earshot of the childs faint gasping confession  gravely and sadly both stood there  christina looked up the hillside for the snowwreath  the may sunshine had dissolved it the green pass lay sparkling without a vestige of its white coating  her eyes full of tears she pointed the spot out to eberhard  he understood but leaning towards her told under his breath of the phantom he had seen  her eyes expanded with awe of the supernatural  it was the blessed friedmund said eberhard  never hath he so greeted one of our race since the pious freiherrinn hildegarde  maiden hast thou brought us back a blessing  ah well may she be blessedwell may the saints stoop to greet her murmured christina with strangled voice scarcely able to control her sobs  father norbert came towards them  the simple confession had been heard and he sought the aid of christina in performing the last rites of the church  maiden he said to her thou hast done a great and blessed work such as many a priest might envy thee  eberhard was not excluded during the final services by which the soul was to be dismissed from its earthly dwellingplace  true he comprehended little of their import and nothing of the words but he gazed meekly with uncovered head and a bewildered look of sadness while christina made her responses and took her part with full intelligence and deep fervour sorrowing indeed for the companion who had become so dear to her but deeply thankful for the spiritual consolation that had come at last  ermentrude lay calm and as it were already rapt into a higher world lighting up at the german portions of the service and not wholly devoid of comprehension of the spirit even of the latin as indeed she had come to the border of the region where human tongues and languages are no more  she was all but gone when the rite of extreme unction was completed and they could only stand round her eberhard christina ursel and the old baroness who had returned again watching the last flutterings of the breath the window thrown wide open that nothing might impede the passage of the soul to the blue vault above  the priest spoke the beautiful commendation depart o christian soul  there was a faint gesture in the midst for christina to lift her in her armsa sign to bend down and kiss her browbut her last look was for her brother her last murmur come after me be the good baron ebbo    chapter v  the young freiherr    ermentrude von adlerstein slept with her forefathers in the vaults of the hermitage chapel and christina sorels work was done  surely it was time for her to return home though she should be more sorry to leave the mountain castle than she could ever have believed possible  she entreated her father to take her home but she received a sharp answer that she did not know what she was talking of  the schlangenwald reitern were besetting all the roads and moreover the ulm burghers had taken the capture of the constance wine in such dudgeon that for a retainer of adlerstein to show himself in the streets would be an absolute asking for the wheel  but was there any hope for her  could he not take her to some nunnery midway and let her write to her uncle to fetch her from thence  he swore at womans pertinacity but allowed at last that if the plan talked of by the barons of going to make their submission to the emperor at linz with a view to which all violence at the ford had ceased should hold good it might be possible thus to drop her on their way  with this christina must needs content herself  poor child not only had ermentrudes death deprived her of the sole object of her residence at schloss adlerstein but it had infinitely increased the difficulties of her position  no one interfered with her possession of the upper room and its turrets and it was only at meal times that she was obliged to mingle with the other inhabitants who for the most part absolutely overlooked the little shrinking pale maiden but with one exception and that the most perplexing of all  she had been on terms with freiherr eberhard that were not so easily broken off as if she had been an old woman of ursels age  all through his sisters decline she had been his comforter assistant director living in intercourse and sympathy that ought surely to cease when she was no longer his sisters attendant yet which must be more than ever missed in the full freshness of the stroke  even on the earliest day of bereavement a sudden thought of hausfrau johanna flashed upon christina and reminded her of the guard she must keep over herself if she would return to ulm the same modest girl whom her aunt could acquit of all indiscretion  her cheeks flamed as she sat alone with the very thought and the next time she heard the wellknown tread on the stair she fled hastily into her own turret chamber and shut the door  her heart beat fast  she could hear sir eberhard moving about the room and listened to his heavy sigh as he threw himself into the large chair  presently he called her by name and she felt it needful to open her door and answer respectfully  what would you my lord  what would i  a little peace and heed to her who is gone  to see my father and mother one would think that a partridge had but flown away  i have seen my father more sorrowful when his dog had fallen over the abyss  mayhap there is more sorrow for a brute that cannot live again said christina  our bird has her nest by an altar that is lovelier and brighter than even our dome kirk will ever be  sit down christina he said dragging a chair nearer the hearth my heart is sore and i cannot bear the din below  tell me where my bird is flown  ah sir pardon me  i must to the kitchen said christina crossing her hands over her breast to still her trembling heart for she was very sorry for his grief but moving resolutely  must  and wherefore  thou hast nought to do there speak truth why not stay with me and his great light eyes opened wide  a burgher maid may not sit down with a noble baron  the devil  has my mother been plaguing thee child  no my lord said christina she reeks not of me butsteadying her voice with great difficultyit behoves me the more to be discreet  and you would not have me come here he said with a wistful tone of reproach  i have no power to forbid you but if you do i must betake me to ursel in the kitchen said christina very low trembling and half choked  among the rude wenches there he cried starting up  nay nay that shall not be  rather will i go  but this is very cruel of thee maiden he added lingering when i give thee my knightly word that all should be as when she whom we both loved was here and his voice shook  it could not so be my lord returned christina with drooping blushing face it would not be maidenly in me  oh my lord you are kind and generous make it not hard for me to do what other maidens less lonely have friends to do for them  kind and generous said eberhard leaning over the back of the chair as if trying to begin a fresh score  this from you who told me once i was no true knight  i shall call you a true knight with all my heart cried christina the tears rushing into her eyes if you will respect my weakness and loneliness  he stood up again as if to move away then paused and twisting his gold chain said and how am i ever to be what the happy one bade me if you will not show me how  my error would never show you the right said christina with a strong effort at firmness and retreating at once through the door of the staircase whence she made her way to the kitchen and with great difficulty found an excuse for her presence there  it had been a hard struggle with her compassion and gratitude and poor little christina felt with dismay with something more than these  else why was it that even while principle and better sense summoned her back to ulm she experienced a deadly weariness of the citypent air of the grave heavy roll of the river nay even of the quiet wellregulated household  why did such a marriage as she had thought her natural destiny with some worthy kindhearted brother of the guild become so hateful to her that she could only aspire to a convent life  this same burgomaster would be an estimable man no doubt and those around her were ruffians but she felt utterly contemptuous and impatient of him  and why was the interchange of greetings the few words at meals worth all the rest of the day besides to her  her own heart was the traitor and to her own sensations the poor little thing had in spirit at least transgressed all aunt johannas precepts against young barons  she wept apart and resolved and prayed cruelly ashamed of every start of joy or pain that the sight of eberhard cost her  from almost the first he had sat next her at the single table that accommodated the whole household at meals and the custom continued though on some days he treated her with sullen silence which she blamed herself for not rejoicing in sometimes he spoke a few friendly words but he observed better than she could have dared to expect her test of his true knighthood and never again forced himself into her apartment though now and then he came to the door with flowers with mountain strawberries and once with two young doves  take them christina he said they are very like yourself and he always delayed so long that she was forced to be resolute and shut the door on him at last  once when there was to be a mass at the chapel hugh sorel between a smile and a growl informed his daughter that he would take her thereto  she gladly prepared and bent on making herself agreeable to her father did not once press on him the necessity of her return to ulm  to her amazement and pleasure the young baron was at church and when on the way home he walked beside her mule she could see no need of sending him away  he had been in no school of the conventionalities of life and when he saw that hugh sorels presence had obtained him this favour he wistfully asked christina if i bring your father with me will you not let me in  entreat me not my lord she answered with fluttering breath  she felt the more that she was right in this decision when she encountered her fathers broad grin of surprise and diversion at seeing the young baron help her to dismount  it was a look of receiving an idea both new comical and flattering but by no means the look of a father who would resent the indignity of attentions to his daughter from a man whose rank formed an insuperable barrier to marriage  the effect was a new urgent and most piteous entreaty that he would find means of sending her home  it brought upon her the hearing put into words what her own feelings had long shrunk from confessing to herself  ah  why what now  what is the young baron after thee  ha ha petticoats are few enough up here but he must have been ill off ere he took to a little ghost like thee  i saw he was moping and doleful but i thought it was all for his sister  and so it is father  tell me that when he watches every turn of that dark eye of thine the only good thing thou tookst of mine  thou art a witch stina  hush oh hush for pitys sake father and let me go home  what thou likest him not  thy mind is all for the mincing goldsmith opposite as i ever told thee  my mind isis to return to my uncle and aunt the truehearted maiden they parted with said christina with clasped hands  and oh father as you were the son of a true and faithful mother be a father to me now  jeer not your motherless child but protect her and help her  hugh sorel was touched by this appeal and he likewise recollected how much it was for his own interest that his brother should be satisfied with the care he took of his daughter  he became convinced that the sooner she was out of the castle the better and at length bethought him that among the merchants who frequented the midsummer fair at the blessed friedmunds wake a safe escort might be found to convey her back to ulm  if the truth were known hugh sorel was not devoid of a certain feeling akin to contempt both for his young masters taste and for his forbearance in not having pushed matters further with a being so helpless meek and timid as christina more especially as such slackness had not been his wont in other cases where his fancy had been caught  but sorel did not understand that it was not physical beauty that here had been the attraction though to some persons the sweet pensive eyes the delicate pure skin the slight tender form might seem to exceed in loveliness the fully developed animal comeliness chiefly esteemed at adlerstein  it was rather the strangeness of the power and purity of this timid fragile creature that had struck the young noble  with all their brutal manners reverence for a lofty female nature had been in the german character ever since their velleda prophesied to them and this reverence in eberhard bowed at the feet of the pure gentle maiden so strong yet so weak so wistful and entreating even in her resolution refined as a white flower on a heap of refuse wise and dexterous beyond his slow and dull conception and the first being in whom he had ever seen piety or goodness and likewise with a tender loving spirit of consolation such as he had both beheld and tasted by his sisters deathbed  there was almost a fear mingled with his reverence  if he had been more familiar with the saints he would thus have regarded the holy virgin martyrs nay even our lady herself and he durst not push her so hard as to offend her and excite the anger or the grief that he alike dreaded  he was wretched and forlorn without the resources he had found in his sisters room the new and better cravings of his higher nature had been excited only to remain unsupplied and disappointed and the affectionate heart in the freshness of its sorrow yearned for the comfort that such conversation had supplied but the impression that had been made on him was still such that he knew that to use rough means of pressing his wishes would no more lead to his real gratification than it would to appropriate a snow bell by crushing it in his gauntlet  and it was on feeble little christina yielding in heart though not in will that it depended to preserve this reverence and return unscathed from this castle more perilous now than ever    chapter vi  the blessed friedmunds wake    midsummerday arrived and the village of adlerstein presented a most unusual spectacle  the wake was the occasion of a grand fair for all the mountainside and it was an understood thing that the barons instead of molesting the pedlars merchants and others who attended it contented themselves with demanding a toll from every one who passed the kohlers hut on the one side or the gemsbocks pass on the other and this toll being the only coin by which they came honestly in the course of the year was regarded as a certainty and highly valued  moreover it was the only time that any purchases could be made and the flotsam of the ford did not always include all even of the few requirements of the inmates of the castle it was the only holiday sacred or secular that ever gladdened the eagles rock  so all the inmates of the castle prepared to enjoy themselves except the heads of the house  the freiherr had never been at one of these wakes since the first after he was excommunicated when he had stalked round to show his indifference to the sentence and the freiherrinn snarled out such sentences of disdain towards the concourse that it might be supposed that she hated the sight of her kind but ursel had all the household purchases to make and the kitchen underlings were to take turns to go and come as indeed were the menatarms who were set to watch the tollbars  christina had packed up a small bundle for the chance of being unable to return to the castle without missing her escort though she hoped that the fair might last two days and that she should thus be enabled to return and bring away the rest of her property  she was more and more resolved on going but her heart was less and less inclined to departure  and bitter had been her weeping through all the early light hours of the long morningweeping that she tried to think was all for ermentrude and all amid prayers she could scarce trust herself to offer that the generous kindly nature might yet work free of these evil surroundings and fulfil the sisters dying wish she should never see it but when she should hear that the debateable ford was the friendly ford then would she know that it was the doing of the good baron ebbo  could she venture on telling him so  or were it not better that there were no farewell  and she wept again that he should think her ungrateful  she could not persuade herself to release the doves but committed the charge to ursel to let them go in case she should not return  so tearstained was her face that ashamed that it should be seen she wrapped it closely in her hood and veil when she came down and joined her father  the whole scene swam in tears before her eyes when she saw the whole green slope from the chapel covered with tents and booths and swarming with pedlars and mountaineers in their picturesque dresses  women and girls were exchanging the yarn of their winters spinning for bright handkerchiefs men drove sheep goats or pigs to barter for knives spades or weapons others were gazing at simple showsa dancing bear or apeor clustering round a minnesinger many even then congregating in booths for the sale of beer  further up on the flat space of sward above the chapel were some lay brothers arranging for the representation of a mysterya kind of entertainment which germany owed to the english who came to the council of constance and which the monks of st ruprechts hoped might infuse some religious notions into the wild ignorant mountaineers  first however christina gladly entered the church  crowded though it were it was calmer than the busy scene without  faded old tapestry was decking its walls representing apparently some subject entirely alien to st john or the blessed hermit christina rather thought it was mars and venus but that was all the same to every one else  and there was a terrible figure of st john painted lifelike with a real haircloth round his loins just opposite to her on the step of the altar also poor friedmunds bones dressed up in a new serge amice and hood the stone from nicaea was in a gilded box ready in due time to be kissed and a preaching friar not one of the monks of st ruprechts was in the midst of a sermon telling how st john presided at the council of nicaea till the emperor maximius cut off his head at the instance of herodiusfull justice being done to the dancingand that the blood was sprinkled on this very stone whereupon our holy father the pope decreed that whoever would kiss the said stone and repeat the credo five times afterwards should be capable of receiving an indulgence for 500 years  which indulgence must however be purchased at the rate of six groschen to be bestowed in alms at rome  and this inestimable benefit he poor friar peter had come from his brotherhood of st francis at offingen solely to dispense to the poor mountaineers  it was disappointing to find this profane mummery going on instead of the holy services to which christina had looked forward for strength and comfort she was far too well instructed not to be scandalized at the profane deception which was ripening fast for luther only thirty years later and when the stone was held up by the friar in one hand the printed briefs of indulgence in the other she shrunk back her father however said wilt have one child  five hundred years is no bad bargain  my uncle has small trust in indulgences she whispered  all lies of course quoth hugh yet theyve the popes seal and i have more than half a mind to get one  five hundred years is no joke and i am sure of purgatory since i bought this medal at the holy house of loretto  and he went forward and invested six groschen in one of the papers the most religious action poor christina had ever seen him perform other purchasers came forwardseveral of the castle knappen and a few peasant women who offered yarn or cheeses as equivalents for money but were told with some insolence to go and sell their goods and bring the coin  after a time the friar finding his traffic slack thought fit to remove with his two lay assistants outside the chapel and try the effects of an outofdoor sermon  hugh sorel who had been hitherto rather diverted by the mans gestures and persuasions now decided on going out into the fair in quest of an escort for his daughter but as she saw father norbert and another monk ascending from the stairs leading to the hermits cell she begged to be allowed to remain in the church where she was sure to be safe instead of wandering about with him in the fair  he was glad to be unencumbered though he thought her taste unnatural and promising to return for her when he had found an escort he left her  father norbert had come for the very purpose of hearing confessions and christinas next hour was the most comfortable she had spent since ermentrudes death  after this however the priests were called away and long long did christina first kneel and then sit in the little lonely church hearing the various sounds without and imagining that her father had forgotten her and that he and all the rest were drinking and then what would become of her  why had she quitted old ursels protection  hours of waiting and nameless alarm must have passed for the sun was waxing low when at length she heard steps coming up the hermits cell and a head rose above the pavement which she recognized with a wild throb of joy but repressing her sense of gladness she only exclaimed oh where is my father  i have sent him to the toll at the gemsbocks pass replied sir eberhard who had by this time come up the stairs followed by brother peter and the two lay assistants  then as christina turned on him her startled terrified eyes in dismay and reproach for such thoughtlessness he came towards her and bending his head and opening his hand he showed on his palm two gold rings  there little one he said now shalt thou never again shut me out  her senses grew dizzy  sir she faintly said this is no place to delude a poor maiden  i delude thee not  the brother here waits to wed us  impossible  a burgher maid is not for such as you  none but a burgher maid will i wed returned sir eberhard with all the settled resolution of habits of command  see christina thou art sweeter and better than any lady in the land thou canst make me what shethe blessed one who lies therewould have me  i love thee as never knight loved lady  i love thee so that i have not spoken a word to offend thee when my heart was bursting andas he saw her irrepressible tearsi think thou lovest me a little  ah she gasped with a sob let me go  thou canst not go home there is none here fit to take charge of thee  or if there were i would slay him rather than let thee go no not so he said as he saw how little those words served his cause but without thee i were a mad and desperate man  christina i will not answer for myself if thou dost not leave this place my wedded wife  oh implored christina if you would only betroth me and woo me like an honourable maiden from my home at ulm  betroth thee ay and wed thee at once replied eberhard who all along even while his words were most pleading had worn a look and manner of determined authority and strength goodnatured indeed but resolved  i am not going to miss my opportunity or baulk the friar  the friar who had meantime been making a few needful arrangements for the ceremony advanced towards them  he was a goodhumoured easygoing man who came prepared to do any office that came in his way on such festival days at the villages round and peasant marriages at such times were not uncommon  but something now staggered him and he said anxiously   this maiden looks conventbred  herr reiter pardon me but if this be the breaking of a cloister i can have none of it  no such thing said eberhard she is townbred that is all  you would swear to it on the holy mass yonder both of you said the friar still suspiciously  yea replied eberhard and so dost thou christina  this was the time if ever to struggle against her destiny  the friar would probably have listened to her if she had made any vehement opposition to a forced marriage and if not a few shrieks would have brought perhaps father norbert and certainly the whole population but the horror and shame of being found in such a situation even more than the probability that she might meet with vengeance rather than protection withheld her  even the friar could hardly have removed her and this was her only chance of safety from the baronesss fury  had she hated and loathed sir eberhard perhaps she had striven harder but his whole demeanour constrained and quelled her and the chief effort she made against yielding was the reply i am no cloister maid holy father but  the but was lost in the friars jovial speech  oh then all is well  take thy place pretty one there by the door thou knowst it should be in the porch butach i understand as eberhard quietly drew the bolt within  no no little one i have no time for bride scruples and coyness i have to train three dullheaded louts to be shem ham and japhet before dark  hast confessed of late  this morning but said christina and this morning to her great joy said eberhard and in her satisfaction thereat her second but was not followed up  the friar asked their names and both gave the christian name alone then the brief and simple rite was solemnized in its shortest form christina had by very force of surprise and dismay gone through all without signs of agitation except the quivering of her whole frame and the icy coldness of the hand where eberhard had to place the ring on each finger in turn  but each mutual vow was a strange relief to her longtossed and divided mind and it was rest indeed to let her affection have its will and own him indeed as a protector to be loved instead of shunned  when all was over and he gathered the two little cold hands into his large one his arm supporting her trembling form she felt for the moment poor little thing as if she could never be frightened again  parish registers were not even had this been a parish church but brother peter asked when he had concluded well my son which of his flock am i to report to your pfarrer as linked together  the less your tongue wags on that matter till i call on you the better was the stern reply  look you no ill shall befall you if you are wise but remember against the day i call you to bear witness that you have this day wedded baron eberhard von adlerstein the younger to christina the daughter of hugh sorel the esquire of ulm  thou hast played me a trick sir baron said the friar somewhat dismayed but more amused looking up at eberhard who as christina now saw had divested himself of his gilt spurs gold chain silvered belt and horn and eagles plume so as to have passed for a simple lanzknecht  i would have had no such gear as this  so i supposed said eberhard coolly  young folks young folks laughed the friar changing his tone and holding up his finger slyly the little bird so cunningly nestled in the church to fly out my lady baroness  well so thou hast a pretty timid lambkin there sir baron  take care you use her mildly  eberhard looked into christinas face with a smile that to her at least was answer enough and he held out half a dozen links of his gold chain to the friar and tossed a coin to each of the lay brethren  not for the poor friar himself explained brother peter on receiving this marriage fee it all goes to the weal of the brotherhood  as you please said eberhard  silence that is all  and thy friary  the poor house of st francis at offingen for the present noble sir said the priest  there will you hear of me if you find me not  and now fare thee well my gracious lady  i hope one day thou wilt have more words to thank the poor brother who has made thee a noble baroness  ah good father pardon my fright and confusion christina tried to murmur but at that moment a sudden glow and glare of light broke out on the eastern rock illuminating the fast darkening little church with a flickering glare that made her start in terror as if the fires of heaven were threatening this stolen marriage but the friar and eberhard both exclaimed the needfire alight already  and she recollected how often she had seen these bonfires on midsummer night shining red on every hill around ulm  loud shouts were greeting the uprising flame and the people gathering thicker and thicker on the slope  the friar undid the door to hasten out into the throng and eberhard said he had left his spurs and belt in the hermits cell and must return thither after which he would walk home with his bride moving at the same time towards the stair and thereby causing a sudden scuffle and fall  so master hermit quoth eberhard as the old man picked himself up looking horribly frightened thats your hermits abstraction is it  no whining old man i am not going to hurt thee so thou canst hold thy tongue  otherwise i will smoke thee out of thy hole like a wild cat  what thou aiding me with my belt my lovely one  thanks the snap goes too hard for thy little hands  now then the fire will light us gaily down the mountain side  but it soon appeared that to depart was impossible unless by forcing a way through the busy throng in the full red glare of the firelight and they were forced to pause at the opening of the hermits cave christina leaning on her husbands arm and a fold of his mantle drawn round her to guard her from the nightbreeze of the mountain as they waited for a quiet space in which to depart unnoticed  it was a strange wild scene  the fire was on a bare flat rock which probably had been yearly so employed ever since the kelts had brought from the east the rite that they had handed on to the swabiansthe beltane fire whose like was blazing everywhere in the alps in the hartz nay even in england scotland and on the granite points of ireland  heaped up for many previous days with faggots from the forest then apparently inexhaustible the fire roared and crackled and rose high red and smoky into the air paling the moon and obscuring the stars  round it completely hiding the bonfire itself were hosts of dark figures swarming to approach itall with a purpose  all held old shoes or superannuated garments in their hands to feed the flame for it was esteemed needful that every villager should contribute something from his houseonce no doubt as an offering to bel but now as a mere unmeaning observance  and shrieks of merriment followed the contribution of each too wellknown article of rubbish that had been in reserve for the needfire  girls and boys had nuts to throw in in pairs to judge by their bounces of future chances of matrimony  then came a shouting tittering and falling back as an old boor came forward like a priest with something heavy and ghastly in his arms which was thrown on with a tremendous shout darkened the glow for a moment then hissed cracked and emitted a horrible odour  it was a horses head the right owner of which had been carefully kept for the occasion though long past work  christina shuddered and felt as if she had fallen upon a pagan ceremony as indeed was true enough only that the adlersteiners attached no meaning to the performance except a vague notion of securing good luck  with the same idea the faggots were pulled down and arranged so as to form a sort of lane of fire  young men rushed along it and then bounded over the diminished pile amid loud shouts of laughter and either admiration or derision and in the meantime a variety of odd recusant noises grunts squeaks and lowings proceeding from the darkness were explained to the startled little bride by her husband to come from all the cattle of the mountain farms around who were to have their weal secured by being driven through the needfire  it may well be imagined that the animals were less convinced of the necessity of this performance than their masters  wonderful was the clatter and confusion horrible the uproar raised behind to make the poor things proceed at all desperate the shout when some half frantic creature kicked or attempted a charge wild the glee when a persecuted goat or sheep took heart of grace and flashed for one moment between the crackling flaring smoking walls  when one cow or sheep off a farm went all the others were pretty sure to follow it and the owner had then only to be on the watch at the other end to turn them back with their flamedazzled eyes from going unawares down the precipice a fate from which the passing through the fire was evidently not supposed to ensure them  the swine those special german delights were of course the most refractory of all  some by dint of being pulled away from the lane of fire were induced to rush through it but about halfway they generally made a bolt either sidelong through the flaming fence or backwards among the legs of their persecutors who were upset amid loud imprecations  one huge old lean highbacked sow with a large family truly feminine in her want of presence of mind actually charged into the midst of the bonfire itself scattering it to the right and left with her snout and emitting so horrible a smell of singed bacon that it might almost be feared that some of her progeny were anticipating the invention of chinese roastingpigs  however their proprietor jobst counted them out all safe on the other side and there only resulted some sighs and lamentations among the seniors such as hatto and ursel that it boded ill to have the needfire trodden out by an old sow  all the castle livestock were undergoing the same ceremony eberhard concerned himself little about the vagaries of the sheep and pigs and only laughed a little as the great black goat who had seen several midsummer nights and stood on his guard made a sudden short run and butted down old hatto then skipped off like a chamois into the darkness unheeding the old rogue the whispers that connected his unlucky hue with the doings of the walpurgisnacht  but when it came to the horses eberhard could not well endure the sight of the endeavours to force them snorting rearing and struggling through anything so abhorrent to them as the hedge of fire  the schneiderlein with all the force of his powerful arm had hold of eberhards own young white mare who with ears turned back nostrils dilated and wild eyes her forefeet firmly planted wide apart was using her whole strength for resistance and when a heavy blow fell on her only plunged backwards and kicked without advancing  it was more than eberhard could endure and christinas impulse was to murmur o do not let him do it but this he scarcely heard as he exclaimed wait for me here and as he stepped forward sent his voice before him forbidding all blows to the mare  the creatures extreme terror ceased at once upon hearing his voice and there was an instant relaxation of all violence of resistance as he came up to her took her halter from the schneiderlein patted her glossy neck and spoke to her  but the tumult of warning voices around him assured him that it would be a fatal thing to spare the steed the passage through the fire and he strove by encouragements and caresses with voice and hand to get her forward leading her himself but the poor beast trembled so violently and though making a few steps forward stopped again in such exceeding horror of the flame that eberhard had not the heart to compel her turned her head away and assured her that she should not be further tormented  the gracious lordship is wrong said public opinion by the voice of old bauer ulrich the sacrificer of the horses head  heaven forfend that evil befall him and that mare in the course of the year  and the buzz of voices concurred in telling of the recusant pigs who had never developed into sausages the sheep who had only escaped to be eaten by wolves the mule whose bones had been found at the bottom of an abyss  old ursel was seriously concerned and would have laid hold on her young master to remonstrate but a fresh notion had arisenwould the gracious freiherr set arolling the wheel which was already being lighted in the fire and was to conclude the festivities by being propelled down the hillfiguring only that no one present knew it the suns declension from his solstitial height  eberhard made no objection and christina in her shelter by the cave felt no little dismay at being left alone there and moreover had a strange weird feeling at the wild uncanny ceremony he was engaged in not knowing indeed that it was sunworship but afraid that it could be no other than unholy sorcery  the wheel flaring or reddening in all its spokes was raised from the bonfire and was driven down the smoothest piece of green sward which formed an inclined plane towards the stream  if its course was smooth and it only became extinguished by leaping into the water the village would flourish and prosperity above all was expected if it should spring over the narrow channel and attempt to run up the other side  such things had happened in the days of the good freiherren ebbo and friedel though the wheel had never gone right since the present baron had been excommunicated but his heir having been twice seen at mass in this last month great hopes were founded upon him  there was a shout to clear the slope  eberhard in great earnest and some anxiety accepted the gauntlet that he was offered to protect his hand steadied the wheel therewith and with a vigorous impulse from hand and foot sent it bounding down the slope among loud cries and a general scattering of the idlers who had crowded full into the very path of the fiery circle which flamed up brilliantly for the moment as it met the current of air  but either there was an obstacle in the way or the young barons push had not been quite straight  the wheel suddenly swerved aside its course swerved to the right maugre all the objurgations addressed to it as if it had been a living thing and the next moment it had disappeared all but a smoky smouldering spot of red that told where it lay charring and smoking on its side without having fulfilled a quarter of its course  people drew off gravely and silently and eberhard himself was strangely discomfited when he came back to the hermitage and wrapping christina in his cloak prepared to return so soon as the glare of the fire should have faded from his eyesight enough to make it safe to tread so precipitous a path  he had indeed this day made a dangerous venture and both he and christina could not but feel disheartened by the issue of all the omens of the year the more because she had a vague sense of wrong in consulting or trusting them  it seemed to her all one frightened uncomprehended dream ever since her father had left her in the chapel and though conscious of her inability to have prevented her marriage yet she blamed herself felt despairing as she thought of the future and above all dreaded the baron and the baroness and their anger  eberhard after his first few words was silent and seemed solely absorbed in leading her safely along the rocky path sometimes lifting her when he thought her in danger of stumbling  it was one of the lightest shortest nights of the year and a young moon added to the brightness in open places while in others it made the rocks and stones cast strange elvish shadows  the distance was not entirely lost other beltane fires could be seen like beacons on every hill and the few lights in the castle shone out like red fiery eyes in its heavy dark pile of building  before entering eberhard paused pulled off his own weddingring and put it into his bosom and taking his brides hand in his did the same for her and bade her keep the ring till they could wear them openly  alas then said christina you would have this secret  unless i would have to seek thee down the oubliette my little one said eberhard or what might even be worse see thee burnt on the hillside for bewitching me with thine arts  no indeed my darling were it only my father i could make him love thee but my motheri could not trust her where she thought the honour of our house concerned  it shall not be for long  thou knowst we are to make peace with the kaiser and then will i get me employment among kurfurst albrechts companies of troops and then shalt thou prank it as my lady freiherrinn and teach me the ways of cities  alas  i fear me it has been a great sin sighed the poor little wife  for theethou couldst not help it said eberhard for mewho knows how many deadly ones it may hinder  cheer up little one no one can harm thee while the secret is kept  poor christina had no choice but submission but it was a sorry bridal evening to enter her husbands home in shrinking terror with the threat of the oubliette before her and with a sense of shame and deception hanging upon her making the wonted scowl of the old baroness cut her both with remorse and dread  she did indeed sit beside her bridegroom at the supper but how little like a bride even though he pushed the saltcellar as if by accident below her place  she thought of her myrtle tended in vain at home by barbara schmidt she thought of ulm courtships and how all ought to have been the solemn embassage to her uncle the stately negotiations the troth plight before the circle of ceremonious kindred and merry maidens of whom she had often been onethe subsequent attentions of the betrothed on all festival days the piles of linen and all plenishings accumulated since babyhood and all reviewed and laid out for general admiration ah poor aunt johanna still spinning away to add to the many webs in her walnut pressesthen the grand procession to fetch home the bride the splendid festival with the musicians dishes and guesttables to the utmost limit that was allowed by the city laws and the brides hair so joyously covered by her matrons curch amid the merriment of her companion maidens  poor child  after she had crept away to her own room glad that her father was not yet returned she wept bitterly over the wrong that she felt she had done to the kind uncle and aunt who must now look in vain for their little christina and would think her lost to them and to all else that was good  at least she had had the churchs blessingbut that strange to say was regarded in burgher life before the reformation as rather the ornament of a noble marriage than as essential to the civil contract and a marriage by a priest was regarded by the citizens rather as a means of eluding the need of obtaining the parents consent than as a more regular and devout manner of wedding  however christina felt this the one drop of peace  the blessings and prayers were warm at her heart and gave her hope  and as to drops of joy of them there was no lack for had not she now a right to love eberhard with all her heart and conscience and was not it a wonderful love on his part that had made him stoop to the little whitefaced burgher maid despised even by her own father  o better far to wear the maidens uncovered head for him than the myrtle wreath for any one else    chapter vii  the schneiderleins return    the poor little unowned bride had more to undergo than her imagination had conceived at the first moment  when she heard that the marriage was to be a secret she had not understood that eberhard was by no means disposed to observe much more caution than mere silence  a rough though kindly man he did not thoroughly comprehend the shame and confusion that he was bringing upon her by departing from his former demeanour  he knew that so enormous was the distance then supposed to exist between the noble and the burgher there was no chance of any one dreaming of the true state of the case and that as long as christina was not taken for his wife there was no personal danger for her from his mother whoso lax were the morals of the german nobility with regard to all of inferior rankwould tolerate her with complacency as his favourite toy and he was taken by surprise at the agony of grief and shame with which she slowly comprehended his assurance that she had nothing to fear  there was no help for it  the oubliette would probably be the portion of the lowborn girl who had interfered with the sixteen quarterings of the adlerstein shield and poor christina never stepped across its trapdoor without a shudder lest it should open beneath her  and her father would probably have been hung from the highest tower in spite of his shrewd care to be aware of nothing christina consoled herself with the hope that he knew all the time why he had been sent out of the way for with a broad grin that had made her blush painfully he had said he knew she would be well taken care of and that he hoped she was not breaking her heart for want of an escort  she tried to extort eberhards permission to let him at least know how it was but eberhard laughed saying he believed the old fox knew just as much as he chose and in effect sorel though now and then gratifying his daughters scruples by serving as a shield to her meetings with the young baron never allowed himself to hear a hint of the true state of affairs  eberhards love and reverence were undiminished and the time spent with him would have been perfectly happy could she ever have divested herself of anxiety and alarm but the periods of his absence from the castle were very terrible to her for the other women of the household quick to perceive that she no longer repelled him had lost that awe that had hitherto kept them at a distance from her and treated her with a familiarity sometimes coarse sometimes spiteful always hateful and degrading  even old ursel had become half pitying halfpatronizing and the old baroness though not molesting her took not the slightest notice of her  this state of things lasted much longer than there had been reason to expect at the time of the marriage  the two freiherren then intended to set out in a very short time to make their long talkedof submission to the emperor at ratisbon but partly from their german tardiness of movement partly from the obstinate delays interposed by the proud old freiherrinn who was as averse as ever to the measure partly from reports that the court was not yet arrived at ratisbon the expedition was again and again deferred and did not actually take place till september was far advanced  poor christina would have given worlds to go with them and even entreated to be sent to ulm with an avowal of her marriage to her uncle and aunt but of this eberhard would not hear  he said the ulmers would thus gain an hostage and hamper his movements and if her wedding was not to be confessedpoor childshe could better bear to remain where she was than to face hausfrau johanna  eberhard was fully determined to enrol himself in some troop either imperial or if not among the free companies among whom men of rank were often found and he would then fetch or send for his wife and avow her openly so soon as she should be out of his mothers reach  he longed to leave her father at home to be some protection to her but hugh sorel was so much the most intelligent and skilful of the retainers as to be absolutely indispensable to the partyhe was their only scribe and moreover his new suit of buff rendered him a creditable member of a troop that had been very hard to equip  it numbered about ten menatarms only three being left at home to garrison the castlenamely hatto who was too old to take hans who had been hopelessly lame and deformed since the old baron had knocked him off a cliff in a passion and squinting matz a runaway servant who had murdered his master the mayor of strasburg and might be caught and put to death if any one recognized him  if needful the villagers could always be called in to defend the castle but of this there was little or no dangerthe eagles steps were defence enough in themselves and the party were not likely to be absent more than a week or ten daysa grievous length of time poor christina thought as she stood straining her eyes on the top of the watchtower to watch them as far as possible along the plain  her heart was very sad and the omen of the burning wheel so continually haunted her that even in her sleep that night she saw its brief course repeated beheld its rapid fall and extinction and then tracked the course of the sparks that darted from it one rising and gleaming high in air till it shone like a star another pursuing a fitful and irregular but still bright course amid the dry grass on the hillside just as she had indeed watched some of the sparks on that night minding her of the words of the allhallowtide legend fulgebunt justi et tanquam scintillae in arundinete discurrenta sentence which remained with her when awake and led her to seek it out in her latin bible in the morning  reluctantly had she gone down to the noontide meal feeling though her husband and father were far less of guardians than they should have been yet that there was absolute rest peace and protection in their presence compared with what it was to be alone with freiherrinn kunigunde and her rude women without them  a few sneers on her daintiness and uselessness had led her to make an offer of assisting in the grand chopping of sausage meat and preparation of winter stores and she had been answered with contempt that my young lord would not have her soil her delicate hands when one of the maids who had been sent to fetch beer from the cellar came back with startled looks and the exclamation there is the schneiderlein riding up the eagles ladder upon freiherr ebbos white mare  all the women sprang up together and rushed to the window whence they could indeed recognize both man and horse and presently it became plain that both were stained with blood weary and spent indeed nothing but extreme exhaustion would have induced the manat arms to trust the tired stumbling horse up such a perilous path  loud were the exclamations ah no good could come of not leading that mare through the johannisfeuer  this shameful expedition  only harm could befall  this is thy doing thou mincing citygirl  all was certain to go wrong when a pale mist widow came into the place  the angry and dismayed cries all blended themselves in confusion in the ears of the only silent woman present the only one that sounded distinctly on her brain was that of the last speaker a pale mist widow as holding herself a little in the rear of the struggling jostling little mob of women who hardly made way even for their acknowledged lady she followed with failing limbs the universal rush to the entrance as soon as man and horse had mounted the slope and were lost sight of  a few moments more and the throng of expectants was at the foot of the hall steps just as the lanzknecht reached the arched entrance his comrade hans took his bridle and almost lifted him from his horse he reeled and stumbled as pale battered and bleeding he tried to advance to freiherinn kunigunde and in answer to her hasty interrogation faltered out ill news gracious lady  we have been set upon by the accursed schlangenwaldern and i am the only living man left  christina scarce heard even these last words senses and powers alike failed her and she sank back on the stone steps in a deathlike swoon  when she came to herself she was lying on her bed ursel and else another of the women busy over her and ursels voice was saying ah she is coming round  look up sweet lady and fear not  you are our gracious lady baroness  is he here  o has he said so  o let me see himsir eberhard faintly cried christina with sobbing breath  ah no no said the old woman but see here and she lifted up christinas powerless bloodless hand and showed her the ring on the finger  her bosom had been evidently searched when her dress was loosened in her swoon and her ring found and put in its place there you can hold up your head with the best of them he took care of thatmy dear young freiherr the boy that i nursed and the old womans burst of tears brought back the truth to christinas s reviving senses  oh tell me she said trying to raise herself was it indeed so o say it was not as he said  ah woes me woes me that it was even so lamented ursel but oh be still look not so wild dear lady  the dear truehearted young lord he spent his last breath in owning you for his true lady and in bidding us cherish you and our young baron that is to be  and the gracious lady belowshe owns you there is no fear of her now so vex not yourself dearest most gracious lady  christina did not break out into the wailing and weeping that the old nurse expected she was still far too much stunned and overwhelmed and she entreated to be told all lying still but gazing at ursel with piteous bewildered eyes  ursel and else helping one another out tried to tell her but they were much confused all they knew was that the party had been surprised at night in a village hostel by the schlangenwaldern and all slain though the young baron had lived long enough to charge the schneiderlein with his commendation of his wife to his mother but all particulars had been lost in the general confusion  oh let me see the schneiderlein implored christina by this time able to rise and cross the room to the large carved chair and ursel immediately turned to her underling saying tell the schneiderlein that the gracious lady baroness desires his presence  elses wooden shoes clattered down stairs but the next moment she returned  he cannot come he is quite spent and he will let no one touch his arm till ursel can come not even to get off his doublet  i will go to him said christina and revived by the sense of being wanted she moved at once to the turret where she kept some rag and some ointment which she had found needful in the latter stages of ermentrudes illnessindeed household surgery was a part of regular female education and christina had had plenty of practice in helping her charitable aunt so that the superiority of her skill to that of ursel had long been avowed in the castle  ursel made no objection further than to look for something that could be at once converted into a widows veilbeing in the midst of her grief quite alive to the need that no matronly badge should be omittedbut nothing came to hand in time and christina was descending the stairs on her way to the kitchen where she found the fugitive man atarms seated on a rough settle his head and wounded arm resting on the table while groans of pain weariness and impatience were interspersed with imprecations on the stupid awkward girls who surrounded him  pity and the instinct of affording relief must needs take the precedence even of the desire to hear of her husbands fate and as the girls hastily whispered here she is and the lanzknecht hastily tried to gather himself up and rise with tokens of respect she bade him remain still and let her see what she could do for him in fact she at once perceived that he was in no condition to give a coherent account of anything he was so completely worn out and in so much suffering  she bade at once that some water should be heated and some of the broth of the dinner set on the fire then with the shears at her girdle and her soft light fingers she removed the torn strip of cloth that had been wound round the arm and cut away the sleeve showing the arm not broken but gashed at the shoulder and thence the whole length grazed and wounded by the descent of the sword down to the wrist  so tender was her touch that he scarcely winced or moaned under her hand and when she proceeded with ursels help to bathe the wound with the warm water the relief was such that the wearied man absolutely slumbered during the process which christina protracted on that very account  she then dressed and bandaged the arm and proceeded to skimas no one else in the castle would dothe basin of soup with which she then fed her patient as he leant back in the corner of the settle at first in the same somnolent halfconscious state in which he had been ever since the relief from the severe pain but after a few spoonfuls the light and life came back to his eye and he broke out thanks thanks gracious lady  this is the lady baroness for me my young lord was the only wise man  thanks lady now am i my own man again  it had been long ere the old freiherrinn had done so much for me  i am your man lady for life or death  and before she knew what he was about the gigantic schneiderlein had slid down on his knees seized her hand and kissed itthe first act of homage to her rank but most startling and distressing to her  nay she faltered prithee do not thou must rest  only ifif thou canst only tell me if he my own dear lord sent me any greeting i would wait to hear the rest till thou hast slept  ah the dog of schlangenwald was the first answer then as he continued you see lady we had ridden merrily as far as jacob mullers hostel the traitor it became plain that he meant to begin at the beginning  she allowed ursel to seat her on the bench opposite to his settle and leaning forward heard his narrative like one in a dream  there the schneiderlein proceeded to say they put up for the night entirely unsuspicious of evil jacob muller who was known to himself as well as to sorel and to the others assuring them that the way was clear to ratisbon and that he heard the emperor was most favourably disposed to any noble who would tender his allegiance  jacobs liquors were brought out and were still in course of being enjoyed when the house was suddenly surrounded by an overpowering number of the retainers of schlangenwald with their count himself at their head  he had been evidently resolved to prevent the timely submission of the enemies of his race and suddenly presenting himself before the elder baron had challenged him to instantaneous battle claiming credit to himself for not having surprised them when asleep  the disadvantage had been scarcely less than if this had been the case for the adlersteinern were all halfintoxicated and far inferior in numbersat least on the showing of the schneiderleinand a desperate fight had ended by his being flung aside in a corner bound fast by the ankles and wrists the only living prisoner except his young lord who having several terrible wounds the worst in his chest was left unbound  both lay helpless untended and silent while the revel that had been so fatal to them was renewed by their captors who finally all sunk into a heavy sleep  the torches were not all spent and the moonlight shone into the room when the schneiderlein desperate from the agony caused by the ligature round his wounded arm sat up and looked about him  a knife thrown aside by one of the drunkards lay near enough to be grasped by his bound hands and he had just reached it when sir eberhard made a sign to him to put it into his hand and therewith contrived to cut the rope round both hands and feetthen pointed to the door  there was nothing to hinder an escape the men slept the sleep of the drunken but the schneiderlein with the rough fidelity of a retainer would have lingered with a hope of saving his master  but eberhard shook his head and signed again to escape then making him bend down close to him he used all his remaining power to whisper as he pressed his sword into the retainers hand   go home tell my motherall the worldthat christina sorel is my wife wedded on the friedmund wake by friar peter of offingen and if she should bear a child he is my true and lawful heir  my sword for himmy love to her  and if my mother would not be haunted by me let her take care of her  these words were spoken with extreme difficulty for the nature of the wound made utterance nearly impossible and each broken sentence cost a terrible effusion of blood  the final words brought on so choking and fatal a gush that said the schneiderlein he fell back as i tried to hold him up and i saw that it was all at an end and a kind and friendly master and lord gone from me  i laid him down and put his cross on his breast that i had seen him kissing many a time that evening and i crossed his hands and wiped the blood from them and his face  and lady he had put on his ring i trust the robber caitiffs may have left it to him in his grave  and so i came forth walking soft and opening the door in no small dread not of the snoring swine but of the dogs without  but happily they were still and even by the door i saw all our poor fellows stark and stiff  my father asked christina  ay with his head cleft open by the graf himself  he died like a true soldier lady and we have lost the best head among us in him well the knave that should have watched the horses was as drunken as the rest of them and i made a shift to put the bridle on the white mare and ride off  such was the narrative of the schneiderlein and all that was left to christina was the picture of her husbands dying effort to guard her and the haunting fancy of those long hours of speechless agony on the floor of the hostel and how direful must have been his fears for her  sad and overcome yet not sinking entirely while any work of comfort remained her heart yearned over her companion in misfortune the mother who had lost both husband and son and all her fears of the dread freiherrinn could not prevent her from bending her steps trembling and palpitating as she was towards the hall to try whether the daughterinlaws right might be vouchsafed to her of weeping with the elder sufferer  the freiherrinn sat by the chimney rocking herself to and fro and holding consultation with hatto  she started as she saw christina approaching and made a gesture of repulsion but with the feeling of being past all terror in this desolate moment christina stepped nearer knelt and clasping her hands said your pardon lady  pardon returned the harsh voice even harsher for very grief thou hast naught to fear girl  as things stand thou canst not have thy deserts  dost hear  ah lady it was not such pardon that i meant  if you would let me be a daughter to you  a daughter  a woodcarvers girl to be a daughter of adlerstein half laughed the grim baroness  come here wench and christina underwent a series of sharp searching questions on the evidences of her marriage  so ended the old lady since better may not be we must own thee for the nonce  hark ye all this is the frau freiherrinn freiherr eberhards widow to be honoured as such she added raising her voice  there girl thou hast what thou didst strive for  is not that enough  alas lady said christina her eyes swimming in tears i would fain have striven to be a comforter or to weep together  what to bewitch me as thou didst my poor son and daughter and wellnigh my lord himself  girl  girl  thou knowst i cannot burn thee now but away with thee try not my patience too far  and more desolate than ever the crushed and brokenhearted christina a widow before she had been owned a wife returned to the room that was now so full of memories as to be even more home than master gottfrieds gallery at ulm    chapter viii  passing the oubliette    who can describe the dreariness of being snowedup all the winter with such a motherinlaw as freiherrinn kunigunde  yet it was well that the snow came early for it was the best defence of the lonely castle from any attack on the part of the schlangenwaldern the swabian league or the next heir freiherr kasimir von adlerstein wildschloss  the elder baroness had at least the merit of a stout heart and even with her sadlyreduced garrison feared none of them  she had been brought up in the faith that adlerstein was impregnable and so she still believed and if the disaster that had cut off her husband and son was to happen at all she was glad that it had befallen before the homage had been paid  probably the schlangenwald count knew how tough a morsel the castle was like to prove and wildschloss was serving at a distance for nothing was heard of either during the short interval while the roads were still open  during this time an attempt had been made through father norbert to ascertain what had become of the corpses of the two barons and their followers and it had appeared that the count had carried them all off from the inn no doubt to adorn his castle with their limbs or to present them to the emperor in evidence of his zeal for order  the old baron could not indeed have been buried in consecrated ground nor have masses said for him but for the weal of her sons soul dame kunigunde gave some of her few ornaments and christina added her gold earrings and all her scanty purse that both her husband and father might be joined in the prayers of the churchtrying with all her might to put confidence in hugh sorels loretto relic and the indulgence he had bought and trusting with more consolatory thoughts to the ever stronger dawnings of good she had watched in her own eberhard  she had some consoling intercourse with the priest while all this was pending but throughout the winter she was entirely cut off from every creature save the inmates of the castle where as far as the old lady was concerned she only existed on sufferance and all her meekness and gentleness could not win for her more than the barest toleration  that eberhard had for a few hours survived his father and that thus the freiherrinn christina was as much the dowager baroness as kunigunde herself was often insisted on in the kitchen by ursel hatto and the schneiderlein whom christina had unconsciously rendered her most devoted servant not only by her daily care of his wound but by her kind courteous words and by her giving him his proper name of heinz dropping the absurd nom de guerre of the schneiderlein or little tailor which had been originally conferred on him in allusion to the valiant tailorling who boasted of having killed seven flies at a blow and had been carried on chiefly because of the contradiction between such a title and his huge brawny strength and fierce courage  poor eberhard with his undaunted bravery and free reckless goodnature a ruffian far more by education than by nature had been much loved by his followers  his widow would have reaped the benefit of that affection even if her exceeding sweetness had not gained it on her own account and this giant was completely gained over to her when amid all her sorrow and feebleness she never failed to minister to his sufferings to the utmost while her questions about his original home and revival of the name of his childhood softened him and awoke in him better feelings  he would have died to serve her and she might have headed an opposition party in the castle had she not been quite indifferent to all save her grief and except by sitting above the salt at the empty table she laid no claim to any honours or authority and was more seldom than ever seen beyond what was now called her own room  at last when for the second time she was seeing the snow wreaths dwindle and the drops shine forth in moisture again while the mountain paths were set free by the might of the springtide sun she spoke almost for the first time with authority as she desired heinz to saddle her mule and escort her to join in the easter mass at the blessed friedmunds chapel  ursel heaped up objections but so urgent was christina for confession and for mass that the old woman had not the heart to stop her by a warning to the elder baroness and took the alternative of accompanying her  it was a glorious sparkling easter day lovely blue sky above herbage and flowers glistening below snow dazzling in the hollows peasants assembling in holiday garb and all rejoicing  even the lonely widow in her heavy veil and black mufflings took hope back to her heart and smiled when at the church door a little child came timidly up to her with a maddertinted easter egga gift once again like the happy home customs of ulm  she gave the child a kissshe had nothing else to give but the sweet face sent it away strangely glad  the festival mass in all its exultation was not fully over when anxious faces began to be seen at the door and whisperings went round and many passed out  nobody at adlerstein was particular about silence in church and when the service was not in progress voices were not even lowered and after many attempts on the part of the schneiderlein to attract the attention of his mistress his voice immediately succeeded the ite missa est gracious lady we must begone  your mule is ready  there is a party at the debateable ford whether schlangenwald or wildschloss we know not yet but either way you must be the first thing placed in safety  christina turned deadly pale  she had long been ready to welcome death as a peaceful friend but sheltered as her girlhood had been in the quiet city she had never been brought in contact with warfare and her nervous timid temperament made the thought most appalling and frightful to her certain as she was that the old baroness would resist to the uttermost  father norbert saw her extreme terror and with the thought that he might comfort and support her perhaps mediate between the contending parties plead that it was holytide and proclaim the peace of the church or at the worst protect the lady herself he offered his company but though she thanked him it was as if she scarcely understood his kindness and a shudder passed over her whenever the serfs hastily summoned to augment the garrison came hurrying down the path or turned aside into the more rugged and shorter descents  it was strange the good father thought that so timorous and fragile a being should have her lot cast amid these rugged places and scenes of violence with no one to give her the care and cherishing she so much required  even when she crept up the castle stairs she was met with an angry rebuke not so much for the peril she had incurred as for having taken away the schneiderlein by far the most availing among the scanty remnant of the retainers of adlerstein  attempting no answer and not even daring to ask from what quarter came the alarm christina made her way out of the turmoil to that chamber of her own the scene of so much fear and sorrow and yet of some share of peace and happiness  but from the window near the fast subsiding waters of the debateable ford could plainly be seen the small troop of warriors of whom jobst the kohler had brought immediate intelligence  the sun glistened on their armour and a banner floated gaily on the wind but they were a fearful sight to the inmates of the lonely castle  a stout heart was however kunigundes best endowment and with the steadiness and precision of a general her commands rang out as she arranged and armed her garrison perfectly resolved against any submission and confident in the strength of her castle nay not without a hope of revenge either against schlangenwald or wildschloss whom as a degenerate adlerstein she hated only less than the slayer of her husband and son  the afternoon of easter day however passed away without any movement on the part of the enemy and it was not till the following day that they could be seen struggling through the ford and preparing to ascend the mountain  attacks had sometimes been disconcerted by posting men in the most dangerous passes but in the lack of numbers and of trustworthy commanders the freiherrinn had judged it wiser to trust entirely to her walls and keep her whole force within them  the new comers could hardly have had any hostile intentions for though well armed and accoutred their numbers did not exceed twenty five  the banner borne at their head was an azure one with a white eagle and their leader could be observed looking with amazement at the top of the watchtower where the same eagle had that morning been hoisted for the first time since the fall of the two freiherren  so soon as the ascent had been made the leader wound his horn and before the echoes had died away among the hills hatto acting as seneschal was demanding his purpose  i am kasimir von adlerstein wildschloss was the reply  i have hitherto been hindered by stress of weather from coming to take possession of my inheritance  admit me that i may arrange with the widowed frau freiherrinn as to her dower and residence  the widowed frau freiherrinn born of adlerstein returned hatto thanks the freiherr von adlerstein wildschloss but she holds the castle as guardian to the present head of the family the freiherr von adlerstein  it is false old man exclaimed the wildschloss the freiherr had no other son  no said hatto but freiherr eberhard hath left us twin heirs our young lords for whom we hold this castle  this trifling will not serve sternly spoke the knight  eberhard von adlerstein died unmarried  not so returned hatto our gracious frau freiherrinn the younger was wedded to him at the last friedmund wake by the special blessing of our good patron who would not see our house extinct  i must see thy lady old man said sir kasimir impatiently not in the least crediting the story and believing his cousin kunigunde quite capable of any measure that could preserve to her the rule in schloss adlerstein even to erecting some passing love affair of her sons into a marriage  and he hardly did her injustice for she had never made any inquiry beyond the castle into the validity of christinas espousals nor sought after the friar who had performed the ceremony  she consented to an interview with the claimant of the inheritance and descended to the gateway for the purpose  the court was at its cleanest the thawing snow having newly washed away its impurities and her proud figure under her black hood and veil made an imposing appearance as she stood tall and defiant in the archway  sir kasimir was a handsome man of about thirty of partly polish descent and endowed with slavonic grace and courtesy and he had likewise been employed in negotiations with burgundy and had acquired much polish and knowledge of the world  lady he said i regret to disturb and intrude on a mourning family but i am much amazed at the tidings i have heard and i must pray of you to confirm them  i thought they would confound you composedly replied kunigunde  and pardon me lady but the diet is very nice in requiring full proofs  i would be glad to learn what lady was chosen by my deceased cousin eberhard  the lady is christina daughter of his esquire hugh sorel of an honourable family at ulm  ha  i know who and what sorel was exclaimed wildschloss  lady cousin thou wouldst not stain the shield of adlerstein with owning aught that cannot bear the examination of the diet  sir kasimir said kunigunde proudly had i known the truth ere my sons death i had strangled the girl with mine own hands  but i learnt it only by his dying confession and had she been a beggars child she was his wedded wife and her babes are his lawful heirs  knowest thou timeplacewitnesses inquired sir kasimir  the time the friedmund wake the place the friedmund chapel replied the baroness  come hither schneiderlein  tell the knight thy young lords confession  he bore emphatic testimony to poor eberhards last words but as to the point of who had performed the ceremony he knew nothis mind had not retained the name  i must see the frau herself said wildschloss feeling certain that such a being as he expected in a daughter of the dissolute lanzknecht sorel would soon by dexterous questioning be made to expose the futility of her pretensions so flagrantly that even kunigunde could not attempt to maintain them  for one moment kunigunde hesitated but suddenly a look of malignant satisfaction crossed her face  she spoke a few words to squinting matz and then replied that sir kasimir should be allowed to satisfy himself but that she could admit no one else into the castle hers was a widows household the twins were only a few hours old and she could not open her gates to admit any person besides himself  so resolved on judging for himself was adlerstein wildschloss that all this did not stagger him for even if he had believed more than he did of the old ladys story there would have been no sense of intrusion or impropriety in such a visit to the mother  indeed had christina been living in the civilized world her chamber would have been hung with black cloth black velvet would have enveloped her up to the eyes and the blackest of cradles would have stood ready for her fatherless babe two steps in honour of her baronial rank would have led to her bed and a beaufet with the due baronial amount of gold and silver plate would have held the comfits and caudle to be dispensed to all visitors  as it was the two steps built into the floor of the room and the black hood that ursel tied over her young mistresss head were the only traces that such etiquette had ever been heard of  but when baron kasimir had clanked up the turret stairs each step bringing to her many a memory of him who should have been there and when he had been led to the bedside he was completely taken by surprise  instead of the great flatfaced coarse comeliness of a german wench treated as a lady in order to deceive him he saw a delicate lilylike face white as ivory and the soft sweet brown eyes under their drooping lashes so full of innocence and sad though thankful content that he felt as if the inquiries he came to make were almost sacrilege  he had seen enough of the world to know that no agent in a clumsy imposition would look like this pure white creature with her arm encircling the two little swaddled babes whose red faces and bald heads alone were allowed to appear above their mummylike wrappings and he could only make an obeisance lower and infinitely more respectful than that with which he had favoured the baroness nee von adlerstein with a few words of inquiry and apology  but christina had her sons rights to defend now and she had far more spirit to do so than ever she had had in securing her own position and a delicate rose tint came into her cheek as she said in her soft voice the baroness tells me that you noble sir would learn who wedded me to my dear and blessed lord sir eberhard  it was friar peter of the franciscan brotherhood of offingen an agent for selling indulgences  two of his lay brethren were present  my dear lord gave his own name and mine in full after the holy rite the friar promising his testimony if it were needed  he is to be found or at least heard of at his own cloister and the hermit at the chapel likewise beheld a part of the ceremony  enough enough lady replied sir kasimir forgive me for having forced the question upon you  nay replied christina with her blush deepening it is but just and due to us all and her soft eyes had a gleam of exultation as she looked at the two little mummies that made up the usi would have all inquiries made in full  they shall be made lady as will be needful for the establishment of your sons right as a free baron of the empire but not with any doubt on my part or desire to controvert that right  i am fully convinced and only wish to serve you and my little cousins  which of them is the head of our family he added looking at the two absolutely undistinguishable little chrysalises so exactly alike that christina herself was obliged to look for the black ribbon on which a medal had been hung round the neck of the elder  sir kasimir put one knee to the ground as he kissed the red cheek of the infant and the white hand of the mother  lady cousin he said to kunigunde who had stood by all this time with an anxious uneasy scowling expression on her face i am satisfied  i own this babe as the true freiherr von adlerstein and far be it from me to trouble his heritage  rather point out the way in which i may serve you and him  shall i represent all to the emperor and obtain his wardship so as to be able to protect you from any attacks by the enemies of the house  thanks sir returned the elder lady severely seeing christinas gratified imploring face  the right line of adlerstein can take care of itself without greedy guardians appointed by usurpers  our submission has never been made and the emperor cannot dispose of our wardship  and kunigunde looked defiant regarding herself and her grandson as quite as good as the emperor and ready to blast her daughterinlaw with her eyes for murmuring gratefully and wistfully thanks noble sir thanks  let me at least win a friendly right in my young cousins said sir kasimir the more drawn by pitying admiration towards their mother as he perceived more of the grandmothers haughty repulsiveness and want of comprehension of the dangers of her position  they are not baptized  let me become their godfather  christinas face was all joy and gratitude and even the grandmother made no objection in fact it was the babes only chance of a noble sponsor and father norbert who had already been making ready for the baptism was sent for from the hall  kunigunde meantime moved about restlessly went halfway down the stairs and held council with some one there ursel likewise bustled about and sir kasimir remained seated on the chair that had been placed for him near christinas bed  she was able again to thank him and add it may be that you will have more cause than the lady grandmother thinks to remember your offer of protection to my poor orphans  their father and grandfather were in very deed on their way to make submission  that is well known to me said sir kasimir  lady i will do all in my power for you  the emperor shall hear the state of things and while no violence is offered to travellers he added lowering his tone i doubt not he will wait for full submission till this young baron be of age to tender it  we are scarce in force to offer violence said christina sighing i have no power to withstand the lady baroness  i am like a stranger here but oh sir if the emperor and diet will be patient and forbearing with this desolate house my babes if they live shall strive to requite their mercy by loyalty  and the blessing of the widow and fatherless will fall on you most generous knight she added fervently holding out her hand  i would i could do more for you said the knight  ask and all i can do is at your service  ah sir cried christina her eyes brightening there is one most inestimable service you could render meto let my uncle master gottfried the woodcarver of ulm know where i am and of my state and of my children  sir kasimir repeated the name  yes she said  there was my home there was i brought up by my dear uncle and aunt till my father bore me away to attend on the young lady here  it is eighteen months since they had any tidings from her who was as a daughter to them  i will see them myself said kasimir i know the name  carved not master gottfried the stallwork at augsburg  yes indeed  in chestnut leaves  and the misereres all with fairy tales exclaimed christina  oh sir thanks indeed  bear to the dear dear uncle and aunt their childs duteous greetings and tell them she loves them with all her heart and prays them to forgive her and to pray for her and her little ones  and she added my uncle may not have learnt how his brother my father died by his lords side  oh pray him if ever he loved his little christina to have masses sung for my father and my own dear lord  as she promised ursel came to make the babes ready for their baptism and sir kasimir moved away towards the window  ursel was looking uneasy and dismayed and as she bent over her mistress she whispered lady the schneiderlein sends you word that matz has called him to help in removing the props of the door you wot of when he yonder steps across it  he would know if it be your will  the oubliette  this was frau kunigundes usage of the relative who was doing his best for the welfare of her grandsons  christinas whole countenance looked so frozen with horror that ursel felt as if she had killed her on the spot but the next moment a flash of relief came over the pale features and the trembling lip commanded itself to say my best thanks to good heinz  say to him that i forbid it if he loves the life of his masters children he will abstain  tell him so  my blessings on him if this knight leave the castle safe ursel and her terrified earnest eyes impelled ursel to hasten to do her bidding but whether it had been executed there was no knowing for almost immediately the freiherrinn and father norbert entered and ursel returned with them  nay the message given who could tell if heinz would be able to act upon it  in the ordinary condition of the castle he was indeed its most efficient inmate matz did not approach him in strength hans was a cripple hatto would be on the right side but jobst the kohler and the other serfs who had been called in for the defence were more likely to hold with the elder than the younger lady  and frau kunigunde herself knowing well that the fiveandtwenty men outside would be incompetent to avenge their master confident in her narrowminded ignorant pride that no one could take schloss adlerstein and incapable of understanding the changes in society that were rendering her isolated condition untenable was certain to scout any representation of the dire consequences that the crime would entail  kasimir had no near kindred and private revenge was the only justice the baroness believed in she only saw in her crime the satisfaction of an old feud and the union of the wildschloss property with the parent stem  seldom could such a christening have taken place as that of which christinas bedroom was the scenethe mother scarcely able even to think of the holy sacrament for the horror of knowing that the one sponsor was already exulting in the speedy destruction of the other and poor little feeble thing rallying the last remnants of her severelytried powers to prevent the crime at the most terrible of risks  the elder babe received from his grandmother the hereditary name of eberhard but sir kasimir looked at the mother inquiringly ere he gave the other to the priest  christina had wellnigh said oubliette but recalling herself in time she feebly uttered the name she had longed after from the moment she had known that two sons had been her easter gift gottfried after her beloved uncle  but kunigunde caught the sound and exclaimed no son of adlerstein shall bear abase craftsmans name  call him racher the avenger and in the word there already rang a note of victory and revenge that made christinas blood run cold  sir kasimir marked her trouble the lady mother loves not the sound he said kindly  lady have you any other wish  then will i call him friedmund  christina had almost smiled  to her the omen was of the best  baron friedmund had been the last common ancestor of the two branches of the family the patron saint was so called his wake was her wedding day the sound of the word imported peace and the good barons ebbo and friedel had ever been linked together lovingly by popular memory and so the second little baron received the name of friedmund and then the knight of wildschloss perceiving with consideration rare in a warrior that the mother looked worn out and feverish at once prepared to kiss her hand and take leave  one more favour sir knight she said lifting up her head while a burning spot rose on either cheek  i beg of you to take my two babes downyes both both in your own arms and show them to your men owning them as your kinsmen and godsons  sir kasimir looked exceedingly amazed as if he thought the ladys senses taking leave of her and dame kunigunde broke out into declarations that it was absurd and she did not know what she was talking of but she repeated almost with passion take them take them you know not how much depends on it  ursel with unusual readiness of wit signed and whispered that the young mother must be humoured for fear of consequences till the knight in a good natured confused way submitted to receive the two little bundles in his arms while he gave place to kunigunde who hastily stepped before him in a manner that made christina trust that her precaution would be effectual  the room was reeling round with her  the agony of those few minutes was beyond all things unspeakable  what had seemed just before like a certain way of saving the guest without real danger to her children now appeared instead the most certain destruction to all and herself the unnatural mother who had doomed her newborn babes for a strangers sake  she could not even pray she would have shrieked to have them brought back but her voice was dead within her her tongue clave to the roof of her mouth ringings in her ears hindered her even from listening to the descending steps  she lay as one dead when ten minutes afterwards the cry of one of her babes struck on her ear and the next moment ursel stood beside her laying them down close to her and saying exultingly safe safe out at the gate and down the hillside and my old lady ready to gnaw off her hands for spite    chapter ix  the eaglets    christinas mental and bodily constitution had much similarity apparently most delicate tender and timid yet capable of a vigour health and endurance that withstood shocks that might have been fatal to many apparently stronger persons  the events of that frightful easter monday morning did indeed almost kill her but the effects though severe were not lasting and by the time the last of ermentrudes snowwreath had vanished she was sunning her babes at the window happier than she had ever thought to beabove all in the possession of both the children  a nurse had been captured for the little baron from the village on the hillside but the woman had fretted the child had pined and had been given back to his mother to save his life and ever since both had thriven perfectly under her sole care so that there was very nearly joy in that room  outside it there was more bitterness than ever  the grandmother had softened for a few moments at the birth of the children with satisfaction at obtaining twice as much as she had hoped but the frustration of her vengeance upon kasimir of adlerstein wildschloss had renewed all her hatred and she had no scruple in abusing the burgherwoman to the whole household for her artful desire to captivate another nobleman  she no doubt expected that degenerate fool of a wildschlosser to come wooing after her if he did he should meet his deserts  it was the favourite reproach whenever she chose to vent her fury on the mute blushing weeping young widow whose glance at her babies was her only appeal against the cruel accusation  on midsummer eve heinz the schneiderlein who had all day been taking toll from the various attendants at the friedmund wake came up and knocked at the door  he had a bundle over his shoulder and a bag in his hand which last he offered to her  the toll  it is for the lady baroness  you are my lady baroness  i levy toll for this my young lord  take it to her good heinz she must have the charge and needless strife i will not breed  the angry notes of dame kunigunde came up  how now knave schneiderlein  come down with the toll instantly  it shall not be tampered with  down i say thou thief of a tailor  go prithee go vex her not entreated christina  coming lady shouted heinz and disregarding all further objurgations from beneath he proceeded to deposit his bundle and explain that it had been entrusted to him by a pedlar from ulm who would likewise take charge of anything she might have to send in return and he then ran down just in time to prevent a domiciliary visit from the old lady  from ulm  the very sound was joy and christina with trembling hands unfastened the cords and stitches that secured the canvas covering within which lay folds on folds of linen and in the midst a rich silver goblet long ago brought by her father from italy a few of her own possessions and a letter from her uncle secured with black floss silk with a black seal  she kissed it with transport but the contents were somewhat chilling by their grave formality  the opening address to the honourworthy lady baroness and loveworthy niece conveyed to her a doubt on good master gottfrieds part whether she were still truly worthy of love or honour  the slaughter at jacob mullers had been already known to him and he expressed himself as relieved but greatly amazed at the information he had received from the baron of adlerstein wildschloss who had visited him at ulm after having verified what had been alleged at schloss adlerstein by application to the friar at offingen  freiherr von adlerstein wildschloss had further requested him to make known that feudbriefs having regularly passed between schlangenwald and adlerstein and the two barons not having been within the peace of the empire no justice could be exacted for their deaths yet in consideration of the tender age of the present heirs the question of forfeiture or submission should be waived till they could act for themselves and schlangenwald should be withheld from injuring them so long as no molestation was offered to travellers  it was plain that sir kasimir had well and generously done his best to protect the helpless twins and he sent respectful but cordial greetings to their mother  these however were far less heeded by her than the coldness of her uncles letter  she had drifted beyond the reckoning of her kindred and they were sending her her property and bridal linen as if they had done with her and had lost their child in the robber barons wife  yet at the end there was a touch of old times in offering a blessing should she still value it and the hopes that heaven and the saints would comfort her for surely thou poor child thou must have suffered much and if thou wiliest still to write to thy city kin thine aunt would rejoice to hear that thou and thy babes were in good health  precise grammarian and scribe as was uncle gottfried the lapse from the formal sie to the familiar du went to his nieces heart whenever her little ones left her any leisure she spent this her first weddingday in writing so earnest and loving a letter as in spite of mediaeval formality must assure the good burgomaster that except in having suffered much and loved much his little christina was not changed since she had left him  no answer could be looked for till another wakeday but when it came it was full and loving and therewith were sent a few more of her favourite books a girdle and a richlyscented pair of gloves together with two ivory boxes of comfits and two little purple silk goldedged straight narrow garments and tight round brimless lace caps for the two little barons  nor did henceforth a wakeday pass by without bringing some such token not only delightful as gratifying christinas affection by the kindness that suggested them but supplying absolute wants in the dire stress of poverty at schloss adlerstein  christina durst not tell her motherinlaw of the terms on which they were unmolested trusting to the scantiness of the retinue and to her own influence with the schneiderlein to hinder any serious violence  indeed while the count of schlangenwald was in the neighbourhood his followers took care to secure all that could be captured at the debateable ford and the broken forces of adlerstein would have been insane had they attempted to contend with such superior numbers  that the castle remained unattacked was attributed by the elder baroness to its own merits nor did christina undeceive her  they had no intercourse with the outer world except that once a pursuivant arrived with a formal intimation from their kinsman the baron of adlerstein wildschloss of his marriage with the noble fraulein countess valeska von trautbach and a present of a gay dagger for each of his godsons  frau kunigunde triumphed a good deal over the notion of christinas supposed disappointment but the tidings were most welcome to the younger lady who trusted they would put an end to all future taunts about wildschloss  alas the handle for abuse was too valuable to be relinquished  the last silver cup the castle had possessed had to be given as a reward to the pursuivant and mayhap frau kunigunde reckoned this as another offence of her daughterinlaw since had sir kasimir been safe in the oubliette the twins might have shared his broad lands on the danube instead of contributing to the fees of his pursuivant the cup could indeed be ill spared  the cattle and swine the dues of the serfs and the yearly toll at the wake were the sole resources of the household and though there was no lack of meat milk and black bread sufficient garments could scarce be come by with all the spinning of the household woven by the village webster of whose time the baronial household by prescriptive right owned the lions share  these matters little troubled the two beings in whom christinas heart was wrapped up  though running about barefooted and bareheaded they were healthy handsome straightlimbed noble looking creatures so exactly alike and so inseparable that no one except herself could tell one from the other save by the medal of our lady worn by the elder and the little cross carved by the mother for the younger indeed at one time the urchins themselves would feel for cross or medal ere naming themselves ebbo or friedel  they were tall for their age but with the slender make of their foreign ancestry and though their fair rosy complexions were brightened by mountain mists and winds their rapidly darkening hair and large liquid brown eyes told of their italian blood  their grandmother looked on their colouring as a taint and christina herself had hoped to see their fathers simple kindly blue eyes revive in his boys but she could hardly have desired anything different from the dancing kindling or earnest glances that used to flash from under their long black lashes when they were nestling in her lap or playing by her knee making music with their prattle or listening to her answers with faces alive with intelligence  they scarcely left her time for sorrow or regret  they were never quarrelsome  either from the influence of her gentleness or from their absolute union they could do and enjoy nothing apart and would as soon have thought of their right and left hands falling out as of ebbo and friedel disputing  ebbo however was always the right hand  the freiherr as he had been called from the first had from the time he could sit at the table at all been put into the baronial chair with the eagle carved at the back every member of the household from his grandmother downwards placed him foremost and friedel followed their example at the less loss to himself as his hand was always in ebbos and all their doings were in common  sometimes however the mother doubted whether there would have been this perfect absence of all contest had the medal of the firstborn chanced to hang round friedmunds neck instead of eberhards  at first they were entirely left to her  their grandmother heeded them little as long as they were healthy and evidently regarded them more as heirs of adlerstein than as grandchildren but as they grew older she showed anxiety lest their mother should interfere with the fierce lawless spirit proper to their line  one winter day when they were nearly six years old christina spinning at her window had been watching them snowballing in the castle court smiling and applauding every large handful held up to her every laughing combat every wellaimed hit as the hardy little fellows scattered the snow in showers round them raising their merry furcapped faces to the bright eyes that rained influence and judged the prize  by and by they stood still ebboshe knew him by the tossed head and commanding airwas proposing what friedel seemed to disapprove but after a short discussion ebbo flung away from him and went towards a shed where was kept a wolfcub recently presented to the young barons by old ulrichs son  the whelp was so young as to be quite harmless but it was far from amiable friedel never willingly approached it and the snarling and whining replies to all advances had begun to weary and irritate ebbo  he dragged it out by its chain and tethering it to a post made it a mark for his snowballs which kneaded hard and delivered with hearty goodwill by his sturdy arms made the poor little beast yelp with pain and terror till the more tenderhearted friedel threw himself on his brother to withhold him while matz stood by laughing and applauding the baron seeing ebbo shake friedel off with unusual petulance and pitying the tormented animal christina flung a cloak round her head and hastened down stairs entering the court just as the terrified whelp had made a snap at the boy which was returned by angry vindictive pelting not merely with snow but with stones  friedel sprang to her crying and her call to ebbo made him turn though with fury in his face shouting he would bite me the evil beast  come with me ebbo she said  he shall suffer for it the spiteful ungrateful brute  let me alone mother cried ebbo stamping on the snow but still from habit yielding to her hand on his shoulder  what now demanded the old baroness appearing on the scene  who is thwarting the baron  she she will not let me deal with yonder savage whelp cried the boy  she  take thy way child said the old lady  visit him well for his malice  none shall withstand thee here  at thy peril she added turning on christina  what art not content to have brought base mechanical blood into a noble house  wouldst make slaves and cowards of its sons  i would teach them true courage not cruelty she tried to say  what should such as thou know of courage  look here girl  another word to daunt the spirit of my grandsons and ill have thee scourged down the mountainside  on  at him ebbo  thats my gallant young knight  out of the way girl with thy whining looks  what friedel be a man and aid thy brother  has she made thee a puling woman already  and kunigunde laid an ungentle grasp upon friedmund who was clinging to his mother hiding his face in her gown  he struggled against the clutch and would not look up or be detached  fie poor little coward taunted the old lady never heed him ebbo my brave baron  cut to the heart christina took refuge in her room and gathered her friedel to her bosom as he sobbed out oh mother the poor little wolf  oh mother are you weeping too  the grandmother should not so speak to the sweetest dearest motherling he added throwing his arms round her neck  alas friedel that ebbo should learn that it is brave to hurt the weak  it is not like walther of vogelwiede said friedel whose mind had been much impressed by the minnesingers bequest to the birds  nor like any true christian knight  alas my poor boys must you be taught foul cruelty and i too weak and cowardly to save you  that never will be said friedel lifting his head from her shoulder  hark what a howl was that  listen not dear child it does but pain thee  but ebbo is not shouting  oh mother he is vexedhe is hurt cried friedel springing from her lap but ere either could reach the window ebbo had vanished from the scene  they only saw the young wolf stretched dead on the snow and the same moment in burst ebbo and flung himself on the floor in a passion of weeping stimulated by the applause of his grandmother and of matz he had furiously pelted the poor animal with all missiles that came to hand till a blow either from him or matz had produced such a howl and struggle of agony and then such terrible stillness as had gone to the young barons very heart a heart as soft as that of his father had been by nature  indeed his sobs were so piteous that his mother was relieved to hear only the wolf the poor wolf and to find that he himself was unhurt and she was scarcely satisfied of this when dame kunigunde came up also alarmed and thus turned his grief to wrath  as if i would cry in that way for a bite he said  go grandame you made me do it the poor beast with a fresh sob  ulrich shall get thee another cub my child  no no i never will have another cub  why did you let me kill it  for shame ebbo  weep for a spiteful brute  thats no better than thy mother or friedel  i love my mother  i love friedel  they would have withheld me go go i hate you  peace peace ebbo exclaimed his mother you know not what you say  ask your grandmothers pardon  peace thou fool screamed the old lady  the baron speaks as he will in his own castle  he is not to be checked here and thwarted there and taught to mince his words like a capinhand pedlar pardon  when did an adlerstein seek pardon  come with me my baron i have still some honeycakes  not i replied ebbo honeycakes will not cure the wolf whelp go  i want my mother and friedel  alone with them his pride and passion were gone but alas what augury for the future of her boys was left with the mother    chapter x  the eagles prey    it fell about the lammas tide when moor men win their hay  that all the serfs of adlerstein were collected to collect their ladys hay to be stored for the winters fodder of the goats and of poor sir eberhards old white mare the only steed as yet ridden by the young barons  the boys were fourteen years old  so monotonous was their mothers life that it was chiefly their growth that marked the length of her residence in the castle  otherwise there had been no change except that the elder baroness was more feeble in her limbs and still more irritable and excitable in temper  there were no events save a few hunting adventures of the boys or the yearly correspondence with ulm and the same life continued of shrinking in dread from the old ladys tyrannous dislike and of the constant endeavour to infuse better principles into the boys without the open opposition for which there was neither power nor strength  the boys love was entirely given to their mother  far from diminishing with their dependence on her it increased with the sense of protection and now that they were taller than herself she seemed to be cherished by them more than ever  moreover she was their oracle  quickwitted and activeminded loving books the more because their grandmother thought signing a feudletter the utmost literary effort becoming to a noble they never rested till they had acquired all that their mother could teach them or rather they then became more restless than ever  long ago had her whole store of tales and ballads become so familiar by repetition that the boys could correct her in the smallest variation reading and writing were mastered as for pleasure and the nuremberg chronicle with its wonderful woodcuts excited such a passion of curiosity that they must needs conquer its latin and read it for themselves  this world history with alexander and the nine worthies the cities and landscapes and the oftrepeated portraits was eberhards study but friedmund continuedconstant to walther of vogelweide  eberhard cared for no character in the vulgate so much as for judas the maccabee but friedmunds heart was all for king david and to both lads shut up from companionship as they were every acquaintance in their books was a living being whose like they fancied might be met beyond their mountain  and when they should go forth like dietrich of berne in search of adventures doughty deeds were chiefly to fall to the lot of ebbos lance while friedel was to be their minnesinger and indeed certain verses that he had murmured in his brothers ear had left no doubt in ebbos mind that the exploits would be worthily sung  the soft dreamy eye was becoming friedels characteristic as fire and keenness distinguished his brothers glance  when at rest the twins could be known apart by their expression though in all other respects they were as alike as ever and let ebbo look thoughtful or friedel eager and they were again undistinguishable and indeed they were constantly changing looks  had not friedel been beside him ebbo would have been deemed a wondrous student for his years had not ebbo been the standard of comparison friedel would have been in high repute for spirit and enterprise and skill as a cragsman with the crossbow and in all feats of arms that the schneiderlein could impart  they shared all occupations and it was by the merest shade that ebbo excelled with the weapon and friedel with the book or tool  for the artist nature was in them not intentionally excited by their mother but far too strong to be easily discouraged  they had long daily gazed at ulm in the distance hoping to behold the spire completed and the illustrations in their mothers books excited a strong desire to imitate them  the floor had often been covered with charcoal outlines even before christina was persuaded to impart the rules she had learnt from her uncle and her carvingtools were soon seized upon  at first they were used only upon knobs of sticks but one day when the boys roaming on the mountain had lost their way and coming to the convent had been there hospitably welcomed by father norbert they came home wild to make carvings like what they had seen in the chapel  jobst the kohler was continually importuned for soft wood the fair was ransacked for knives and even the old baroness could not find great fault with the occupation base and mechanical though it were which disposed of the two restless spirits during the many hours when winter storms confined them to the castle  rude as was their work the constant observation and choice of subjects were an unsuspected training and softening  it was not in vain that they lived in the glorious mountain fastness and saw the sun descend in his majesty dyeing the masses of rock with purple and crimson not in vain that they beheld peak and ravine clothed in purest snow flushed with rosy light at morn and eve or contrasted with the purple blue of the sky or that they stood marvelling at ice caverns with gigantic crystal pendants shining with the most magical pure depths of sapphire and emerald as if said friedel winter kept in his service all the jewelforging dwarfs of the motherlings tales and when the snow melted and the buds returned the ivy spray the smiling saxifrage the purple gentian bell the feathery rowan leaf the symmetrical ladys mantle were hailed and loved first as models then for themselves  one regret their mother had almost amounting to shame  every virtuous person believed in the efficacy of the rod and maugre her own docility she had been chastised with it almost as a religious duty but her sons had never felt the weight of a blow except once when their grandmother caught them carving a border of eagles and doves round the hall table and then ebbo had returned the blow with all his might  as to herself if she ever worked herself up to attempt chastisement the baroness was sure to fall upon her for insulting the noble birth of her sons and thus gave them a triumph far worse for them than impunity  in truth the boys had their own way or rather the baron had his way and his way was baron friedmunds  poor bare and scanty as were all the surroundings of their life everything was done to feed their arrogance with only one influence to counteract their education in pride and violencea mothers influence indeed but her authority was studiously taken from her and her position set at naught with no power save what she might derive from their love and involuntary honour and the sight of the pain caused her by their wrongdoings  and so the summers hayharvest was come  peasants clambered into the green nooks between the rocks to cut down with hook or knife the flowery grass for there was no space for the sweep of a scythe  the best crop was on the bank of the braunwasser by the debateable ford but this was cut and carried on the backs of the serfs much earlier than the mountain grass and never without much vigilance against the schlangenwaldern but this year the count was absent at his styrian castle and little had been seen or heard of his people  the full muster of serfs appeared for frau kunigunde admitted of no excuses and the sole absentee was a widow who lived on the ledge of the mountain next above that on which the castle stood  her son reported her to be very ill and with tears in his eyes entreated baron friedel to obtain leave for him to return to her since she was quite alone in her solitary hut with no one even to give her a drink of water  friedel rushed with the entreaty to his grandmother but she laughed it to scorn  lazy koppel only wanted an excuse or if not the woman was old and useless and men could not be spared  ah good grandame said friedel his father died with ours  the more honour for him  the more he is bound to work for us  off junker make no loiterers  grieved and discomfited friedel betook himself to his mother and brother  foolish lad not to have come to me said the young baron  where is he  ill send him at once  but christina interposed an offer to go and take koppels place beside his mother and her skill was so much prized over all the mountainside that the alternative was gratefully accepted and she was escorted up the steep path by her two boys to the hovel where she spent the day in attendance on the sick woman  evening came on the patient was better but koppel did not return nor did the young barons come to fetch their mother home  the last sunbeams were dying off the mountaintops and beginning to suspect something amiss she at length set off and half way down met koppel who replied to her question ah then the gracious lady has not heard of our luck  excellent booty and two prisoners  the young baron has been a hero indeed and has won himself a knightly steed and on her further interrogation he added that an unusually rich but small company had been reported by jobst the kohler to be on the way to the ford where he had skilfully prepared a stumblingblock the gracious baroness had caused hatto to jodel all the haymakers together and they had fallen on the travellers by the straight path down the crag  ach did not the young baron spring like a young gemsbock  and in midstream down came their packhorses and their wares  some of them took to flight but pfui there were enough for my young lord to show his mettle upon  such a prize the saints have not sent since the old barons time  christina pursued her walk in dismay at this new beginning of freebooting in its worst form overthrowing all her hopes  the best thing that could happen would be the immediate interference of the swabian league while her sons were too young to be personally held guilty  yet this might involve ruin and confiscation and apart from all consequences she bitterly grieved that the stain of robbery should have fallen on her hitherto innocent sons  every peasant she met greeted her with praises of their young lord and when she mounted the hallsteps she found the floor strewn with bales of goods  mother cried ebbo flying up to her have you heard  i have a horse a spirited bay a knightly charger and friedel is to ride him by turns with me  where is friedel  and mother heinz said i struck as good a stroke as any of them and i have a sword for friedel now  why does he not come  and motherling this is for you a gown of velvet a real black velvet that will make you fairer than our lady at the convent  come to the window and see it mother dear  the boy was so joyously excited that she could hardly withstand his delight but she did not move  dont you like the velvet he continued  we always said that the first prize we won the motherling should wear velvet  do but look at it  woe is me my ebbo she sighed bending to kiss his brow  he understood her at once coloured and spoke hastily and in defiance  it was in the river mother the horses fell it is our right  fairly ebbo she asked in a low voice  nay mother if jobst did hide a branch in midstream it was no doing of mine and the horses fell  the schlangenwaldern dont even wait to let them fall  we cannot live if we are to be so nice and dainty  ah my son i thought not to hear you call mercy and honesty mere niceness  what do i hear exclaimed frau kunigunde entering from the storeroom where she had been disposing of some spices a much esteemed commodity  are you chiding and daunting this boy as you have done with the other  my mother may speak to me cried ebbo hotly turning round  and quench thy spirit with whining fooleries  take the barons bounty woman and vex him not after his first knightly exploit  heaven knows and ebbo knows said the trembling christina that were it a knightly exploit i were the first to exult  thou thou craftsmans girl dost presume to call in question the knightly deeds of a noble house  there cried the furious baroness striking her face  now dare to be insolent again  her hand was uplifted for another blow when it was grasped by eberhard and the next moment he likewise held the other hand with youthful strength far exceeding hers  she had often struck his mother before but not in his presence and the greatness of the shock seemed to make him cool and absolutely dignified  be still grandame he said  no mother i am not hurting her and indeed the surprise seemed to have taken away her rage and volubility and unresistingly she allowed him to seat her in a chair still holding her arm he made his clear boyish voice resound through the hall saying retainers all know that as i am your lord and master so is my honoured mother lady of the castle and she is never to be gainsayed let her say or do what she will  you are right herr freiherr said heinz  the frau christina is our gracious and beloved dame  long live the freiherrinn christina and the voices of almost all the serfs present mingled in the cry  and hear you all continued eberhard she shall rule all and never be trampled on more  grandame you understand  the old woman seemed confounded and cowered in her chair without speaking  christina almost dismayed by this silence would have suggested to ebbo to say something kind or consoling but at that moment she was struck with alarm by his renewed inquiry for his brother  friedel  was not he with thee  no i never saw him  ebbo flew up the stairs and shouted for his brother then coming down gave orders for the men to go out on the mountainside and search and jodel  he was hurrying with them but his mother caught his arm  o ebbo how can i let you go  it is dark and the crags are so perilous  mother i cannot stay and the boy flung his arms round her neck and whispered in her ear friedel said it would be a treacherous attack and i called him a craven  oh mother we never parted thus before  he went up the hillside  oh where is he  infected by the boys despairing voice yet relieved that friedel at least had withstood the temptation christina still held ebbos hand and descended the steps with him  the clear blue sky was fast showing the stars and into the evening stillness echoed the loud wide jodeln cast back from the other side of the ravine  ebbo tried to raise his voice but broke down in the shout and choked with agitation said let me go mother  none know his haunts as i do  hark she said only grasping him tighter  thinner shriller clearer came a faraway cry from the heights and ebbo thrilled from head to foot then sent up another pealing mountain shout responded to by a jodel so pitched as to be plainly not an echo  towards the red eyrie said hans  he will have been to the ptarmigans pool said ebbo sending up his voice again in hopes that the answer would sound less distant but instead of this its intonations conveyed to these adepts in mountain language that friedel stood in need of help  depend upon it said the startled ebbo that he has got up amongst those rocks where the dead chamois rolled down last summer then as christina uttered a faint cry of terror heinz added fear not lady those are not the jodeln of one who has met with a hurt  baron friedel has the sense to be patient rather than risk his bones if he cannot move safely in the dark  up after him said ebbo emitting a variety of shouts intimating speedy aid and receiving a halloo in reply that reassured even his mother  equipped with a rope and sundry torches of pinewood heinz and two of the serfs were speedily ready and christina implored her son to let her come so far as where she should not impede the others he gave her his arm and heinz held his torch so as to guide her up a winding path not in itself very steep but which she could never have climbed had daylight shown her what it overhung  guided by the constant exchange of jodeln they reached a height where the wind blew cold and wild and ebbo pointed to an intensely black shadow overhung by a peak rising like the gable of a house into the sky yonder lies the tarn he said  dont stir  this way lies the cliff  friedmund exchanging the jodel for the name  herethis way  under the red eyrie called back the wanderer and steering their course round the rocks above the pool the rescuers made their way towards the base of the peak which was in fact the summit of the mountain the top of the eagles ladder the highest step of which they had attained  the peak towered over them and beneath the castle lights seemed as if it would be easy to let a stone fall straight down on them  friedels cry seemed to come from under their feet  i am here  i am safe only it grew so dark that i durst not climb up or down  the schneiderlein explained that he would lower down a rope which when fastened round friedels waist would enable him to climb safely up and after a breathless space the torchlight shone upon the longedfor face and friedel springing on the path cried the motherand here   oh friedel where have you been  what is this in your arms  he showed them the innocent face of a little white kid  whence is it friedel  he pointed to the peak saying i was lying on my back by the tarn when my lady eagle came sailing overhead so low that i could see this poor little thing and hear it bleat  thou hast been to the eyriethe inaccessible eyrie exclaimed ebbo in amazement  thats a mistake  it is not hard after the first said friedel  i only waited to watch the old birds out again  robbed the eagles  and the young ones  well said friedmund as if half ashamed they were twin eaglets and their mother had left them and i felt as though i could not harm them so i only bore off their provisions and stuck some feathers in my cap  but by that time the sun was down and soon i could not see my footing and when i found that i had missed the path i thought i had best nestle in the nook where i was and wait for day  i grieved for my mothers fear but oh to see her here  ah friedel didst do it to prove my words false interposed ebbo eagerly  what words  thou knowest  make me not speak them again  oh those said friedel only now recalling them  no verily they were but a moments anger  i wanted to save the kid  i think it is old mother rikas white kid  but oh motherling  i grieve to have thus frightened you  not a single word passed between them upon ebbos exploits  whether friedel had seen all from the heights or whether he intuitively perceived that his brother preferred silence he held his peace and both were solely occupied in assisting their mother down the pass the difficulties of which were far more felt now than in the excitement of the ascent only when they were near home and the boys were walking in the darkness with arms round one anothers necks christina heard friedel say low and rather sadly i think i shall be a priest ebbo  to which ebbo only answered pfui  christina understood that friedel meant that robbery must be a severance between the brothers  alas had the moment come when their paths must diverge  could ebbos step not be redeemed  ursel reported that dame kunigunde had scarcely spoken again but had retired like one stunned into her bed  friedel was half asleep after the exertions of the day but ebbo did not speak and both soon betook themselves to their little turret chamber within their mothers  christina prayed long that night her heart full of dread of the consequence of this transgression  rumours of freebooting castles destroyed by the swabian league had reached her every wake day and if this outrage were once known the sufferance that left adlerstein unmolested must be over  there was hope indeed in the weakness and uncertainty of the government but present safety would in reality be the ruin of ebbo since he would be encouraged to persist in the career of violence now unhappily begun  she knew not what to ask save that her sons might be shielded from evil and might fulfil that promise of her dream the star in heaven the light on earth  and for the presentthe good god guide her and her sons through the difficult morrow and turn the heart of the unhappy old woman below  when exhausted with weeping and watching she rose from her knees she stole softly into her sons turret for a last look at them generally they were so much alike in their sleep that even she was at fault between them but that night there was no doubt  friedel pale after the days hunger and fatigue slept with relaxed features in the most complete calm but though ebbos eyes were closed there was no repose in his facehis hair was tossed his colour flushed his brow contracted the arm flung across his brother had none of the ease of sleep  she doubted whether he were not awake but knowing that he would not brook any endeavour to force confidence he did not offer she merely hung over them both murmured a prayer and blessing and left them    chapter xi  the choice in life    friedel wake  is it day said friedel slowly wakening and crossing himself as he opened his eyes  surely the sun is not up  we must be before the sun said ebbo who was on his feet beginning to dress himself  hush and come  do not wake the mother  it must be ere she or aught else be astir  thy prayersi tell thee this is a work as good as prayer  half awake and entirely bewildered friedel dipped his finger in the pearl mussel shell of holy water over their bed and crossed his own brow and his brothers then carrying their shoes they crossed their mothers chamber and crept down stairs  ebbo muttered to his brother stand thou still there and pray the saints to keep her asleep and then with bare feet moved noiselessly behind the wooden partition that shut off his grandmothers boxbedstead from the rest of the hall  she lay asleep with open mouth snoring loudly and on her pillow lay the bunch of castle keys that was always carried to her at night  it was a moment of peril when ebbo touched it but he had nerved himself to be both steady and dexterous and he secured it without a jingle and then without entering the hall descended into a passage lit by a rough opening cut in the rock  friedel who began to comprehend followed him close and joyfully and at the first door he fitted in and with some difficulty turned a key and pushed open the door of a vault where morning light streaming through the grated window showed two captives who had started to their feet and now stood regarding the pair in the doorway as if they thought their dreams were multiplying the young baron who had led the attack  signori began the principal of the two but ebbo spoke  sir you have been brought here by a mistake in the absence of my mother the lady of the castle  if you will follow me i will restore all that is within my reach and put you on your way  the merchants knowledge of german was small but the purport of the words was plain and he gladly left the damp chilly vault  ebbo pointed to the bales that strewed the hall  take all that can be carried he said  here is your sword and your purse he said for these had been given to him in the moment of victory  i will bring out your horse and lead you to the pass  give him food whispered friedel but the merchant was too anxious to have any appetite  only he faltered in broken german a proposal to pay his respects to the signora castellana to whom he owed so much  no  dormit in lecto said ebbo with a sudden inspiration caught from the latinized sound of some of the italian words but colouring desperately as he spoke  the latin proved most serviceable and the merchant understood that his property was restored and made all speed to gather it together and transport it to the stable  one or two of his beasts of burden had been lost in the fray and there were more packages than could well be carried by the merchant his servant and his horse  ebbo gave the aid of the old white marenow very white indeedand in truth the boys pitied the merchants fine young bay for being put to base trading uses and were rather shocked to hear that it had been taken in payment for a knights branched velvet gown and would be sold again at ulm  what a poor coxcomb of a knight said they to one another as they patted the creatures neck with such fervent admiration that the merchant longed to present it to them when he saw that the old white mare was the sole steed they possessed and watched their tender guidance both of her and of the bay up the rocky path so familiar to them  but ah signorini miei i am an infelice infelicissimo ever persecuted by le fate  by whom  a count like schlangenwald asked ebbo  das schicksal whispered friedel  three long miserable years did i spend as a captive among the moors having lost all my ships and all i had and being forced to row their galleys gli scomunicati  galleys exclaimed ebbo there are some pictured in our world history before carthage  would that i could see one  the signorino would soon have seen his fill were he between the decks chained to the bench for weeks together without ceasing to row for twentyfour hours together with a renegade standing over to lash us or to put a morsel into our mouths if we were fainting  the dogs  do they thus use christian men cried friedel  si sija wohl  there were a good fourscore of us and among them a tedesco a good man and true from whom i learnt la lingua loro  our tonguefrom whom asked one twin of the other  a tedesco a fellowcountryman of sue eccellenze  deutscher cried both boys turning in horror our germans so treated by the pagan villains  yea truly signorini miei  this fellowcaptive of mine was a cavaliere in his own land but he had been betrayed and sold by his enemies and he mourned piteously for la sposa suahis bride as they say here  a goodly man and a tall piteously cramped in the narrow deck i grieved to leave him there when the good confraternita at genoa paid my ransom  having learnt to speak il tedesco and being no longer able to fit out a vessel i made my venture beyond the alps but alas till this moment fortune has still been adverse my mules died of the toil of crossing the mountains and when with reduced baggage i came to the river beneath therewhen my horses fell and my servants fled and the peasants came down with their hayforksi thought myself in hands no better than those of the moors themselves  it was wrongly done said ebbo in an honest open tone though blushing  i have indeed a right to what may be stranded on the bank but never more shall foul means be employed for the overthrow  the boys had by this time led the traveller through the gemsbocks pass within sight of the convent  there said ebbo will they give you harbourage food a guide and a beast to carry the rest of your goods  we are now upon convent land and none will dare to touch your bales so i will unload old schimmel  ah signorino if i might offer any token of gratitude  nay said ebbo with boyish lordliness make me not a spoiler  if the signorini should ever come to genoa continued the trader and would honour gian battista dei battiste with a call his whole house would be at their feet  thanks i would that we could see strange lands said ebbo  but come friedel the sun is high and i locked them all into the castle to make matters safe  may the liberated captive know the name of his deliverers that he may commend it to the saints asked the merchant  i am eberhard freiherr von adlerstein and this is freiherr friedmund my brother  farewell sir  strange muttered the merchant as he watched the two boys turn down the pass strange how like one barbarous name is to another eberardo  that was what we called il tedesco and when he once told me his family name it ended in stino but all these foreign names sound alike  let us speed on lest these accursed peasants should wake and be beyond the control of the signorino  ah sighed ebbo as soon as he had hurried out of reach of the temptation small use in being a baron if one is to be no better mounted  thou art glad to have let that fair creature go free though said friedel  nay my mothers eyes would let me have no rest in keeping him otherwisetalk not to me of gladness friedel  thou shouldst know better  how is one to be a knight with nothing to ride but a beast old enough to be his grandmother  knighthood of the heart may be content to go afoot said friedel oh ebbo what a brother thou art  how happy the mother will be  pfui friedel what boots heart without spur  i am sick of being mewed up here within these walls of rock  no sport not even with falling on a traveller  i am worse off than ever were my forefathers  but how is it  i cannot understand asked friedel  what has changed thy mind  thou and the mother and more than all the grandame  listen friedel  when thou camest up in all the whirl of eagerness and glad preparation with thy grave face and murmur that jobst had put forked stakes in the stream it was past mans endurance to be baulked of the fray  thou hast forgotten what i said to thee then good friedel  long since  no doubt i thrust in vexatiously  not so said ebbo and i saw thou hadst reason for the stakes were most maliciously planted with long branches hid by the current but the fellows were showing fight and i could not stay to think then or i should have seemed to fear them  i can tell you we made them run  but i never meant the grandmother to put yon poor fellow in the dungeon and use him worse than a dog  i wot that he was my captive and none of hers  and then came the mother and oh friedel she looked as if i were slaying her when she saw the spoil and ere i had made her see right and reason the old lady came swooping down in full malice and spite and actually came to blows she struck the motherlingstruck her on the face friedel  i fear me it has so been before said friedel sadly  never will it be so again said ebbo standing still  i took the old hag by the hands and told her she had ruled long enough  my fathers wife is as good a lady of the castle as my grandfathers and i myself am lord thereof and since my lady kunigunde chooses to cross me and beat my mother about this capture why she has seen the last of it and may learn who is master and who is mistress  oh ebbo  i would i had seen it  but was not she outrageous  was not the mother shrinking and ready to give back all her claims at once  perhaps she would have been but just then she found thou wast not with me and i found thou wast not with her and we thought of nought else  but thou must stand by me friedel and help to keep the grandmother in her place and the mother in hers  if the mother will be kept said friedel  i fear me she will only plead to be left to the grandames treatment as before  never friedel  i will never see her so used again  i released this man solely to show that she is to rule hereyes i know all about freebooting being a deadly sin and moreover that it will bring the league about our ears and it was a cowardly trick of jobst to put those branches in the stream  did i not go over it last night till my brain was dizzy  but still it is but living and dying like our fathers and i hate tameness or dullness and it is like a fool to go back from what one has once begun  no it is like a brave man when one has begun wrong said friedel  but then i thought of the grandame triumphing over the gentle motherand i know the mother wept over her beads half the night she shall find she has had her own way for once this morning  friedel was silent for a few moments then said let me tell thee what i saw yesterday ebbo  so answered the other brother  i liked not to vex my mother by my tidings so i climbed up to the tarn  there is something always healing in that spot is it not so ebbo  when the grandmother has been raving hitherto friedels worst grievance it is like getting up nearer the quiet sky in the stillness there when the sky seems to have come down into the deep blue water and all is so still so wondrous still and calm  i wonder if when we see the great dome kirk itself it will give ones spirit wings as does the gazing up from the ptarmigans pool  thou minnesinger was it the blue sky thou hadst to tell me of  no brother it was ere i reached it that i saw this sight  i had scaled the peak where grows the stunted rowan and i sat down to look down on the other side of the gorge  it was clear where i sat but the ravine was filled with clouds and upon them  the shape of the blessed friedmund thy patron  our patron said friedel i saw him a giant form in gown and hood traced in grey shadow upon the dazzling white cloud and oh ebbo he was struggling with a thinner darker wilder shape bearing a club  he strove to withhold it his gestures threatened and warned  i watched like one spellbound for it was to me as the guardian spirit of our race striving for thee with the enemy  how did it end  the cloud darkened and swallowed them nor should i have known the issue if suddenly on the very cloud where the strife had been there had not beamed forth a rainbownot a common rainbow ebbo but a perfect ring a softglancing manytinted crown of victory  then i knew the saint had won and that thou wouldst win  i  what not thyselfhis own namesake  i thought ebbo if the fight went very hardnay if for a time the grandame led thee her waythat belike i might serve thee best by giving up all and praying for thee in the hermits cave or as a monk  thouthou my other self  aid me by burrowing in a hole like a rat  what foolery wilt say next  no no friedel strike by my side and i will strike with thee pray by my side and i will pray with thee but if thou takest none of the strokes then will i none of the prayers  ebbo thou knowest not what thou sayest  no one knows better  see friedel wouldst thou have me all that the old adlersteinen were and worse too then wilt thou leave me and hide thine head in some priestly cowl  maybe thou thinkest to pray my soul into safety at the last moment as a favour to thine own abundant sanctity but i tell thee friedel thats no manly way to salvation  if thou followst that track ill take care to get past the borderline within which prayer can help  friedel crossed himself and uttered an imploring exclamation of horror at these wild words  stay said ebbo i said not i meant any such thingso long as thou wilt be with me  my purpose is to be a good man and true a guard to the weak a defence against the turk a good lord to my vassals and if it may not be otherwise i will take my oath to the kaiser and keep it  is that enough for thee friedel or wouldst thou see me a monk at once  oh ebbo this is what we ever planned  i only dreamed of the other whenwhen thou didst seem to be on the other track  well what can i do more than turn back  ill get absolution on sunday and tell father norbert that i will do any penance he pleases and warn jobst that if he sets any more traps in the river i will drown him there next  only get this priestly fancy away friedel once and for ever  never never could i think of what would sever us cried friedel savewhen he added hesitating unwilling to harp on the former string  ebbo broke in imperiously  friedmund von adlerstein give me thy solemn word that i never again hear of this freak of turning priest or hermit  what art slow to speak  thinkest me too bad for thee  no ebbo  heaven knows thou art stronger more resolute than i  i am more likely to be too bad for thee  but so long as we can be true faithful godfearing junkern together heaven forbid that we should part  it is our bond said ebbo nought shall part us  nought but death said friedmund solemnly  for my part said ebbo with perfect seriousness i do not believe that one of us can live or die without the other  but hark theres an outcry at the castle  they have found out that they are locked in  ha ho hilloa hatto how like you playing prisoner  ebbo would have amused himself with the dismay of his garrison a little longer had not friedel reminded him that their mother might be suffering for their delay and this suggestion made him march in hastily  he found her standing drooping under the pitiless storm which frau kunigunde was pouring out at the highest pitch of her cracked trembling voice one hand uplifted and clenched the other grasping the back of a chair while her whole frame shook with rage too mighty for her strength  grandame said ebbo striding up to the scene of action cease remember my words yestereve  she has stolen the keys  she has tampered with the servants  she has released the prisonerthy prisoner ebbo  she has cheated us as she did with wildschloss  false burgherinn  i trow she wanted another suitor  banepest of adlerstein  friedmund threw a supporting arm round his mother but ebbo confronted the old lady  grandmother he said i freed the captive  i stole the keysi and friedel  no one else knew my purpose  he was my captive and i released him because he was foully taken  i have chosen my lot in life he added and standing in the middle of the hall he took off his cap and spoke gravely i will not be a treacherous robberoutlaw but so help me god a faithful loyal godly nobleman  his mother and friedel breathed an amen with all their hearts and he continued  and thou grandame peace  such reverence shalt thou have as befits my fathers mother but henceforth mine own ladymother is the mistress of this castle and whoever speaks a rude word to her offends the freiherr von adlerstein  that last days work had made a great step in ebbos life and there he stood grave and firm ready for the assault for in effect he and all besides expected that the old lady would fly at him or at his mother like a wild cat as she would assuredly have done in a like case a year earlier but she took them all by surprise by collapsing into her chair and sobbing piteously  ebbo much distressed tried to make her understand that she was to have all care and honour but she muttered something about ingratitude and continued to exhaust herself with weeping spurning away all who approached her and thenceforth she lived in a gloomy sullen acquiescence in her deposition  christina inclined to the opinion that she must have had some slight stroke in the night for she was never the same woman again her vigour had passed away and she would sit spinning or rocking herself in her chair scarcely alive to what passed or scolding and fretting like a shadow of her old violence  nothing pleased her but the attentions of her grandsons and happily she soon ceased to know them apart and gave ebbo credit for all that was done for her by friedel whose separate existence she seemed to have forgotten  as long as her old spirit remained she would not suffer the approach of her daughterinlaw and christina could only make suggestions for her comfort to be acted on by ursel and though the reins of government fast dropped from the aged hands they were but gradually and cautiously assumed by the younger baroness  only elsie remained of the rude demoralized girls whom she had found in the castle and their successors though dull and uncouth were meek and manageable the men of the castle had all except matz been always devoted to the frau christina and matz to her great relief ran away so soon as he found that decency and honesty were to be the rule  old hatto humpbacked hans and heinz the schneiderlein were the whole male establishment and had at least the merit of attachment to herself and her sons and in time there was a shade of greater civilization about the castle though impeded both by dire poverty and the doggedness of the old retainers  at least the court was cleared of the swine and within doors the table was spread with dainty linen out of the parcels from ulm and the meals served with orderliness that annoyed the boys at first but soon became a subject of pride and pleasure  frau kunigunde lingered long with increasing infirmities  after the winter day when running down at a sudden noise friedel picked her up from the hearthstone scorched bruised almost senseless she accepted christinas care with nothing worse than a snarl and gradually seemed to forget the identity of her nurse with the interloping burgher girl  thanks or courtesy had been no part of her nature least of all towards her own sex and she did little but grumble fret and revile her attendant but she soon depended so much on christinas care that it was hardly possible to leave her at her best and strongest her talk was maundering abuse of her sons lowborn wife but at times her wanderings showed black gulfs of iniquity and coarseness of soul that would make the gentle listener tremble and be thankful that her sons were out of hearing  and thus did christina von adlerstein requite fifteen years of persecution  the old ladys first failure had been in the summer of 1488 it was the advent season of 1489 when the snow was at the deepest and the frost at the hardest that the two hardy mountaineer grandsons fetched over the pass father norbert and a still sturdier stronger monk to the dying woman  are we in time mother asked ebbo from the door of the upper chamber where the adlersteins began and ended life shaking the snow from his mufflings  ruddy with exertion in the sharp wind what a contrast he was to all within the room  who is that said a thin feeble voice  it is ebbo  it is the baron said christina  come in ebbo  she is somewhat revived  will she be able to speak to the priest asked ebbo  priest feebly screamed the old woman  no priest for me  my lord died unshriven unassoilzied  where he is there will i be  let a priest approach me at his peril  stony insensibility ensued nor did she speak again though life lasted many hours longer  the priests did their office for impenitent as the life and frantic as the words had been the opinions of the time deemed that their rites might yet give the departing soul a chance though the body was unconscious  when all was over snow was again falling shifting and drifting so that it was impossible to leave the castle and the two monks were kept there for a full fortnight during which christmas solemnities were observed in the chapel for the first time since the days of friedmund the good  the corpse of kunigunde preservedwe must say the wordsalted was placed in a coffin and laid in that chapel to await the melting of the snows when the vault at the hermitage could be opened  and this could not be effected till easter had nearly come round again and it was within a week of their sixteenth birthday that the two young barons stood together at the coffins head serious indeed but more with the thought of life than of death    chapter xii  back to the dovecote    for the first time in her residence at adlerstein now full half her life the freiherrinn christina ventured to send a messenger to ulm namely a lay brother of the convent of st ruprecht who undertook to convey to master gottfried sorel her letter informing him of the death of her motherinlaw and requesting him to send the same tidings to the freiherr von adlerstein wildschloss the kinsman and godfather of her sons  she was used to wait fiftytwo weeks for answers to her letters and was amazed when at the end of three two stout servingmen were guided by jobst up the pass but her heart warmed to their flat caps and round jerkins they looked so like home  they bore a letter of invitation to her and her sons to come at once to her uncles house the king of the romans and perhaps the emperor were to come to the city early in the summer and there could be no better opportunity of presenting the young barons to their sovereign  sir kasimir of adlerstein wildschloss would meet them there for the purpose and would obtain their admission to the league in which all swabian nobles had bound themselves to put down robbery and oppression and outside which there was nothing but outlawry and danger  so must it be said ebbo between his teeth as he leant moodily against the wall while his mother was gone to attend to the fare to be set before the messengers  what art not glad to take wing at last exclaimed friedel cut short in an exclamation of delight  take wing forsooth  to be guest of a greasy burgher and call cousin with him  fear not friedel ill not vex the motherling heaven knows she has had pain grief and subjection enough in her lifetime and i would not hinder her visit to her home but i would she could go alone nor make us show our poverty to the swollen city folk and listen to their endearments  i charge thee friedel do as i do be not too familiar with them  could we but sprain an ankle over the crag  nay she would stay to nurse us said friedel laughing besides thou art needed for the matter of homage  look friedel said ebbo sinking his voice i shall not lightly yield my freedom to king or kaiser  maybe there is no help for it but it irks me to think that i should be the last lord of adlerstein to whom the title of freiherr is not a mockery  why dost bend thy brow brother  what art thinking of  only a saying in my mothers book that wellordered service is true freedom said friedel  and methinks there will be freedom in rushing at last into the great faroffthe boys eye expanded and glistened with eagerness  here are we prisonersto ourselves if you likebut prisoners still pent up in the rocks seeing no one hearing scarce an echo from the knightly or the poet world nor from all the wonders that pass  and the world has a history going on still like the chronicle  oh ebbo think of being in the midst of life with lance and sword and seeing the kaiserthe kaiser of the holy roman empire  with lance and sword well and good but would it were not at the cost of liberty  however ebbo forbore to damp his mothers joy save by the one warningunderstand mother that i will not be pledged to anything i will not bend to the yoke ere i have seen and judged for myself  the manly sound of the words gave a sweet sense of exultation to the mother even while she dreaded the proud spirit and whispered god direct thee my son  certainly ebbo hitherto the most impetuous and least thoughtful of the two lads had a gravity and seriousness about him that but for his naturally sweet temper would have seemed sullen  his aspirations for adventure had hitherto been more vehement than friedels but when the time seemed at hand his regrets at what he might have to yield overpowered his hopes of the future  the fierce haughtiness of the old adlersteins could not brook the descent from the crag even while the keen clear burgher wit that ebbo inherited from the other side of the house taught him that the position was untenable and that his isolated glory was but a poor mean thing after all  and the struggle made him sad and moody  friedel less proud and with nothing to yield was open to blithe anticipations of what his fancy pictured as the home of all the beauty sacred or romantic that he had glimpsed at through his mother  religion poetry learning art refinement had all come to him through her and though he had a soul that dreamt and soared in the lonely grandeur of the mountain heights it craved further aliment for its yearnings for completeness and perfection  long ago had friedel come to the verge of such attainments as he could work out of his present materials and keen had been his ardour for the means of progress though only the mountain tarn had ever been witness to the full outpouring of the longings with which he gazed upon the dim distant city like a land of enchantment  the journey was to be at once so as to profit by the escort of master sorels men  means of transport were scanty but ebbo did not choose that the messengers should report the need and bring back a bevy of animals at the burghers expense so the mother was mounted on the old white mare and her sons and heinz trusted to their feet by setting out early on a may morning the journey could be performed ere night and the twilight would find them in the domains of the free city where their small numbers would be of no importance  as to their appearance the mother wore a black woollen gown and mantle and a black silk hood tied under her chin and sitting loosely round the stiff frame of her white capa nunlike garb save for the soft brown hair parted over her brow and more visible than she sometimes thought correct but her sons would not let her wear it out of sight  the brothers had piece by piece surveyed the solitary suit of armour remaining in the castle but though it might serve for defence it could not be made fit for display and they must needs be contented with blue cloth spun woven dyed fashioned and sewn at home chiefly by their mother and by her embroidered on the breast with the white eagle of adlerstein  short blue cloaks and caps of the same with an eagle plume in each and leggings neatly fashioned of deerskin completed their equipments  ebbo wore his fathers sword friedel had merely a dagger and crossbow  there was not a gold chain not a brooch not an approach to an ornament among the three except the medal that had always distinguished ebbo and the coral rosary at christinas girdle  her own trinkets had gone in masses for the souls of her father and husband and though a few costly jewels had been found in frau kunigundes hoards the mode of their acquisition was so doubtful that it had seemed fittest to bestow them in alms and masses for the good of her soul  what ornament what glory could any one desire better than two such sons thought christina as for the first time for eighteen years she crossed the wild ravine where her father had led her a trembling little captive longing for wings like a doves to flutter home again  who would then have predicted that she should descend after so long and weary a time and with a gallant boy on either side of her eager to aid her every step and reassure her at each giddy pass all joy and hope before her and them  yet she was not without some dread and misgiving as she watched her elder son always attentive to her but unwontedly silent with a stern gravity on his young brow a proud sadness on his lip  and when he had come to the debateable ford and was about to pass the boundaries of his own lands he turned and gazed back on the castle and mountain with a silent but passionate ardour as though he felt himself doing them a wrong by perilling their independence  the sun had lately set and the moon was silvering the danube when the travellers came full in view of the imperial free city girt in with mighty walls and towersthe vineclad hill dominated by its crowning church the irregular outlines of the unfinished spire of the cathedral traced in mysterious dark lacework against the pearly sky the lofty steeplelike gatetower majestically guarding the bridge  christina clasped her hands in thankfulness as at the familiar face of a friend friedel glowed like a minstrel introduced to his fair dame long wooed at a distance ebbo could not but exclaim yea truly a great city is a solemn and a glorious sight  the gates were closed and the servingmen had to parley at the barbican ere the heavy door was opened to admit the party to the bridge between deep battlemented stone walls with here and there loopholes showing the shimmering of the river beneath  the slow tired tread of the old mare sounded hollow the river rushed below with the full swell of evening loudness a deeptoned conventbell tolled gravely through the stillness while between its reverberations clear distinct notes of joyous music were borne on the summer wind and a nightingale sung in one of the gardens that bordered the banks  mother it is all that i dreamt breathlessly murmured friedel as they halted under the dark arch of the great gateway tower  not however in friedels dreams had been the hearty voice that proceeded from the lighted guardroom in the thickness of the gateway  freiherrinn von adlerstein  is it she  then must i greet my old playmate  and the captain of the watch appeared among upraised lanterns and torches that showed a broad smooth plump face beneath a plain steel helmet  welcome gracious lady welcome to your old city  what do you not remember lippus grundt your poor valentine  master philip grundt exclaimed christina amazed at the breadth of visage and person and how fares it with my good regina  excellent well good lady  she manages her trade and house as well as the good man bartolaus fleischer himself  blithe will she be to show you her goodly ten as i shall my eight he continued walking by her side and barbarayou remember barbara schmidt lady  my dear barbarathat do i indeed  is she your wife  ay truly lady he answered in an odd sort of apologetic tone you see you returned not and the housefathers they would have it soand barbara is a good housewife  truly do i rejoice said christina wishing she could convey to him how welcome he had been to marry any one he liked as far as she was concernedhe in whom her fears of mincing goldsmiths had always taken formthen signing with her hand i have my sons likewise to show her  ah on foot muttered grundt as a not wellconceived apology for not having saluted the young gentlemen  i greet you well sirs with a bow most haughtily returned by ebbo who was heartily wishing himself on his mountain  two lusty wellgrown junkern indeed to whom my martin will be proud to show the humours of ulm  a fair good night lady  you will find the old folks right cheery  well did christina know the turn down the street darkened by the overhanging brows of the tall houses but each lower window laughing with the glow of light within that threw out the heavy mullions and the circles and diamonds of the latticework and here and there the brilliant tints of stained glass sparkled like jewels in the upper panes pictured with scripture scene patron saint or trade emblem the familiar porch was reached the familiar knock resounded on the ironstudded door  friedel lifted his mother from her horse and felt that she was quivering from head to foot and at the same moment the light streamed from the open door on the white horse and the two young faces one eager the other with knit brows and uneasy eyes  a kind of echo pervaded the house she is come she is come and as one in a dream christina entered crossed the wellknown hall looked up to her uncle and aunt on the stairs perceived little change on their countenances and sank upon her knees with bowed head and clasped hands  my child my dear child exclaimed her uncle raising her with one hand and crossing her brow in benediction with the other  art thou indeed returned and he embraced her tenderly  welcome fair niece said hausfrau johanna more formally  i am right glad to greet you here  dear dear mother cried christina courting her fond embrace by gestures of the most eager affection how have i longed for this moment and above all to show you my boys  herr uncle let me present my sonsmy eberhard my friedmund  o housemother are not my twins wellgrown lads  and she stood with a hand on each proud that their heads were so far above her own and looking still so slight and girlish in figure that she might better have been their sister than their mother  the cloud that the sudden light had revealed on ebbos brow had cleared away and he made an inclination neither awkward nor ungracious in its free mountain dignity and grace but not devoid of mountain rusticity and shy pride and far less cordial than was friedels manner  both were infinitely relieved to detect nothing of the greasy burgher and were greatly struck with the fine venerable head before them indeed friedel would like his mother have knelt to ask a blessing had he not been under command not to outrun his brothers advances towards her kindred  welcome fair junkern said master gottfried welcome both for your mothers sake and your own  these thy sons my little one he added smiling  art sure i neither dream nor see double  come to the gallery and let me see thee better  and ceremoniously giving his hand he proceeded to lead his niece up the stairs while ebbo labouring under ignorance of city forms and uncertainty of what befitted his dignity presented his hand to his aunt with an air that halfamused halfoffended the shrewd dame  all is as if i had left you but yesterday exclaimed christina uncle have you pardoned me  you bade me return when my work was done  i should have known better child  such return is not to be sought on this side the grave  thy work has been more than i then thought of  ah and now will you deem it begunnot done softly said christina though with too much heartfelt exultation greatly to doubt that all the world must be satisfied with two such boys if only ebbo would be his true self  the luxury of the house the wainscoted and tapestried walls the polished furniture the lamps and candles the damask linen the rich array of silver pewter and brightlycoloured glass were a great contrast to the bare walls and scant necessaries of schloss adlerstein but ebbo was resolved not to expose himself by admiration and did his best to stifle friedels exclamations of surprise and delight  were not these citizens to suppose that everything was tenfold more costly at the baronial castle  and truly the boy deserved credit for the consideration for his mother which made him merely reserved while he felt like a wild eagle in a poultryyard  it was no small proof of his affection to forbear more interference with his mothers happiness than was the inevitable effect of that intuition which made her aware that he was chafing and ill at ease  for his sake she allowed herself to be placed in the seat of honour though she longed as of old to nestle at her uncles feet and be again his child but even while she felt each acceptance of a token of respect as almost an injury to them every look and tone was showing how much the same christina she had returned  in truth though her life had been mournful and oppressed it had not been such as to age her early  it had been all submission without wear and tear of mind and too simple in its trials for care and moiling so the fresh lilylike sweetness of her maiden bloom was almost intact and much as she had undergone her once frail health had been so braced by the mountain breezes that though delicacy remained sickliness was gone from her appearance  there was still the exquisite purity and tender modesty of expression but with greater sweetness in the pensive brown eyes  ah little one said her uncle after duly contemplating her the change is all for the better  thou art grown a wondrously fair dame there will scarce be a lovelier in the kaiserly train  ebbo almost pardoned his greatuncle for being his greatuncle  when she is arrayed as becomes the frau freiherrinn said the housewife aunt looking with concern at the coarse texture of her black sleeve  i long to see our own lady ruffle it in her new gear i am glad that the lofty pointed cap has passed out the coif becomes my child far better and i see our tastes still accord as to fashion  fashion scarce came above the debateable ford said christina smiling  i fear my boys look as if they came out of the weltgeschichte for i could only shape their garments after my remembrance of the gallants of eighteen years ago  their garments are your own shaping exclaimed the aunt now in an accent of real not conventional respect  spinning and weaving shaping and sewing said friedel coming near to let the housewife examine the texture  close woven even threaded smooth tinted  ah stina thou didst learn something  thou wert not quite spoilt by the housefathers books and carvings  i cannot tell whose teachings have served me best or been the most precious to me said christina with clasped hands looking from one to another with earnest love  thou art a good child  ah little one forgive me you look so like our child that i cannot bear in mind that you are the frau freiherrinn  nay i should deem myself in disgrace with you did you keep me at a distance and not thou me as your little stina she fondly answered half regretting her fond eager movement as ebbo seemed to shrink together with a gesture perceived by her uncle  it is my young lord there who would not forgive the freedom he said goodhumouredly though gravely  not so ebbo forced himself to say not so if it makes my mother happy  he held up his head rather as if he thought it a fools paradise but master gottfried answered  the noble freiherr is from all i have heard too good a son to grudge his mothers duteous love even to burgher kindred  there was something in the old mans frank dignified tone of grave reproof that at once impressed ebbo with a sense of the true superiority of that wise and venerable old age to his own petulant baronial selfassertion  he had both head and heart to feel the burghers victory and with a deep blush though not without dignity he answered truly sir my mother has ever taught us to look up to you as her kindest and best  he was going to say friend but a look into the grand benignity of the countenance completed the conquest and he turned it into father  friedel at the same instant bent his knee exclaiming it is true what ebbo says  we have both longed for this day  bless us honoured uncle as you have blessed my mother  for in truth there was in the soul of the boy who had never had any but women to look up to a strange yearning towards reverence which was called into action with inexpressible force by the very aspect and tone of such a sage elder and counsellor as master gottfried sorel and he took advantage of the first opening permitted by his brother  and the sympathy always so strong between the two quickened the like feeling in ebbo so that the same movement drew him on his knee beside friedel in oblivion or renunciation of all lordly pride towards a kinsman such as he had here encountered  truly and heartily my fair youths said master gottfried with the same kind dignity do i pray the good god to bless you and render you faithful and loving sons not only to your mother but to your fatherland  he was unable to distinguish between the two exactly similar forms that knelt before him yet there was something in the quivering of friedels head which made him press it with a shade more of tenderness than the other  and in truth tears were welling into the eyes veiled by the fingers that friedel clasped over his face for such a blessing was strange and sweet to him  their mother was ready to weep for joy  there was now no drawback to her bliss since her son and her uncle had accepted one another and she repaired to her own beloved old chamber a happier being than she had been since she had left its wainscoted walls  nay as she gazed out at the familiar outlines of roof and tower and felt herself truly at home then knelt by the little undisturbed altar of her devotions with the cross above and her own patron saint below in carved wood and the flowers which the good aunt had ever kept as a freshly renewed offering she felt that she was happier more fully thankful and blissful than even in the girlish calm of her untroubled life  her prayer that she might come again in peace had been more than fulfilled nay when she had seen her boys kneel meekly to receive her uncles blessing it was in some sort to her as if the work was done as if the millstone had been borne up for her and had borne her and her dear ones with it  but there was much to come  she knew full well that even though her sons first step had been in the right direction it was in a path beset with difficulties and how would her proud ebbo meet them    chapter xiii  the eaglets in the city    after having once accepted master gottfried ebbo froze towards him and dame johanna no more save that a naturally imperious temper now and then led to fitful stiffnesses and momentary haughtiness which were easily excused in one so new to the world and afraid of compromising his rank  in general he could afford to enjoy himself with a zest as hearty as that of the simplerminded friedel  they were early afoot but not before the heads of the household were coming forth for the morning devotions at the cathedral and the streets were stirring into activity and becoming so peopled that the boys supposed that it was a great fair day  they had never seen so many people together even at the friedmund wake and it was several days before they ceased to exclaim at every passenger as a new curiosity  the dome kirk awed and hushed them  they had looked to it so long that perhaps no sublunary thing could have realized their expectations and friedel avowed that he did not know what he thought of it  it was not such as he had dreamt and like a german as he was he added that he could not think he could only feel that there was something ineffable in it yet he was almost disappointed to find his visions unfulfilled and the hues of the painted glass less pure and translucent than those of the ice crystals on the mountains however after his eye had become trained the deep influence of its dim solemn majesty and of the echoes of its organ tones and chants of high praise or earnest prayer began to enchain his spirit and if ever he were missing he was sure to be found among the mysteries of the cathedral aisles generally with ebbo who felt the spell of the same grave fascination since whatever was true of the one brother was generally true of the other  they were essentially alike though some phases of character and taste were more developed in the one or the other  master gottfried was much edified by their perfect knowledge of the names and numbers of his books  they instantly almost resentfully missed the ciceros offices that he had parted with and joyfully hailed his new acquisitions often sitting with heads together over the same book reading like activeminded youths who were used to outofdoor life and exercise in superabundant measure and to study as a valued recreation with only food enough for the intellect to awaken instead of satisfying it  they were delighted to obtain instruction from a travelling student then attending the schools of ulma meek timid lad who for love of learning and desire of the priesthood had endured frightful tyranny from the bacchanten or elder scholars and having at length attained that rank had so little heart to retaliate on the juniors that his contemporaries despised him and led him a cruel life until he obtained food and shelter from master gottfried at the pleasant cost of lessons to the young barons  poor bastien this land of quiet civility and books was a foretaste of paradise to him after the hard living barbarity and coarse vices of his comrades of whom he now and then disclosed traits that made his present pupils long to give battle to the big shaggy youths who used to send out the lesser lads to beg and steal for them and cruelly maltreated such as failed in the quest  lessons in music and singing were gladly accepted by both lads and from their uncles carving they could not keep their hands  ebbo had begun by enjoining friedel to remember that the work that had been sport in the mountains would be basely mechanical in the city and friedel as usual yielded his private tastes but on the second day ebbo himself was discovered in the workshop watching the magic touch of the deft workman and he was soon so enticed by the perfect appliances as to take tool in hand and prove himself not unadroit in the craft  friedel however excelled in delicacy of touch and grace and originality of conception and produced such workmanship that master gottfried could not help stroking his hair and telling him it was a pity he was not born to belong to the guild  i cannot spare him sir cried ebbo priest scholar minstrel artistall want him  what hans of all streets ebbo interrupted friedel  and guildmaster of none said ebbo save as a warrior the rest only enough for a gentleman  for what i am thou must be  but ebbo did not find fault with the skill friedel was bestowing on his worka carving in wood of a dove brooding over two young eagles the device that both were resolved to assume  when their mother asked what their ladyloves would say to this ebbo looked up and with the fullest conviction in his lustrous eyes declared that no love should ever rival his motherling in his heart  for truly her tender sweetness had given her sons affection a touch of romance for which master gottfried liked them the better though his wife thought their familiarity with her hardly accordant with the patriarchal discipline of the citizens  the youths held aloof from these burghers for master gottfried wisely desired to give them time to be tamed before running risk of offence either to or by their wild shy pride and their mother contrived to time her meetings with her old companions when her sons were otherwise occupied  master gottfried made it known that the marriage portion he had designed for his niece had been intrusted to a merchant trading in peltry to muscovy and the sum thus realized was larger than any bride had yet brought to adlerstein  master gottfried would have liked to continue the same profitable speculations with it but this would have been beyond the young barons endurance and his eyes sparkled when his mother spoke of repairing the castle refitting the chapel having a resident chaplain cultivating more land increasing the scanty stock of cattle and attempting the improvements hitherto prevented by lack of means  he fervently declared that the motherling was more than equal to the wise spinning queen bertha of legend and lay and the first pleasant sense of wealth came in the acquisition of horses weapons and braveries  in his original mood ebbo would rather have stood before the diet in his homespun blue than have figured in cloth of gold at a burghers expense but he had learned to love his uncle he regarded the marriage portion as family property and moreover he sorely longed to feel himself and his brother well mounted and scarcely less to see his mother in a velvet gown  here was his chief point of sympathy with the housemother who herself precluded from wearing miniver velvet or pearls longed to deck her niece therewith in time to receive sir kasimir of adlerstein wildschloss as he had promised to meet his godsons at ulm  the knights marriage had lasted only a few years and had left him no surviving children except one little daughter whom he had placed in a nunnery at ulm under the care of her mothers sister his lands lay higher up the danube and he was expected at ulm shortly before the emperors arrival  he had been chiefly in flanders with the king of the romans and had only returned to germany when the netherlanders had refused the regency of maximilian and driven him out of their country depriving him of the custody of his children  pfingsttag or pentecostday was the occasion of christinas first full toilet and never was bride more solicitously or exultingly arrayed than she while one boy held the mirror and the other criticized and admired as the aunt adjusted the pearlbordered coif and long white veil floating over the longdesired black velvet dress  how the two lads admired and gazed caring far less for their own new and noble attire  friedel was indeed somewhat concerned that the sword by his side was so much handsomer than that which ebbo wore and which for all its dinted scabbard and battered hilt he was resolved never to discard  it was a festival of brilliant joy  wreaths of flowers hung from the windows rich tapestries decked the dome kirk and the relics were displayed in shrines of wonderful costliness of material and beauty of workmanship little birds with thin cakes fastened to their feet were let loose to fly about the church in strange allusion to the event of the day the clergy wore their most gorgeous robes and the exulting music of the mass echoed from the vaults of the longdrawn aisles and brought a rapt look of deep calm ecstasy over friedels sensitive features  the beggars evidently considered a festival as a harvestday and crowded round the doors of the cathedral  as the lady of adlerstein came out leaning on ebbos arm with friedel on her other side they evidently attracted the notice of a woman whose thin brown face looked the darker for the striped red and yellow silk kerchief that bound the dark locks round her brow as holding out a beringed hand she fastened her glittering jet black eyes on them and exclaimed alms if the fair dame and knightly junkern would hear what fate has in store for them  we meddle not with the future i thank thee said christina seeing that her sons to whom gipsies were an amazing novelty were in extreme surprise at the fortunetelling proposal  yet could i tell much lady said the woman still standing in the way  what would some here present give to know that the locks that were shrouded by the widows veil ere ever they wore the matrons coif shall yet return to the coif once more  ebbo gave a sudden start of dismay and passion his mother held him fast  push on ebbo mine heed her not she is a mere bohemian  but how knew she your history mother asked friedel eagerly  that might be easily learnt at our wake began christina but her steps were checked by a call from master gottfried just behind frau freiherrinn junkern not so fast  here is your noble kinsman  a tall finelooking person in the long rich robe worn on peaceful occasions stood forth doffing his eagleplumed bonnet and as the lady turned and curtsied low he put his knee to the ground and kissed her hand saying well met noble dame i felt certain that i knew you when i beheld you in the dome  he was gazing at her all the time whispered ebbo to his brother while their mother blushing replied you do me too much honour herr freiherr  once seen never to be forgotten was the courteous answer  and truly but for the stately height of these my godsons i would not believe how long since our meeting was  thereupon in true german fashion sir kasimir embraced each youth in the open street and then removing his long embroidered spanish glove he offered his hand or rather the tips of his fingers to lead the frau christina home  master sorel had invited him to become his guest at a very elaborate ornamental festival meal in honour of the great holiday at which were to be present several wealthy citizens with their wives and families old connections of the sorel family  ebbo had resolved upon treating them with courteous reserve and distance but he was surprised to find his cousin of wildschloss comporting himself among the burgomasters and their dames as freely as though they had been his equals and to see that they took such demeanour as perfectly natural  quick to perceive the boy gathered that the gulf between noble and burgher was so great that no intimacy could bridge it over no reserve widen it and that his own bashful hauteur was almost a sign that he knew that the gulf had been passed by his own parents but shame and consciousness did not enable him to alter his manner but rather added to its stiffness  the junker is like an englishman said sir kasimir who had met many of the exiles of the roses at the court of mary of burgundy and then he turned to discuss with the guildmasters the interruption to trade caused by flemish jealousies  after the lengthy meal the tables were removed the long gallery was occupied by musicians and master gottfried crossed the hall to tell his eldest grandnephew that to him he should depute the opening of the dance with the handsome bride of the rathsherr ulrich burger ebbo blushed up to the eyes and muttered that he prayed his uncle to excuse him  so said the old citizen really displeased thy kinsman might have proved to thee that it is no derogation of thy lordly dignity i have been patient with thee but thy pride passes  sir interposed friedel hastily raising his sweet candid face with a look between shame and merriment it is not that but you forget what poor mountaineers we are  never did we tread a measure save now and then with our mother on a winter evening and we know no more than a chamois of your intricate measures  master gottfried looked perplexed for these dances were matters of great punctilio  it was but seven years since the lord of praunstein had defied the whole city of frankfort because a damsel of that place had refused to dance with one of his cousins and though fistright and letters of challenge had been made illegal yet the whole city of ulm would have resented the affront put on it by the young lord of adlerstein  happily the freiherr of adlerstein wildschloss was at hand  herr burgomaster he said let me commence the dance with your fair lady niece  by your testimony he added smiling to the youths she can tread a measure  and after marking us you may try your success with the rathsherrinn  christina would gladly have transferred her noble partner to the rathsherrinn but she feared to mortify her good uncle and aunt further and consented to figure alone with sir kasimir in one of the majestic graceful dances performed by a single couple before a gazing assembly  so she let him lead her to her place and they bowed and bent swept past one another and moved in interlacing lines and curves with a grand slow movement that displayed her quiet grace and his stately port and courtly air  is it not beautiful to see the motherling said friedel to his brother she sails like a white cloud in a soft wind  and he stands grand as a stag at gaze  like a malapert peacock say i returned ebbo didst not see friedel how he kept his eyes on her in church  my uncle says the bohemians are mere deceivers  depend on it the woman had spied his insolent looks when she made her ribald prediction  see said friedel who had been watching the steps rather than attending it will be easy to dance it now  it is a figure my mother once tried to teach us  i remember it now  then go and do it since better may not be  nay but it should be thou  who will know which of us it is  i hated his presumption too much to mark his antics  friedel came forward and the substitution was undetected by all save their mother and uncle by the latter only because addressing ebbo he received a reply in a tone such as friedel never used  natural grace quickness of ear and eye and a skilful partner rendered friedels so fair a performance that he ventured on sending his brother to attend the councilloress with wine and comfits while he in his own person performed another dance with the city dame next in pretension and their mother was amused by sir kasimirs remark that her second son danced better than the elder but both must learn  the remark displeased ebbo  in his isolated castle he knew no superior and his nature might yield willingly but rebelled at being put down  his brother was his perfect equal in all mental and bodily attributes but it was the absence of all selfassertion that made ebbo so often give him the preference it was his mothers tender meekness in which lay her power with him and if he yielded to gottfried sorels wisdom and experience it was with the inward consciousness of voluntary deference to one of lower rank  but here was wildschloss of the same noble blood with himself his elder his sponsor his protector with every right to direct him so that there was no choice between grateful docility and headstrong folly  if the fellow had been old weak or in any way inferior it would have been more bearable but he was a tried warrior a sage counsellor in the prime vigour of manhood and with a kindly reasonable authority to which only a fool could fail to attend and which for that very reason chafed ebbo excessively  moreover there was the gipsy prophecy ever rankling in the lads heart and embittering to him the sight of every civility from his kinsman to his mother  sir kasimir lodged at a neighbouring hostel but he spent much time with his cousins and tried to make them friends with his squire count rudiger  a great offence to ebbo was however the criticisms of both knight and squire on the bearing of the young barons in military exercises  truly with no instructor but the rough lanzknecht heinz they must as friedel said have been born paladins to have equalled youths whose life had been spent in chivalrous training  see us in a downright fight said ebbo we could strike as hard as any courtly minion  as hard but scarce as dexterously said friedel and be called for our pains the wild mountaineers  i heard the menatarms saying i sat my horse as though it were always going up or down a precipice and master schmidt went into his shop the other day shrugging his shoulders and saying we hailed one another across the marketplace as if we thought ulm was a mountain full of gemsbocks  thou heardst and didst not cast his insolence in his teeth cried ebbo  how could i laughed friedel when the echo was casting back in my teeth my own shout to thee  i could only laugh with rudiger  the chief delight i could have next to getting home would be to lay that fellow rudiger on his back in the tiltyard said ebbo  but as rudiger was by four years his senior and very expert the upshot of these encounters was quite otherwise and the young gentlemen were disabused of the notion that fighting came by nature and found that if they desired success in a serious conflict they must practise diligently in the city tiltyard where young men were trained to arms  the crossbow was the only weapon with which they excelled and as shooting was a favourite exercise of the burghers their proficiency was not as exclusive as had seemed to ebbo a baronial privilege  harquebuses were novelties to them and they despised them as burgher weapons in spite of sir kasimirs assurance that firearms were a great subject of study and interest to the king of the romans  the name of this personage was it may be feared highly distasteful to the freiherr von adlerstein both as wildschlosss model of knightly perfection and as one who claimed submission from his haughty spirit  when sir kasimir spoke to him on the subject of giving his allegiance he stiffly replied sir that is a question for ripe consideration  it is the question said wildschloss rather more lightly than agreed with the barons dignity whether you like to have your castle pulled down about your ears  that has never happened yet to adlerstein said ebbo proudly  no because since the days of the hohenstaufen there has been neither rule nor union in the empire  but times are changing fast my junker and within the last ten years forty castles such as yours have been consumed by the swabian league as though they were so many walnuts  the shell of adlerstein was too hard for them though  they never tried  and wherefore friend eberhard  it was because i represented to the kaiser and the graf von wurtemberg that little profit and no glory would accrue from attacking a crag full of women and babes and that i having the honour to be your next heir should prefer having the castle untouched and under the peace of the empire so long as that peace was kept  when you should come to years of discretion then it would be for you to carry out the intention wherewith your father and grandfather left home  then we have been protected by the peace of the empire all this time said friedel while ebbo looked as if the notion were hard of digestion  even so and had you not freely and nobly released your genoese merchant it had gone hard with adlerstein  could adlerstein be taken demanded ebbo triumphantly  your grandmother thought not said sir kasimir with a shade of irony in his tone  it would be a troublesome siege but the league numbers 1500 horse and 9000 foot and with schlangenwalds concurrence you would be assuredly starved out  ebbo was so much the more stimulated to take his chance and do nothing on compulsion but friedel put in the question to what the oaths would bind them  only to aid the emperor with sword and counsel in field or diet and thereby win fame and honour such as can scarce be gained by carrying prey to yon eagle roost  one may preserve ones independence without robbery said ebbo coldly  nay lad  did you ever hear of a wolf that could live without marauding  or if he tried would he get credit for so doing  after all said friedel does not the present agreement hold till we are of age  i suppose the swabian league would attempt nothing against minors unless we break the peace  probably not i will do my utmost to give the freiherr there time to grow beyond his grandmothers maxims said wildschloss  if schlangenwald do not meddle in the matter he may have the next five years to decide whether adlerstein can hold out against all germany  freiherr kasimir von adlerstein wildschloss said eberhard turning solemnly on him i do you to wit once for all that threats will not serve with me  if i submit it will be because i am convinced it is right  otherwise we had rather both be buried in the ruins of our castle as its last free lords  so said the provoking kinsman such burials look grim when the time comes but happily it is not coming yet  meantime as ebbo said to friedel how much might happena disruption of the empire a crusade against the turks a war in italy some grand means of making the diet value the sword of a free baron without chaining him down to gratify the greed of hungry austria  if only wildschloss could be shaken off  but he only became constantly more friendly and intrusive almost paternal  no wonder when the mother and her uncle made him so welcome and were so intolerably grateful for his impertinent interference while even friedel confessed the reasonableness of his counsels as if that were not the very sting of them  he even asked leave to bring his little daughter thekla from her convent to see the lady of adlerstein  she was a pretty flaxen haired maiden of five years old in a round cap and long narrow frock with a little cross at the neck  she had never seen any one beyond the walls of the nunnery and when her father took her from the lay sisters arms and carried her to the gallery where sat hausfrau johanna in dark green slashed with cherry colour master gottfried in sober crimson with gold medal and chain freiherrinn christina in silverbroidered black and the two junkern stood near in the shining mail in which they were going to the tilt yard she turned her head in terror struggled with her scarce known father and shrieked for sister grethel  it was all too sheen she sobbed in the lay sisters arms she did not want to be in paradise yet among the saints  o take her back  the two bright holy michaels would let her go for indeed she had made but one mistake in her ave  vain was the attempt to make her lift her face from the black serge shoulder where she had hidden it  sister grethel coaxed and scolded sir kasimir reproved the housemother offered comfits and christinas soft voice was worst of all for the child probably taking her for our lady herself began to gasp forth a general confession  i will never do so again  yes it was a fib but mother hildegard gave me a bit of marchpane not to tell  here the lay sister took strong measures for closing the little mouth and christina drew back recommending that the child should be left gradually to discover their terrestrial nature  ebbo had looked on with extreme disgust trying to hurry friedel who had delayed to trace some lines for his mother on her broidery pattern  in passing the step where grethel sat with thekla on her lap the clank of their armour caused the uplifting of the little flaxen head and two wide blue eyes looked over grethels shoulder and met friedels sunny glance  he smiled she laughed back again  he held out his arms and though his hands were gauntleted she let him lift her up and curiously smoothed and patted his cheek as if he had been a strange animal  you have no wings she said  are you st george or st michael  neither the one nor the other pretty one  only your poor cousin friedel von adlerstein and here is ebbo my brother  it was not in ebbos nature not to smile encouragement at the fair little face with its wistful look  he drew off his glove to caress her silken hair and for a few minutes she was played with by the two brothers like a newlyinvented toy receiving their attentions with pretty halffrightened graciousness until count rudiger hastened in to summon them and friedel placed her on his mothers knee where she speedily became perfectly happy and at ease  her extreme delight when towards evening the junkern returned was flattering even to ebbo and when it was time for her to be taken home she made strong resistance clinging fast to christina with screams and struggles  to the ladys promise of coming to see her she replied friedel and ebbo too and receiving no response to this request she burst out then i wont come  i am the freiherrinn thekla the heiress of adlerstein wildschloss and felsenbach  i wont be a nun  ill be married  you shall be my husband and she made a dart at the nearest youth who happened to be ebbo  ay ay you shall have him  he will come for you sweetest fraulein said the perplexed grethel so only you will come home nobody will come for you if you are naughty  will you come if i am good said the spoilt cloister pet clinging tight to ebbo  yes said her father as she still resisted come back my child and one day shall you see ebbo and have him for a brother  thereat ebbo shook off the little grasping fingers almost as if they had belonged to a noxious insect  the matrons coif should succeed the widows veil  he might talk with scholarly contempt of the new race of bohemian impostors but there was no forgetting that sentence  and in like manner though his grandmothers allegation that his mother had been bent on captivating sir kasimir in that single interview at adlerstein had always seemed to him the most preposterous of all kunigundes forms of outrage the recollection would recur to him and he could have found it in his heart to wish that his mother had never heard of the old ladys designs as to the oubliette  he did most sincerely wish master gottfried had never let wildschloss know of the mode in which his life had been saved  yet while it would have seemed to him profane to breathe even to friedel the true secret of his repugnance to this meddlesome kinsman it was absolutely impossible to avoid his most distasteful authority and patronage  and the mother herself was gently thankfully happy and unsuspicious basking in the tender home affection of which she had so long been deprived proud of her sons and though anxious as to ebbos decision with a quiet trust in his foundation of principle and above all trusting to prayer    chapter xiv  the doubleheaded eagle    one summer evening when shooting at a bird on a pole was in full exercise in the tiltyard the sports were interrupted by a message from the provost that a harbinger had brought tidings that the imperial court was within a days journey  all was preparation  fresh sand had to be strewn on the arena  new tapestry hangings were to deck the galleries the houses and balconies to be brave with drapery the fountain in the marketplace was to play rhine wine all ulm was astir to do honour to itself and to the kaisar and ebbo stood amid all the bustle drawing lines in the sand with the stock of his arblast subject to all that oppressive selfmagnification so frequent in early youth and which made it seem to him as if the kaisar and the king of the romans were coming to ulm with the mere purpose of destroying his independence and as if the eyes of all germany were watching for his humiliation  see see suddenly exclaimed friedel look there is something among the tracery of the dome kirk tower  is it man or bird  bird folly  thou couldst see no bird less than an eagle from hence said ebbo  no doubt they are about to hoist a banner  that is not their wont returned sir kasimir  i see him interrupted ebbo  nay but he is a bold climber  we went up to that stage close to the balcony but theres no footing beyond but crockets and canopies  and a bit of rotten scaffold added friedel  perhaps he is a builder going to examine it  up higher higher  a builder said ebbo a man with a head and foot like that should be a chamois hunter  shouldst thou deem it worse than the red eyrie friedel  yea truly  the depth beneath is plainer  there would be no climbing there without  without what cousin asked wildschloss  without great cause said friedel  it is fearful  he is like a fly against the sky  beaten again muttered ebbo i did think that none of these town bred fellows could surpass us when it came to a giddy height  who can he be  look look burst out friedel  the saints protect him  he is on that narrowest topmost ledgemeasuring his heel is over the parapethalf his foot  holding on by the rotten scaffold pole  st barbara be his speed but he is a brave man shouted ebbo  oh the pole has broken  heaven forefend cried wildschloss with despair on his face unseen by the boys for friedel had hidden his eyes and ebbo was straining his with the intense gaze of horror  he had carried his glance downwards following the 380 feet fall that must be the lot of the adventurer  then looking up again he shouted i see him  i see him  praise to st barbara  he is safe  he has caught by the upright stone work  where where  show me cried wildschloss grasping ebbos arm  there clinging to that upright bit of tracery stretching his foot out to yonder crocket  i cannot see  mine eyes swim and dazzle said wildschloss merciful heavens is this another tempting of providence  how is it with him now ebbo  swarming down another slender bit of the stone network  it must be easy now to one who could keep head and hand steady in such a shock  there added friedel after a breathless space he is on the lower parapet whence begins the stair  do you know him sir  who is he  either a venetian mountebank said wildschloss or else there is only one man i know of either so foolhardy or so steady of head  be he who he may said ebbo he is the bravest man that ever i beheld  who is he sir kasimir  an eagle of higher flight than ours no doubt said wildschloss but come we shall reach the dome kirk by the time the climber has wound his way down the turret stairs and we shall see what like he is  their coming was well timed for a small door at the foot of the tower was just opening to give exit to a very tall knight in one of those short spanish cloaks the collar of which could be raised so as to conceal the face  he looked to the right and left and had one hand raised to put up the collar when he recognized sir kasimir and holding out both hands exclaimed ha adlerstein well met  i looked to see thee here  no unbonneting i am not come yet  i am at strasburg with the kaisar and the archduke and am not here till we ride in in purple and in pall by the time the good folk have hung out their arras and donned their gold chains and conned their speeches and mounted their mules  well that their speeches are not over the lykewake of his kingly kaisarly highness gravely returned sir kasimir  ha  thou sawest  i came out here to avoid the gaping throng who dont know what a hunter can do  i have been in worse case in the tyrol  snowdrifts are worse footing than stone vine leaves  where abides your highness asked wildschloss  i ride back again to the haltingplace for the night and meet my father in time to do my part in the pageant  i was sick of the addresses and moreover the purseproud flemings have made such a stiff little fop of my poor boy that i am ashamed to look at him or hear his french accent  so i rode off to get a view of this notable dom in peace ere it be bedizened in holiday garb and one cant stir without all the chapter waddling after one  your highness has found means of distancing them  why truly the prior would scarce delight in the view from yonder parapet laughed his highness  ha  adlerstein where didst get such a perfect pair of pages  i would i could match my hounds as well  they are no pages of mine so please you said the knight rather this is the head of my name  let me present to your kingly highness the freiherr von adlerstein  thou dost not thyself distinguish between them said maximilian as friedmund stepped back putting forward eberhard whose bright lively smile of interest and admiration had been the cause of his cousins mistake  they would have doffed their caps and bent the knee but were hastily checked by maximilian  no no junkern i shall owe you no thanks for bringing all the street on methats enough  reserve the rest for kaisar fritz  then familiarly taking sir kasimirs arm he walked on saying i remember now  thou wentest after an inheritance from the old mouser of the debateable ford and wert ousted by a couple of lusty boys sprung of a peasant wedlock  nay my lord of a burgher lady fair as she is wise and virtuous who spite of all hindrances has bred up these youths in all good and noble nurture  is this so said the king turning sharp round on the twins  are ye minded to quit freebooting and come a crusading against the turks with me  everywhere with such a leader enthusiastically exclaimed ebbo  what up there said maximilian smiling  thou hast the tread of a chamoishunter  friedel has been on the red eyrie exclaimed ebbo then thinking he had spoken foolishly he coloured  which is the red eyrie goodhumouredly asked the king  it is the crag above our castle said friedel modestly  none other has been there added ebbo perceiving his auditors interest but he saw the eagle flying away with a poor widows kid and the sight must have given him wings for we never could find the same path but here is one of the feathers he brought downtaking off his cap so as to show a feather rather the worse for wear and sheltered behind a fresher one  nay said friedel thou shouldst say that i came to a ledge where i had like to have stayed all night but that ye all came out with men and ropes  we know what such a case is said the king  it has chanced to us to hang between heaven and earth ive even had the holy sacrament held up for my last pious gaze by those who gave me up for lost on the mountainside  adlerstein  the peak above the braunwasser some day shall ye show me this eyrie of yours and we will see whether we can amaze our cousins the eagles  we see you at our fathers court tomorrow he graciously added and ebbo gave a ready bow of acquiescence  there said the king as after their dismissal he walked on with sir kasimir never blame me for rashness and imprudence  here has this height of the steeple proved the height of policy  it has made a loyal subject of a mouser on the spot  pray heaven it may have won a heart true though proud said wildschloss but mousing was cured before by the wise training of the mother  your highness will have taken out the sting of submission and you will scarce find more faithful subjects  how old are the junkern  some sixteen years your highness  that is what living among mountains does for a lad  why could not those thriceaccursed flemish towns let me breed up my boy to be good for something in the mountains instead of getting duckfooted and muddywitted in the fens  in the meantime ebbo and friedel were returning home in that sort of passion of enthusiasm that ingenuous boyhood feels when first brought into contact with greatness or brilliant qualities  and brilliance was the striking point in maximilian  the last of the knights in spite of his many defects was by personal qualities and the hereditary influence of longdescended rank verily a king of men in aspect and demeanour even when most careless and simple  he was at this time a year or two past thirty unusually tall and with a form at once majestic and full of vigour and activity a noble fair though sunburnt countenance eyes of dark gray almost black long fair hair a keen aquiline nose a lip only beginning to lengthen to the characteristic austrian feature an expression always lofty sometimes dreamy and yet at the same time full of acuteness and humour  his abilities were of the highest order his purposes especially at this period of his life most noble and becoming in the first prince of christendom and if his life were a failure and his reputation unworthy of his endowments the cause seems to have been in great measure the bewilderment and confusion that unusual gifts sometimes cause to their possessor whose sight their conflicting illumination dazzles so as to impair his steadiness of aim while their contending gleams light him into various directions so that one object is deserted for another ere its completion  thus maximilian cuts a figure in history far inferior to that made by his grandson charles v whom he nevertheless excelled in every personal quality except the most needful of all force of character and in like manner his remote descendant the narrowminded ferdinand of styria gained his ends though the able and brilliant joseph ii was to die brokenhearted calling his reign a failure and mistake however such terms as these could not be applied to maximilian with regard to home affairs  he has had hard measure from those who have only regarded his vacillating foreign policy especially with respect to italyever the temptation and the bane of austria but even here much of his uncertain conduct was owing to the unfulfilled promises of what he himself called his realm of kings and a sovereign can only justly be estimated by his domestic policy  the contrast of the empire before his time with the subsequent germany is that of chaos with order  since the death of friedrich ii the imperial title had been a mockery making the prince who chanced to bear it a mere mark for the spite of his rivals there was no centre of justice no appeal everybody might make war on everybody with the sole preliminary of exchanging a challenge fistright was the acknowledged law of the land and except in the free cities and under such a happy accident as a rightminded prince here and there the state of germany seems to have been rather worse than that of scotland from bruce to the union of the crowns  under maximilian the diet became an effective council fistright was abolished independent robberlords put down civilization began to effect an entrance the system of circles was arranged and the empire again became a leading power in europe instead of a mere vortex of disorder and misrule  never would charles v have held the position he occupied had he come after an ordinary man instead of after an able and sagacious reformer like that maximilian who is popularly regarded as a fantastic caricature of a knighterrant marred by avarice and weakness of purpose  at the juncture of which we are writing none of maximilians less worthy qualities had appeared he had not been rendered shifty and unscrupulous by difficulties and disappointments in money matters and had not found it impossible to keep many of the promises he had given in all good faith  he stood forth as the hope of germany in salient contrast to the feeble and avaricious father who was felt to be the only obstacle in the way of his noble designs of establishing peace and good discipline in the empire and conducting a general crusade against the turks whose progress was the most threatening peril of christendom  his fame was of course frequently discussed among the citizens with whom he was very popular not only from his ease and freedom of manner but because his graceful tastes his love of painting sculpture architecture and the mechanical turn which made him an improver of firearms and a patron of painting and engraving rendered their society more agreeable to him than that of his dull barbarous nobility  ebbo had heard so much of the perfections of the king of the romans as to be prepared to hate him but the boy as we have seen was of a generous sensitive nature peculiarly prone to enthusiastic impressions of veneration and maximilians highspirited manhood personal fascination and individual kindness had so entirely taken him by surprise that he talked of him all the evening in a more fervid manner than did even friedel though both could scarcely rest for their anticipations of seeing him on the morrow in the full state of his entry  richly clad and mounted on creamcoloured steeds nearly as much alike as themselves the twins were a pleasant sight for a proud mothers eyes as they rode out to take their place in the procession that was to welcome the royal guests  master sorel in ample gown richly furred with medal and chain of office likewise went forth as guildmaster and christina with smiling lips and liquid eyes recollected the days when to see him in such array was her keenest pleasure and the utmost splendour her fancy could depict  arrayed as her sons loved to see her in black velvet and with pearlbordered cap christina sat by her aunt in the tapestried balcony and between them stood or sat little thekla von adlerstein wildschloss whose father had entrusted her to their care to see the procession pass by  a rich eastern carpet of gorgeous colouring covered the upper balustrade over which they leant in somewhat close quarters with the scarletbodiced dames of the opposite house but with ample space for sight up and down the rows of smiling expectants at each balcony or window equally gay with hangings while the bells of all the churches clashed forth their gayest chimes and fitful bursts of music were borne upon the breeze little thekla danced in the narrow space for very glee and wondered why any one should live in a cloister when the world was so wide and so fair  and dame johanna tried to say something pious of worldly temptations and the cloister shelter but thekla interrupted her and clinging to christina exclaimed nay but i am always naughty with mother ludmilla in the convent and i know i should never be naughty out here with you and the barons i should be so happy  hush hush little one here they come  on they camestout lanzknechts first the city guard with steel helmets unadorned buff suits and bearing either harquebuses halberts or those handsome but terrible weapons morning stars then followed guild after guild each preceded by the banner bearing its homely emblemthe cauldron of the smiths the hose of the clothiers the helmet of the armourers the bason of the barbers the boot of the sutors even the sausage of the cooks and the shoe of the shoeblacks were represented as by men who gloried in the calling in which they did lifes duty and task  first in each of these bands marched the prentices stout broad flatfaced lads from twenty to fourteen years of age with hair like tow hanging from under their blue caps staves in their hands and knives at their girdles  behind them came the journeymen in leathern jerkins and steel caps and armed with halberts or cross bows men of all ages from sixty to one or two and twenty and many of the younger ones with foreign countenances and garb betokening that they were strangers spending part of their wandering years in studying the ulm fashions of their craft  each trade showed a large array of these juniors but the masters who came behind were comparatively few mostly elderly longgowned goldchained personages with a weight of solid dignity on their wise browsmen who respected themselves made others respect them and kept their city a peaceful wellordered haven while storms raged in the realm beyondmen too who had raised to the glory of their god a temple not indeed fulfilling the original design but a noble effort and grand monument of burgher devotion  then came the ragged regiment of scholars wild lads from every part of germany and switzerland some wan and pinched with hardship and privation others sturdy selfish rogues evidently well able to take care of themselves  there were many rude tyrannicallooking lads among the older lads and though here and there a studious earnest face might be remarked the prospect of germanys future priests and teachers was not encouraging  and what a searching ordeal was awaiting those careless lads when the voice of one as yet still a student should ring through germany  contrasting with these illkempt pupils marched the grave professors and teachers in square ecclesiastic caps and long gowns whose colours marked their degrees and the universities that had conferred themsome thin some portly some jocund others dreamy some observing all the humours around others still intent on aristotelian ethics all men of high fame with doctor at the beginning of their names and or or us at the close of them  after them rode the magistracy a burgomaster from each guild and the herr provost himselfas great a potentate within his own walls as the doge of venice or of genoa or perhaps greater because less jealously hampered  in this dignified group was uncle gottfried by complacent nod and smile acknowledging his good wife and niece who indeed had received many a previous glance and bow from friends passing beneath but master sorel was no new spectacle in a civic procession and the sight of him was only a pleasant fillip to the excitement of his ladies  here was jingling of spurs and trampling of horses heraldic achievements showed upon the banners round which rode the mailclad retainers of country nobles who had mustered to meet their lords then with still more of clank and tramp rode a brightfaced troop of lads with feathered caps and gay mantles  young count rudiger looked up with courteous salutation and just behind him with smiling lips and upraised faces were the pair whose dark eyes dark hair and slender forms rendered them conspicuous among the fair teutonic youth  each cap was taken off and waved and each pair of lustrous eyes glanced up pleasure and exultation at the sight of the lovely mutterlein  and she  the pageant was wellnigh over to her save for heartily agreeing with aunt johanna that there was not a young noble of them all to compare with the twin barons of adlerstein  however she knew she should be called to account if she did not look well at the romish king besides thekla was shrieking with delight at the sight of her father tall and splendid on his mighty black charger with a smile for his child and for the lady a bow so low and deferential that it was evidently remarked by those at whose approach every lady in the balconies was rising every head in the street was bared  a tall thin shrivelled but exceedingly stately old man on a gray horse was in the centre  clad in a purple velvet mantle and bowing as he went he looked truly the kaisar to whom stately courtesy was second nature  on one side in black and gold with the jewel of the golden fleece on his breast rode maximilian responding gracefully to the salutations of the people but his keen gray eye roving in search of the object of sir kasimirs salute and lighting on christina with such a rapid amused glance of discovery that in her confusion she missed what excited dame johannas rapturous admirationthe handsome boy on the emperors other side a fair plump lad the young sovereign of the low countries beautiful in feature and complexion but lacking the fire and the loftiness that characterized his fathers countenance  the train was closed by the reitern of the emperors guardsteelclad mercenaries who were looked on with no friendly eyes by the few gazers in the street who had been left behind in the general rush to keep up with the attractive part of the show  pageants of elaborate mythological character impeded the imperial progress at every stage and it was full two hours ere the two youths returned heartily weary of the lengthened ceremonial and laughing at having actually seen the king of the romans enduring to be conducted from shrine to shrine in the cathedral by a large proportion of its dignitaries  ebbo was sure he had caught an archly disconsolate wink  ebbo had to dress for the banquet spread in the townhall  space was wanting for the concourse of guests and master sorel had decided that the younger baron should not be included in the invitation friedel pardoned him more easily than did ebbo who not only resented any slight to his double but in his fits of shy pride needed the aid of his readier and brighter other self  but it might not be and sir kasimir and master gottfried alone accompanied him hoping that he would not look as wild as a hawk and would do nothing to diminish the favourable impression he had made on the king of the romans  late according to mediaeval hours was the return and ebbo spoke in a tone of elation  the kaisar was most gracious and the king knew me he said and asked for thee friedel saying one of us was nought without the other  but thou wilt go tomorrow for we are to receive knighthood  already exclaimed friedel a bright glow rushing to his cheek  yea said ebbo  the romish king said somewhat about waiting to win our spurs but the kaisar said i was in a position to take rank as a knight and i thanked him so thou shouldst share the honour  the kaisar said wildschloss is not the man to let a knights fee slip between his fingers  the king would have kept off their grip and reserved you for knighthood from his own sword under the banner of the empire but there is no help for it now and you must make your vassals send in their dues  my vassals said ebbo what could they send  the aid customary on the knighthood of the heir  but there isthere is nothing said friedel  they can scarce pay meal and poultry enough for our daily fare and if we were to flay them alive we should not get sixty groschen from the whole  true enough  knighthood must wait till we win it said ebbo gloomily  nay it is accepted said wildschloss  the kaisar loves his iron chest too well to let you go back  you must be ready with your round sum to the chancellor and your spurmoney and your fee to the heralds and largess to the crowd  mother the dowry said ebbo  at your service my son said christina anxious to chase the cloud from his brow  but it was a deep haul for the avaricious friedrich iv made exorbitant charges for the knighting his young nobles and ebbo soon saw that the improvements at home must suffer for the honours that would have been so much better won than bought  if your vassals cannot aid yet may not your kinsman began wildschloss  no interrupted ebbo lashed up to hot indignation  no sir rather will my mother brother and i ride back this very night to unfettered liberty on our mountain without obligation to any living man  less hotly sir baron said master gottfried gravely  you broke in on your noble godfather and you had not heard me speak  you and your brother are the old mans only heirs nor do ye incur any obligation that need fret you by forestalling what would be your just right  i will see my nephews as well equipped as any young baron of them  the mother looked anxiously at ebbo  he bent his head with rising colour and said thanks kind uncle  from you i have learnt to look on goodness as fatherly  only added friedel if the barons station renders knighthood fitting for him surely i might remain his esquire  never friedel cried his brother  without thee nothing  well said freiherr said master sorel what becomes the one becomes the other  i would not have thee left out my friedel since i cannot leave thee the mysteries of my craft  tomorrow said friedel gravely  then must the vigil be kept to night  the boy thinks these are the days of roland and karl the great said wildschloss  he would fain watch his arms in the moonlight in the dome kirk  alas no my friedel  knighthood in these days smacks more of bezants than of deeds of prowess  unbearable fellow cried ebbo when he had latched the door of the room he shared with his brother  first holding up my inexperience to scorn  as though the kaisar knew not better than he what befits me  then trying to buy my silence and my mothers gratitude with his hateful advance of gold  as if i did not loathe him enough without if i pay my homage and sign the league tomorrow it will be purely that he may not plume himself on our holding our own by sufferance in deference to him  you will sign ityou will do homage exclaimed friedel  how rejoiced the mother will be  i had rather depend at onceif depend i muston yonder dignified kaisar and that noble king than on our meddling kinsman said ebbo i shall be his equal now  ay and no more classed with the court junkern i was with today  the dullards  no one reasonable thing know they but the chase  one had been at florence and when i asked him of the baptistery and rare giotto of whom my uncle told us he asked if he were a knight of the medici  all he knew was that there were ortolans at ser lorenzos table and he and the rest of them talked over wines as many and as hard to call as the roll of aeneass comrades and when each one must drink to her he loved best and i said i loved none like my sweet mother they gibed me for a simple dutiful mountaineer  yea and when the servants brought a bowl i thought it was a wholesome draught of spring water after all their hot wines and fripperies  pah  the rosewater ebbo  no wonder they laughed  why the bowls for our fingers came round at the banquet here  ah thou hast eyes for their finikin manners  yet what know they of what we used to long for in polished life  not one but vowed he abhorred books and cursed dr faustus for multiplying them  i may not know the taste of a stew nor the fit of a glove as they do but i trust i bear a less empty brain  and the young netherlanders that came with the archduke were worst of all  they got together and gabbled french and treated the german junkern with the very same sauce with which they had served me  the archduke laughed with them and when the provost addressed him made as if he understood not till his father heard and thundered out how now philip  deaf on thy german ear  i tell thee herr probst he knows his own tongue as well as thou or i and thou shalt hear him speak as becomes the son of an austrian hunter  that romish king is a knight of knights friedel  i could follow him to the worlds end  i wonder whether he will ever come to climb the red eyrie  it does not seem the worlds end when one is there said friedel with strange yearnings in his breast  even the dom steeple never rose to its full height he added standing in the window and gazing pensively into the summer sky oh ebbo this knighthood has come very suddenly after our many dreams and even though its outward tokens be lowered it is still a holy awful thing  nurtured in mountain solitude on romance transmitted through the pure medium of his mothers mind and his spirit untainted by contact with the world friedmund von adlerstein looked on chivalry with the temper of a percival or galahad and regarded it with a sacred awe eberhard though treating it more as a matter of business was like enough to his brother to enter into the force of the vows they were about to make and if the young barons of adlerstein did not perform the nightwatch over their armour yet they kept a vigil that impressed their own minds as deeply and in early morn they went to confession and mass ere the gay parts of the city were astir  sweet niece said master sorel as he saw the brothers grave earnest looks thou hast done well by these youths yet i doubt me at times whether they be not too much lifted out of this veritable world of ours  ah fair uncle were they not above it how could they face its temptations  true my child but how will it be when they find how lightly others treat what to them is so solemn  there must be temptations for them above all for ebbo said christina but still when i remember how my heart sank when their grandmother tried to bring them up to love crime as sport and glory i cannot but trust that the good work will be wrought out and my dream fulfilled that they may be lights on earth and stars in heaven  even this matter of homage that seemed so hard to my ebbo has now been made easy to him by his veneration for the emperor  it was even so  if the sense that he was the last veritable free lord of adlerstein rushed over ebbo he was on the other hand overmastered by the kingliness of friedrich and maximilian and was aware that this submission while depriving him of little or no actual power brought him into relations with the civilized world and opened to him paths of true honour  so the ceremonies were gone through his oath of allegiance was made investiture was granted to him by the delivery of a sword and both he and friedel were dubbed knights  then they shared another banquet where as away from the junkern and among elder men ebbo was happier than the day before some of the knights seemed to him as rude and ignorant as the schneiderlein but no one talked to him nor observed his manners and he could listen to conversation on war and policy such as interested him far more than the subjects affected by youths a little older than himself  their lonely life and training had rendered the minds of the brothers as much in advance of their fellows as they were behind them in knowledge of the world  the crass obtuseness of most of the nobility made it a relief to return to the usual habits of the sorel household when the court had left ulm  friedmund anxious to prove that his new honours were not to alter his home demeanour was drawing on a block of wood from a tinted penandink sketch ebbo was deeply engaged with a newly acquired copy of virgil and their mother was embroidering some draperies for the longneglected castle chapelall sitting as master gottfried loved to have them in his studio whence he had a few moments before been called away when as the door slowly opened a voice was heard that made both lads start and rise  yea truly herr guildmaster i would see these masterpieces  ha what have you here for masterpieces  our two new doubleganger knights  and maximilian entered in a simple ridingdress attended by master gottfried and by sir kasimir of adlerstein wildschloss  christina would fain have slipped out unperceived but the king was already removing his cap from his fair curling locks and bending his head as he said the frau freiherrinn von adlerstein  fair lady i greet you well and thank you in the kaisars name and mine for having bred up for us two true and loyal subjects  may they so prove themselves my liege said christina bending low  and not only loyalhearted added maximilian smiling but ready brained which is less frequent among our youth  what is thy book young knight  virgilius maro  dost thou read the latin he added in that tongue  not as well as we wish your kingly highness readily answered ebbo in latin having learnt solely of our mother till we came hither  never fear for that my young blade laughed the king  knowst not that the wiseacres thought me too dull for teaching till i was past ten years  and what is thy double about  drawing on wood  how now an able draughtsman my young knight  my nephew sir friedmund is good to the old man said gottfried himself almost regretting the lads avocation  my eyes are failing me and he is aiding me with the graving of this border  he has the knack that no teaching will impart to any of my present journeymen  born not made quoth maximilian  nay as friedel coloured deeper at the sense that ebbo was ashamed of him no blushes my boy it is a rare gift  i can make a hundred knights any day but the almighty alone can make a genius  it was this very matter of graving that led me hither  for maximilian had a passion for composition and chiefly for autobiography and his head was full of that curious performance der weisse konig which occupied many of the leisure moments of his life being dictated to his former writingmaster marcus sauerwein  he had already designed the portrayal of his father as the old white king and himself as the young white king in a series of woodcuts illustrating the narrative which culminated in the one romance of his life his brief happy marriage with mary of burgundy and he continued eagerly to talk to master gottfried about the mystery of graving and the various scenes in which he wished to depict himself learning languages from native speakersczech from a peasant with a basket of eggs english from the exiles at the burgundian court who had also taught him the use of the longbow building from architects and masons painting from artists and more imaginatively astrology from a wonderful flaming sphere in the sky and the black art from a witch inspired by a longtailed demon perched on her shoulder  no doubt the young white king made an exceedingly prominent figure in the discourse but it was so quaint and so brilliant that it did not need the charm of royal condescension to entrance the young knights who stood silent auditors  ebbo at least was convinced that no species of knowledge or skill was viewed by his kaisarly kingship as beneath his dignity but still he feared friedels being seized upon to be as prime illustrator to the royal autobiographya lot to which with all his devotion to maximilian he could hardly have consigned his brother in the certainty that the jeers of the ruder nobles would pursue the craftsman baron  however for the present maximilian was keen enough to see that the boys mechanical skill was not as yet equal to his genius so he only encouraged him to practise adding that he heard there was a rare lad one durer at nuremburg whose productions were already wonderful  and what is this he asked what is the daintily carved group i see yonder  your highness means the dove in the eagles nest said kasimir it is the work of my young kinsmen and their appropriate device  as well chosen as carved said maximilian examining it  well is it that a city dove should now and then find her way to the eyrie some of my nobles would cut my throat for the heresy but i am safe here eh sir kasimir  fare ye well ye dovetrained eaglets  we will know one another better when we bear the cross against the infidel  the brothers kissed his hand and he descended the steps from the hall door  ere he had gone far he turned round upon sir kasimir with a merry smile  a very white and tender dove indeed and one who might easily nestle in another eyrie methinks  deems your kingly highness that consent could be won asked wildschloss  from the kaisar  pfui man thou knowst as well as i do the golden key to his consent  so thou wouldst risk thy luck again  thou hast no male heir  and i would fain give my child a mother who would deal well with her  nay to say sooth that gentle innocent face has dwelt with me for many years  but for my precontract i had striven long ago to win her and had been a happier man mayhap  and now i have seen what she has made of her sons i feel i could scarce find her match among our nobility  nor elsewhere said the king and i honour thee for not being so besotted in our german haughtiness as not to see that it is our free cities that make refined and discreet dames  i give you good speed adlerstein but if i read aright the brow of one at least of these young fellows thou wilt scarce have a willing or obedient stepson    chapter xv  the rival eyrie    ebbo trusted that his kinsman of wildschloss was safe gone with the court and his temper smoothed and his spirits rose in proportion while preparations for a return to adlerstein were being completed preparations by which the burgher lady might hope to render the castle far more habitable not to say baronial than it had ever been  the lady herself felt thankful that her stay at ulm had turned out well beyond all anticipations in the excellent understanding between her uncle and her sons and still more in ebbos full submission and personal loyalty towards the imperial family  the die was cast and the first step had been taken towards rendering the adlerstein family the peaceful honourable nobles she had always longed to see them  she was one afternoon assisting her aunt in some of the duties of her wirthschaft when master gottfried entered the apartment with an air of such extreme complacency that both turned round amazed the one exclaiming surely funds have come in for finishing the spire the other have they appointed thee provost for next year house father  neither the one nor the other was the reply  but heard you not the horses feet  here has the lord of adlerstein wildschloss been with me in full state to make formal proposals for the hand of our child christina  for christina cried hausfrau johanna with delight truly that is well  truly our maiden has done honour to her breeding  a second nobleman demanding herand one who should be able richly to endow her  and who will do so said master gottfried  for morning gift he promises the farms and lands of grunaurich both in forest and corn glebe  likewise her dower shall be upon wildschlosswhere the soil is of the richest pasture and there are no less than three mills whence the lord obtains large rights of multure  moreover the castle was added to and furnished on his marriage with the late baroness and might serve a kurfurst and though the jewels of freiherrinn valeska must be inherited by her daughter yet there are many of higher price which have descended from his own ancestresses and which will all be hers  and what a wedding we will have exclaimed johanna it shall be truly baronial  i will take my hood and go at once to neighbour sophie lemsberg who was wife to the markgrafs under kellermeister she will tell me point device the ceremonies befitting the espousals of a barons widow  poor christina had sat all this time with drooping head and clasped hands a tear stealing down as the formal terms of the treaty sent her spirit back to the urgent pleading imperious voice that had said now little one thou wilt not shut me out and as she glanced at the ring that had lain on that broad palm she felt as if her sixteen cheerful years had been an injury to her husband in his nameless bloody grave  but protection was so needful in those rude ages and second marriages so frequent that reluctance was counted as weakness  she knew her uncle and aunt would never believe that aught but compulsion had bound her to the rude outlaw and her habit of submission was so strong that only when her aunt was actually rising to go and consult her gossip she found breath to falter  hold dear auntmy sons  nay child it is the best thing thou couldst do for them  wonders hast thou wrought yet are they too old to be without fatherly authority  i speak not of friedel the lad is gentle and pious though spirited but for the baron  the very eye and temper of my poor brother hughthy father stineare alive again in him  yea i love the lad the better for it while i fear  he minds me precisely of hugh ere he was prenticed to the weaponsmith and all became bitterness  ah truly said christina raising her eyes all would become bitterness with my ebbo were i to give a fathers power to one whom he would not love  then were he sullen and unruly indeed said the old burgomaster with displeasure none have shown him more kindness none could better aid him in court and empire  the lad has never had restraint enough  i blame thee not child but he needs it sorely by thine own showing  alas uncle mine be the blame but it is over late  my boy will rule himself for the love of god and of his mother but he will brook no hand over himleast of all now he is a knight and thinks himself a man  uncle i should be deprived of both my sons for friedels very soul is bound up with his brothers  i pray thee enjoin not this thing on me she implored  child exclaimed master gottfried thou thinkst not that such a contract as this can be declined for the sake of a wayward junker  stay housefather the little one will doubtless hear reason and submit put in the aunt  her sons were goodly and delightsome to her in their upgrowth but they are wellnigh men  they will be away to court and camp to love and marriage and how will it be with her then young and fair as she still is  well will it be for her to have a stately lord of her own and a new home of love and honour springing round her  true continued sorel and though she be too pious and wise to reck greatly of such trifles yet it may please her dreamy brain to hear that sir kasimir loves her even like a paladin and the love of a tried man of sixandforty is better worth than a mere kindling of youthful fancy  mine eberhard loved me murmured christina almost to herself but her aunt caught the word  and what was such love worth  to force thee into a stolen match and leave thee alone and unowned to the consequences  peace exclaimed christina with crimson cheek and uplifted head peace  my own dear lord loved me with true and generous love  none but myself knows how much  not a word will i hear against that tender heart  yes peace returned gottfried in a conciliatory tonepeace to the brave sir eberhard  thine aunt meant no ill of him  he truly would rejoice that the wisdom of his choice should receive such testimony and that his sons should be thus well handled  nay little as i heed such toys it will doubtless please the lads that the baron will obtain of the emperor letters of nobility for this house which verily sprang of a good walloon family and so their shield will have no blank  the romish king promises to give thee rank with any baroness and hath fully owned what a pearl thou art mine own sweet dove  nay sir kasimir is coming tomorrow in the trust to make the first betrothal with graf von kaulwitz as a witness and i thought of asking the provost on the other hand  tomorrow exclaimed johanna and how is she to be meetly clad look at this widowgarb and how is time to be found for procuring other raiment  housefather a substantial man like you should better understand  the meal too  i must to gossip sophie  verily dear mother and father said christina who had rallied a little have patience with me  i may not lightly or suddenly betroth myself i know not that i can do so at all assuredly not unless my sons were heartily willing  have i your leave to retire  granted my child for meditation will show thee that this is too fair a lot for any but thee  much had i longed to see thee wedded ere thy sons outgrew thy care but i shunned proposing even one of our worthy guildmasters lest my young freiherr should take offence but this knight of his own blood true and wise as a burgher and faithful and godfearing withal is a better match than i durst hope and is no doubt a special reward from thy patron saint  let me entreat one favour more implored christina  speak of this to no one ere i have seen my sons  she made her way to her own chamber there to weep and flutter marriage was a matter of such high contract between families that the parties themselves had usually no voice in the matter and only the widowed had any chance of a personal choice nor was this always accorded in the case of females who remained at the disposal of their relatives  good substantial wedded affection was not lacking but romantic love was thought an unnecessary preliminary and found a vent in extravagant adoration not always in reputable quarters obedience first to the father then to the husband was the first requisite love might shift for itself and the fair widow of adlerstein telling her beads in sheer perplexity knew not whether her strong repugnance to this marriage and warm sympathy with her son ebbo were not an act of rebellion  yet each moment did her husband rise before her mind more vividly with his rugged looks his warm tender heart his dawnings of comprehension his generous forbearance and reverential lovethe love of her youthto be equalled by no other  the accomplished courtier and polished man of the world might be his superior but she loathed the superiority since it was to her husband  might not his one chosen dove keep heartwhole for him to the last  she recollected that coarsest cruellest reproach of all that her motherinlaw had been wont to fling at herthat she the recent widow the newmade mother of eberhards babes in her grief her terror and her weakness had sought to captivate this suitor by her blandishments  the taunt seemed justified and her cheeks burned with absolute shame my husband my loving eberhard left with none but me to love thee unknown to thine own sons  i cannot i will not give my heart away from thee  thy little bride shall be faithful to thee whatever betide  when we meet beyond the grave i will have been thine only nor have set any before thy sons  heaven forgive me if i be undutiful to my uncle but thou must be preferred before even him  hark and she started as if at eberhards footstep then smiled recollecting that ebbo had his fathers tread  but her husband had been too much in awe of her to enter with that hasty agitated step and exclamation mother mother what insolence is this  hush ebbo  i prayed mine uncle to let me speak to thee  it is true then said ebbo dashing his cap on the ground i had soundly beaten that grinning prentice for telling heinz  truly the house rings with the rumour mother said friedel but we had not believed it  i believed wildschloss assured enough for aught said ebbo but i thought he knew where to begin  does he not know who is head of the house of adlerstein since he must tamper with a mechanical craftsman cap in hand to any sprig of nobility  i would have soon silenced his overtures  is it in sooth as we heard asked friedel blushing to the ears for the boy was shy as a maiden  mother we know what you would say he added throwing himself on his knees beside her his arm round her waist his cheek on her lap and his eyes raised to hers  she bent down to kiss him  thou knewst it friedel and now must thou aid me to remain thy fathers true widow and to keep ebbo from being violent  ebbo checked his hasty march to put his hand on her chair and kiss her brow  motherling i will restrain myself so you will give me your word not to desert us  nay ebbo said friedel the motherling is too true and loving for us to bind her  children she answered hear me patiently  i have been communing with myself and deeply do i feel that none other can i love save him who is to you a mere name but to me a living presence  nor would i put any between you and me  fear me not ebbo  i think the mothers and sons of this wider fuller world do not prize one another as we do  but my son this is no matter for rage or ingratitude remember it is no small condescension in a noble to stoop to thy citizen mother  he knew what painted puppets noble ladies are growled ebbo  moreover continued christina thine uncle is highly gratified and cannot believe that i can refuse  he understands not my love for thy father and sees many advantages for us all  i doubt me if he believes i have power to resist his will and for thee he would not count thine opposition valid  and the more angry and vehement thou art the more will he deem himself doing thee a service by overruling thee  come home mother  let heinz lead our horses to the door in the dawn and when we are back in free adlerstein it will be plain who is master  such a flitting would scarce prove our wisdom said christina to run away with thy mother like a lover in a ballad  nay let me first deal gently with thine uncle and speak myself with sir kasimir so that i may show him the vanity of his suit  then will we back to adlerstein without leaving wounds to requite kindness  ebbo was wrought on to promise not to attack the burgomaster on the subject but he was moody and silent and master gottfried let him alone considering his gloom as another proof of his need of fatherly authority and as a peacelover forbearing to provoke his fiery spirit  but when sir kasimirs visit was imminent and christina had refused to make the change in her dress by which a young widow was considered to lay herself open to another courtship master gottfried called the twins apart  my young lords he said i fear me ye are vexing your gentle mother by needless strife at what must take place  pardon me good uncle said ebbo i utterly decline the honour of sir kasimirs suit to my mother  master gottfried smiled  sons are not wont to be the judges in such cases sir eberhard  perhaps not he answered but my mothers will is to the nayward nor shall she be coerced  it is merely because of you and your pride said master gottfried  i think not so rejoined the calmer friedel my mothers love for my father is still fresh  young knights said master gottfried it would scarce become me to say nor you to hear how much matter of fancy such love must have been towards one whom she knew but for a few short months though her pure sweet dreams through these long years have moulded him into a hero  boys i verily believe ye love her truly  would it be well for her still to mourn and cherish a dream while yet in her fresh age capable of new happiness fuller than she has ever enjoyed  she is happy with us rejoined ebbo  and ye are good lads and loving sons though less duteous in manner than i could wish  but look you you may not ever be with her and when ye are absent in camp or court or contracting a wedlock of your own would you leave her to her lonesome life in your solitary castle  friedels unselfishness might have been startled but ebbo boldly answered all mine is hers  no joy to me but shall be a joy to her we can make her happier than could any stranger  is it not so friedel  it is said friedel thoughtfully  ah rash bloods promising beyond what ye can keep  nature will be too strong for you  love your mother as ye may what will she be to you when a bride comes in your way  fling not away in wrath sir baron it was so with your parents both before you and what said the law of the good god at the first marriage  how can you withstand the nature he has given  belike i may wed said ebbo bluntly but if it be not for my mothers happiness call me mansworn knight  not so goodhumouredly answered gottfried but boysworn paladin who talks of he knows not what  speak knightly truth sir baron and own that this opposition is in verity from distaste to a stepfathers rule  i own that i will not brook such rule said ebbo nor do i know what we have done to deserve that it should be thrust on us  you have never blamed friedel at least and verily uncle my mothers eye will lead me where a strangers hand shall never drive me  did i even think she had for this man a quarter of the love she bears to my dead father i would strive for endurance but in good sooth we found her in tears praying us to guard her from him  i may be a boy but i am man enough to prevent her from being coerced  was this so friedel asked master gottfried moved more than by all that had gone before  ach i thought ye all wiser  and spake she not of sir kasimirs offersinterest with the romish king yea and a grant of nobility and arms to this house so as to fill the blank in your scutcheon  my father never asked if she were noble said ebbo  nor will i barter her for a cantle of a shield  there spake a manly spirit said his uncle delighted  her worth hath taught thee how little to prize these gewgaws  yet if you look to mingling with your own proud kind ye may fall among greater slights than ye can brook  it may matter less to you sir baron but friedel here ay and your sons will be ineligible to the choicest orders of knighthood and the canonries and chapters that are honourable endowments  friedel looked as if he could bear it and eberhard said the order of the dove of adlerstein is enough for us  headstrong all headstrong all sighed master gottfried  one romantic marriage has turned all your heads  the baron of adlerstein wildschloss unprepared for the opposition that awaited him was riding down the street equipped point device and with a goodly train of followers in brilliant suits  private wooing did not enter into the honest ideas of the burghers and the suitor was ushered into the full family assembly where christina rose and came forward a few steps to meet him curtseying as low as he bowed as he said lady i have preferred my suit to you through your honourworthy uncle who is good enough to stand my friend  you are over good sir  i feel the honour but a second wedlock may not be mine  now murmured ebbo to his brother as the knight and lady seated themselves in full view now will the smoothtongued fellow talk her out of her senses  alack that gipsy prophecy  wildschloss did not talk like a young wooer such days were over for both but he spoke as a grave and honourable man deeply penetrated with true esteem and affection  he said that at their first meeting he had been struck with her sweetness and discretion and would soon after have endeavoured to release her from her durance but that he was bound by the contract already made with the trautbachs who were dangerous neighbours to wildschloss  he had delayed his distasteful marriage as long as possible and it had caused him nothing but trouble and strife his children would not live and thekla the only survivor was as his sole heiress a mark for the cupidity of her uncle the count of trautbach and his almost savage son lassla while the right to the wildschloss barony would become so doubtful between her and ebbo as heir of the male line that strife and bloodshed would be wellnigh inevitable  these causes made it almost imperative that he should remarry and his own strong preference and regard for little thekla directed his wishes towards the freiherrinn von adlerstein  he backed his suit with courtly compliments as well as with representations of his childs need of a mothers training and the twins equal want of fatherly guidance dilating on the benefits he could confer on them  christina felt his kindness and had full trust in his intentions no was a difficult syllable to her but she had that within her which could not accept him and she firmly told him that she was too much bound to both her eberhards  but there was no daunting him nor preventing her uncle and aunt from encouraging him  he professed that he would wait and give her time to consider and though she reiterated that consideration would not change her mind master gottfried came forward to thank him and express his confidence of bringing her to reason  while i sir said ebbo with flashing eyes and low but resentful voice beg to decline the honour in the name of the elder house of adlerstein  he held himself upright as a dart but was infinitely annoyed by the little mocking bow and smile that he received in return as sir kasimir with his long mantle swept out of the apartment attended by master gottfried  burgomaster sorel said the boy standing in the middle of the floor as his uncle returned let me hear whether i am a person of any consideration in this family or not  nephew baron quietly replied master gottfried it is not the use of us germans to be dictated to by youths not yet arrived at years of discretion  then mother said ebbo we leave this place tomorrow morn  and at her nod of assent the housefather looked deeply grieved the housemother began to clamour about ingratitude  not so answered ebbo fiercely  we quit the house as poor as we came in homespun and with the old mare  peace ebbo said his mother rising peace i entreat house mother pardon uncle i pray thee  o why will not all who love me let me follow that which i believe to be best  child said her uncle i cannot see thee domineered over by a youth whose whole conduct shows his need of restraint  nor am i said christina  it is i who am utterly averse to this offer  my sons and i are one in that and uncle if i pray of you to consent to let us return to our castle it is that i would not see the visit that has made us so happy stained with strife and dissension  sure sure you cannot be angered with my son for his love for me  for the selfseeking of his love said master gottfried  it is to gratify his own pride that he first would prevent thee from being enriched and ennobled and now would bear thee away to the scant nay freiherr i will not seem to insult you but resentment would make you cruel to your mother  not cruel said friedel hastily  my mother is willing  and verily good uncle methinks that we all were best at home  we have benefited much and greatly by our stay we have learnt to love and reverence you but we are wild mountaineers at the best and while our hearts are fretted by the fear of losing our sweet mother we can scarce be as patient or submissive as if we had been bred up by a stern father  we have ever judged and acted for ourselves and it is hard to us not to do so still when our minds are chafed  friedel said ebbo sternly i will have no pardon asked for maintaining my mothers cause  do not thou learn to be smooth tongued  o thou wrongheaded boy half groaned master gottfried  why did not all this fall out ten years sooner when thou wouldst have been amenable  yet after all i do not know that any noble training has produced a more highminded loving youth he added half relenting as he looked at the gallant earnest face full of defiance indeed but with a certain wistful appealing glance at the motherling softening the liquid lustrous dark eye  get thee gone boy i would not quarrel with you and it may be as friedel says that we are best out of one anothers way  you are used to lord it and i can scarce make excuses for you  then said ebbo scarce appeased i take home my mother and you sir cease to favour kasimirs suit  no sir baron  i cease not to think that nothing would be so much for your good  it is because i believe that a return to your own old castle will best convince you all that i will not vex your mother by further opposing your departure  when you perceive your error may it only not be too late  such a protector is not to be found every day  my mother shall never need any protector save myself said ebbo but sir she loves you and owes all to you  therefore i will not be at strife with you and there is my hand  he said it as if he had been the emperor reconciling himself to all the hanse towns in one  master gottfried could scarce refrain from shrugging his shoulders and hausfrau johanna was exceedingly angry with the petulant pride and insolence of the young noble but in effect all were too much relieved to avoid an absolute quarrel with the fiery lad to take exception at minor matters  the old burgher was forbearing christina who knew how much her son must have swallowed to bring him to this concession for love of her thought him a hero worthy of all sacrifices and peacemaking friedel by his aunts side soon softened even her by some of the persuasive arguments that old dames love from gracious graceful greatnephews  and when by and by master gottfried went out to call on sir kasimir and explain how he had thought it best to yield to the hot tempered lad and let the family learn how to be thankful for the goods they had rejected he found affairs in a state that made him doubly anxious that the young barons should be safe on their mountain without knowing of them  the trautbach family had heard of wildschlosss designs and they had set abroad such injurious reports respecting the lady of adlerstein that sir kasimir was in the act of inditing a cartel to be sent by count kaulwitz to demand an explanationnot merely as the ladys suitor but as the only adlerstein of full age  now if ebbo had heard of the rumour he would certainly have given the lie direct and taken the whole defence on himself and it may be feared that just as his cause might have been master gottfrieds faith did not stretch to believing that it would make his sixteenyearold arm equal to the brutal might of lassla of trautbach  so he heartily thanked the baron of wildschloss agreed with him that the young knights were not as yet equal to the maintenance of the cause and went home again to watch carefully that no report reached either of his nephews  nor did he breathe freely till he had seen the little party ride safe off in the early morning in much more lordly guise than when they had entered the city  as to wildschloss and his nephew of trautbach in spite of their relationship they had a sharp combat on the borders of their own estates in which both were severely wounded but sir kasimir with the misericorde in his grasp forced lassla to retract whatever he had said in dispraise of the lady of adlerstein  wily old gottfried took care that the tidings should be sent in a form that might at once move christina with pity and gratitude towards her champion and convince her sons that the adversary was too much hurt for them to attempt a fresh challenge    chapter xvi  the eagle and the snake    the reconciliation made ebbo retract his hasty resolution of relinquishing all the benefits resulting from his connection with the sorel family and his mothers fortune made it possible to carry out many changes that rendered the castle and its inmates far more prosperous in appearance than had ever been the case before christina had once again the appliances of a wirthschaft such as she felt to be the suitable and becoming appurtenance of a rightminded frau gentle or simple and she felt so much the happier and more respectable  a chaplain had also been secured  the youths had insisted on his being capable of assisting their studies and a good man had been found who was fearfully learned having studied at all possible universities but then failing as a teacher because he was so dreamy and absent as to be incapable of keeping the unruly students in order  jobst schon was his proper name but he was translated into jodocus pulcher  the chapel was duly adorned the hall and other chambers were fitted up with some degree of comfort the castle court was cleansed the cattle sheds removed to the rear and the serfs were presented with seed and offered payment in coin if they would give their labour in fencing and clearing the cornfield and vineyard which the barons were bent on forming on the sunny slope of the ravine  poverty was over thanks to the marriage portion and yet ebbo looked less happy than in the days when there was but a bare subsistence and he seemed to miss the full tide of city life more than did his brother who though he had enjoyed ulm more heartily at the time seemed to have returned to all his mountain delights with greater zest than ever  at his favourite tarn he revelled in the vast stillness with the greater awe for having heard the hum of men and his minstrel dreams had derived fresh vigour from contact with the active world  but as usual he was his brothers chief stay in the vexations of a reformer  the serfs had much rather their lord had turned out a freebooter than an improver  why should they sow new seeds when the old had sufficed their fathers  work beyond the regulated days when they scratched up the soil of his old enclosure was abhorrent to them  as to his offered coin they needed nothing it would buy and had rather bask in the sun or sleep in the smoke a vineyard had never been heard of on adlerstein mountain  it was clean contrary to his forefathers habits and all came of the bad drop of restless burgher blood that could not let honest folk rest  ebbo stormed not merely with words but blows became ashamed of his violence tried to atone for it by gifts and kind words and in return was sulkily told that he would bring more good to the village by rolling the fiery wheel straight down hill at the wake than by all his newfangled ways  had not koppel and a few younger men been more open to influence his agricultural schemes could hardly have begun but friedels persuasions were not absolutely without success and every rood that was dug was achieved by his patience and perseverance  next came home the graf von schlangenwald  he had of late inhabited his castle in styria but in a fierce quarrel with some of his neighbours he had lost his eldest son and the pacification enforced by the king of the romans had so galled and infuriated him that he had deserted that part of the country and returned to swabia more fierce and bitter than ever  thenceforth began a petty border warfare such as had existed when christina first knew adlerstein but had of late died out  the shepherd lad came home weeping with wrath three mounted schlangenwaldern had driven off his four best sheep and beaten himself with their halberds though he was safe on adlerstein ground  then a light thrown by a schlangenwald reiter consumed all jobsts pile of wood  the swine did not come home and were found with spears sticking in them the great broadhorned bull that ebbo had brought from the pastures of ulm vanished from the alp below the gemsbocks pass and was known to be salted for winter use at schlangenwald  still christina tried to persuade her sons that this might be only the retainers violence and induced ebbo to write a letter complaining of the outrages but not blaming the count only begging that his followers might be better restrained  the letter was conveyed by a lay brotherno other messenger being safe  ebbo had protested from the first that it would be of no use but he waited anxiously for the answer  thus it stood when conveyed to him by a tenant of the ruprecht cloister  wot you eberhard freiherr von adlerstein that your house have injured me by thought word and deed  your greatgrandfather usurped my lands at the ford  your grandfather stole my cattle and burnt my mills  then in the war he slew my brother johann and lamed for life my cousin matthias  your father slew eight of my retainers and spoiled my crops  you yourself claim my land at the ford and secure the spoil which is justly mine  therefore do i declare war and feud against you  therefore to you and all yours to your helpers and helpers helpers am i a foe  and thereby shall i have maintained my honour against you and yours  wolfgang graf von schlangenwald hierom graf von schlangenwaldhis cousin c c c   and a long list of names all connected with schlangenwald followed and a large seal bearing the snake of schlangenwald was appended thereto  the old miscreant burst out ebbo it is a feud brief  a feud brief exclaimed friedel they are no longer according to the law  lawwhat cares he for law or mercy either  is this the way men act by the league  did we not swear to send no more feud letters nor have recourse to fistright  we must appeal to the markgraf of wurtemburg said friedel  it was the only measure in their power though ebbo winced at it but his oaths were recent and his conscience would not allow him to transgress them by doing himself justice  besides neither party could take the castle of the other and the only reprisals in his power would have been on the defenceless peasants of schlangenwald he must therefore lay the whole matter before the markgraf who was the head of the swabian league and bound to redress his wrongs  he made his arrangements without faltering selecting the escort who were to accompany him and insisting on leaving friedel to guard his mother and the castle  he would not for the world have admitted the suggestion that the counsel and introduction of adlerstein wildschloss would have been exceedingly useful to him  poor christina  it was a great deal too like that former departure and her heart was heavy within her  friedel was equally unhappy at letting his brother go without him but it was quite necessary that he and the few armed men who remained should show themselves at all points open to the enemy in the course of the day lest the freiherrs absence should be remarked  he did his best to cheer his mother by reminding her that ebbo was not likely to be taken at unawares as their father had been and he shared the prayers and chapel services in which she poured out her anxiety  the blue banner came safe up the pass again but wurtemburg had been formally civil to the young freiherr but he had laughed at the fend letter as a mere oldfashioned habit of schangenwalds that it was better not to notice and he evidently regarded the stealing of a bull or the misusing of a serf as far too petty a matter for his attention  it was as if a judge had been called by a crying child to settle a nursery quarrel  he told ebbo that being a free baron of the empire he must keep his bounds respected he was free to take and hang any spoiler he could catch but his bulls were his own affair  the league was not for such gear  and a knight who had ridden out of stuttgard with ebbo had told him that it was no wonder that this had been his reception for not only was schlangenwald an old intimate of the markgraf but swabia was claimed as a fief of wurtemburg so that ebbos direct homage to the emperor without the interposition of the markgraf had made him no object of favour  what could be done asked ebbo  fire some schlangenwald hamlet and teach him to respect yours said the knight  the poor serfs are guiltless  ha ha as if they would not rob any of yours  give and take thats the way the empire wags sir baron  send him a feud letter in return with a goodly file of names at its foot and teach him to respect you  but i have sworn to abstain from fistright  much you gain by so abstaining  if the league will not take the trouble to right you right yourself  i shall appeal to the emperor and tell him how his league is administered  young sir if the emperor were to guard every cow in his domains he would have enough to do  you will never prosper with him without some one to back your cause better than that free tongue of yours hast no sister that thou couldst give in marriage to a stout baron that could aid you with strong arm and prudent head  i have only one twin brother  ah the twins of adlerstein  i remember me  was not the other adlerstein seeking an alliance with your lady mother  sure no better aid could be found  he is hand and glove with young king max  that may never be said ebbo haughtily  and sure that he should receive the same advice he decided against turning aside to consult his uncle at ulm and returned home in a mood that rejoiced heinz and hatto with hopes of the old days while it filled his mother with dreary dismay and apprehension  schlangenwald should suffer next time he transgressed said ebbo it should not again be said that he himself was a coward who appealed to the law because his hand could not keep his head  the next time was when the first winter cold was setting in  a party of reitern came to harry an outlying field where ulrich had raised a scanty crop of rye  tidings reached the castle in such good time that the two brothers with heinz the two ulm grooms koppel and a troop of serfs fell on the marauders before they had effected much damage and while some remained to trample out the fire the rest pursued the enemy even to the village of schlangenwald  burn it herr freiherr cried heinz hot with victory  let them learn how to make havoc of our corn  but a host of halfnaked beings rushed out shrieking about sick children bedridden grandmothers and crippled fathers and falling on their knees with their hands stretched out to the young barons ebbo turned away his head with hot tears in his eyes  friedel what can we do  not barbarous murder said friedel  but they brand us for cowards  the cowardice were in striking here and friedel sprang to withhold koppel who had lighted a bundle of dried fern ready to thrust into the thatch  peasants said ebbo with the same impulse i spare you  you did not this wrong  but bear word to your lord that if he will meet me with lance and sword he will learn the valour of adlerstein  the serfs flung themselves before him in transports of gratitude but he turned hastily away and strode up the mountain his cheek glowing as he remembered too late that his defiance would be scoffed at as a boys vaunt  by and by he arrived at the hamlet where he found a prisoner a scowling abject fellow already well beaten and now held by two serfs  the halter is ready herr freiherr said old ulrich and yon rowan stump is still as stout as when your herr grandsire hung three lanzknechts on it in one day  we only waited your bidding  quick then and let me hear no more said ebbo about to descend the pass as if hastening from the execution of a wolf taken in a gin  has he seen the priest asked friedel  the peasants looked as if this were one of sir friedels unaccountable fancies  ebbo paused frowned and muttered but seeing a move as if to drag the wretch towards the stunted bush overhanging an abyss he shouted hold ulrich  little hans do thou run down to the castle and bring father jodocus to do his office  the serfs were much disgusted  it never was so seen before herr freiherr remonstrated heinz fang and hang was ever the word  what shrift had my lords father or mine added koppel  look you said ebbo turning sharply  if schlangenwald be a godless ruffian pitiless alike to soul and body is that a cause that i should stain myself too  it were true vengeance growled koppel  and now grumbled ulrich will my lady hear and there will be feeble pleadings for the vermins life  like mutterings ensued the purport of which was caught by friedel and made him say to ebbo who would again have escaped the disagreeableness of the scene we had better tarry at hand  unless we hold the folk in some check there will be no right execution they will torture him to death ere the priest comes  ebbo yielded and began to pace the scanty area of the flat rock where the needfire was wont to blaze  after a time he exclaimed friedel how couldst ask me  knowst not that it sickens me to see a mountain cat killed save in full chase  and thouwhy thou art white as the snow crags  better conquer the folly than that he there should be put to needless pain said friedel but with labouring breath that showed how terrible was the prospect to his imaginative soul not inured to deathscenes like those of his fellows  just then a mocking laugh broke forth  ha cried ebbo looking keenly down what do ye there  fang and hang may be fair fang and torment is base  what was it lieschen  only herr freiherr the caitiff craved drink and the fleischerinn gave him a cup from the stream behind the slaughterhouse where we killed the swine  fit for the like of him  by heavens when i forbade torture cried ebbo leaping from the rock in time to see the disgusting draught held to the lips of the captive whose hands were twisted back and bound with cruel tightness for the german boor once roused from his lazy good nature was doubly savage from stolidity  wretches cried ebbo striking right and left with the back of his sword among the serfs and then cutting the thong that was eating into the prisoners flesh while friedel caught up a wooden bowl filled it with pure water and offered it to the captive who drank deeply  now said ebbo hast ought to say for thyself  a low curse against things in general was the only answer  what brought thee here continued ebbo in hopes of extracting some excuse for pardon but the prisoner only hung his head as one stupefied brutally indifferent and hardened against the mere trouble of answering  not another word could be extracted and ebbos position was very uncomfortable keeping guard over his condemned felon with the sulky peasants herding round in fear of being balked of their prey and the reluctance growing on him every moment to taking life in cold blood  right of life and death was a heavy burden to a youth under seventeen unless he had been thoughtless and reckless and from this ebbo had been prevented by his peculiar life the lion cub had never tasted blood  the situation was prolonged beyond expectation  many a time had the brothers paced their platform of rock the criminal had fallen into a dose and women and boys were murmuring that they must call home their kine and goats and it was a shame to debar them of the sight of the hanging long before hans came back between crying and stammering to say that father jodocus had fallen into so deep a study over his book that he only muttered coming then went into another musing fit whence no one could rouse him to do more than say coming  let him wait  i must go and bring him if the thing is to be done said friedel  and let it last all night was the answer  no if the man were to die it should be at once not by inches  hark thee rogue stirring him with his foot  well sir said the man is the hanging ready yet  youve been long enough about it for us to have twisted the necks of every adlerstein of you all  look thee caitiff said ebbo thou meritest the rope as well as any wolf on the mountain but we have kept thee so long in suspense that if thou canst say a word for thy life or pledge thyself to meddle no more with my lands ill consider of thy doom  you have had plenty of time to consider it growled the fellow  a murmur followed by a wrathful shout rose among the villagers letting off the villain  no  no  out upon him  he dares not  dare thundered ebbo with flashing eyes  rascals as ye are think ye to hinder me from daring  your will to be mine  there fellow away with thee  up to the gemsbocks pass  and whoso would follow him let him do so at his peril  the prisoner was prompt to gather himself up and rush like a hunted animal to the path at the entrance of which stood both twins with drawn swords to defend the escape  of course no one ventured to follow and surly discontented murmurs were the sole result as the peasants dispersed  ebbo sheathing his sword and putting his arm into his brothers said  what friedel turned stonyhearted hadst never a word for the poor caitiff  i knew thou wouldst never do the deed said friedel smiling  it was such wretched prey said ebbo  yet shall i be despised for this  would that thou hadst let me string him up shriftless as any other man had done and there would have been an end of it  and even his mothers satisfaction did not greatly comfort ebbo for he was of the age to feel more ashamed of a solecism than a crime christina perceived that this was one of his most critical periods of life baited as he was by the enemy of his race and feeling all the disadvantages which heart and conscience gave him in dealing with a man who had neither at a time when public opinion was always with the most masterful  the necessity of arming his retainers and having fighting men as a guard were additional temptations to hereditary habits of violence and that so proud and fiery a nature as his should never become involved in them was almost beyond hope  even present danger seemed more around than ever before  the estate was almost in a state of siege and christina never saw her sons quit the castle without thinking of their fathers fate and passing into the chapel to entreat for their return unscathed in body or soul  the snow which she had so often hailed as a friend was never more welcome than this winter not merely as shutting the enemy out and her sons in but as cutting off all danger of a visit from her suitor who would now come armed with his late sufferings in her behalf and moreover with all the urgent need of a wise and respected head and protector for her sons  yet the more evident the expediency became the greater grew her distaste  still the lonely life weighed heavily on ebbo  lighthearted friedel was ever busy and happy were he chasing the grim winter gamethe bear and wolfwith his brother fencing in the hall learning greek with the chaplain reading or singing to his mother or carving graceful angel forms to adorn the chapel  or he could at all times soar into a minstrel dream of pure chivalrous semiallegorical romance sometimes told over the glowing embers to his mother and brother  all that came to friedel was joy from battling with the bear on a frozen rock to persuading rude little hans to come to the frau freiherrinn to learn his paternoster  but the elder twin might hunt might fence might smile or kindle at his brothers lay but ever with a restless gloom on him a doubt of the future which made him impatient of the present and led to a sharpness and hastiness of manner that broke forth in anger at slight offences  the matrons coif succeeding the widows veil friedel heard him muttering even in sleep and more than once listened to it as ebbo leant over the battlementsas he looked over the white world to the gray mist above the city of ulm  thou who mockest my forebodings and fancies to dwell on that gipsy augury argued friedel  as thou saidst at the time wildschlosss looks gave shrewd cause for it  the answer is in mine own heart answered ebbo  since our stay at ulm i have ever felt as though the sweet motherling were less my own  and the same with my house and lands  rule as i will a mocking laugh comes back to me saying  thou art but a boy sir baron thou dost but play at lords and knights  if i had hung yon rogue of a reiter i wonder if i had felt my grasp more real  nay said friedel glancing from the sparkling white slopes to the pure blue above our whole life is but a play at lords and knights with the blessed saints as witnesses of our sport in the tiltyard  were it merely that said ebbo impatiently i were not so galled something hangs over us friedel  i long that these snows would melt that i might at least know what it is    chapter xvii  bridging the ford    the snow melted the torrent became a flood then contracted itself but was still a broad stream when one spring afternoon ebbo showed his brother some wains making for the ford adding it cannot be rightly passable  they will come to loss  i shall get the men together to aid them  he blew a blast on his horn and added the knaves will be alert enough if they hope to meddle with honest mens luggage  see and friedel pointed to the thicket to the westward of the meadow around the stream where the beech trees were budding but not yet forming a full mass of verdure is not the snake in the wood methinks i spy the glitter of his scales  by heavens the villains are lying in wait for the travellers at our landingplace cried ebbo and again raising the bugle to his lips he sent forth three notes well known as a call to arms  their echoes came back from the rocks followed instantly by lusty jodels and the brothers rushed into the hall to take down their light headpieces and corslets answering in haste their mothers startled questions by telling of the endangered travellers and the schlangenwald ambush  she looked white and trembled but said no word to hinder them only as she clasped friedels corslet she entreated them to take fuller armour  we must speed the short way down the rock said ebbo and cannot be cumbered with heavy harness  sweet motherling fear not but let a meal be spread for our rescued captives  ho heinz tis against the schlangenwald rascals  art too stiff to go down the rock path  no nor down the abyss could i strike a good stroke against schlangenwald at the bottom of it quoth heinz  nor see vermin set free by the freiherr growled koppel but the words were lost in ebbos loud commands to the men as friedel and hatto handed down the weapons to them  the convoy had by this time halted evidently to try the ford  a horseman crossed and found it practicable for a waggon proceeded to make the attempt  now is our time said ebbo who was standing on the narrow ledge between the castle and the precipitous path leading to the meadow one waggon may get over but the second or third will stick in the ruts that it leaves  now we will drop from our crag and if the snake falls on them why then for a pounce of the eagle  the two young knights so goodly in their bright steel knelt for their mothers blessing and then sprang like chamois down the ivy twined steep followed by their men and were lost to sight among the bushes and rocks  yet even while her frame quivered with fear her heart swelled at the thought what a gulf there was between these days and those when she had hidden her face in despair while ermentrude watched the debateable ford  she watched now in suspense indeed but with exultation instead of shame as two waggons safely crossed but the third stuck fast and presently turned over in the stream impelled sideways by the efforts of the struggling horses  then amid endeavours to disentangle the animals and succour the driver the travellers were attacked by a party of armed men who dashed out of the beechwood and fell on the main body of the waggons which were waiting on the bit of bare shingly soil that lay between the new and old channels  a wild melee was all that christina could seeweapons raised horses starting men rushing from the river while the clang and the shout rose even to the castle  hark  out rings the clear call the eagle to the rescue  there they speed over the meadow the two slender forms with glancing helms  o overrun not the followers rush not into needless danger there is koppel almost up with them with his big axeheinzs broad shoulders near  heaven strike with them  visit not their forefathers sin on those pure spirits  some are flying  some one has fallen  o heavens on which side  ah it is into the schlangenwald woods that the fugitives direct their flight  three fourthe whole troop pursued  go not too far  run not into needless risk  your work is done and gallantly  well done young knights of adlerstein  which of you is it that stands pointing out safe standingground for the men that are raising the waggon  which of you is it who stands in converse with a burgher form  thanks and blessings the lads are safe and full knightly hath been their first emprise  a quarter of an hour later a gay step mounted the ascent and friedels bright face laughed from his helmet  there mother will you crown your knights  could you see ebbo bear down the chief squire for the old snake was not there himself  and whom do you think we rescued besides a whole band of venetian traders to whom he had joined himself  why my uncles friend the architect of whom he used to speakmaster moritz schleiermacher  moritz schleiermacher  i knew him as a boy  he had been laying out a lustgarten for the romish king at innspruck and he is a stout man of his hands and attempted defence but he had such a shrewd blow before we came up that he lay like one dead and when he was lifted up he gazed at us like one moonstruck and said are my eyes dazed or are these the twins of adlerstein that are as like as face to mirror  lads lads your uncle looked not to hear of you acting in this sort  but soon we and his people let him know how it was and that eagles do not have the manner of snakes  poor master moritz  is he much hurt  is ebbo bringing him up hither  no mother he is but giddied and stunned and now must you send down store of sausage sourkraut meat wine and beer for the wains cannot all cross till daylight and we must keep ward all night lest the schlangenwalden should fall on them again  plenty of good cheer mother to make a right merry watch  take heed friedel mine a merry watch is scarce a safe one  even so sweet motherling and therefore must ebbo and i share it you must mete out your liquor wisely you see enough for the credit of adlerstein and enough to keep out the marsh fog yet not enough to make us snore too soundly  i am going to take my lute it would be using it ill not to let it enjoy such a chance as a midnight watch  so away went the lighthearted boy and by and by christina saw the red watchfire as she gazed from her turret window  she would have been pleased to see how marshalled by a merchant who had crossed the desert from egypt to palestine the waggons were ranged in a circle and the watches told off while the food and drink were carefully portioned out  freiherr ebbo on his own ground as champion and host was far more at ease than in the city and became very friendly with the merchants and architect as they sat round the bright fire conversing or at times challenging the mountain echoes by songs to the sound of friedels lute  when the stars grew bright most lay down to sleep in the waggons while others watched pacing up and down till karls waggon should be over the mountain and the vigil was relieved  no disturbance took place and at sunrise a hasty meal was partaken of and the work of crossing the river was set in hand  pity said moritz the architect that this ford were not spanned by a bridge to the avoiding of danger and spoil  who could build such a bridge asked ebbo  yourself herr freiherr in union with us burghers of ulm  it were well worth your while to give land and stone and ours to give labour and skill provided we fixed a toll on the passage which would be willingly paid to save peril and delay  the brothers caught at the idea and the merchants agreed that such a bridge would be an inestimable boon to all traffickers between constance ulm and augsburg and would attract many travellers who were scared away by the evil fame of the debateable ford  master moritz looked at the stone of the mountain pronounced it excellent material and already sketched the span of the arches with a view to winter torrents  as to the site the best was on the firm ground above the ford but here only one side was adlerstein while on the other ebbo claimed both banks and it was probable that an equally sound foundation could be obtained only with more cost and delay  after this survey the travellers took leave of the barons promising to write when their fellowcitizens should have been sounded as to the bridge and ebbo remained in high spirits with such brilliant purposes that he had quite forgotten his gloomy forebodings  peace instead of war at home he said with the revenue it will bring i will build a mill and set our lads to work so that they may become less dull and doltish than their parents  then will we follow the emperor with a train that none need despise  no one will talk now of adlerstein not being able to take care of himself  letters came from ulm saying that the guilds of mercers and wine merchants were delighted with the project and invited the baron of adlerstein to a council at the rathhaus  master sorel begged the mother to come with her sons to be his guest but fearing the neighbourhood of sir kasimir she remained at home with heinz for her seneschal while her sons rode to the city  there ebbo found that his late exploit and his future plan had made him a person of much greater consideration than on his last visit and he demeaned himself with far more ease and affability in consequence  he had affairs on his hands too and felt more than one year older  the two guilds agreed to build the bridge and share the toll with the baron in return for the ground and materials but they preferred the plan that placed one pier on the schlangenwald bank and proposed to write to the count an offer to include him in the scheme awarding him a share of the profits in proportion to his contribution however vexed at the turn affairs had taken ebbo could offer no valid objection and was obliged to affix his signature to the letter in company with the guildmasters  it was despatched by the city pursuivants    the only men who safe might ride   their errands on the border side and a meeting was appointed in the rathhaus for the day of their expected return  the higher burghers sat on their carved chairs in the grand old hall the lesser magnates on benches and ebbo in an elbowed seat far too spacious for his slender proportions met a glance from friedel that told him his merry brother was thinking of the frog and the ox  the pursuivants enteredhardy shrewdlooking men with the city arms decking them wherever there was room for them  honourworthy sirs they said no letter did the graf von schlangenwald return  sent he no message demanded moritz schleiermacher  yea worthy sir but scarce befitting this reverend assembly  on being pressed however it was repeated  the lord count was pleased to swear at what he termed the insolence of the city in sending him heralds as if said he the dogs your worships were his equals  then having cursed your worships he reviled the crooked writing of herr clerk diedrichson and called his chaplain to read it to him  herr priest could scarce read three lines for his foul language about the ford  never said he would he consent to raising a bridgea mean trick so said he for defrauding him of his rights to what the flood sent him  but asked ebbo took he no note of our explanation that if he give not the upper bank we will build lower where both sides are my own  he passed it not entirely over replied the messenger  what said hethe very words demanded ebbo with the paling cheek and low voice that made his passion often seem like patience  he saidthe herr freiherr will pardon me for repeating the words he said tell the misproud mongrel of adlerstein that he had best sit firm in his own saddle ere meddling with his betters and if he touch one pebble of the braunwasser he will rue it  and before your cityfolk take up with him or his they had best learn whether he have any right at all in the case  his right is plain said master gottfried full proofs were given in and his investiture by the kaisar forms a title in itself  it is mere bravado and an endeavour to make mischief between the baron and the city  even so did i explain herr guildmaster said the pursuivant but pardon me the count laughed me to scorn and quoth he asked the kaisar for proof of his fathers death  mere mischiefmaking as before said master gottfried while his nephews started with amaze  his fathers death was proved by an eyewitness whom you still have in your train have you not herr freiherr  yea replied ebbo he is at adlerstein now heinrich bauermann called the schneiderlein a lanzknecht who alone escaped the slaughter and from whom we have often heard how my father died choked in his own blood from a deep breastwound immediately after he had sent home his last greetings to my lady mother  was the corpse restored asked the able rathsherr ulrich  no said ebbo  almost all our retainers had perished and when a friar was sent to the hostel to bring home the remains it appeared that the treacherous foe had borne them offnay my grandfathers head was sent to the diet  the whole assembly agreed that the count could only mean to make the absence of direct evidence about a murder committed eighteen years ago tell in sowing distrust between the allies  the suggestion was not worth a thought and it was plain that no site would be available except the debateable strand  to this however ebbos title was assailable both on account of his minority as well as his fathers unproved death and of the disputed claim to the ground  the rathsherr master gottfried and others therefore recommended deferring the work till the baron should be of age when on again tendering his allegiance he might obtain a distinct recognition of his marches  but this policy did not consort with the quick spirit of moritz schleiermacher nor with the convenience of the mercers and winemerchants who were constant sufferers by the want of a bridge and afraid of waiting four years in which a lad like the baron might return to the nominal instincts of his class or the braunwasser might take back the land it had given whilst ebbo himself was urgent with all the defiant fire of youth to begin building at once in spite of all gainsayers  strife and blood will it cost said master sorel gravely  what can be had worth the having save at cost of strife and blood said ebbo with a glance of fire  youth speaks of counting the cost  little knows it what it saith sighed master gottfried  nay returned the rathsherr were it otherwise who would have the heart for enterprise  so the young knights mounted and had ridden about half the way in silence when ebbo exclaimed friedeland as his brother started what art musing on  what thou art thinking of said friedel turning on him an eye that had not only something of the brightness but of the penetration of a sunbeam  i do not think thereon at all said ebbo gloomily  it is a figment of the old serpent to hinder us from snatching his prey from him  nevertheless said friedel i cannot but remember that the genoese merchant of old told us of a german noble sold by his foes to the moors  folly  that tale was too recent to concern my father  i did not think it did said friedel but mayhap that nobles family rest equally certain of his death  pfui said ebbo hotly hast not heard fifty times how he died even in speaking and how heinz crossed his hands on his breast what wouldst have more  hardly even that said friedel slightly smiling  tush hastily returned his brother i meant only by way of proof would an honest old fellow like heinz be a deceiver  not wittingly  yet i would fain ride to that hostel and make inquiries  the traitor host met his deserts and was broken on the wheel for murdering a pedlar a year ago said ebbo  i would i knew where my father was buried for then would i bring his corpse honourably back but as to his being a living man i will not have it spoken of to trouble my mother  to trouble her exclaimed friedel  to trouble her repeated ebbo  long since hath passed the pang of his loss and there is reason in what old sorel says that he must have been a rugged untaught savage with little in common with the gentle one and that tender memory hath decked him out as he never could have been  nay friedel it is but sense  what could a man have been under the granddames breeding  it becomes not thee to say so returned friedel  nay he could learn to love our mother  one sign of grace but doubtless she loved him the better for their having been so little together  her heart is at peace believing him in his grave but let her imagine him in schlangenwalds dungeon or some moorish galley if thou likest it better and how will her mild spirit be rent  it might be so said friedel thoughtfully  it may be best to keep this secret from her till we have fuller certainty  agreed then said ebbo unless the wildschloss fellow should again molest us when his answer is ready  is this just towards my mother said friedel  just  what meanst thou  is it not our office and our dearest right to shield our mother from care  and is not her chief wish to be rid of the wildschloss suit  nevertheless ebbo was moody all the way home but when there he devoted himself in his most eager and winning way to his mother telling her of master gottfrieds woodcuts and hausfrau johannas rheumatism and of all the news of the country in especial that the kaisar was at lintz very ill with a gangrene in his leg said to have been caused by his habit of always kicking doors open and that his doctors thought of amputation a horrible idea in the fifteenth century  the young baron was evidently bent on proving that no one could make his mother so happy as he could and he was not far wrong there  friedel however could not rest till he had followed heinz to the stable and speaking over the back of the old white mare the only other survivor of the massacre had asked him once more for the particulars a tale he was never loth to tell but when friedel further demanded whether he was certain of having seen the death of his younger lord he replied as if hurt  what think you i would have quitted him while life was yet in him  no certainly good heinz yet i would fain know by what tokens thou knewest his death  ah  sir friedel when you have seen a stricken field or two you will not ask how i know death from life  is a swoon so utterly unlike death  i say not but that an inexperienced youth might be mistaken said heinz but for one who had learned the bloody trade it were impossible  why ask sir  because said friedel low and mysteriouslymy brother would not have my mother know it butcount schlangenwald demanded whether we could prove my fathers death  prove  he could not choose but die with three such wounds as the old ruffian knows  i shall bless the day sir friedmund when i see you or your brother give back those strokes  a heavy reckoning be his  we all deem that line only meant to cross our designs said friedel  yet heinz i would i knew how to find out what passed when thou wast gone  is there no servant at the innno retainer of schlangenwald that aught could be learnt from  by st gertrude roughly answered the schneiderlein if you cannot be satisfied with the oath of a man like me who would have given his life to save your father i know not what will please you  friedel with his wonted goodnature set himself to pacify the warrior with assurances of his trust yet while ebbo plunged more eagerly into plans for the bridgebuilding friedel drew more and more into his old world of musings and many a summer afternoon was spent by him at the ptarmigans mere in deep communings with himself as one revolving a purpose  christina could not but observe with a strange sense of foreboding that while one son was more than ever in the lonely mountain heights the other was far more at the base  master moritz schleiermacher was a constant guest at the castle and ebbo was much taken up with his companionship  he was a strong shrewd man still young but with much experience and he knew how to adapt himself to intercourse with the proud nobility preserving an independent bearing while avoiding all that haughtiness could take umbrage at and thus he was acquiring a greater influence over ebbo than was perceived by any save the watchful mother who began to fear lest her son was acquiring an infusion of worldly wisdom and eagerness for gain that would indeed be a severance between him and his brother  if she had known the real difference that unconsciously kept her sons apart her heart would have ached yet more    chapter xviii  friedmund in the clouds    the stone was quarried high on the mountain and a direct road was made for bringing it down to the waterside  the castle profited by the road in accessibility but its impregnability was so far lessened  however as ebbo said it was to be a friendly harbour instead of a robber crag and in case of need the communication could easily be destroyed  the blocks of stone were brought down and wooden sheds were erected for the workmen in the meadow  in august however came tidings that after two amputations of his diseased limb the kaisar friedrich iii had diedit was said from over free use of melons in the fever consequent on the operation his death was not likely to make much change in the government which had of late been left to his son  at this time the king of the romans for the title of kaisar was conferred only by coronation by the pope and this maximilian never received was at innspruck collecting troops for the deliverance of styria and carinthia from a horde of invading turks  the markgraf of wurtemburg sent an intimation to all the swabian league that the new sovereign would be best pleased if their homage were paid to him in his camp at the head of their armed retainers  here was the way of enterprise and honour open at last and the young barons of adlerstein eagerly prepared for it equipping their vassals and sending to ulm to take three or four menatarms into their pay so as to make up twenty lances as the contingent of adlerstein  it was decided that christina should spend the time of their absence at ulm whither her sons would escort her on their way to the camp  the last busy day was over and in the summer evening christina was sitting on the castle steps listening to ebbos eager talk of his plans of interesting his hero the king of the romans in his bridge and obtaining full recognition of his claim to the debateable strand where the busy workmen could be seen far below  presently ebbo as usual when left to himself grew restless for want of friedel and exclaiming the musing fit is on himhe will stay all night at the tarn if i fetch him not he set off in quest of him passing through the hamlet to look for him in the chapel on his way  not finding friedel there he was however some way up towards the tarn when he met his brother wearing the beamy yet awestruck look that he often brought from the mountain height yet with a steadfast expression of resolute purpose on his face  ah dreamer said ebbo i knew where to seek thee  ever in the clouds  yes i have been to the tarn said friedel throwing his arm round his brothers neck in their boyish fashion  it has been very dear to me and i longed to see its gray depths once more  once  yea manifold times shalt thou see them said ebbo schleiermacher tells me that these are no janissaries but a mere miscreant horde even by whom glory can scarce be gained and no peril at all  i know not said friedel but it is to me as if i were taking my leave of all these purple hollows and heavenlighted peaks cleaving the sky  all the more ebbo since i have made up my mind to a resolution  nay none of the old monkish fancies cried ebbo against them thou art sworn so long as i am true knight  no it is not the monkish fancy but i am convinced that it is my duty to strive to ascertain my fathers fate  hold i say not that it is thine  thou hast thy charge here  looking for a dead man growled ebbo a proper quest  not so returned friedel  at the camp it will surely be possible to learn through either schlangenwald or his men how it went with my father  men say that his surviving son the teutonic knight is of very different mould  he might bring something to light  were it proved to be as the schneiderlein avers then would our conscience be at rest but if he were in schlangenwalds dungeon  folly  impossible  yet men have pined eighteen years in dark vaults said friedel and when i think that so may he have wasted for the whole of our lives that have been so free and joyous on his own mountain it irks me to bound on the heather or gaze at the stars  if the serpent hath dared cried ebbo though it is mere folly to think of it we would summon the league and have his castle about his ears  not that i believe it  scarce do i said friedel but there haunts me evermore the description of the kindly german chained between the decks of the corsairs galley  once and again have i dreamt thereof  and ebbo recollect the prediction that so fretted thee  might not yon dark cheeked woman have had some knowledge of the east and its captives  ebbo started but resumed his former tone  so thou wouldst begin thine errantry like sir hildebert and sir hildebrand in the rose garden  have a care  such quests end in mortal conflict between the unknown father and son  i should know him said friedel enthusiastically or at least he would know my mothers son in me and could i no otherwise ransom him i would ply the oar in his stead  a fine exchange for my mother and me gloomily laughed ebbo to lose thee my sublimated self for a rude savage lord who would straightway undo all our work and rate and misuse our sweet mother for being more civilized than himself  shame ebbo cried friedel or art thou but in jest  so far in jest that thou wilt never go puissant sir hildebert returned ebbo drawing him closer  thou wilt learnas i also trust to doin what nameless hole the serpent hid his remains  then shall they be duly coffined and blazoned  all the monks in the cloisters for twenty miles round shall sing requiems and thou and i will walk bareheaded with candles in our hands by the bier till we rest him in the blessed friedmunds chapel and there lucas handlein shall carve his tomb and thou shalt sit for the likeness  so may it end said friedel but either i will know him dead or endeavour somewhat in his behalf  and that the need is real as well as the purpose blessed i have become the more certain for ebbo as i rose to descend the hill i saw on the cloud our patrons very formi saw myself kneel before him and receive his blessing  ebbo burst out laughing  now know i that it is indeed as saith schleiermacher he said and that these phantoms of the blessed friedmund are but shadows cast by the sun on the vapours of the ravine  see friedel i had gone to seek thee at the chapel and meeting father norbert i bent my knee that i might take his farewell blessing  i had the substance thou the shadow thou dreamer  friedel was as much mortified for the moment as his gentle nature could be  then he resumed his sweet smile saying be it so  i have oft read that men are too prone to take visions and special providences to themselves and now i have proved the truth of the saying  and said ebbo thou seest thy purpose is as baseless as thy vision  no ebbo  it grieves me to differ from thee but my resolve is older than the fancy and may not be shaken because i was vain enough to believe that the blessed friedmund could stoop to bless me  ha shouted ebbo glad to see an object on which to vent his secret annoyance  who goes there skulking round the rocks  here rogue what art after here  no harm sullenly replied a halfclad boy  whence art thou  from schlangenwald to spy what more we can be robbed of  the lash  hold interposed friedel  perchance the poor lad had no evil purposes  didst lose thy way  no sir my mother sent me  i thought so cried ebbo  this comes of sparing the nest of thankless adders  nay said friedel mayhap it is because they are not thankless that the poor fellow is here  sir said the boy coming nearer i will tell youyou i will tellnot him who threatens  mother said you spared our huts and the lady gave us bread when we came to the castle gate in winter and she would not see the reiters lay waste your folks doings down there without warning you  my good lad  what saidst thou cried ebbo but the boy seemed dumb before him and friedel repeated the question ere he answered  all the lanzknechts and reiters are at the castle and the herr graf has taken all my fathers young sheep for them a plague upon him  and our folk are warned to be at the muster rock tomorrow morn each with a bundle of straw and a pine brand and black berend heard the body squire say the herr graf had sworn not to go to the wars till every stick at the ford be burnt every stone drowned every workman hung  ebbo in a transport of indignation and gratitude thrust his hand into his pouch and threw the boy a handful of groschen while friedel gave warm thanks in the utmost haste ere both brothers sprang with headlong speed down the wild path to take advantage of the timely intelligence  the little council of war was speedily assembled consisting of the barons their mother master moritz schleiermacher heinz and hatto to bring up to the castle the workmen their families and the more valuable implements was at once decided and christina asked whether there would be anything left worth defending and whether the schlangenwalden might not expend their fury on the scaffold which could be newly supplied from the forest the huts which could be quickly restored and the stones which could hardly be damaged  the enemy must proceed to the camp in a day or two and the building would be less assailable by their return and besides it was scarcely lawful to enter on a private war when the imperial banner was in the field  craving your pardon gracious lady said the architect that blame rests with him who provokes the war  see lord baron there is time to send to ulm where the two guilds our allies will at once equip their trained bands and despatch them  we meanwhile will hold the knaves in check and by the time our burghers come up the snake brood will have had such a lesson as they will not soon forget  said i well herr freiherr  right bravely said ebbo  it consorts not with our honour or rights with my pledges to ulm or the fame of my house to shut ourselves up and see the rogues work their will scatheless  my own score of men besides the stouter masons carpenters and serfs will be fully enough to make the old serpent of the wood rue the day even without the aid of the burghers  not a word against it dearest mother  none is so wise as thou in matters of peace but honour is here concerned  my question is persevered the mother whether honour be not better served by obeying the summons of the king against the infidel with the men thou hast called together at his behest  let the count do his worst he gives thee legal ground of complaint to lay before the king and the league and all may there be more firmly established  that were admirable counsel lady said schleiermacher well suited to the honourworthy guildmaster sorel and to our justice loving city but in matters of baronial rights and aggressions king and league are wont to help those that help themselves and those that are over nice as to law and justice come by the worst  not the worst in the long run said friedel  thine unearthly code will not serve us here friedel mine returned his brother  did i not defend the work i have begun i should be branded as a weak fool  nor will i see the foes of my house insult me without striking a fair stroke  hap what hap the debateable ford shall be debated  call in the serfs hatto and arm them  mother order a good supper for them  master moritz let us summon thy masons and carpenters and see who is a good man with his hands among them  christina saw that remonstrance was vain  the days of peril and violence were coming back again and all she could take comfort in was that if not wholly right her son was far from wholly wrong and that with a free heart she could pray for a blessing on him and on his arms    chapter xix  the fight at the ford    by the early september sunrise the thicket beneath the pass was sheltering the twenty wellappointed reiters of adlerstein each standing holding his horse by the bridle ready to mount at the instant  in their rear were the serfs and artisans some with axes scythes or ploughshares a few with crossbows and jobst and his sons with the long blackened poles used for stirring their charcoal fires  in advance were master moritz and the two barons the former in a stout plain steel helmet cuirass and gauntlets a sword and those newfashioned weapons pistols the latter in full knightly armour exactly alike from the giltspurred heel to the eagle crested helm and often moving restlessly forward to watch for the enemy though taking care not to be betrayed by the glitter of their mail  so long did they wait that there was even a doubt whether it might not have been a false alarm the boy was vituperated and it was proposed to despatch a spy to see whether anything were doing at schlangenwald  at length a rustling and rushing were heard then a clank of armour ebbo vaulted into the saddle and gave the word to mount schleiermacher who always fought on foot stepped up to him  keep back your men herr freiherr  let his design be manifest  we must not be said to have fallen on him on his way to the muster  it would be but as he served my father muttered ebbo forced however to restrain himself though with boiling blood as the tramp of horses shook the ground and bright armour became visible on the further side of the stream  for the first time the brothers beheld the foe of their line  he was seated on a clumsy black horse and sheathed in full armour and was apparently a large heavy man whose powerful proportions were becoming unwieldy as he advanced in life  the dragon on his crest and shield would have made him known to the twins even without the deadly curse that passed the schneiderleins lips at the sight  as the armed troop outnumbering the adlersteiners by about a dozen and followed by a rabble with straw and pine brands came forth on the meadow the count halted and appeared to be giving orders  the ruffian  he is calling them on  now began ebbo  nay there is no sign yet that he is not peacefully on his journey to the camp responded moritz and chafing with impatient fury the knight waited while schlangenwald rode towards the old channel of the braunwasser and there drawing his rein and sitting like a statue in his stirrups he could hear him shout  the lazy dogs are not astir yet  we will give them a reveille  forward with your brands  now and ebbos creamcoloured horse leapt forth as the whole band flashed into the sunshine from the greenwood covert  who troubles the workmen on my land shouted ebbo  who you may be i care not replied the count but when i find strangers unlicensed on my lands i burn down their huts  on fellows  back fellows called ebbo  whoso touches a stick on adlerstein ground shall suffer  so said the count this is the burgherbred burgherfed varlet that calls himself of adlerstein  boy thou had best be warned wert thou trueblooded it were worth my while to maintain my rights against thee  craven as thou art not even with spirit to accept my feud i would fain not have the trouble of sweeping thee from my path  herr graf as true freiherr and belted knight i defy thee  i proclaim my right to this ground and whoso damages those i place there must do battle with me  thou wilt have it then said the count taking his heavy lance from his squire closing his visor and wheeling back his horse so as to give space for his career  ebbo did the like while friedel on one side and hierom von schlangenwald on the other kept their men in array awaiting the issue of the strife between their leadersthe fire of seventeen against the force of fiftysix  they closed in full shock with shivered lances and rearing pawing horses but without damage to either  each drew his sword and they were pressing together when heinz seeing a schlangenwalder aiming with his crossbow rode at him furiously and the melee became general shots were fired not only from crossbows but from arquebuses and in the throng friedel lost sight of the main combat between his brother and the count  suddenly however there was a crash as of falling men and horses with a shout of victory strangely mingled with a cry of agony and both sides became aware that their leaders had fallen  each party rushed to its fallen head  friedel beheld ebbo under his struggling horse and an enemy dashing at his throat and flying to the rescue he rode down the assailant striking him with his sword and with the instinct of driving the foe as far as possible from his brother he struck with a sort of frenzy shouting fiercely to his men and leaping over the dry bed of the river rushing onward with an intoxication of ardour that would have seemed foreign to his gentle nature but for the impetuous desire to protect his brother  their leaders down the enemy had no one to rally them and in spite of their superiority in number gave way in confusion before the furious onset of adlerstein  so soon however as friedel perceived that he had forced the enemy far back from the scene of conflict his anxiety for his brother returned and leaving the retainers to continue the pursuit he turned his horse  there on the green meadow lay on the one hand ebbos creamcoloured charger with his master under him on the other the large figure of the count and several other prostrate forms likewise struggled on the sand and pebbles of the strand or on the turf  ay said the architect who had turned with friedel twas a gallant feat sir friedel and i trust there is no great harm done were it the mere dint of the counts sword your brother will be little the worse  ebbo  ebbo mine look up cried friedel leaping from his horse and unclasping his brothers helmet  friedel groaned a halfsuffocated voice  o take away the horse  one or two of the artisans were at hand and with their help the dying steed was disengaged from the rider who could not restrain his moans though friedel held him in his arms and endeavoured to move him as gently as possible  it was then seen that the deep gash from the counts sword in the chest was not the most serious injury but that an arquebus ball had pierced his thigh before burying itself in the body of his horse and that the limb had been further crushed and wrenched by the animals struggles  he was nearly unconscious and gasped with anguish but after moritz had bathed his face and moistened his lips as he lay in his brothers arms he looked up with clearer eyes and said  have i slain him  it was the shot not he that sent me down  lives he  seethou friedelthou make him yield  transferring ebbo to the arms of schleiermacher friedel obeyed and stepped towards the fallen foe  the wrongs of adlerstein were indeed avenged for the blood was welling fast from a deep thrust above the collarbone and the failing feeble hand was wandering uncertainly among the clasps of the gorget  let me aid said friedel kneeling down and in his pity for the dying man omitting the summons to yield he threw back the helmet and beheld a grizzled head and stern hard features so embrowned by weather and inflamed by intemperance that even approaching death failed to blanch them  a scowl of malignant hate was in the eyes and there was a thrill of angry wonder as they fell on the lads face  thou againthou whelp  i thought at least i had made an end of thee he muttered unheard by friedel who intent on the thought that had recurred to him with greater vividness than ever was again filling ebbos helmet with water  he refreshed the dying mans face with it held it to his lips and said  herr graf variance and strife are ended now  for heavens sake say where i may find my father  so  wouldst find him replied schlangenwald fixing his look on the eager countenance of the youth while his hand with a dying mans nervous agitation was fumbling at his belt  i would bless you for ever could i but free him  know then said the count speaking very slowly and still holding the young knights gaze with a sort of intent fascination by the stony glare of his light gray eyes know that thy villain father is a turkish slave unless he beas i hopewhere his mongrel son may find him  therewith came a flash a report friedel leaped back staggered fell ebbo started to a sitting posture with horrified eyes and a loud shriek calling on his brother moritz sprang to his feet shouting shame treason  i call you to witness that i had not yielded said the count theres an end of the brood and with a grim smile he straightened his limbs and closed his eyes as a dead man ere the indignant artisans fell on him in savage vengeance  all this had passed like a flash of lightning and friedel had almost at the instant of his fall flung himself towards his brother and raising himself on one hand with the other clasped ebbos saying fear not it is nothing and he was bending to take ebbos head again on his knee when a gush of dark blood from his left side caused moritz to exclaim ah  sir friedel the traitor did his work  that is no slight hurt  where  how  the ruffian cried ebbo supporting himself on his elbow so as to see his brother who rather dreamily put his hand to his side and looking at the fresh blood that immediately dyed it said i do not feel it  this is more numb dulness than pain  a bad sign that said moritz apart to one of the workmen with whom he held counsel how to carry back to the castle the two young knights who remained on the bank ebbo partly extended on the ground partly supported on the knee and arm of friedel who sat with his head drooping over him their looks fixed on one another as if conscious of nothing else on earth  herr freiherr said moritz presently have you breath to wind your bugle to call the men back from the pursuit  ebbo essayed but was too faint and friedel rousing himself from the stupor took the horn from him and made the mountain echoes ring again but at the expense of a great effusion of blood  by this time however heinz was riding back and a moment his exultation changed to rage and despair when he saw the condition of his young lords  master schleiermacher proposed to lay them on some of the planks prepared for the building and carry them up the new road  methinks said friedel that i could ride if i were lifted on horseback and thus would our mother be less shocked  well thought said ebbo  go on and cheer her  show her thou canst keep the saddle however it may be with me he added with a groan of anguish  friedel made the sign of the cross over him  the holy cross keep us and her ebbo he said as he bent to assist in laying his brother on the boards where a mantle had been spread then kissed his brow saying we shall be together again soon  ebbo was lifted on the shoulders of his bearers and friedel strove to rise with the aid of heinz but sank back unable to use his limbs and schleiermacher was the more concerned  it goes so with the backbone he said  sir friedmund you had best be carried  nay for my mothers sake  and i would fain be on my good steeds back once again he entreated  and when with much difficulty he had been lifted to the back of his creamcolour who stood as gently and patiently as if he understood the exigency of the moment he sat upright and waved his hand as he passed the litter while ebbo on his side signed to him to speed on and prepare their mother  long however before the castle was reached dizzy confusion and leaden helplessness when no longer stimulated by his brothers presence so grew on him that it was with much ado that heinz could keep him in his saddle but when he saw his mother in the castle gateway he again collected his forces bade heinz withdraw his supporting arm and straightening himself waved a greeting to her as he called cheerily victory dear mother  ebbo has overthrown the count and you must not be grieved if it be at some cost of blood  alas my son was all christina could say for his effort at gaiety formed a ghastly contrast with the gray livid hue that overspread his fair young face his bloody armour and damp disordered hair and even his stiff unearthly smile  nay motherling he added as she came so near that he could put his arm round her neck sorrow not for ebbo will need thee much and mother as his face lighted up there is joy coming to you only i would that i could have brought him  mother he died not under the schlangenwald swords  who  not ebbo cried the bewildered mother  your own eberhard our father said friedel raising her face to him with his hand and adding as he met a startled look the cruel count owned it with his last breath  he is a turkish slave and surely heaven will give him back to comfort you even though we may not work his freedom  o mother i had so longed for it but god be thanked that at least certainty was bought by my life  the last words were uttered almost unconsciously and he had nearly fallen as the excitement faded but as they were lifting him down he bent once more and kissed the glossy neck of his horse  ah poor fellow thou too wilt be lonely  may ebbo yet ride thee  the mother had no time for grief  alas  she might have full time for that by and by  the one wish of the twins was to be together and presently both were laid on the great bed in the upper chamber ebbo in a swoon from the pain of the transport and friedel lying so as to meet the first look of recovery  and after ebbos eyes had reopened they watched one another in silence for a short space till ebbo said  is that the hue of death on thy face brother  i well believe so said friedel  ever together said ebbo holding his hand  but alas  my mother would i had never sent thee to the traitor  ah  so comes her comfort said friedel  heard you not  he owned that my father was among the turks  and i cried ebbo  i have withheld thee  o friedel had i listened to thee thou hadst not been in this fatal broil  nay ever together repeated friedel  through ulm merchants will my mother be able to ransom him  i know she will so oft have i dreamt of his return  then mother you will give him our duteous greetings and he smiled again  like one in a dream christina returned his smile because she saw he wished it just as the moment before she had been trying to staunch his wound  it was plain that the injuries except ebbos swordcut were far beyond her skill and she could only endeavour to check the bleeding till better aid could be obtained from ulm  thither moritz schleiermacher had already sent and he assured her that he was far from despairing of the elder baron but she derived little hope from his words for gunshot wounds were then so ill understood as generally to prove fatal  moreover there was an undefined impression that the two lives must end in the same hour even as they had begun  indeed ebbo was suffering so terribly and was so much spent with pain and loss of blood that he seemed sinking much faster than friedel whose wound bled less freely and who only seemed benumbed and torpid except when he roused himself to speak or was distressed by the writhings and moans which however for his sake ebbo restrained as much as he could  to be together seemed an allsufficient consolation and when the chaplain came sorrowfully to give them the last rites of the church ebbo implored him to pray that he might not be left behind long in purgatory  friedel he said clasping his brothers hand is even like the holy sebastian or maurice but ii was never such as he  o father will it be my penance to be left alone when he is in paradise  what is that said friedel partially roused by the sound of his name and the involuntary pressure of his hand  nay ebbo one repentance one cross one hope and he relapsed into a doze while ebbo murmured over a broken brief confessionexhausting by its vehemence of selfaccusation for his proud spirit his wilful neglect of his lost father his hot contempt of prudent counsel  then when the priest came round to friedels side and the boy was wakened to make his shrift the words were contrite and humble but calm and full of trust  they were like two of their own mountain streams the waters almost equally undefiled by external stainyet one struggling agitated whirling giddily round the other still transparent and the light of heaven smiling in its clearness  the farewell greetings of the church on earth breathed soft and sweet in their loftiness and friedel though lying motionless and with closed eyes never failed in the murmured response whether fully conscious or not while his brother only attended by fits and starts and was evidently often in too much pain to know what was passing  help was nearer than had been hoped  the summons despatched the night before had been responded to by the vintners and mercers their train bands had set forth and their captain a cautious man never rode into the way of blows without his surgeon at hand  and so it came to pass that before the sun was low on that long and grievous day doctor johannes butteman was led into the upper chamber where the mother looked up to him with a kind of hopeless gratitude on her face which was nearly as white as those of her sons  the doctor soon saw that friedel was past human aid but when he declared that there was fair hope for the other youth friedel whose torpor had been dispelled by the examination looked up with his beaming smile saying there motherling  the doctor then declared that he could not deal with the barons wound unless he were the sole occupant of the bed and this sentence brought the first cloud of grief or dread to friedels brow but only for a moment  he looked at his brother who had again fainted at the first touch of his wounded limb and said it is well  tell the dear ebbo that i cannot help it if after all i go to the praying and leave him the fighting  dear dear ebbo  one day together again and for ever  i leave thee for thine own sake  with much effort he signed the cross again on his brothers brow and kissed it long and fervently  then as all stood round reluctant to effect this severance or disturb one on whom death was visibly fast approaching he struggled up on his elbow and held out the other hand saying take me now heinz ere ebbo revive to be grieved  the last sacrifice he further whispered whilst almost giving himself to heinz and moritz to be carried to his own bed in the turret chamber  there even as they laid him down began what seemed to be the mortal agony and though he was scarcely sensible his mother felt that her prime call was to him while his brother was in other hands  perhaps it was well for her  surgical practice was rough and wounds made by firearms were thought to have imbibed a poison that made treatment be supposed efficacious in proportion to the pain inflicted  when ebbo was recalled by the torture to see no white reflection of his own face on the pillow beside him and to feel in vain for the grasp of the cold damp hand a delirious frenzy seized him and his struggles were frustrating the doctors attempts when a low soft sweet song stole through the open door  friedel he murmured and held his breath to listen  all through the declining day did the gentle sound continue now of grand chants or hymns caught from the cathedral choir now of songs of chivalry or saintly legend so often sung over the evening fire the one flowing into the other in the wandering of failing powers but never failing in the tender sweetness that had distinguished friedel through life and whenever that voice was heard let them do to him what they would ebbo was still absorbed in intense listening so as not to lose a note and lulled almost out of sense of suffering by that swanlike music  if his attendants made such noise as to break in on it or if it ceased for a moment the anguish returned but was charmed away by the weakest faintest resumption of the song  probably friedel knew not with any earthly sense what he was doing but to the very last he was serving his twin brother as none other could have aided him in his need  the september sun had set twilight was coming on the doctor had worked his stern will and ebbo quivering in every fibre lay spent on his pillow when his mother glided in and took her seat near him though where she hoped he would not notice her presence  but he raised his eyelids and said he is not singing now  singing indeed but where we cannot hear him she answered whiter than the snow clearer than the icecave more solemn than the choir  they will come at last  that was what he said even as he entered there  and the low dovelike tone and tender calm face continued upon ebbo the spell that the chant had left  he dozed as though still lulled by its echo    chapter xx  the wounded eagle    the star and the spark in the stubble  often did the presage of her dream occur to christina and assist in sustaining her hopes during the days that ebbos life hung in the balance and he himself had hardly consciousness to realize either his brothers death or his own state save as much as was shown by the words let him not be taken away mother let him wait for me  friedmund did wait in his coffin before the altar in the castle chapel covered with a pall of blue velvet and great white cross mournfully sent by hausfrau johanna his sword shield helmet and spurs laid on it and wax tapers burning at the head and feet  and when christina could leave the one son on his couch of suffering it was to kneel beside the other son on his narrow bed of rest and recall like a breath of solace the heavenly loveliness and peace that rested on his features when she had taken her last long look at them  moritz schleiermacher assisted at sir friedmunds first solemn requiem and then made a journey to ulm whence he returned to find the barons danger so much abated that he ventured on begging for an interview with the lady in which he explained his purpose of repairing at once to the imperial camp taking with him a letter from the guilds concerned in the bridge and using his personal influence with maximilian to obtain not only pardon for the combat but authoritative sanction to the erection  dankwart of schlangenwald the teutonic knight and only heir of old wolfgang was supposed to be with the emperor and it might be possible to come to terms with him since his breeding in the prussian commanderies had kept him aloof from the feuds of his father and brother  this mournful fight had to a certain extent equalized the injuries on either side since the man whom friedel had cut down was hierom one of the few remaining scions of schlangenwald and there was thus no dishonour in trying to close the deadly feud and coming to an amicable arrangement about the debateable strand the cause of so much bloodshed  what was now wanted was freiherr eberhards signature to the letter to the emperor and his authority for making terms with the new count and haste was needed lest the markgraf of wurtemburg should represent the affray in the light of an outrage against a member of the league  christina saw the necessity and undertook if possible to obtain her sons signature but at the first mention of master moritz and the bridge ebbo turned away his head groaned and begged to hear no more of either  he thought of his bold declaration that the bridge must be built even at the cost of blood  little did he then guess of whose blood  and in his bitterness of spirit he felt a jealousy of that influence of schleiermacher which had of late come between him and his brother  he hated the very name he said and hid his face with a shudder  he hoped the torrent would sweep away every fragment of the bridge  nay ebbo mine wherefore wish ill to a good work that our blessed one loved  listen and let me tell you my dream for making yonder strand a peaceful memorial of our peaceful boy  to honour friedel and he gazed on her with something like interest in his eyes  yes ebbo and as he would best brook honour  let us seek for ever to end the rival claims to yon piece of meadow by praying this knight of a religious order the new count to unite with us in building thereor as near as may be safea church of holy peace and a cell for a priest who may watch over the bridge ward and offer the holy sacrifice for the departed of either house  there will we place our gentle friedel to be the first to guard the peace of the ford and there will we sleep ourselves when our time shall come and so may the cruel feud of many generations be slaked for ever  in his blood sighed ebbo  ah would that it had been mine mother  it is well as well as anything can be again  so shall the spot where he fell be made sacred and fenced from rude feet and we shall see his fair effigy keeping his armed watch there  and christina was thankful to see his look of gratification sad though it was  she sat down near his bed and began to write a letter in their joint names to graf dankwart von schlangenwald proposing that thus after the even balance of the wrongs of the two houses their mutual hostility might be laid to rest for ever by the consecration of the cause of their long contention  it was a stiff and formal letter full of the set pious formularies of the age scarcely revealing the deep heartfeeling within but it was to the purpose and ebbo after hearing it read heartily approved and consented to sign both it and those that schleiermacher had brought christina held the scroll and placed the pen in the fingers that had lately so easily wielded the heavy sword but now felt it a far greater effort to guide the slender quill  moritz schleiermacher went his way in search of the king of the romans far off in carinthia  a full reply could not be expected till the campaign was over and all that was known for some time was through a messenger sent back to ulm by schleiermacher with the intelligence that maximilian would examine into the matter after his return and that count dankwart would reply when he should come to perform his fathers obsequies after the army was dispersed  there was also a letter of kind though courtly condolence from kasimir of wildschloss much grieving for gallant young sir friedmund proffering all the advocacy he could give the cause of adlerstein and covertly proffering the protection that she and her remaining son might now be more disposed to accept  christina suppressed this letter knowing it would only pain and irritate ebbo and that she had her answer ready  indeed in her grief for one son and her anxiety for the other perhaps it was this letter that first made her fully realize the drift of those earnest words of friedels respecting his father  meantime the mother and son were alone together with much of suffering and of sorrow yet with a certain tender comfort in the being all in all to one another with none to intermeddle with their mutual love and grief  it was to christina as if something of friedels sweetness had passed to his brother in his patient helplessness and that while thus fully engrossed with him she had both her sons in one  nay in spite of all the pain grief and weariness these were times when both dreaded any change and the full recovery when not only would the loss of friedel be every moment freshly brought home to his brother but when ebbo would go in quest of his father  for on this the young baron had fixed his mind as a sacred duty from the moment he had seen that life was to be his lot  he looked on his neglect of indications of the possibility of his fathers life in the light of a sin that had led to all his disasters and not only regarded the intended search as a token of repentance but as a charge bequeathed to him by his less selfish brother  he seldom spoke of his intention but his mother was perfectly aware of it and never thought of it without such an agony of foreboding dread as eclipsed all the hope that lay beyond  she could only turn away her mind from the thought and be thankful for what was still her own from day to day  art weary my son asked christina one october afternoon as ebbo lay on his bed languidly turning the pages of a noble folio of the legends of the saints that master gottfried had sent for his amusement  it was such a book as fixed the ardour a few years later of the wounded navarrese knight inigo de loyola but ebbo handled it as if each page were lead  only thinking how friedel would have glowed towards these as his own kinsmen said ebbo  then should i have cared to read of them and he gave a long sigh  let me take away the book she said  thou hast read long and it is dark  so dark that there must surely be a snowcloud  snow is falling in the large flakes that our friedel used to call winterbutterflies  butterflies that will swarm and shut us in from the weary world said ebbo  and alack when they go what a turmoil it will be councils in the rathhaus appeals to the league wranglings with the markgraf wise saws overweening speeches all alike dull and dead  it will scarce be so when strength and spirit have returned mine ebbo  never can life be more to me than the way to him said the lonely boy and inever like himshall miss the road without him  while he thus spoke in the listless dejection of sorrow and weakness hattos aged step was on the stair  gracious lady he said here is a huntsman bewildered in the hills who has been asking shelter from the storm that is drifting up  see to his entertainment then hatto said the lady  my ladysir baron added hatto i had not come up but that this guest seems scarce gear for us below  he is none of the foresters of our tract  his hair is perfumed his shirt is fine holland his buff suit is of softest skin his baldric has a jewelled clasp and his arblast  it would do my lord barons heart good only to cast eyes on the perfect make of that arblast  he has a lordly tread and a stately presence and though he has a free tongue and made friends with us as he dried his garments he asked after my lord like his equal  o mother must you play the chatelaine asked ebbo  who can the fellow be  why did none ever so come when they would have been more welcome  welcomed must he be said christina rising and thy state shall be my excuse for not tarrying longer with him than may be needful  yet though shrinking from a strangers face she was not without hope that the variety might wholesomely rouse her son from his depression and in effect ebbo when left with hatto minutely questioned him on the appearance of the stranger and watched with much curiosity for his mothers return  ebbo mine she said entering after a long interval the knight asks to see thee either after supper or tomorrow morn  then a knight he is  yea truly a knight truly in every look and gesture bearing his head like the leading stag of the herd and yet right gracious  gracious to you mother in your own hall cried ebbo almost fiercely  ah jealous champion thou couldst not take offence  it was the manner of one free and courteous to every one and yet with an inherent loftiness that pervades all  gives he no name said ebbo  he calls himself ritter theurdank of the suite of the late kaisar but i should deem him wont rather to lead than to follow  theurdank repeated eberhard i know no such name  so motherling are you going to sup  i shall not sleep till i have seen him  hold dear son  she leant over him and spoke low  see him thou must but let me first station heinz and koppel at the door with halberts not within earshot but thou art so entirely defenceless  she had the pleasure of seeing him laugh  less defenceless than when the kinsman of wildschloss here visited us mother  i see for whom thou takest him but let it be so a spiritual knight would scarce wreak his vengeance on a wounded man in his bed  i will not have him insulted with precautions  if he has freely risked himself in my hands i will as freely risk myself in his  moreover i thought he had won thy heart  reigned over it rather said christina  it is but the disguise that i suspect and mistrust  bid me not leave thee alone with him my son  nay dear mother said ebbo the matters on which he is like to speak will brook no presence save our own and even that will be hard enough to bear  so prop me more upright  so  and comb out these locks somewhat smoother  thanks mother  now can he see whether he will choose eberhard of adlerstein for friend or foe  by the time supper was ended the only light in the upper room came from the flickering flames of the fire of pine knots on the hearth it glanced on the pale features and dark sad eyes of the young baron sad in spite of the eager look of scrutiny that he turned on the figure that entered at the door and approached so quickly that the partial light only served to show the gloss of long fair hair the glint of a jewelled belt and the outline of a tall wellknit agile frame  welcome herr ritter he said i am sorry we have been unable to give you a fitter reception  no host could be more fully excused than you said the stranger and ebbo started at his voice  i fear you have suffered much and still have much to suffer  my sword wound is healing fast said ebbo it is the shot in my broken thigh that is so tedious and painful  and i dare be sworn the leeches made it worse  i have hated all leeches ever since they kept me three days a prisoner in a pothecarys shop stinking with drugs  why i have cured myself with one pitcher of water of a raging fever in their very despite  how did they serve thee my poor boy  they poured hot oil into the wound to remove the venom of the lead said ebbo  had it been my case the lead should have been in their own brains first though that were scarce needed the heavywitted hans sausages  why should there be more poison in lead than in steel  i have asked all my surgeons that question nor ever had a reasonable answer  greater havoc of warriors do they make than ever with the arquebusay even when every lanzknecht bears one  alack ebbo could not help exclaiming where will be room for chivalry  talk not old world nonsense said theurdank chivalry is in the heart not in the weapon  a youth beforehand enough with the world to be building bridges should know that when all our troops are provided with such an arm then will their platoons in serried ranks be as a solid wall breathing fire and as impregnable as the lines of english archers with long bows or the phalanx of macedon  and when each man bears a pistol instead of the misericorde his life will be far more his own  ebbos face was in full light and his visitor marked his contracted brow and trembling lip  ah he said thou hast had foul experience of these weapons  not mine own hurt said ebbo that was but fair chance of war  i understand said the knight it was the shot that severed the goodly bond that was so fair to see  young man none has grieved more truly than king max  and well he may said ebbo  he has not lost merely one of his best servants but all the better half of another  there is still stuff enough left to make that one well worth having said theurdank kindly grasping his hand though i would it were more substantial  how didst get old wolfgang down boy  he must have been a tough morsel for slight bones like these even when better covered than now  come tell me all  i promised the markgraf of wurtemburg to look into the matter when i came to be guest at st ruprechts cloister and i have some small interest too with king max  his kindliness and sympathy were more effectual with ebbo than the desire to represent his case favourably for he was still too wretched to care for policy but he answered theurdanks questions readily and explained how the idea of the bridge had originated in the vigil beside the broken waggons  i hope said theurdank the merchants made up thy share  these overthrown goods are a seignorial right of one or other of you lords of the bank  true herr ritter but we deemed it unknightly to snatch at what travellers lost by misfortune  freiherr eberhard take my word for it while thou thus holdest all the arquebuses yet to be cut out of the black forest will not mar thy chivalry  where didst get these ways of thinking  my brother was a very st sebastian  my mother  ah her sweet wise face would have shown it even had not poor kasimir of adlerstein raved of her  ah lad thou hast crossed a case of true love there  canst not brook even such a gallant stepfather  i may not said ebbo with spirit for with his last breath schlangenwald owned that my own father died not at the hostel but may now be alive as a turkish slave  the devil burst out theurdank  well that might have been a pretty mess  a turkish slave saidst thou  what year chanced all this matterthy grandfathers murder and all the rest  the year before my birth said ebbo  it was in the september of 1475  ha muttered theurdank musing to himself that was the year the dotard schenk got his overthrow at the fight of rain on sare from the moslem  some composition was made by them and old wolfgang was not unlikely to have been the gobetween  so  say on young knight he added let us to the matter in hand  how rose the strife that kept back two troops from ourfrom the banner of the empire  ebbo proceeded with the narration and concluded it just as the bell now belonging to the chapel began to toll for compline and theurdank prepared to obey its summons first however asking if he should send any one to the patient  ebbo thanked him but said he needed no one till his mother should come after prayers  nay i told thee i had some leechcraft  thou art weary and must rest more entirelyand giving him little choice theurdank supported him with one arm while removing the pillows that propped him then laid him tenderly down saying good night and the saints bless thee brave young knight  sleep well and recover in spite of the leeches  i cannot afford to lose both of you  ebbo strove to follow mentally the services that were being performed in the chapel and whose amens and louder notes pealed up to him devoid of the clear young tones that had sung their last here below but swelled by grand bass notes that as much distracted ebbos attention as the memory of his guests conversation and he impatiently awaited his mothers arrival  at length lamp in hand she appeared with tears shining in her eyes and bending over him said  he hath done honour to our blessed one my ebbo he knelt by him and crossed him with holy water and when he led me from the chapel he told me any mother in germany might envy me my two sons even now thou must love him now ebbo  love him as one loves ones loftiest model said ebbovalue the old castle the more for sheltering him  hath he made himself known to thee  not openly but there is only one that he can be  christina smiled thankful that the work of pardon and reconciliation had been thus softened by the personal qualities of the enemy whose conduct in the chapel had deeply moved her  then all will be well blessedly well she said  so i trust said ebbo but the bell broke our converse and he laid me down as tenderly aso mother if a fathers kindness be like his i have truly somewhat to regain  knew he aught of the fell bargain whispered christina  not he of course save that it was a year of turkish inroads  he will speak more perchance tomorrow  mother not a word to any one nor let us betray our recognition unless it be his pleasure to make himself known  certainly not said christina remembering the danger that the household might revenge friedels death if they knew the foe to be in their power  knowing as she did that ebbos admiration was apt to be enthusiastic and might now be rendered the more fervent by fever and solitude she was still at a loss to understand his dazzled fascinated state  when heinz entered bringing the castle key which was always laid under the barons pillow ebbo made a movement with his hand that surprised them both as if to send it elsewherethen muttered no no not till he reveals himself and asked where sleeps the guest  in the grandmothers room which we fitted for a guestchamber little thinking who our first would be said his mother  never fear lady we will have a care to him said heinz somewhat grimly  yes have a care said ebbo wearily and take care all due honour is shown to him  good night heinz  gracious lady said heinz when by a sign he had intimated to her his desire of speaking with her unobserved by the baron never fear i know who the fellow is as well as you do  i shall be at the foot of the stairs and woe to whoever tries to step up them past me  there is no reason to apprehend treason heinz yet to be on our guard can do no harm  nay lady i could look to the gear for the oubliette if you would speak the word  for heavens sake no heinz  this man has come hither trusting to our honour and you could not do your lord a greater wrong nor one that he could less pardon than by any attempt on our guest  would that he had never eaten our bread muttered heinz  vipers be they all and who knows what may come next  watch watch heinz that is all implored christina and above all not a word to any one else  and christina dismissed the manatarms gruff and sullen and herself retired ill at ease between fears of and for the unwelcome guest whose strange powers of fascination had rendered her in his absence doubly distrustful    chapter xxi  ritter theurdank    the snow fell all night without ceasing and was still falling on the morrow when the guest explained his desire of paying a short visit to the young baron and then taking his departure  christina would gladly have been quit of him but she felt bound to remonstrate for their mountain was absolutely impassable during a fall of snow above all when accompanied by wind since the drifts concealed fearful abysses and the shifting masses insured destruction to the unwary wayfarer nay natives themselves had perished between the hamlet and the castle  not the hardiest cragsman not my son himself she said could venture on such a morning to guide you to  whither gracious dame asked theurdank half smiling  nay sir i would not utter what you would not make known  you know me then  surely sir for our noble foe whose generous trust in our honour must win my sons heart  so he said with a peculiar smile theurdankdankwarti see may i ask if your son likewise smelt out the schlangenwald  verily sir count my ebbo is not easily deceived  he said our guest could be but one man in all the empire  theurdank smiled again saying then lady you shudder not at a man whose kin and yours have shed so much of one anothers blood  nay ghostly knight i regard you as no more stained therewith than are my sons by the deeds of their grandfather  if there were more like you lady returned theurdank deadly feuds would soon be starved out  may i to your son  i have more to say to him and i would fain hear his views of the storm  christina could not be quite at ease with theurdank in her sons room but she had no choice and she knew that heinz was watching on the turret stair out of hearing indeed but as ready to spring as a cat who sees her young ones in the hand of a child that she only half trusts  ebbo lay eagerly watching for his visitor who greeted him with the same almost paternal kindness he had evinced the night before but consulted him upon the way from the castle  ebbo confirmed his mothers opinion that the path was impracticable so long as the snow fell and the wind tossed it in wild drifts  we have been caught in snow he said and hard work have we had to get home  once indeed after a bear hunt we fully thought the castle stood before us and lo it was all a cruel snow mist in that mocking shape  i was even about to climb our last eagles step as i thought when behold it proved to be the very brink of the abyss  ah these ravines are wellnigh as bad as those of the inn  ive known what it was to be caught on the ledge of a precipice by a sharp wind changing its course markst thou so swiftly that it verily tore my hold from the rock and had wellnigh swept me into a chasm of mighty depth  there was nothing for it but to make the best spring i might towards the crag on the other side and grip for my life at my alpenstock which by our ladys grace was firmly planted and i held on till i got breath again and felt for my footing on the iceglazed rock  ah said eberhard with a long breath after having listened with a hunters keen interest to this hairsbreadth escape it sounds like a gust of my mountain air thus let in on me  truly it is dismal work for a lusty hunter to lie here said theurdank but soon shalt thou take thy crags again in full vigour i hope  how callst thou the deep gray lonely pool under a steep frowning crag sharpened wellnigh to a spear point that i passed yester afternoon  the ptarmigans mere the red eyrie murmured ebbo scarcely able to utter the words as he thought of friedels delight in the pool his exploit at the eyrie and the gay bargain made in the streets of ulm that he should show the scaler of the dom steeple the way to the eagles nest  i remember said his guest gravely coming to his side  ah boy thy brothers flight has been higher yet  weep freely fear me not do i not know what it is when those who were overgood for earth have found their eagles wings and left us here  ebbo gazed up through his tears into the noble mournful face that was bent kindly over him  i will not seek to comfort thee by counselling thee to forget said theurdank  i was scarce thine elder when my life was thus rent asunder and to hoar hairs nay to the grave itself will she be my glory and my sorrow  never owned i brother but i trow ye two were one in no common sort  such brothers as we saw at ulm were little like us returned ebbo from the bottom of his heart  we were knit together so that all will begin with me as if it were the left hand remaining alone to do it  i am glad that my old life may not even in shadow be renewed till after i have gone in quest of my father  be not over hasty in that quest said the guest or the infidels may chance to gain two freiherren instead of one  hast any designs  ebbo explained that he thought of making his way to genoa to consult the merchant gian battista dei battiste whose description of the captive german noble had so strongly impressed friedel  ebbo knew the difference between turks and moors but friedels impulse guided him and he further thought that at genoa he should learn the way to deal with either variety of infidel  theurdank thought this a prudent course since the genoese had dealings both at tripoli and constantinople and moreover the transfer was not impossible since the two different hordes of moslems trafficked among themselves when either had made an unusually successful razzia  shame he broke out that these eastern locusts these ravening hounds should prey unmolested on the fairest lands of the earth and our german nobles lie here like swine grunting and squealing over the plunder they grub up from one another deaf to any summons from heaven or earth  did not heavens own voice speak in thunder this last year even in november hurling the mighty thunderbolt of alsace an ell long weighing two hundred and fifteen pounds  did i not cause it to be hung up in the church of encisheim as a witness and warning of the plagues that hang over us  but no nothing will quicken them from their sloth and drunkenness till the foe are at their doors and if a man arise of different mould with some heart for the knightly the good and the true then they kill him for me but thou adlerstein this pious quest over thou wilt return to me thou hast head to think and heart to feel for the shame and woe of this misguided land  i trust so my lord said ebbo  truly i have suffered bitterly for pursuing my own quarrel rather than the crusade  i meant not thee said theurdank kindly  thy bridge is a benefit to me as much as or more than ever it can be to thee  dost know italian  there is something of italy in thine eye  my mothers mother was italian my lord but she died so early that her language has not descended to my mother or myself  thou shouldst learn it  it will be pastime while thou art bedfast and serve thee well in dealing with the moslem  moreover i may have work for thee in welschland  books  i will send thee books  there is the whole chronicle of karl the great and all his palsgrafen by pulci and boiardo a brave count and gentleman himself governor of reggio and worthy to sing of deeds of arms so choice too as to the names of his heroes that they say he caused his church bells to be rung when he had found one for rodomonte his infidel hector  he has shown up roland as a lovesick knight though which is out of all accord with archbishop turpin  wilt have him  when we were together we used to love tales of chivalry  ah  or wilt have the stern old ghibelline florentine who explored the three realms of the departed  deep lore and wellnigh unsearchable is his but i love him for the sake of his beatrice who guided him  may we find such guides in our day  i have heard of him said ebbo  if he will tell me where my friedel walks in light then my lord i would read him with all my heart  or wouldst thou have rare franciscus petrarca  i wot thou art too young as yet for the yearnings of his sonnets but their voice is sweet to the bereft heart  and he murmured over in their melodious italian flow the lines on lauras death   not pallid but yet whiter than the snow by wind unstirred that on a hillside lies rest seemed as on a weary frame to grow a gentle slumber pressed her lovely eyes   ah he added aloud to himself it is ever to me as though the poet had watched in that chamber at ghent  such were the discourses of that morning now on poetry and book lore now admiration of the carvings that decked the room now talk on grand architectural designs or improvements in firearms or the discussion of hunting adventures  there seemed nothing in art life or learning in which the versatile mind of theurdank was not at home or that did not end in some strange personal reminiscence of his own all was so kind so gracious and brilliant that at first the interview was full of wondering delight to ebbo but latterly it became very fatiguing from the strain of attention above all towards a guest who evidently knew that he was known while not permitting such recognition to be avowed  ebbo began to long for an interruption but though he could see by the lightened sky that the weather had cleared up it would have been impossible to have suggested to any guest that the way might now probably be open and more especially to such a guest as this  considerate as his visitor had been the night before the pleasure of talk seemed to have done away with the remembrance of his hosts weakness till ebbo so flagged that at last he was scarcely alive to more than the continued sound of the voice and all the pain that for a while had been in abeyance seemed to have mastered him but his guest half reading his books half discoursing seemed too much immersed in his own plans theories and adventures to mark the condition of his auditor  interruption came at last however  there was a sudden knock at the door at noon and with scant ceremony heinz entered followed by three other of the menatarms fully equipped  ha what means this demanded ebbo  peace sir baron said heinz advancing so as to place his large person between ebbos bed and the strange hunter  you know nothing of it  we are not going to lose you as well as your brother and we mean to see how this knight likes to serve as a hostage instead of opening the gates as a traitor spy  on him koppel it is thy right  hands off at your peril villains exclaimed ebbo sitting up and speaking in the steady resolute voice that had so early rendered him thoroughly their master but much perplexed and dismayed and entirely unassisted by theurdank who stood looking on with almost a smile as if diverted by his predicament  by your leave herr freiherr said heinz putting his hand on his shoulder this is no concern of yours  while you cannot guard yourself or my lady it is our part to do so  i tell you his minions are on their way to surprise the castle  even as heinz spoke christina came panting into the room and hurrying to her sons side said sir count is this just is this honourable thus to return my sons welcome in his helpless condition  mother are you likewise distracted exclaimed ebbo  what is all this madness  alas my son it is no frenzy  there are armed men coming up the eagles stairs on the one hand and by the gemsbocks pass on the other  but not a hair of your head shall they hurt lady said heinz this fellows limbs shall be thrown to them over the battlements on koppel  off koppel thundered ebbo  would you brand me with shame for ever  were he all the schlangenwalds in one he should go as freely as he came but he is no more schlangenwald than i am  he has deceived you my lord said heinz  my ladys own letter to schlangenwald was in his chamber  tis a treacherous disguise  fool that thou art said ebbo  i know this gentleman well  i knew him at ulm  those who meet him here mean me no ill  open the gates and receive them honourably  mother mother trust me all is well  i know what i am saying  the men looked one upon another  christina wrung her hands uncertain whether her son were not under some strange fatal deception  my lord has his fancies growled koppel  ill not be balked of my right of vengeance for his scruples  will he swear that this fellow is what he calls himself  i swear said ebbo slowly that he is a true loyal knight well known to me  swear it distinctly sir baron said heinz  we have all too deep a debt of vengeance to let off any one who comes here lurking in the interest of our foe  swear that this is theurdank or we send his head to greet his friends  drops stood on ebbos brow and his breath laboured as he felt his senses reeling and his powers of defence for his guest failing him even should the stranger confess his name the people of the castle might not believe him and here he stood like one indifferent evidently measuring how far his young host would go in his cause  i cannot swear that his real name is theurdank said ebbo rallying his forces but this i swear that he is neither friend nor fosterer of schlangenwald that i know him and i had rather die than that the slightest indignity were offered him  here and with a great effort that terribly wrenched his wounded leg he reached past heinz and grasped his guests hand pulling him as near as he could  sir he said if they try to lay hands on you strike my death blow  a buglehorn was wound outside  the men stood dauntedchristina in extreme terror for her son who lay gasping breathless but still clutching the strangers hand and with eyes of fire glaring on the mutinous warriors  another bugleblast  heinz was almost in the act of grappling with the silent foe and koppel cried as he raised his halbert now or never but paused  never so please you said the strange guest  what if your young lord could not forswear himself that my name is theurdank  are you foes to all the world save theurdank  no masking said heinz sternly  tell your true name as an honest man and we will judge whether you be friend or foe  my name is a mouthful as your master knows said the guest slowly looking with strangely amused eyes on the confused lanzknechts who were trying to devour their rage  i was baptized maximilianus archduke of austria by birth by choice of the germans king of the romans  the kaisar  christina dropped on her knee the menatarms tumbled backwards ebbo pressed the hand he held to his lips and fainted away  the bugle sounded for the third time    chapter xxii  peace    slowly and painfully did ebbo recover from his swoon feeling as if the means of revival were rending him away from his brother  he was so completely spent that he was satisfied with a mere assurance that nothing was amiss and presently dropped into a profound slumber whence he awoke to find it still broad daylight and his mother sitting by the side of his bed all looking so much as it had done for the last six weeks that his first inquiry was if all that had happened had been but a strange dream  his mother would scarcely answer till she had satisfied herself that his eye was clear his voice steady his hand cool and that as she said that kaisar had done him no harm  ah then it was true  where is he  gone cried ebbo eagerly  no in the hall below busy with letters they have brought him  lie still my boy he has done thee quite enough damage for one day  but mother what are you saying  something disloyal was it not  well ebbo i was very angry that he should have half killed you when he could so easily have spoken one word  heaven forgive me if i did wrong but i could not help it  did he forgive you mother said ebbo anxiously  heoh yes  to do him justice he was greatly concerned devised ways of restoring thee and now has promised not to come near thee again without my leave said the mother quite as persuaded of her own rightful sway in her sons sick chamber as ever kunigunde had been of her dominion over the castle  and is he displeased with me  those cowardly vindictive rascals to fall on him and set me at nought  before him too exclaimed ebbo bitterly  nay ebbo he thought thy part most gallant  i heard him say so not only to me but below stairsboth wise and true  thou didst know him then  from the first glance of his princely eyethe first of his keen smiles  i had seen him disguised before  i thought you knew him too mother i never guessed that your mind was running on schlangenwald when we talked at cross purposes last night  would that i had but though i breathed no word openly i encouraged heinzs precautions  my boy i could not help it my heart would tremble for my only one and i saw he could not be what he seemed  and what doth he here  who were the men who were advancing  they were the followers he had left at st ruprechts and likewise master schleiermacher and sir kasimir of wildschloss  ha  whathe had not told thee  no  he knew that i knew him was at no pains to disguise himself yet evidently meant me to treat him as a private knight  but what brought wildschloss here  it seems said christina that on the return from carinthia the kaisar expressed his intention of slipping away from his army in his own strange fashion and himself inquiring into the matter of the ford  so he took with him his own personal followers the new graf von schlangenwald herr kasimir and master schleiermacher  the others he sent to schlangenwald he himself lodged at st ruprechts appointing that sir kasimir should meet him there this morning  from the convent he started on a chamois hunt and made his way hither but when the snow came on and he returned not his followers became uneasy and came in search of him  ah said ebbo he meant to intercede for wildschlossit might be he would have tried his power  no for that he is too generous  how looked wildschloss mother  how could i tell how any one looked save thee my poor wan boy thou art paler than ever  i cannot have any king or kaisar of them all come to trouble thee  nay motherling there is much more trouble and unrest to me in not knowing how my king will treat us after such a requital  prithee let him know that i am at his service  and after having fed and refreshed her patient the gentle potentate of his chamber consented to intimate her consent to admit the invader  but not till after delay enough to fret the impatient nerves of illness did maximilian appear handing her in and saying in the cheery voice that was one of his chief fascinations  yea truly fair dame i know thou wouldst sooner trust schlangenwald himself than me alone with thy charge  how goes it my true knight  well right well my liege said ebbo save for my shame and grief  thou art the last to be ashamed for that said the goodnatured prince  have i never seen my faithful vassals more bent on their own feuds than on my wordi who reign over a set of kings who brook no will but their own  and may we ask your pardon said ebbo not only for ourselves but for the misguided menatarms  what the grewsome giant that was prepared with the axe and the honest lad that wanted to do his duty by his father  i honour that lad freiherr i would enrol him in my guard but that probably he is better off here than with massimiliano pochi danari as the italians call me  but what i came hither to say was this and he spoke gravely  thou art sincere in desiring reconciliation with the house of schlangenwald  with all my heart said ebbo do i loathe the miserable debt of blood for blood  and said maximilian graf dankwart is of like mind  bred from pagedom in his prussian commandery he has never been exposed to the irritations that have fed the spirit of strife and he will be thankful to lay it aside  the question next is how to solemnize this reconciliation ere your retainers on one side or the other do something to set you by the ears together again which judging by this mornings work is not improbable  alas no said ebbo while i am laid by  had you both been in our camp you should have sworn friendship in my chapel  now must dankwart come hither to thee as i trow he had best do while i am here to keep the peace  see friend ebbo we will have him here tomorrow thy chaplain shall deck the altar here the father abbot shall say mass and ye shall swear peace and brotherhood before me  and he added taking ebbos hand i shall know how to trust thine oaths as of one who sets the fear of god above that of his king  this was truly the only chance of impressing on the wild vassals of the two houses an obligation that perhaps might override their ancient hatred and the baron and his mother gladly submitted to the arrangement  maximilian withdrew to give directions for summoning the persons required and christina was soon obliged to leave her son while she provided for her influx of guests  ebbo was alone till nearly the end of the supper below stairs  he had been dozing when a cautious tread came up the turret steps and he started and called out who goes there  i am not asleep  it is your kinsman freiherr said a wellknown voice i come by your mothers leave  welcome sir cousin said ebbo holding out his hand  you come to find everything changed  i have knelt in the chapel said wildschloss gravely  and he loved you better than i said ebbo  your jealousy of me was a providential thing for which all may be thankful said wildschloss gravely yet it is no small thing to lose the hope of so many years  however young baron i have grave matter for your consideration  know you the service on which i am to be sent  the kaisar deems that the armenians or some of the christian nations on the skirts of the ottoman empire might be made our allies and attack the turk in his rear  i am chosen as his envoy and shall sail so soon as i can make my way to venice  i only knew of the appointment since i came hither he having been led thereto by letters brought him this day and mayhap by the downfall of my hopes  he was peremptory as his mood is and seemed to think it no small favour added wildschloss with some annoyance  and meantime what of my poor child  there she is in the cloister at ulm but an inheritance is a very millstone round the neck of an orphan maid  that insolent fellow lassla von trautbach hath already demanded to espouse the poor babe hea bloodstained dicing drunken rover with whom i would not trust a dog that i loved  yet my death would place her at the disposal of his father who would give her at once to him  nay even his aunt the abbess will believe nothing against him and hath even striven with me to have her betrothed at once  on the barest rumour of my death will they wed the poor little thing and then woe to her and woe to my vassals  the king suggested ebbo  surely she might be made his ward  young man said sir kasimir bending over him and speaking in an undertone he may well have won your heart  as friend when one is at his side none can be so winning or so sincere as he but with all his brilliant gifts he says truly of himself that he is a mere reckless huntsman  today while i am with him he would give me half austria or fight singlehanded in my cause or theklas  next month when i am out of sight comes trautbach just when his head is full of keeping the french out of italy or reforming the church or beating the turk or parcelling the empire into circles or maybe of a new touchhole for a cannonnay of a flowergarden or of walking into a lions den  he just says yea well to be rid of the importunity and all is over with my poor little maiden  hare brained and bewildered with schemes has he been as romish kinghow will it be with him as kaisar  it is but of his wonted madness that he is here at all when his austrian states must be all astray for want of him  no no i would rather make a weathercock guardian to my daughter  you yourself are the only guard to whom i can safely intrust her  my sword as knight and kinsman began ebbo  no no tis no matter of errant knight or distressed damsel  that is king maxs own line said wildschloss with a little of the irony that used to nettle ebbo  there is only one way in which you can save her and that is as her husband  ebbo started as well he might but sir kasimir laid his hand on him with a gesture that bade him listen ere he spoke  my first wish for my child he said was to see her brought up by that peerless lady below stairs  the saintsin pity to one so like themselvesspared her the distress our union would have brought her  now it would be vain to place my little thekla in her care for trautbach would easily feign my death and claim his niece nor are you of age to be made her guardian as head of our house  but if this marriage rite were solemnized then would her person and lands alike be yours and i could leave her with an easy heart  but said the confused surprised ebbo what can i do  they say i shall not walk for many weeks to come  and even if i could i am so youngi have so blundered in my dealings with my own mountaineers and with this fatal bridgehow should i manage such estates as yours  some better  look you ebbo said wildschloss you have erredyou have been hasty but tell me where to find another youth whose strongest purpose was as wise as your errors or who cared for others good more than for his own violence and vainglory  brief as your time has been one knows when one is on your bounds by the aspect of your serfs the soundness of their dwellings the prosperity of their crops and cattle above all by their face and tone if one asks for their lord  ah it was friedel they loved  they scarce knew me from friedel  such as you are with all the blunders you have made and will make you are the only youth i know to whom i could intrust my child or my lands  the old wildschloss castle is a male fief and would return to you but there are domains since granted that will cause intolerable trouble and strife unless you and my poor little heiress are united  as for age you are  eighteen next easter  then there are scarce eleven years between you  you will find the little one a blooming bride when your first deeds in arms have been fought out  and if my mother trains her up said ebbo thoughtfully she will be all the better daughter to her  but sir cousin you know i too must be going  so soon as i can brook the saddle i must seek out and ransom my father  that is like to be a far shorter and safer journey than mine  the genoese and venetians understand traffic with the infidels for their captives and only by your own fault could you get into danger  even at the worst should mishap befall you you could so order matters as to leave your girlwidow in your mothers charge  then added ebbo she would still have one left to love and cherish her  sir kasimir it is well though if you knew me without my friedel you would repent of your bargain  thanks from my heart said wildschloss but you need not be concerned  you have never been overfriendly with me even with friedel at your side  but to business my son  you will endure that title from me now  my time is short  what would you have me do  shall i send the little one a betrothal ring and ride to ulm to wed and fetch her home in spring  that may hardly serve  these kinsmen would have seized on her and the castle long ere that time  the only safety is the making wedlock as fast as it can be made with a child of such tender years  mine is the only power that can make the abbess give her up and therefore will i ride this moonlight night to ulm bring the little one back with me by the time the reconciliation be concluded and then shall ye be wed by the abbot of st ruprechts with the kaisar for a witness and thus will the knot be too strong for the trautbachs to untie  ebbo looked disconcerted and gasped as if this were overquick worktomorrow he said  knows my mother  i go to speak with her at once  the kaisars consent i have as he says if we have one vassal who has common sense and honesty let us make the most of him  ah my son i shall return to see you his counsellor and friend  those days had no delicacies as to the ladys side taking the initiative  and in effect the wealth and power of wildschloss so much exceeded those of the elder branch that it would have been presumptuous on eberhards part to have made the proposal  it was more a treaty than an affair of hearts and sir kasimir had not even gone through the form of inquiring if ebbo were fancyfree  it was true indeed that he was still a boy with no passion for any one but his mother but had he even formed a dream of a ladye love it would scarcely have been deemed a rational objection  the days of romance were no days of romance in marriage  yet christina wedded herself for pure love felt this obstacle strongly  the scheme was propounded to her over the hall fire by no less a person than maximilian himself and he whose perceptions were extremely keen when he was not too much engrossed to use them observed her reluctance through all her timid deference and probed her reasons so successfully that she owned at last that though it might sound like folly she could scarce endure to see her son so bind himself that the romance of his life could hardly be innocent  nay lady was the answer in a tone of deep feeling  neither lands nor honours can weigh down the upspringing of true love and he bowed his head between his hands  verily all the low countries had not impeded the truehearted affection of maximilian and mary and though since her death his want of selfrestraint had marred his personal character and morals and though he was now on the point of concluding a most loveless political marriage yet still mary wasas he shows her as the beatrice of both his strange autobiographical allegoriesthe guiding star of his fitful life and in heart his fidelity was so unbroken that when after a long pause he again looked up to christina he spoke as well understanding her feelings  i know what you would say lady your son hardly knows as yet how much is asked of him and the little maid to whom he vows his heart is overyoung to secure it  but lady i have often observed that men whose family affections are as deep and fervent as your sons are for you and his brother seldom have wandering passions but that their love flows deep and steady in the channels prepared for it let your young freiherr regard this damsel as his own and you will see he will love her as such  i trust so my liege  moreover if she turn out like the spiteful trautbach folk said maximilian rather wickedly plenty of holes can be picked in a babywedding  no fear of its overfirmness  i never saw one come to good only he must keep firm hold on the lands  this was not easy to answer coming from a prince who had no small experience in premature bridals coming to nothing and christina felt that the matter was taken out of her hands and that she had no more to do but to enjoy the warmhearted kaisars praises of her son  in fact the general run of nobles were then so boorish and violent compared with the citizens that a nobleman who possessed intellect loyalty and conscience was so valuable to the sovereign that maximilian was rejoiced to do all that either could bind him to his service or increase his power  the true history of this expedition on the emperors part was thisthat he had consulted kasimir upon the question of the debateable ford and the feud of adlerstein and schlangenwald asking further how his friend had sped in the wooing of the fair widow to which he remembered having given his consent at ulm  wildschloss replied that though backed up by her kindred at ulm he had made no progress in consequence of the determined opposition of her two sons and he had therefore resolved to wait a while and let her and the young baron feel their inability to extricate themselves from the difficulties that were sure to beset them without his authority influence and experiencefully believing that some predicament might arise that would bring the mother to terms if not the sons  this disaster did seem to have fallen out and he had meant at once to offer himself to the lady as her supporter and advocate able to bring about all her son could desire though he owned that his hopes would have been higher if the survivor had been the gentle friendly friedmund rather than the hot and imperious eberhard who he knew must be brought very low ere his objections would be withdrawn  the touch of romance had quite fascinated maximilian  he would see the lady and her son  he would make all things easy by the personal influence that he so well knew how to exert backed by his imperial authority and both should see cause to be thankful to purchase consent to the bridgebuilding and pardon for the fray by the marriage between the widow and sir kasimir  but the last of the knights was a gentleman and the meek dignity of his hostess had hindered him from pressing on her any distasteful subject until her sons explanation of the uncertainty of her husbands death had precluded all mention of this intention besides maximilian was himself greatly charmed by ebbos own qualitiespartly perhaps as an intelligent auditor but also by his good sense high spirit and above all by the ready and delicate tact that had both penetrated and respected the disguise  moreover maximilian though a faulty was a devout man and could appreciate the youths unswerving truth under circumstances that did in effect imperil him more really than his guest  in this mood maximilian felt disposed to be rid to the very utmost of poor sir kasimirs unlucky attachment to a wedded lady and receiving letters suggestive of the eastern mission instantly decided that it would only be doing as he would be done by instantly to order the disappointed suitor off to the utmost parts of the earth where he would much have liked to go himself save for the unlucky clog of all the realm of germany  that sir kasimir had any tie to home he had for the moment entirely forgotten and had he remembered it the knight was so eminently fitted to fulfil his purpose that it could hardly have been regarded  but when wildschloss himself devised his little heiress s union with the head of the direct line it was a most acceptable proposal to the emperor who set himself to forward it at once out of policy and as compensation to all parties  and so christinas gentle remonstrance was passed by  yet with all her sense of the venture it was thankworthy to look back on the trembling anxiety with which she had watched her boys childhood and all his temptations and perils and compare her fears with his present position  his alliance courted his wisdom honoured the child of the proud contemned outlaw received as the favourite of the emperor and the valued ally of her own honoured burgher world  yet he was still a mere lad  how would it be for the future  would he be unspoiled  yes even as she already viewed one of her twins as the star on highnay when kneeling in the chapel her dazzling tears made stars of the glint of the light reflected in his bright helmetmight she not trust that the other would yet run his course to and fro as the spark in the stubble    chapter xxiii  the altar of peace    no one could bear to waken the young baron till the sun had risen high enough to fall on his face and unclose his eyes  mother ever his first word you have let me sleep too long  thou didst wake too long i fear me  i hoped you knew it not  yes my wound throbbed sore and the wonders of the day whirled round my brain like the wild huntsmans chase  and cruel boy thou didst not call to me  what with such a yesterday and such a morrow for you while chance what may i can but lie still  i thought i must call if i were still so wretched when the last moonbeam faded but behold sleep came and therewith my friedel sat by me and has sung songs of peace ever since  and hath lulled thee to content dear son  content as the echo of his voice and the fulfilment of his hope can make me said ebbo  and so christina made her son ready for the days solemnities arraying him in a fine holland shirt with exquisite broidery of her own on the collar and sleeves and carefully disposing his long glossy dark brown hair so as to fall on his shoulders as he lay propped up by cushions  she would have thrown his crimson mantle round him but he repelled it indignantly  gay braveries for me while my friedel is not yet in his restingplace  herethe black velvet cloak  alas ebbo it makes thee look more of a corpse than a bridegroom thou wilt scare thy poor little spouse  ah it was not thus i had fancied myself decking thee for thy wedding  poor little one said ebbo  if as your uncle says mourning is the seed of joy this bridal should prove a gladsome one  but let her prove a loving child to you and honour my friedels memory then shall i love her well  do not fear motherling with the roots of hatred and jealousy taken out of the heart even sorrow is such peace that it is almost joy  it was over early for pain and sorrow to have taught that lesson thought the mother as with tender tears she gave place to the priest who was to begin the solemnities of the day by shriving the young baron  it was father norbert who had in this very chamber baptized the brothers while their grandmother was plotting the destruction of their godfather even while he gave friedmund his name of peacefather norbert who had from the very first encouraged the drooping heartstricken solitary christina not to be overcome of evil but to overcome evil with good  a temporary altar was erected between the windows and hung with the silk and embroidery belonging to that in the chapel  a crucifix was placed on it with the shrine of the stone of nicaea one or two other relics brought on st ruprechts cloister and a beautiful motherofpearl and gold pyx also from the abbey containing the host  these were arranged by the chaplain father norbert and three of his brethren from the abbey  and then the father abbot a kindly dignified old man who had long been on friendly terms with the young baron entered and after a few kind though serious words to him assumed a gorgeous cope stiff with gold embroidery and standing by the altar awaited the arrival of the other assistants at the ceremony  the slender youthfullooking pensive lady of the castle in her wonted mourning dress was courteously handed to her sons bedside by the emperor  he was in his plain buff leathern hunting garb unornamented save by the rich clasp of his swordbelt and his gold chain and his head was only covered by the long silken locks of fair hair that hung round his shoulders but now that his large keen dark blue eyes were gravely restrained and his eager face composed his countenance was so majestic his bearing so lofty that not all his crowns could have better marked his dignity  behind him came a sunburnt hardy man wearing the white mantle and black fleurdelispointed cross of the teutonic order  a thrill passed through ebbos veins as he beheld the man who to him represented the murderer of his brother and both his grandfathers the cruel oppressor of his father and the perpetrator of many a more remote but equally unforgotten injury  and in like manner sir dankwart beheld the actual slayer of his father and the heir of a long score of deadly retribution  no wonder then that while the emperor spoke a few words of salutation and inquiry gracious though not familiar the two foes scanned one another with a shiver of mutual repulsing and a sense that they would fain have fought it out as in the good old times  however ebbo only beheld a somewhat dull heavy honestlooking visage of about thirty years old goodnature written in all its flat german features and a sort of puzzled wonder in the wide light eyes that stared fixedly at him no doubt in amazement that the mighty hugelimbed wolfgang could have been actually slain by the delicatelyframed youth now more colourless than ever in consequence of the mornings fast  schleiermacher was also present and the chief followers on either hand had come into the lower part of the roomhatto heinz and koppel looking far from contented some of the emperors suite and a few attendants of schlangenwald like himself connected with the teutonic order  the emperor spoke  we have brought you together herr graff von schlangenwald and herr freiherr von adlerstein because ye have given us reason to believe you willing to lay aside the remembrance of the foul and deadly strifes of your forefathers and to live as good christians in friendship and brotherhood  sire it is true said schlangenwald and it is true said ebbo  that is well replied maximilian  nor can our reign better begin than by the closing of a breach that has cost the land some of its bravest sons  dankwart von schlangenwald art thou willing to pardon the heir of adlerstein for having slain thy father in free and honourable combat as well as doubtless for other deeds of his ancestors more than i know or can specify  yea truly i pardon him my liege as befits my vow  and thou eberhard von adlerstein dost thou put from thee vengeance for thy twin brothers death and all the other wrongs that thine house has suffered  i put revenge from me for ever  ye agree further then instead of striving as to your rights to the piece of meadow called the debateable strand and to the wrecks of burthens there cast up by the stream ye will unite with the citizens of ulm in building a bridge over the braunwasser where your mutual portions thereof being decided by the swabian league toll may be taken from all vehicles and beasts passing there over  we agree said both knights  and i also on behalf of the two guilds of ulm added moritz schleiermacher  likewise continued the emperor for avoidance of debate and to consecrate the spot that has caused so much contention ye will jointly erect a church where may be buried both the relatives who fell in the late unhappy skirmish and where ye will endow a perpetual mass for their souls and those of others of your two races  thereto i willingly agree said the teutonic knight  but to ebbo it was a shock that the pure gentle friedmund should thus be classed with his treacherous assassin and he had almost declared that it would be sacrilege when he received from the emperor a look of stern surprised command which reminded him that concession must not be all on one side and that he could not do friedel a greater wrong than to make him a cause of strife  so though they half choked him he contrived to utter the words i consent  and in token of amity i here tear up and burn all the feuds of adlerstein said schlangenwald producing from his pouch a collection of hostile literature beginning from a crumpled strip of yellow parchment and ending with a coarse paper missive in the clerkly hand of burgherbred hugh sorel and bearing the crooked signatures of the last two eberhards of adlersteinall with great seals of the eagle shield appended to them  a similar collection which with one or two other family defiances and the letters of investiture recently obtained at ulm formed the whole archives of adlersteinhad been prepared within ebbos reach and each of the two taking up a dagger made extensive gashes in these documents and thenwith no mercy to the future antiquaries who would have gloated over themthe whole were hurled into the flames on the hearth where the odour they emitted if not grateful to the physical sense should have been highly agreeable to the moral  then holy father abbot said maximilian let us ratify this happy and christian reconciliation by the blessed sacrifice of peace over which these two faithful knights shall unite in swearing goodwill and brotherhood  such solemn reconciliations were frequent but alas were too often a mockery  here however both parties were men who felt the awe of the promise made before the pardonwinner of all mankind  ebbo bred up by his mother in the true life of the church and comparatively apart from practical superstitions felt the import to the depths of his inmost soul with a force heightened by his bodily state of nervous impressibility and his wan wasted features and dark shining eyes had a strange spiritual beam half passion and half awe as he followed the words of universal forgiveness and lofty praise that he had heard last in his anguished trance when his brother lay dying beside him and leaving him behind  he knew now that it was for this  his deep repressed ardour and excitement were no small contrast to the sober matteroffact demeanour of the teutonic knight who comported himself with the mechanical decorum of an ecclesiastic but quite as one who meant to keep his word  maximilian served the mass in his royal character as subdeacon  he was fond of so doing either from humility or love of incongruity or both  no one however communicated except the clergy and the parties concerned dankwart first as being monk as well as knight then eberhard and his mother and then followed interposed into the rite the oath of pardon friendship and brotherhood administered by the abbot and followed by the solemn kiss of peace  there was now no recoil eberhard raised himself to meet the lips of his foe and his heart went with the embrace  nay his inward ear dwelt on friedmunds song mingling with the concluding chants of praise  the service ended it was part of the pledge of amity that the reconciled enemies should break their fast together and a collation of white bread and wine was provided for the purpose  the emperor tried to promote free and friendly talk between the two adversaries but not with great success for dankwart though honest and sincere seemed extremely dull  he appeared to have few ideas beyond his prussian commandery and its routine discipline and to be lost in a castle where all was at his sole will and disposal and he caught eagerly at all proposals made to him as if they were new lights  as for instance that some impartial arbitrator should be demanded from the swabian league to define the boundary and that next rogation tide the two knights should ride or climb it in company while meantime the serfs should be strictly charged not to trespass and any transgressor should be immediately escorted to his own lord  but quoth sir dankwart in a most serious tone i am told that a shebear wons in a den on yonder crag between the pass you call the gemsbocks and the schlangenwald valley  they told me the right in it had never been decided and i have not been up myself  to say truth i have lived so long in the sand plains as to have lost my mountain legs and i hesitated to see if a hunter could mount thither for fear of fresh offence but if she bide there till rogationtide it will be ill for the lambs  is that all cried maximilian  then will i a neutral kill your bear for you gentlemen so that neither need transgress this new crag of debate  ill go down and look at your bear spears friend ebbo and be ready so soon as kasimir has done with his bridal  that crag cried ebbo  little good will it do either of us sire it is a mere wall of sloping rock slippery as ice and with only a stone or matting of ivy here and there to serve as foothold  where bear can go man can go replied the kaisar  oh yes  we have been there craving your pardon herr graf said ebbo after a dead chamois that rolled into a cleft but it is the worst crag on all the hill and the frost will make it slippery sire if you do venture it i conjure you to take koppel and climb by the rocks from the left not the right which looks easiest  the yellow rock with a face like a mans is the safer but ach it is fearful for one who knows not the rocks  if i know not the rocks all true german rocks know me smiled maximilian to whom the danger seemed to be such a stimulus that he began to propose the bearhunt immediately as an interlude while waiting for the bride  however at that moment halfadozen horsemen were seen coming up from the ford by the nearer path and a forerunner arrived with the tidings that the baron of adlerstein wildschloss was close behind with the little baroness thekla  half the moonlight night had sir kasimir and his escort ridden and after a brief sleep at the nearest inn outside ulm he had entered in early morning demanded admittance at the convent made short work with the abbess ludmillas arguments claimed his daughter and placing her on a cushion before him on his saddle had borne her away telling her of freedom of the kind lady and the young knight who had dazzled her childish fancy  christina went down to receive her  there was no time to lose for the huntsman kaisar was bent on the slaughter of his bear before dark and if he were to be witness of the wedding it must be immediate  he was in a state of much impatience which he beguiled by teasing his friend wildschloss by reminding him how often he himself had been betrothed and had managed to slip his neck out of the noose  and if my margot be not soon back on my hands i shall give the french credit he said tossing his bearspear in the air and catching it again  why this bride is as long of busking her as if she were a beauty of seventeen  i must be off to my lady bearess  thus nothing could be done to prepare the little maiden but to divest her of her mufflings and comb out her flaxen hair crowning it with a wreath which christina had already woven from the myrtle of her own girlhood scarcely waiting to answer the bewildered queries and entreaties save by caresses and admonitions to her to be very good  poor little thing  she was tired frightened and confused and when she had been brought upstairs she answered the half smiling half shy greeting of her bridegroom with a shudder of alarm and the exclamation where is the beautiful young knight  thats a lady going to take the veil lying under the pall  you look rather like a little nun yourself said ebbo for she wore a little conventual dress but we must take each other for such as we are and as she hid her face and clung to his mother he added in a more cheerful coaxing tone you once said you would be my wife  ah but then there were two of you and you were all shining bright  before she could be answered the impatient emperor returned and brought with him the abbot who proceeded to find the place in his book and to ask the bridegroom for the rings  ebbo looked at sir kasimir who owned that he should have brought them from ulm but that he had forgotten  jewels are not plenty with us said ebbo with a glow of amusement and confusion dawning on his cheek such as reassured the little maid that she beheld one of the two beautiful young knights  must we borrow  christina looked at the ring she had first seen lying on her own eberhards palm and felt as if to let it be used would sever the renewed hope she scarcely yet durst entertain and at the same moment maximilian glanced at his own fingers and muttered none but this unlucky  for it was the very diamond which mary of burgundy had sent to assure him of her faith and summon him to her aid after her fathers death  sir kasimir had not retained the pledge of his own illomened wedlock but in the midst of the dilemma the emperor producing his dagger began to detach some of the massive gold links of the chain that supported his huntinghorn  there said he the little elf of a bride can get her finger into this lesser one and youverily this largest will fit and the goldsmith can beat it out when needed  so on with you in st huberts name father abbot  slenderboned and thin as was ebbos hand it was a very tight fit but the purpose was served  the service commenced and fortunately thanks to theklas conventual education she was awed into silence and decorum by the sound of latin and the sight of an abbot  it was a strange marriage if only in the contrast between the pale expressive face and sad dark eyes of the prostrate youth and the frightened bewildered little girl standing upon a stool to reach up to him with her blue eyes stretched with wonder and her cheeks flushed and pouting with unshed tears her rosy plump hand enclosed in the long white wasted one that was thus for ever united to it by the broken fragments of kaisar maxs chain  the rite over two attestations of the marriage of eberhard freiherr von adlerstein and thekla freiherrinn von adlerstein wildschloss and felsenbach were drawn up and signed by the abbot the emperor count dankwart and the father and mother of the two contracting parties one to be committed to the care of the abbot the other to be preserved by the house of adlerstein  then the emperor as the concluding grace of the ceremonial bent to kiss the bride but tired terrified and cross thekla as if quite relieved to have some object for her resentment returned his attempt with a vehement buffet struck with all the force of her small arm crying out go away with you  i know ive never married you  the better for my eyes said the goodnatured emperor laughing heartily  my lady bearess is like to prove the more courteous bride  fare thee well sir bridegroom he added stooping over ebbo and kissing his brow heaven give thee joy of this days work and of thy faithful little fury  ill send her the bearskin as her meetest weddinggift  and the next that was heard from the kaisar was the arrival of a parcel of italian books for the freiherr eberhard and for the little freiherrinn a large bundle which proved to contain a softlydressed bearskin with the head on the eyes being made of rubies a gold muzzle and chain on the nose and the claws tipped with gold  the emperor had made a point that it should be conveyed to the castle snow or no snow for a yule gift    chapter xxiv  old iron and new steel    the clear sunshine of early summer was becoming low on the hillsides sparkling and dimpling the clear ambercoloured stream of the braunwasser rippled along its stony bed winding in and out among the rocks so humbly that it seemed to be mocked by the wide span of the arch that crossed it in all the might of massive bulwarks and dignified masonry of huge stones  some way above a clearing of the wood below the mountain showed huts and labourers apparently constructing a mill so as to take advantage of the leap of the water from the height above and on the left bank an enclosure was traced out within which were rising the walls of a small church while the noise of the mallet and chisel echoed back from the mountain side and masons white with stone dust swarmed around  across the bridge came a pilgrim marked out as such by hat wallet and long staff on which he leant heavily stumbling along as if both halting and footsore and bending as one bowed down by past toil and present fatigue  pausing in the centre he gazed round with a strange disconcerted airat the castle on the terraced hillside looking down with bright eyes of glass glittering in the sunshine and lighting up even that grim old pile at the banner hanging so lazily that the tinctures and bearings were hidden in the folds then at the crags rosy purple in evening glow rising in broad step above step up to the red eyrie bathed in sunset majesty of dark crimson and above it the sweep of the descending eagle discernible for a moment in the pearly light of the sky  the pilgrims eye lighted up as he watched it but then looking down at bridge and church and trodden wheeltracked path he frowned with perplexity and each painful step grew heavier and more uncertain  near the opposite side of the enclosure there waited a tall rugged looking elderly man with two horsesone an aged mare mane tail and all of the snowiest silvery white the other a little shaggy dark mountain pony with a padsaddle  and close to the bank of the stream might be seen its owner a little girl of some seven years whose tight round lace cap had slipped back as well as her blue silk hood and exposed a profusion of loose flaxen hair and a plump innocent face intent upon some private little bit of building of her own with some pebbles from the brook and some mortar filched from the operations above to the great detriment of her soft pinky fingers  the pilgrim looked at her unperceived and for a moment was about to address her but then with a strange air of repulsion dragged himself on to the porch of the rising church where seated on a block of stone he could look into the interior  all was unfinished but the portion which had made the most progress was a chantrychapel opposite to the porch and containing what were evidently designed to be two monuments  one was merely blocked out but it showed the outline of a warrior bearing a shield on which a coiled serpent was rudely sketched in red chalk  the other in a much more forward state was actually under the hands of the sculptor and represented a slender youth almost a boy though in the full armour of a knight his hands clasped on his breast over a lute an eagle on his shield an eaglecrest on his helmet and under the arcade supporting the altartomb shields alternately of eagles and doves  but the strangest thing was that this young knight seemed to be sitting for his own effigy  the very same face under the very same helmet only with the varied warm hues of life instead of in cold white marble was to be seen on the shoulders of a young man in a gray cloth dress with a black scarf passing from shoulder to waist crossed by a swordbelt  the hair was hidden by the helmet whose raised visor showed keen finelycut features and a pair of dark brown eyes of somewhat grave and sad expression  have a care lucas he presently said i fear me you are chiselling away too much  it must be a softer more rounded face than mine has become and above all let it not catch any saddened look  keep that air of solemn waiting in glad hope as though he saw the dawn through his closed eyelids and were about to take up his song again  verily herr freiherr now the likeness is so far forward the actual sight of you may lead me to mar it rather than mend  so is it well that this should be the last sitting  i am to set forth for genoa in another week  if i cannot get letters from the kaisar i shall go in search of him that he may see that my lameness is no more an impediment  the pilgrim passed his hand over his face as though to dissipate a bewildering dream and just then the little girl all flushed and dabbled flew rushing up from the stream but came to a sudden standstill at sight of the stranger who at length addressed her little lady he said is this the debateable ford  no now it is the friendly bridge said the child  the pilgrim started as with a pang of recollection  and what is yonder castle he further asked  schloss adlerstein she said proudly  and you are the little lady of adlerstein wildschloss  yes again she answered and then gathering courageyou are a holy pilgrim  come up to the castle for supper and rest  and then springing past him she flew up to the knight crying herr freiherr here is a holy pilgrim weary and hungry  let us take him home to the mother  did he take thee for a wild elf said the young man with an elder brotherly endeavour to right the little cap that had slidden under the chin and to push back the unmanageable wealth of hair under it ere he rose and he came forward and spoke with kind courtesy as he observed the wanderers worn air and feeble step  dost need a nights lodging holy palmer  my mother will make thee welcome if thou canst climb as high as the castle yonder  the pilgrim made an obeisance but instead of answering demanded hastily see i yonder the bearing of schlangenwald  even so  schloss schlangenwald is about a league further on and thou wilt find a kind reception there if thither thou art bent  is that graff wolfgangs tomb still eagerly pursued the pilgrim and receiving a sign in the affirmative what was his end  he fell in a skirmish  by whose hand  by mine  ha and the pilgrim surveyed him with undisguised astonishment then without another word took up his staff and limped out of the building but not on the road to schlangenwald  it was nearly a quarter of an hour afterwards that he was overtaken by the young knight and the little lady on their horses just where the new road to the castle parted from the old way by the eagles ladder  the knight reined up as he saw the poor mans slow painful steps and said so thou art not bound for schlangenwald  i would to the village so please youto the shrine of the blessed friedmund  nay at this rate thou wilt not be there till midnight said the young knight springing off his horse thou canst never brook our sharp stones  see thekla do thou ride on with heinz to tell the mother i am bringing her a holy pilgrim to tend  and thou good man mount my old gray  fear not she is steady and surefooted and hath of late been used to a lame rider  ah that is well  thou hast been in the saddle before  to go afoot for the sake of giving a lift to a holy wayfarer was one of the most esteemed acts of piety of the middle age so that no one durst object to it and the palmer did no more than utter a suppressed murmur of acknowledgment as he seated himself on horseback the young knight walking by his rein  but what is this he exclaimed almost with dismay  a road to the castle up here  yes we find it a great convenience  thou art surely from these parts added the knight  i was a manatarms in the service of the baron was the answer in an odd muffled tone  whatof my grandfather was the exclamation  no gruffly  of old freiherr eberhard  not of any of the wildschloss crew  but i am not a wildschloss  i am grandson to freiherr eberhard oh wast thou with him and my father when they were set upon in the hostel he cried looking eagerly up to the pilgrim but the man kept his broadleaved hat slouched over his face and only muttered the son of christina the last word so low that ebbo was not sure that he caught it and the next moment the old warrior exclaimed exultingly and you have had vengeance on them  whenhowwhere  last harvesttideat the debateable strand said ebbo never able to speak of the encounter without a weight at his heart but drawn on by the earnestness of the old foe of schlangenwald  it was a meeting in full careerlances broken swordstroke on either hand i was sore wounded but my sword went through his collarbone  well struck good stroke cried the pilgrim in rapture  and with that sword  with this sword  didst know it said ebbo drawing the weapon and giving it to the old man who held it for a few moments weighed it affectionately and with a long low sigh restored it saying it is well  you and that blade have paid off the score  i should be content  let me dismount  i know my way to the hermitage  nay what is this said ebbo thou must have rest and food  the hermitage is empty scarce habitable  my mother will not be balked of the care of thy bleeding feet  but let me go ere i bring evil on you all  i can pray up there and save my soul but i cannot see it all  see what said ebbo again trying to see his guests face  there may be changes but an old faithful follower of my fathers must ever be welcome  not when his wife has taken a new lord growled the stranger bitterly and he a wildschloss  young man i could have pardoned aught else  i know not who you may be who talk of pardoning my ladymother said ebbo but new lord she has neither taken nor will take  she has refused every offer and now that schlangenwald with his last breath confessed that he slew not my father but sold him to the turks i have been only awaiting recovery from my wound to go in search of him  who then is yonder child who told me she was wildschloss  that child said ebbo with half a smile and half a blush is my wife the daughter of wildschloss who prayed me to espouse her thus early that so my mother might bring her up  by this time they had reached the castle court now a wellkept lordlylooking enclosure where the pilgrim looked about him as one bewildered  he was so infirm that ebbo carefully helped him up the stone stairs to the hall where he already saw his mother prepared for the hospitable reception of the palmer  leaving him at the entrance ebbo crossed the hall to say to her in a low voice this pilgrim is one of the old lanzknechts of my grandfathers time  i wonder whether you or heinz will know him  one of the old sort supremely discontented at change  and thou hast walked up and wearied thyself exclaimed christina grieved to see her sons halting step  a rest will soon cure that said ebbo seating himself as he spoke on a settle near the hall fire but the next moment a strange wild low shriek from his mother made him start up and spring to her side she stood with hands clasped and wondering eyes  the pilgrimhis hat on the ground his white head and rugged face displayedwas gazing as though devouring her with his eyes murmuring unchanged unchanged  what is this thundered the young baron  what are you doing to the lady  hush hush ebbo exclaimed christina  it is thy father  on thy knees  thy father is come  it is our son my own lord  oh embrace him  kneel to him ebbo she wildly cried  hold mother said ebbo keeping his arm round her though she struggled against him for he felt some doubts as he looked back at his walk with the stranger and remembered heinzs want of recognition  is it certain that this is indeed my father  oh ebbo was the cry of poor christina almost beside herself how could i not be sure  i know him  i feel it  oh my lord bear with him  it is his wont to be so loving  ebbo cannot you see it is himself  the young fellow is right said the stranger slowly  i will answer all he may demand  forgive me said ebbo abashed forgive me and as his mother broke from him he fell upon his knee but he only heard his fathers cry ah  stine stine thou alone art the same and looking up saw her with her face hidden in the white beard quivering with a rapture such as he had never seen in her before  it seemed long to him ere she looked up again in her husbands face to sob on  my son  oh my beautiful twins  our son  oh see him dear lord and the pilgrim turned to hear ebbos pardon honoured father and your blessing  almost bashfully the pilgrim laid his hand on the dark head and murmured something then said up then  the slayer of schlangenwald kneeling  ah  stine i knew thy little head was wondrous wise but i little thought thou wouldst breed him up to avenge us on old wolfgang  so slender a lad too  ha schneiderlein old rogue i knew thee holding out his hand  so thou didst get home safe  ay my lord though if i left you alive never more will i call a man dead said heinz  worse luck for metill now said sir eberhard whose tones rather than his looks carried perfect conviction of his identity  it was the old homely accent and gruff goodhumoured voice but with something subdued and broken in the tone  his features had grown like his fathers but he looked much older than ever the hale old mountaineer had done or than his real age so worn and lined was his face his skin tanned his eyelids and temples puckered by burning sun his hair and beard white as the inane of his old mare the proud adlerstein port entirely gone  he stooped even more without his staff than with it and when he yielded himself with a sigh of repose to his wifes tendance she found that he had not merely the ordinary hurts of travelling but that there were old festering scars on his ankles  the gyves he said as she looked up at him with startled pitying eyes  little deemed i that they would ever come under thy tender hands  as he almost timidly smoothed the braid of dark hair on her browso they never burnt thee for a witch after all little one  i thought my mother would never keep her hands off thee and used to fancy i heard the crackling of the flame  she spared me for my childrens sake said christina and truly heaven has been very good to us but never so much as now  my dear lord will it weary thee too much to come to the castle chapel and give thanks she said timidly  with all my heart he answered earnestly  i would go even on my knees  we were not without masses even in tunis but when italian and spaniard would be ransomed and there was no mind of the german i little thought i should ever sing brother lamberts psalm about turning our captivity as rivers in the south  ebbo was hovering round supplying all that was needed for his fathers comfort but his parents were so completely absorbed in one another that he was scarcely noticed and what perhaps pained him more there was no word about friedel  he felt this almost an injustice to the brother who had been foremost in embracing the idea of the unknown father and scarcely understood how his parents shrank from any sorrowful thought that might break in on their newfound joy nor that he himself was so strange and new a being in his fathers eyes that to imagine him doubled was hardly possible to the tardy dulled capacity which as yet seemed unable to feel anything but that here was home and christina  when the chapel bell rang and the pair rose to offer their thanksgiving ebbo dutifully offered his support but was absolutely unseen so fondly was sir eberhard leaning on his wife and her bright exulting smile and shake of the head gave an absolute pang to the son who had hitherto been all in all to her  he followed and as they passed friedmunds coffin he thought his mother pointed to it but even of this he was uncertain  the pair knelt side by side with hands locked together while notes of praise rose from all voices and meantime ebbo close to that coffin strove to share the joy and to lift up a heart that would sink in the midst of selfreproach for undutifulness and would dislike the thought of the rude untaught man holding aloof from him likely to view him with distrust and jealousy and to undo all he had achieved and further absorbing the mother the mother who was to him all the world and for whose sake he had given his best years to the child wife as yet nothing to him  it was reversing the natural order of things that after reigning from infancy he should have to give up at eighteen to one of the last generation and some such thought rankled in his mind when the whole household trooped joyfully out of the chapel to prepare a banquet for their old new lord and their young old lord was left alone  alone with the coffin where the armour lay upon the white cross ebbo threw himself on his knees and laid his head upon it murmuring ah friedel  friedel  would that we had changed places  thou wouldst brook it better  at least thou didst never know what it is to be lonely  herr baron said a little voice  his first movement was impatient  thekla was apt to pursue him wherever he did not want her but here he had least expected her for she had a great fear of that coffin and could hardly be brought to the chapel at prayer times when she generally occupied herself with fancies that the empty helmet glared at her  but now ebbo saw her standing as near as she durst with a sweet wistfulness in her eyes such as he had never seen there before  what is it thekla he said  art sent to call me  no only i saw that you stayed here all alone she said clasping her hands  must i not be alone child he said bitterly  here lies my brother  my mother has her husband again  but you have me cried thekla and as he looked up between amusement and melancholy he met such a loving eager little face that he could not help holding out his arms and letting her cling to him  indeed she said ill never be afraid of the helmet again if only you will not lay down your head there and say you are alone  never thekla while you are my little wife said he and child as she was there was strange solace to his heart in the eyes that once vacant and wondering had now gained a look of love and intelligence  what are you going to do she said shuddering a little as he rose and laid his hand on friedels sword  to make thee gird on thine own knights sword said ebbo unbuckling that which he had so long worn  friedel he added thou wouldst give me thine  let me take up thy temper with it thine openhearted love and humility  he guided theklas happy little fingers to the fastening of the belt and then laying his hand on hers said gravely thekla never speak of what i said just nownot even to the mother  remember it is thy husbands first secret  and feeling no longer solitary when his hand was in the clasp of hers he returned to the hall where his father was installed in the baronial chair in which ebbo had been at home from babyhood  his mothers exclamation showed that her son had been wanting to her and she looked fuller than ever of bliss when ebbo gravely stood before his father and presented him with the good old sword that he had sent to his unborn son  you are like to use it more than inay you have used it to some purpose said he  yet must i keep mine old comrade at least a little while  wife son sword should make one feel the same man again but it is all too wonderful  all that evening and long after his hand from time to time sought the hilt of his sword as if that touch above all proved to him that he was again a free noble in his own castle  the story he told was thus  the swoon in which heinz had left him had probably saved his life by checking the gush of blood and he had known no more till he found himself in a rough cart among the corpses  at schlangenwalds castle he had been found still breathing and had been flung into a dungeon where he lay unattended for how long he never knew since all the early part of the time was lost in the clouds of fever  on coarse fare and scanty drink in that dark vault he had struggled by sheer obstinacy of vitality into recovery  in the very height of midsummer alone did the sun peep through the grating of his cell and he had newly hailed this cheerful visitor when he was roughly summoned placed on horseback with eyes and hands bound and only allowed sight again to find himself among a herd of his fellow germans in the turkish camp they were the prisoners of the terrible turkish raid of 1475 when georg von schenk and fourteen other noblemen of austria and styria were all taken in one unhappy fight and dragged away into captivity with hundreds of lower rank  to sir eberhard the change had been greatly for the better  the turk had treated him much better than the christian and walking in the open air chained to a german comrade was far pleasanter than pining in his lonely dungeon  at adrianople an offer had been made to each of the captives if they would become moslems of entering the ottoman service as spahis but with one voice they had refused and had then been draughted into different divisions  the fifteen nobles who had been offered for ransom were taken to constantinople to await its arrival and they had promised sir eberhard to publish his fate on their return to their homes and though he knew the family resources too well to have many hopes he was rather hurt to find that their promise had been unfulfilled  alas they had no opportunity said ebbo  gulden were scarce or were all in kaisar friedrichs great chest the ransoms could not be raised and all died in captivity  i heard about it when i was at wurms last month  the boy at wurms almost gasped sir eberhard in amaze  i had to be there about matters concerning the wildschloss lands and the bridge said ebbo and both dankwart von schlangenwald and i made special inquiries about that company in case you should have shared their fate  i hoped to have set forth at that time but the kaisar said i was still too lame and refused me license or letters to the sultan  you would not have found me said his father narrating how he with a large troop of captives had been driven down to the coast where they were transferred to a moorish slavedealer who shipped them off for tunis  here after their first taste of the miseries of a sea life the alternative of islam or slavery was again put before them and by the holy stone of nicaea said sir eberhard i thought by that time that the infidels had the advantage of us in goodwill and friendliness but when they told me women had no souls at all no more than a horse or dog i knew it was but an empty dream of a religion for did i not know that my little ermentrude and thou stine had finer clearer wiser souls than ever a man i had known nay nay quoth i ill cast in my lot where i may meet my wife hereafter should i never see her here  he had then been allotted to a corsair and had thenceforth been chained to the bench of rowers between the two decks where in stifling heat and stench in storm or calm healthy or diseased the wretched oarsmen were compelled to play the part of machinery in propelling the vessel in order to capture christian shipsmaking exertions to which only the perpetual lash of the galleymaster could have urged their exhausted frames often not desisting for twenty or thirty hours and rowing still while sustenance was put into their mouths by their drivers many a man drew has last breath with his last stroke and was at the first leisure moment hurled into the waves  it was the description that had so deeply moved friedel long ago and christina wept over it as she looked at the bowed form once so proud and free and thought of the unhealed scars  but there her husband added he had been chained next to a holy friar of german blood like himself a captive of the great styrian raid and while some blasphemed in their misery or wildly chid their patron saints this good man strove to show that all was to work out good he had a pious saying for all that befell and adored the will of god in thus purifying him and if it were thus with a saint like him i thought what must it be with a rough freebooting godless sinner such as i had been  seeand he took out a rosary of strung bladders of seaweed that is what he left me when he died and what i meant to have been telling for ever up in the hermitage  he died then  ayhe died on the shore of corsica while most of the dogs were off harrying a village inland and we had a sort of respite or i trow he would have rowed till his last gasp  how he prayed for the poor wretches they were gone to attackay and for all of usfor me alsotheres enough of it  such talk skills not now  it was plain that sir eberhard had learnt more christianity in the hold of his moorish pirate ship than ever in the holy roman empire and a weight was lifted off his sons mind by finding that he had vowed never to return to a life of violence even though fancying a life of penance in a hermitage the only alternative  ebbo asked if the genoese merchant ser gian battista dei battiste had indeed been one of his fellowcaptives  hawhat and on the repetition truly i knew him merchant gian as we used to call him but you twang off his name as they speak it in his own stately city  christina smiled  ebbo learnt the italian tongue this winter from our chaplain who had studied at bologna  he was told it would aid in his quest of you  tell me not said the traveller holding up his hands in deprecation the junker is worse than a priest  and yet he killed old wolfgang  but what of gian  holddid not he when i was with him at genoa tell me a story of being put into a dungeon in a mountain fortress in germany and released by a pair of young lads with eyes beaming in the sunrise who vanished just as they brought him to a cloister  nay he deemed it a miracle of the saints and hung up a votive picture thereof at the shrine of the holy cosmo and damian  he was not so far wrong in deeming one of the lads near of kin to the holy ones said christina softly  and ebbo briefly narrated the adventure when it evidently appeared that his having led at least one foray gave his father for the first time a fellowfeeling for him and a sense that he was one of the true old stock but when he heard of the release he growled so how would a lad have fared who so acted in my time  my poor old mother  she must have been changed indeed not to have scourged him till he had no strength to cry out  he was my prisoner said ebbo in his old defiant tone i had the right  ah well the junker has always been master here and i never said the elder knight looking round rather piteously and ebbo with a sudden movement exclaimed nay sir you are the only lord and master and i stand ready to be the first to obey you  you  a fine young booklearned scholar already knighted and with all these wildschloss lands too said sir eberhard gazing with a strange puzzled look at the delicate but spirited features of this strange perplexing son  reach hither your hand boy  and as he compared the slender shapely hand of such finelytextured skin with the breadth of his own horny giants paw he tossed it from him shaking his head with a gesture as if he had no commands for such femininelooking fingers to execute and mortifying ebbo not a little  ah said christina apologetically it always grieved your mother that the boys would resemble me and mine  but when daylight comes ebbo will show you that he has not lost the old german strength  no doubtno doubt said sir eberhard hastily since he has slain schlangenwald and if the former state of things be at an end the less he takes after the ancient stock the better  but i am an old man now stine though thou lookst fair and fresh as ever and i do not know what to make of these things  white napery on the table glass drinking thingsnay were it not for thee and the schneiderlein i should not know i was at home  he was led back to his narration and it appeared that after some years spent at the oar certain bleedings from the lungs the remains of his wound had become so much more severe as to render him useless for naval purposes and as he escaped actually dying during a voyage he was allowed to lie by on coming into port till he had in some degree recovered and then had been set to labour at the fortifications chained to another prisoner and toiling between the burning sand and burning sun but treated with less horrible severity than the necessities of the sea had occasioned on board ship and experiencing the benefit of intercourse with the better class of captives whom their miserable fate had thrown into the hands of the moors  it was a favourite almsdeed among the provencals spaniards and italians to send money for the redemption of prisoners to the moors and there was a regular agency for ransoms through the jews but german captives were such an exception that no one thought of them and many a time had the summons come for such and such a slave by name or for five poor sicilians twenty genoese a dozen marseillais or the like but still no word for the swabian till he had made up his mind that he should either leave his bones in the hot mud of the harbour or be only set free by some gallant descent either of the brave king of portugal or of the knights of rhodes of whom the captives were ever dreaming and whispering  at length his own slave name was shouted he was called up by the captain of his gang and while expecting some fresh punishment or maybe to find himself sold into some domestic form of slavery he was set before a jewish agent who after examining him on his name country and station and comparing his answers with a paper of instructions informed him that he was ransomed caused his fetters to be struck off and shipped him off at once for genoa with orders to the captain to consign him to the merchant signor del battiste by him sir eberhard had been received with the warmest hospitality and treated as befitted his original station but battista disclaimed the merit of having ransomed him  he had but acted he said as the agent of an austrian gentleman from whom he had received orders to inquire after the swabian baron who had been his fellowcaptive and if he were still living to pay his ransom and bring him home  the namethe name eagerly asked ebbo and his mother at once  the name  gian was wont to make bad work of our honest german names but i tried to learn thisbeing so beholden to him  i even caused it to be spelt over to me but my letters long ago went from me  it seems to me that the man is a knighterrant like those of thy ballads stineone ritter theurtheur  theurdank cried ebbo  ay theurdank  what you know him  there is nothing you and your mother dont know i believe  know him  father he is our greatest and noblest  he has been kind to me beyond description  he is the kaisar  now i see why he had that strange arch look which so vexed me when he forbade me on my allegiance to set forth till my lameness should be gone  long ago had he asked me all about gian battista  to him he must have written  the kaisar said sir eberhard  nay the poor fellows i left in turkey ever said he was too close of fist for them to have hope from him  oh that was old kaisar friedrich  this is our own gallant maximiliana knight as true and brave as ever was paladin said christina and most truly loving and prizing our ebbo  and yet i wishi wish said ebbo that he had let me win my fathers liberty for myself  yea well said his father there spoke the adlerstein  we never were wont to be beholden to king or kaisar  nay say ebbo after a moments recollection colouring as he spoke it is true that i deserved it not  nay sir father it is well  you owe your freedom in very truth to the son you have not known  it was he who treasured up the thought of the captive german described by the merchant and even dreamt of it while never doubting of your death it was he who caught up schlangenwalds first hint that you lived while i in my pride passed it by as merely meant to perplex me it was he who had formed an absolute purpose of obtaining some certainty and at last when my impetuosity had brought on the fatal battle it was he who bought with his own life the avowal of your captivity  i had hoped to have fulfilled friedels trust and to have redeemed my own backwardness but it is not to be  while i was yet lying helpless on my bed the emperor has taken it out of my power  mother you receive him from friedels hands after all  and well am i thankful that so it should be said christina  ah ebbo sorely should i have pined with anxiety when thou wast gone and thy father knows that thou hadst the full purpose  yea i know it said the old man and after all small blame to him even if he had not  he never saw me and light grieves the heart for what the eye hath not seen  but added the wife since the romish king freed you dear lord cared he not better for your journey than to let you come in this forlorn plight  this it appeared was far from being his deliverers fault  money had been supplied and sir eberhard had travelled as far as aosta with a party of italian merchants but no sooner had he parted with them than he was completely astray  his whole experience of life had been as a robber baron or as a slave and he knew not how to take care of himself as a peaceful traveller he suffered fresh extortions at every stage and after a few days was plundered by his guides beaten and left devoid of all means of continuing the journey to which he could hardly hope for a cheerful end  he did not expect to find his mother livingfar less that his unowned wife could have survived the perils in which he had involved her and he believed that his ancestral home would if not a ruin be held by his foes or at best by the rival branch of the family whose welcome of the outlawed heir would probably be to a dungeon if not a halter  yet the only magnet on earth for the lonely wanderer was his native mountain where from some old peasant he might learn how his fair young bride had perished and perhaps the sins of his youth might be expiated by continual prayer in the hermitage chapel where his sister lay buried and whence he could see the crags for which his eye and heart had craved so long with the homesickness of a mountaineer  and now when his own christina had welcomed him with all the overflow of her loving heart unchanged save that hers had become a tenderer yet more dignified loveliness when his gallant son in all the bloom of young manhood received him with dutiful submission when the castle in a state of defence prosperity and comfort of which he had never dreamt was again his ownstill the old man was bewildered and sometimes oppressed almost to distress  he had as it were fallen asleep in one age of the world and wakened in another and it seemed as if he really wished to defer his wakening or else that repose was an absolute novelty to him for he sat dozing in his chair in the sun the whole of the next day and scarcely spoke  ebbo who felt it a necessity to come to an understanding of the terms on which they were to stand tried to refer matters to him and to explain the past but he was met sometimes by a shake of the head sometimes by a nodnot of assent but of sleep and his mother advised him not to harass the wearied traveller but to leave him to himself at least for that day and let him take his own time for exertion letting things meantime go on as usual  ebbo obeyed but with a load at his heart as he felt that all he was doing was but provisional and that it would be his duty to resign all that he had planned and partly executed to this incompetent ignorant rule  he could certainly when not serving the emperor go and act for himself at theklas dower castle of felsenbach and his mother might save things from going to utter ruin at adlerstein but no reflection or selfreproach could make it otherwise than a bitter pill to any telemachus to have to resign to one so unlike ulysses in all but the length of his wanderingsone also who seemed only half to like and not at all to comprehend his telemachus  meantime ebbo attended to such matters as were sure to come each day before the herr freiherr  now it was a question whether the stone for the mill should be quarried where it would undermine a bit of grass land or further on where the road was rougher now berends swine had got into barthels rye and barthel had severely hurt one of themthe herr freiherrs interference could alone prevent a hopeless quarrel now a waggon with ironwork for the mill claimed exemption from toll as being for the baron  and he must send down the toll to obviate injustice towards schlangenwald and ulm  old ulrichs grandson who had run away for a lanzknecht had sent a letter home written by a comrade the baron must read and answer it  steinmarks son wanted to be a poor student  the herr freiherr must write him a letter of recommendation  mother grethels ewe had fallen into a cleft her son came to borrow a rope and ask aid and the baron must superintend the hoisting the poor beast up again hans had found the track of a wolf and knew the hole where a litter of cubs abode the freiherr his wolfhound and his spear were wanted for their destruction  dietrich could not tell how to manage his new arquebus  the baron must teach him to take aim  then there was a letter from ulm to invite the baron to consult on the tax demanded by the emperor for his italian war and how far it should concern the profits of the bridge and another letter from the markgraf of wurtemburg as chief of the swabian league requesting the lord of adlerstein to be on the lookout for a band of robbers who were reported to be in neighbouring hills after being hunted out of some of their other lurkingplaces  that very night or rather nearly at the dawn of a summer morning there was a yelling below the castle and a flashing of torches and tidings rang through it that a boor on the outskirts of the mountain had had his ricks fired and his cattle driven by the robbers and his young daughters carried off  old sir eberhard hobbled down to the hall in time to see weapons flashing as they were dealt out to hear a clear decided voice giving orders to listen to the tramp of horse and watch more reitern pass out under the gateway than ever the castle had counted in his fathers time  then he went back to his bed and when he came down in the morning found all the womankind of the castle roasting and boiling  and at noon little thekla came rushing down from the watchtower with news that all were coming home up the eagles steps and she was sure her baron had sent her and waved to her  soon after her baron in his glittering steel rode his creamcoloured charger once friedels into the castle court followed by his exultant merrymen  they had overtaken the thieves in good time made them captives and recovered the spoil unhurt and heinz and koppel made the castle ring with the deed of their young lord who had forced the huge leader of the band to the earth and kept him down by main strength till they could come to bind him  by main strength slowly asked sir eberhard who had been stirred into excitement  he was a looselimbed awkward fellow said ebbo less strong than he looked  not only that sir said heinz looking from his old master to his young one but old iron is not a whit stronger than new steel though the one looks full of might and you would think the other but a toy  and what have you done with the rogues heads asked the old knight  i looked to see them on your spears  or have you hung them  not so sir said ebbo  i sent the men off to stuttgard with an escort  i dislike doing execution ourselves it makes the men so lawless  besides this farmer was schlangenwalder  and yet he came to you for redress  yes for sir dankwart is at his commandery and he and i agreed to look after each others lands  sir eberhard retired to his chair as if all had gone past his understanding and thence he looked on while his son and wife hospitably regaled and then dismissed their auxiliaries in the rescue  afterwards christina told her son that she thought his father was rested and would be better able to attend to him and ebbo with a painful swelling in his heart approached him deferentially with a request that he would say what was his pleasure with regard to the emperor to whom acknowledgments must in the first place be made for his release and next would arise the whole question of homage and investiture  look you here fair son said sir eberhard rousing himself these things are all past me  ill have none of them  you and your kaisar understand one another and your homage is paid  it boots not changing all for an old fellow that is but come home to die  nay father it is in the order of things that you should be lord here  i never was lord here and what is more i would not and could not be  son i marked you yesterday  you are master as never was my poor father with all the bawling and blows that used to rule the house while these fellows mind you at a word in a voice as quiet as your mothers  besides what should i do with all these mills and bridges of yours and diets and leagues and councils enough to addle a mans brain  no no i could once slay a bear or strike a fair stroke at a schlangenwalder but even they got the better of me and i am good for nothing now but to save my soul  i had thought to do it as a hermit up there but my little christina thinks the saints will be just as well pleased if i tell my beads here with her to help me and i know that way i shall not make so many mistakes  so young sir if you can give the old man a corner of the hearth while he lives he will never interfere with you  and maybe if the castle were in jeopardy in your absence with that newfangled road up to it he could tell the fellows how to hold it out  sirdear father cried the ardent ebbo this is not a fit state of things  i will spare you all trouble and care only make me not undutiful take your own place  mother convince him  no my son said sir eberhard your mother sees what is best for me  i only want to be left to her to rest a little while and repent of my sinful life  as heinz says the rusty old iron must lie by while the new steel does the work  it is quiet that i need  it is joy enough for me to see what she has made you and all around  ah stine my white dove i knew thine was a wise head but when i left thee gentle little frightened fluttering thing how little could i have thought that all alone unaided thou wouldst have kept that little head above water and made thy son work out all these changes thy doingand so i know they are good and seemly  i see thou hast made him clerkly quickwitted and yet a good knight  ah thou didst tell me oft that our lonely pride was not high nor worthy fame stine how didst do it  i did it not dear husband god did it for me  he gave the boys the loving true tempers that worked out the rest  he shielded them and me in our days of peril  yes father added ebbo providence guarded us but above all our chief blessing has been the mother who has made one of us a holy saint and taught the other to seek after him  father i am glad you see how great has been the work of the dove you brought to the eagles nest    chapter xxv  the star and the spark    the year 1531 has begun and schloss adlerstein remains in its strength on the mountain side but with a look of cultivation on its environs such as would have amazed kunigunde  vines run up trellises against the rocks potherbs and flowers nestle in the nooks outbuildings cluster round it and even the grim old keep has a range of buildings connected with it as if the household had entirely outgrown the capacities of the square tower  yet the old hall is still the chief place of assembly and now that it has been wainscoted with a screen of carved wood to shut off the draughty passages and a stove of bright tiles to increase the warmth it is far more cheerful  moreover a window has been opened showing the rich green meadow below with the bridge over the braunwasser and the little church with a spire of pierced lace work and white cottages peeping out of the retreating forest  that is the window which the lady baroness loves  see her there the lovely old lady of seventyfiveyes lovelier than ever for her sweet brown eyes have the same pensive clear beauty enhanced by the snowy whiteness of her hair of which a soft braid shows over the pure pale brow beneath the white band and sweeping black veil that she has worn by right for twenty years  but the slight form is active and brisk and there are ready smiles and looks of interest for the pretty fairhaired maidens three in number who run in and out from their household avocations to appeal to the dear grandmother mischievously to tell of the direful yawns proceeding from brothers ebbo and gottfried over their studies with their tutor or to gaze from the window and wonder if the father with the two brothers friedel max and kasimir will return from ulm in time for the midday eating  ah there they are  quickeyed vittoria has seen the cavalcade first and dances off to tell ermentrude and stine time enough to prepare their last batch of fritters for the newcomers ebbo and gotz rush headlong down the hillside and the lady baroness lays down her distaff and gazes with eyes of satisfied content at the small party of horsemen climbing up the footpath  then when they have wound out of sight round a rock she moves out towards the halldoor with a light quick step for never yet has she resigned her great enjoyment that of greeting her son on the steps of the porchthose steps where she once met such fearful news but where that memory has been effaced by many a cheerful welcome  there then she stands amid the bright throng of grandchildren while the baron and his sons spring from their horses and come up to her  the baron doffs his spanish hat bends the knee kisses her hand and receives her kiss on his brow with the fervour of a life devotion before he turns to accept the salutation of his daughters and then takes her hand with pretty affectionate ceremony to hand her back to her seat  a few words pass between them  no motherling he says i signed it not i will tell you all by and by  and then the midday meal is served for the whole household as of old with the saltcellar in the middle but with a far larger company above it than when first we saw it  the seven young folks preserve a decorous silence save when fraulein ermentrudes cookeries are goodnaturedly complimented by her father or when baron friedmund maximilianus breaks out with some wonderful fact about new armour seen at ulm  he is a handsome fair flaxenhaired young manlike the old adlersteins say the elder peopleand full of honest gaiety and good nature the special pride of his sisters and no sooner is the meal over than with a formal entreaty for dismissal all the seven and all the dogs move off together to that favourite gatheringplace round the stove where all their merry tongues are let loose together  to them the herr vater and the frau grossmutter seem nearly of the same age and of the same generation and verily the eighteen years between the mother and son have dwindled into a very small difference even in appearance and a lesser one in feeling  she is a youthful beautiful old lady he a grave spare worn elderly man in his full strength but with many a trace of care and thought and far more of silver than of brown in his thin hair and pointed beard and with a melancholy thoughtfulness in his clear brown eyesall well corresponding with the gravity of the dress in which he has been meeting the burghers of ulm a black velvet suitonly relieved by his small white lace ruff and the ribbon and jewel of the golden fleece the only other approach to ornament that he wears being that ring long ago twisted off the emperor maximilians chain  but now as he has bowed off the chaplain to his study and excused himself from aiding his two gentlemensquires in consuming their krug of beer and hands his mother to her favourite nook in the sunny window taking his seat by her side his features assume an expression of repose and relaxation as if here indeed were his true home  he has chosen his seat in full view of a picture that hangs on the wainscoted wall near his mothera picture whose pure ethereal tinting of colour limpid as the rainbow yet rich as the most glowing flowerbeds and its soft lovely pose and rounded outlines prove it to be no produce even of one of the great german artists of the time but to have been wrought under an italian sky by such a hand as left us the marvellous smile of mona lisa  it represents two figures one unmistakably himself when in the prime of life his brow and cheeks unfurrowed and his hair still thick shining brown but with the same grave earnestness of the dark eye that came with the early sense of responsibility and with the first sorrow of his youth  the other figure one on which the painter evidently loved to dwell is of a lady so young that she might almost pass for his daughter except for the peculiar tender sweetness that could only become the wife and mother  fair she is as snow with scarce a deepening of the rose on cheek or even lip fragile and transparent as a spiritual form and with a light in the blue eyes and a grace in the soft fugitive smile that scarce seems to belong to earth a beauty not exactly of feature but rather the pathetic loveliness of calm fading awayas if she were already melting into the clear blue sky with the horizon of golden light that the wondrous power of art has made to harmonize with but not efface her blue dress golden hair white coif and fair skin  it is as if she belonged to that sky and only tarried as unable to detach herself from the clasp of the strong hand round and in which both her hands are twined and though the light in her face may be from heaven yet the whole countenance is fixed in one absorbed almost worshipping gaze of her husband with a wistful simplicity and innocence on devotion like the absorption of a loving animal to whom its masters presence is bliss and sunshine  it is a picture to make light in a dark place and that sweet face receives a loving glance nay an absolutely reverent bend of the knightly head as the baron seats himself  so it was as we feared and this schmalkaldic league did not suit thy sense of loyalty my son she asks reading his features anxiously  no mother  i ever feared that further pressure would drive our friends beyond the line where begin schism and rebellion and it seems to me that the moment is come when i must hold me still or transgress mine own sense of duty  i must endure the displeasure of many i love and respect  surely my son they have known you too long and too well not to respect your motives and know that conscience is first with you  scarce may such confidence be looked for mother from the most part who esteem every man a traitor to the cause if he defend it not precisely in the fashion of their own party  but i hear that the king of france has offered himself as an ally and that dr luther together with others of our best divines have thereby been startled into doubts of the lawfulness of the league  and what think you of doing my son  i shall endeavour to wait until such time as the muchneeded general council may proclaim the ancient truth and enable us to avouch it without disunion  into schism i will not be drawn  i have held truth all my life in the church nor will i part from her now  if intrigues again should prevail then heaven help us  meantime mother the best we can as has ever been your warcry  and much has been won for us  here are the little maidens who save vittoria would never have been scholars reading the holy word daily in their own tongue  ach i had not told you mother  i have the court secretarys answer this day about that command in the kaisars guards that my dear old master had promised to his godson  another putoff with flemish courtesy i see by thy face ebbo  not quite that mother  the command is ready for the baron friedmund maximilianus von adlerstein wildschloss and all the rest of it on the understanding that he has been bred up free from all taint of the new doctrine  new  nay it is the oldest of all doctrine  even so  as i ever said dr luther hath been setting forth in greater clearness and fulness what our blessed friedel and i learnt at your knee and my young ones have learnt from babyhood of the true catholic doctrine  yet i may not call my sons faith such as the kaisars spanish consciencekeepers would have it and so the boy must een tarry at home till there be work for his stout arm to do  he seems little disappointed  his laugh comes ringing the loudest of all  the junker is more of a boy at twoandtwenty than i ever recollect myself  he lacks not sense nor wit but a fray or a feast a chase or a dance seem to suffice him at an age when i had long been dwelling on matters of moment  thou wast left to be thine own pilot he is but one of thy gay crew and thus even these stirring times touch him not so deeply as thou wert affected by thine own choice in life between disorderly freedom and honourable restraint  i thought of that choice today mother as i crossed the bridge and looked at the church and more than ever thankful did i feel that our blessed friedel having aided me over that one decisive pass was laid to rest his tender spirit unvexed by the shocks and divisions that have wrenched me hither and thither  nay not hither and thither  ever hadst thou a resolute purpose and aim  ever failed in by my own error or that of otherswhat thou nestling here my little vittoria away from all yonder prattle  dear father if i may i love far best to hear you and the grandmother talk  hear the child  she alone hath your face mother or friedels eyes  is it that thou wouldst be like thy noble roman godmother the marchesa di pescara that makes thee seek our grave company little one  i always long to hear you talk of her and of the italian days dear father and how you won this noble jewel of yours  ah child that was before those times  it was the gift of good kaisar max at his godsons christening when he filled your sweet mother with pretty spite by persuading her that it was a little golden bearskin  tell her how you had gained it my son  by vapouring child and by the dull pride of my neighbours heardst thou never of the siege of padua when we had bayard the best knight in europe and 500 frenchmen for our allies  our artillery had made a breach and the kaisar requested the french knights to lead the storm whereto they answered well and good but our german nobles must share the assault and not leave them to fight with no better backers than the hired lanzknechts  all in reason quoth i and more shame for us not to have been foremost in our kaisars own cause but what said the rest of our misproud chivalry they would never condescend to climb a wall on foot in company with lanzknechts  on horseback must their worships fight or not at all and when to shame them i called myself a mountaineer more used to climb than to ride and vowed that i should esteem it an honour to follow such a knight as bayard were it on all fours then cast they my burgher blood in my teeth  never saw i the kaisar so enraged he swore that all the common sense in the empire was in the burgher blood and that he would make me a knight of the noblest order in europe to show how he esteemed it  and next morning he was gone  so ashamed was he of his own army that he rode off in the night and sent orders to break up the siege  i could have torn my hair for i had just lashed up a few of our nobles to a better sense of honour and we would yet have redeemed our name  and after all the chapter of proud flemings would never have admitted me had not the heralds hunted up that the sorels were gentlemen of blood and coat armour long ago at liege  i am glad my father lived to see that proved mother  he could not honour thee more than he did but he would have been sorely grieved had i been rejected  he often thought me a mechanical burgher as it was  not quite so my son  he never failed to be proud of thy deeds even when he did not understand them but this and the grandsons birth were the crowning joys of his life  yes those were glad triumphant years take them all in all ere the emperor sent me to act ambassador in rome and we left you the two elder little girls and the boy to take care of  my dear little thekla  she had a foreboding that she might never see those children more yet would she have pined her heart away more surely had i left her at home  i never was absent a week but i found her wasted with watching for me  it was those weary seven years of italy that changed thee most my son  apart from you mother and knowing you now indeed to be widowed and with on the one hand such contradictory commands from the emperor as made me sorely ashamed of myself of my nation and of the man whom i loved and esteemed personally the most on earth yet bound there by his express command while i saw my tender wifes health wasting in the climate day by day  yet still while most she gasped for a breath of swabian hills she ever declared it would kill her outright to send her from me  and thus it went on till i laid her in the stately church of her own patroness  then how it would have fared with me and the helpless little ones i know not but for thy noble godmother my vittoria the wise and ready helper of all in trouble the only friend thy mother had made at rome and who had been able from all her heights of learning and accomplishment to value my theklas golden soul in its simplicity  even then when too late came one of the kaisars kindest letters recalling mea letter whose every word i would have paid for with a drop of my own blood six weeks before and which he had only failed to send because his head was running on the plan of that gorgeous tomb where he is not buried  well at least it brought us home to you again once more mother and where you are comfort never has been utterly absent from me  and then coming from the wilful gloom of pope leos court into our germany streamed over by the rays of luthers light it was as if a new world of hope were dawning as if truth would no longer be muffled and the young would grow up to a world far better and purer than the old had ever seen  what trumpetcalls those were and how welcome was the voice of the true catholic faith no longer stifled  and my dear old kaisar with his clear eyes his unfettered mindhe felt the power and truth of those theses  he bade the elector of saxony well to guard the monk luther as a treasure  ah had he been a younger man or had he been more firm and resolute able to act as well as think for himself things might have gone otherwise with the church  he could think but could not act and now we have a man who acts but will not think  it may have been a good day for our german reputation among foreign princes when charles v put on the crown but only two days in my life have been as mournful to me as that when i stood by kaisar maxs deathbed at wells and knew that generous loving fitful spirit was passing away from the earth  never owned i friend i loved so well as kaisar max nor has any emperor done so much for this our dear land  the young emperor never loved thee  he might have treated me as one who could be useful but he never forgave me for shaking hands with luther at the diet of worms  i knew it was all over with my court favour after i had joined in escorting the doctor out of the city  and the next thing was that georg of freundsberg and his friends proclaimed me a bigoted papist because i did my utmost to keep my troop out of the devils holiday at the sack of rome  it has ever been my lot to be in disgrace with one side or the other  here is my daughters marriage hindered on the one hand my sons promotion checked on the other because i have a conscience of my own and not of other peoples  heaven knows the right is no easy matter to find but when one thinks one sees it there is nothing to be done but to guide oneself by it even if the rest of the world will not view it in the same light  nothing else  i doubt me whether it be ever easy to see the veritably right course while still struggling in the midst  that is for after ages which behold things afar off but each man must needs follow his own principle in an honest and good heart and assuredly god will guide him to work out some good end or hinder some evil one  ay mother  each party may guard one side or other of the truth in all honesty and faithfulness he who cannot with his whole heart cast in his lot with eitherhe is apt to serve no purpose and to be scorned  nay ebbo may he not be a witness to the higher and more perfect truth than either party have conceived  nor is inaction always needful  that which is right towards either side still reveals itself at the due moment whether it be to act or to hold still  and verily ebbo what thou didst say even now has set me on a strange thought of mine own dream that which heralded the birth of thyself and thy brother  as thou knowest it seemed to me that i was watching two sparkles from the extinguished needfire wheel  one rose aloft and shone as a star  my guidingstar  the other fulfilled those words of the wise man  it shone and ran to and fro in the grass  and surely my ebbo thy mother may feel that in all these dark days of perplexity and trial the spark of light hath ever shone and drawn its trail of brightness in the gloom even though the way was long and seemed uncertain  the mother who ever fondled me will think so it may be  but ah she had better pray that the light be clearer and that i may not fall utterly short of the star   travellers in wurtemburg may perhaps turn aside from glorious old ulm and the memories of the battlefields around it to the romantic country round the swabian mountains through which descend the tributaries of the danube  here they may think themselves fortunate if they come upon a green valley with a bright mountain torrent dashing through it fresh from the lofty mountain with terraced sides that rise sheer above  an old bridge a mill and a neat german village lie clustered in the valley a seignorial mansion peeps out of the forest glades and a lovely church of rather late gothic but beautifully designed attracts the eye so soon as it can be persuaded to quit the romantic outline of the ruined baronial castle high up on one of the mountain ledges  report declares that there are tombs in the church well worth inspection  you seek out an old venerable bluecoated peasant who has charge of the church  what is yonder castle  it is the castle of adlerstein  are the family still extant  yea yea they built yonder house when the schloss became ruinous they have always been here  the church is very beautiful in its details the carved work of the east end and pulpit especially so but nothing is so attractive as the altar tomb in the chantry chapel  it is a double one holding not as usual the recumbent effigies of a husband and wife but of two knights in armour  who are these good friend  they are the good barons ebbo and friedel  father and son they appear to be killed at the same time in some fatal battle for the white marble face of one is round with youth no hair on lip nor chin and with a lovely peaceful solemnity almost cheerfulness in the expression  the other a bearded man has the glory of old age in his worn features beautiful and restful but it is as if one had gone to sleep in the light of dawn the other in the last glow of sunset  their armour and their crests are alike but the young one bears the eagle shield alone while the elder has the same bearing repeated upon an escutcheon of pretence the young mans hands are clasped over a harp those of the other over a bible and the elder wears the insignia of the order of the golden fleece  they are surely father and son a maiden knight and tried warrior who fell together  no the guide shakes his head they are twin brothers the good barons ebbo and friedel who were born when their father had been taken captive by the saracens while on a crusade  baron friedel was slain by the turks at the bridge foot and his brother built the church in his memory  he first planted vines upon the mountains and freed the peasants from the lords dues on their flax  and it is true that the two brothers may still be seen hovering on the mountainside in the mist at sunset sometimes one sometimes both  you turn with a smile to the inscription sure that those windows those porches that armour never were of crusading date and ready to refute the old peasant  you spell out the upright gothic letters around the cornice of the tomb and you read in mediaeval latin   orate pro anima friedmundis equitis baronis adlersteini  a d mccccxciii   then turn to the other side and read    hic jacet eberardus eques baro adlersteini  ad mdxliii  demum   yes the guide is right  they are brothers with wellnigh a lifetime between their deaths  is that the meaning of that strange demum  few of the other tombs are worth attention each lapsing further into the bad taste of later ages yet there is one still deserving admiration placed close to the head of that of the two barons  it is the effigy of a lady aged and serene with a delicatelycarved face beneath her stiff headgear  surely this monument was erected somewhat later for the inscription is in german  stiff contracted hard to read but this is the rendering of it   here lies christina sorel wife of eberhard xxth baron von adlerstein and mother of the barons eberhard and friedmund  she fell asleep two days before her son on the feast of st john mdxliii  her children shall rise up and call her blessed  erected with full hearts by her grandson baron friedmund maximilianus and his brothers and sisters  farewell
