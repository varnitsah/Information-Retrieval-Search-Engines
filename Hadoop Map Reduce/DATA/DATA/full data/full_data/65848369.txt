   kingston or ballantyne the brave   or cooper of the wood and wave     so be it also and may i   and all my pirates share the grave     where these and their creations lie       part i    the old buccaneer       treasure island       chapter i    the old seadog at the admiral benbow   squire trelawney dr livesey and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about treasure island from the beginning to the end keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted i take up my pen in the year of grace 17 and go back to the time when my father kept the admiral benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabrecut first took up his lodging under our roof  i remember him as if it were yesterday as he came plodding to the inndoor his seachest following behind him in a handbarrow a tall strong heavy nutbrown man his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulders of his soiled blue coat his hands ragged and scarred with black broken nails and the sabrecut across one cheek a dirty livid white i remember him looking round the cove and whistling to himself as he did so and then breaking out in that old seasong that he sang so often afterwards    fifteen men on the dead mans chest      yohoho and a bottle of rum  in the high old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried and when my father appeared called roughly for a glass of rum this when it was brought to him he drank slowly like a connoisseur lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard  this is a handy cove says he at length and a pleasant sittyated grogshopmuch company mate  my father told him novery little company the more was the pity  well then said he this is the berth for mehere you matey he cried to the man who trundled the barrow bring up alongside and help up my chest ill stay here a bit he continued im a plain man rum and bacon and eggs is what i want and that head up there for to watch ships offwhat you mought call me you mought call me captain oh i see what youre atthere and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold you can tell me when ive worked through that says he looking as fierce as a commander  and indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke he had none of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast but seemed like a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike the man who came with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at the royal george that he had inquired what inns there were along the coast and hearing ours well spoken of i suppose and described as lonely had chosen it from the others for his place of residence and that was all we could learn of our guest  he was a very silent man by custom all day he hung round the cove or upon the cliffs with a brass telescope all evening he sat in a corner of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong mostly he would not speak when spoken to only look up sudden and fierce and blow through his nose like a foghorn and we and the people who came about our house soon learned to let him be every day when he came back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road at first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them when a seaman put up at the admiral benbow as now and then some did making by the coast road for bristol he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlour and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present for me at least there was no secret about the matter for i was in a way a sharer in his alarms he had taken me aside one day and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if i would only keep my weathereye open for a seafaring man with one leg and let him know the moment he appeared often enough when the first of the month came round and i applied to him for my wage he would only blow through his nose at me and stare me down but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it bring me my fourpennypiece and repeat his orders to look out for the seafaring man with one leg  how that personage haunted my dreams i need scarcely tell you on stormy nights when the wind shook the four corners of the house and the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs i would see him in a thousand forms and with a thousand diabolical expressions now the leg would be cut off at the knee now at the hip now he was a monstrous kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg and that in the middle of his body to see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and ditch was the worst of nightmares and altogether i paid pretty dear for my monthly fourpennypiece in the shape of these abominable fancies  but though i was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one leg i was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him there were nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his head would carry and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked old wild seasongs minding nobody but sometimes he would call for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing often i have heard the house shaking with yohoho and a bottle of rum all the neighbours joining in for dear life with the fear of death upon them and each singing louder than the other to avoid remark for in these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known he would slap his hand on the table for silence all round he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question or sometimes because none was put and so he judged the company was not following his story nor would he allow any one to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed  his stories were what frightened people worst of all dreadful stories they were about hanging and walking the plank and storms at sea and the dry tortugas and wild deeds and places on the spanish main by his own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men that god ever allowed upon the sea and the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described my father was always saying the inn would be ruined for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannised over and put down and sent shivering to their beds but i really believe his presence did us good people were frightened at the time but on looking back they rather liked it it was a fine excitement in a quiet country life and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him calling him a true seadog and a real old salt and suchlike names and saying there was the sort of man that made england terrible at sea  in one way indeed he bade fair to ruin us for he kept on staying week after week and at last month after month so that all the money had been long exhausted and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more if ever he mentioned it the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say he roared and stared my poor father out of the room i have seen him wringing his hands after such a rebuff and i am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have greatly hastened his early and unhappy death  all the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker one of the cocks of his hat having fallen down he let it hang from that day forth though it was a great annoyance when it blew i remember the appearance of his coat which he patched himself upstairs in his room and which before the end was nothing but patches he never wrote or received a letter and he never spoke with any but the neighbours and with these for the most part only when drunk on rum the great seachest none of us had ever seen open  he was only once crossed and that was towards the end when my poor father was far gone in a decline that took him off dr livesey came late one afternoon to see the patient took a bit of dinner from my mother and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should come down from the hamlet for we had no stabling at the old benbow i followed him in and i remember observing the contrast the neat bright doctor with his powder as white as snow and his bright black eyes and pleasant manners made with the coltish country folk and above all with that filthy heavy bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours sitting far gone in rum with his arms on the table suddenly hethe captain that isbegan to pipe up his eternal song    fifteen men on the dead mans chest      yohoho and a bottle of rum    drink and the devil had done for the rest      yohoho and a bottle of rum  at first i had supposed the dead mans chest to be that identical big box of his upstairs in the front room and the thought had been mingled in my nightmares with that of the onelegged seafaring man but by this time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song it was new that night to nobody but dr livesey and on him i observed it did not produce an agreeable effect for he looked up for a moment quite angrily before he went on with his talk to old taylor the gardener on a new cure for the rheumatics in the meantime the captain gradually brightened up at his own music and at last flapped his hand upon the table before him in a way we all knew to meansilence the voices stopped at once all but dr liveseys he went on as before speaking clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or two the captain glared at him for a while flapped his hand again glared still harder and at last broke out with a villainous low oath silence there between decks  were you addressing me sir says the doctor and when the ruffian had told him with another oath that this was so i have only one thing to say to you sir replies the doctor that if you keep on drinking rum the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel  the old fellows fury was awful he sprang to his feet drew and opened a sailors claspknife and balancing it open on the palm of his hand threatened to pin the doctor to the wall  the doctor never so much as moved he spoke to him as before over his shoulder and in the same tone of voice rather high so that all the room might hear but perfectly calm and steady  if you do not put that knife this instant in your pocket i promise upon my honour you shall hang at next assizes  then followed a battle of looks between them but the captain soon knuckled under put up his weapon and resumed his seat grumbling like a beaten dog  and now sir continued the doctor since i now know theres such a fellow in my district you may count ill have an eye upon you day and night im not a doctor only im a magistrate and if i catch a breath of complaint against you if its only for a piece of incivility like tonights ill take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed out of this let that suffice  soon after dr liveseys horse came to the door and he rode away but the captain held his peace that evening and for many evenings to come       chapter ii    black dog appears and disappears   it was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain though not as you will see of his affairs it was a bitter cold winter with long hard frosts and heavy gales and it was plain from the first that my poor father was little likely to see the spring he sank daily and my mother and i had all the inn upon our hands and were kept busy enough without paying much regard to our unpleasant guest  it was one january morning very earlya pinching frosty morningthe cove all grey with hoarfrost the ripple lapping softly on the stones the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to seaward the captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the beach his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat his brass telescope under his arm his hat tilted back upon his head i remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off and the last sound i heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort of indignation as though his mind was still running upon dr livesey  well mother was upstairs with father and i was laying the breakfasttable against the captains return when the parlour door opened and a man stepped in on whom i had never set my eyes before he was a pale tallowy creature wanting two fingers of the left hand and though he wore a cutlass he did not look much like a fighter i had always my eye open for seafaring men with one leg or two and i remember this one puzzled me he was not sailorly and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too  i asked him what was for his service and he said he would take rum but as i was going out of the room to fetch it he sat down upon a table and motioned me to draw near i paused where i was with my napkin in my hand  come here sonny says he come nearer here  i took a step nearer  is this here table for my mate bill he asked with a kind of leer  i told him i did not know his mate bill and this was for a person who stayed in our house whom we called the captain  well said he my mate bill would be called the captain as like as not he has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him particularly in drink has my mate bill well put it for argument like that your captain has a cut on one cheekand well put it if you like that that cheeks the right one ah well i told you now is my mate bill in this here house  i told him he was out walking  which way sonny which way is he gone  and when i had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was likely to return and how soon and answered a few other questionsah said he thisll be as good as drink to my mate bill  the expression of his face as he said these words was not at all pleasant and i had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was mistaken even supposing he meant what he said but it was no affair of mine i thought and besides it was difficult to know what to do the stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door peering round the corner like a cat waiting for a mouse once i stepped out myself into the road but he immediately called me back and as i did not obey quick enough for his fancy a most horrible change came over his tallowy face and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump as soon as i was back again he returned to his former manner halffawning halfsneering patted me on the shoulder told me i was a good boy and he had taken quite a fancy to me i have a son of my own said he as like you as two blocks and hes all the pride of my art but the great thing for boys is discipline sonnydiscipline now if you had sailed along of bill you wouldnt have stood there to be spoke to twicenot you that was never bills way nor the way of sich as sailed with himand here sure enough is my mate bill with a spyglass under his arm bless his old art to be sure you and mell just go back into the parlour sonny and get behind the door and well give bill a little surprisebless his art i say again  so saying the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me behind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door i was very uneasy and alarmed as you may fancy and it rather added to my fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself he cleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath and all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt what we used to call a lump in the throat  at last in strode the captain slammed the door behind him without looking to the right or left and marched straight across the room to where his breakfast awaited him  bill said the stranger in a voice that i thought he had tried to make bold and big  the captain spun round on his heel and fronted us all the brown had gone out of his face and even his nose was blue he had the look of a man who sees a ghost or the evil one or something worse if anything can be and upon my word i felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn so old and sick  come bill you know me you know an old shipmate bill surely said the stranger  the captain gave a sort of gasp  black dog said he  and who else returned the other getting more at his ease black dog as ever was come for to see his old shipmate billy at the admiral benbow inn ah bill bill we have seen a sight of times us two since i lost them two talons holding up his mutilated hand  now look here said the captain youve run me down here i am well then speak up what is it  thats you bill returned black dog youre in the right of it billy ill have a glass of rum from this dear child here as ive took such a liking to and well sit down if you please and talk square like old shipmates  when i returned with the rum they were already seated on either side of the captains breakfasttableblack dog next to the door and sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one as i thought on his retreat  he bade me go and leave the door wide open none of your keyholes for me sonny he said and i left them together and retired into the bar  for a long time though i certainly did my best to listen i could hear nothing but a low gabbling but at last the voices began to grow higher and i could pick up a word or two mostly oaths from the captain  no no no no and an end of it he cried once and again if it comes to swinging swing all say i  then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and other noisesthe chair and table went over in a lump a clash of steel followed and then a cry of pain and the next instant i saw black dog in full flight and the captain hotly pursuing both with drawn cutlasses and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder just at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous cut which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been intercepted by our big signboard of admiral benbow you may see the notch on the lower side of the frame to this day  that blow was the last of the battle once out upon the road black dog in spite of his wound showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute the captain for his part stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man then he passed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into the house  jim says he rum and as he spoke he reeled a little and caught himself with one hand against the wall  are you hurt cried i  rum he repeated i must get away from here rum rum  i ran to fetch it but i was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen out and i broke one glass and fouled the tap and while i was still getting in my own way i heard a loud fall in the parlour and running in beheld the captain lying fulllength upon the floor at the same instant my mother alarmed by the cries and fighting came running downstairs to help me between us we raised his head he was breathing very loud and hard but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible colour  dear deary me cried my mother what a disgrace upon the house and your poor father sick  in the meantime we had no idea what to do to help the captain nor any other thought but that he had got his deathhurt in the scuffle with the stranger i got the rum to be sure and tried to put it down his throat but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron it was a happy relief for us when the door opened and doctor livesey came in on his visit to my father  oh doctor we cried what shall we do where is he wounded  wounded a fiddlesticks end said the doctor no more wounded than you or i the man has had a stroke as i warned himnow mrs hawkins just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him if possible nothing about it for my part i must do my best to save this fellows trebly worthless life and jim here will get me a basin  when i got back with the basin the doctor had already ripped up the captains sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm it was tattooed in several places heres luck a fair wind and billy bones his fancy were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from itdone as i thought with great spirit  prophetic said the doctor touching this picture with his finger and now master billy bones if that be your name well have a look at the colour of your bloodjim he said are you afraid of blood  no sir said i  well then said he you hold the basin and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein  a great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him first he recognised the doctor with an unmistakable frown then his glance fell upon me and he looked relieved but suddenly his colour changed and he tried to raise himself crying  wheres black dog  there is no black dog here said the doctor except what you have on your own back you have been drinking rum you have had a stroke precisely as i told you and i have just very much against my own will dragged you headforemost out of the grave now mr bones  thats not my name he interrupted  much i care returned the doctor its the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance and i call you by it for the sake of shortness and what i have to say to you is this one glass of rum wont kill you but if you take one youll take another and another and i stake my wig if you dont break off short youll diedo you understand thatdie and go to your own place like the man in the bible come now make an effort ill help you to your bed for once  between us with much trouble we managed to hoist him upstairs and laid him on his bed where his head fell back on the pillow as if he were almost fainting  now mind you said the doctor i clear my consciencethe name of rum for you is death  and with that he went off to see my father taking me with him by the arm  this is nothing he said as soon as he had closed the door i have drawn blood enough to keep him quiet a while he should lie for a week where he isthat is the best thing for him and you but another stroke would settle him       chapter iii    the black spot   about noon i stopped at the captains door with some cooling drinks and medicines he was lying very much as we had left him only a little higher and he seemed both weak and excited  jim he said youre the only one here thats worth anything and you know ive been always good to you never a month but ive given you a silver fourpenny for yourself and now you see mate im pretty low and deserted by all and jim youll bring me one noggin of rum now wont you matey  the doctor i began  but he broke in cursing the doctor in a feeble voice but heartily doctors is all swabs he said and that doctor there why what do he know about seafaring men i been in places hot as pitch and mates dropping round with yellow jack and the blessed land aheaving like the sea with earthquakeswhat do the doctor know of lands like thatand i lived on rum i tell you its been meat and drink and man and wife to me and if im not to have my rum now im a poor old hulk on a leeshore my bloodll be on you jim and that doctor swab and he ran on again for a while with curses look jim how my fingers fidges he continued in the pleading tone i cant keep em still not i i havent had a drop this blessed day that doctors a fool i tell you if i dont have a drain o rum jim ill have the horrors i seen some on em already i seen old flint in the corner there behind you as plain as print i seen him and if i get the horrors im a man that has lived rough and ill raise cain your doctor hisself said one glass wouldnt hurt me ill give you a golden guinea for a noggin jim  he was growing more and more excited and this alarmed me for my father who was very low that day and needed quiet besides i was reassured by the doctors words now quoted to me and rather offended by the offer of a bribe  i want none of your money said i but what you owe my father ill get you one glass and no more  when i brought it to him he seized it greedily and drank it out  ay ay said he thats some better sure enough and now matey did that doctor say how long i was to lie here in this old berth  a week at least said i  thunder he cried a week i cant do that theyd have the black spot on me by then the lubbers is going about to get the wind of me this blessed moment lubbers as couldnt keep what they got and want to nail what is anothers is that seamanly behaviour now i want to know but im a saving soul i never wasted good money of mine nor lost it neither and ill trick em again im not afraid on em ill shake out another reef matey and daddle em again  as he was thus speaking he had risen from bed with great difficulty holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out and moving his legs like so much dead weight his words spirited as they were in meaning contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they were uttered he paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge  that doctors done me he murmured my ears is singing lay me back  before i could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his former place where he lay for a while silent  jim he said at length you saw that seafaring man today  black dog i asked  ah black dog says he hes a bad un but theres worse that put him on now if i cant get away nohow and they tip me the black spot mind you its my old seachest theyre after you get on a horseyou can cant you well then you get on a horse and go towell yes i willto that eternal doctor swab and tell him to pipe all handsmagistrates and sichand hell lay em aboard at the admiral benbowall old flints crew man and boy all on em thats left i was first mate i wasold flints first mate and im the only one as knows the place he gave it me to savannah when he lay adying like as if i was to now you see but you

mate ill tell you if they get that but you keep your weathereye open jim and ill share with you equals upon my honour  he wandered a little longer his voice growing weaker but soon after i had given him his medicine which he took like a child with the remark if ever a seaman wanted drugs its me he fell at last into a heavy swoonlike sleep in which i left him what i should have done had all gone well i do not know probably i should have told the whole story to the doctor for i was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of his confessions and make an end of me but as things fell out my poor father died quite suddenly that evening which put all other matters on one side our natural distress the visits of the neighbours the arranging of the funeral and all the work of the inn to be carried on in the meanwhile kept me so busy that i had scarcely time to think of the captain far less to be afraid of him  he got downstairs next morning to be sure and had his meals as usual though he ate little and had more i am afraid than his usual supply of rum for he helped himself out of the bar scowling and blowing through his nose and no one dared to cross him on the night before the funeral he was as drunk as ever and it was shocking in that house of mourning to hear him singing away at his ugly old seasong but weak as he was we were all in fear of death for him and the doctor was suddenly taken up with a case many miles away and was never near the house after my fathers death i have said the captain was weak and indeed he seemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength he clambered up and downstairs and went from the parlour to the bar and back again and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea holding on to the walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast like a man on a steep mountain he never particularly addressed me and it is my belief he had as good as forgotten his confidences but his temper was more flighty and allowing for his bodily weakness more violent than ever he had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his cutlass and laying it bare before him on the table but with all that he minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather wandering once for instance to our extreme wonder he piped up to a different air a kind of country lovesong that he must have learned in his youth before he had begun to follow the sea  so things passed until the day after the funeral and about three oclock of a bitter foggy frosty afternoon i was standing at the door for a moment full of sad thoughts about my father when i saw some one drawing slowly near along the road he was plainly blind for he tapped before him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes and nose and he was hunched as if with age or weakness and wore a huge old tattered seacloak with a hood that made him appear positively deformed i never saw in my life a more dreadfullooking figure he stopped a little from the inn and raising his voice in an odd singsong addressed the air in front of him  will any kind friend inform a blind man who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defence of his native country england and god bless king georgewhere or in what part of this country he may now be  you are at the admiral benbow black hill cove my good man said i  i hear a voice said hea young voice will you give me your hand my kind young friend and lead me in  i held out my hand and the horrible softspoken eyeless creature gripped it in a moment like a vice i was so much startled that i struggled to withdraw but the blind man pulled me close up to him with a single action of his arm  now boy he said take me in to the captain  sir said i upon my word i dare not  oh he sneered thats it take me in straight or ill break your arm  and he gave it as he spoke a wrench that made me cry out  sir said i it is for yourself i mean the captain is not what he used to be he sits with a drawn cutlass another gentleman  come now march interrupted he and i never heard a voice so cruel and cold and ugly as that blind mans it cowed me more than the pain and i began to obey him at once walking straight in at the door and towards the parlour where our sick old buccaneer was sitting dazed with rum the blind man clung close to me holding me in one iron fist and leaning almost more of his weight on me than i could carry lead me straight up to him and when im in view cry out heres a friend for you bill if you dont ill do this and with that he gave me a twitch that i thought would have made me faint between this and that i was so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that i forgot my terror of the captain and as i opened the parlour door cried out the words he had ordered in a trembling voice  the poor captain raised his eyes and at one look the rum went out of him and left him staring sober the expression of his face was not so much of terror as of mortal sickness he made a movement to rise but i do not believe he had enough force left in his body  now bill sit where you are said the beggar if i cant see i can hear a finger stirring business is business hold out your left handboy take his left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right  we both obeyed him to the letter and i saw him pass something from the hollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captains which closed upon it instantly  and now thats done said the blind man and at the words he suddenly left hold of me and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness skipped out of the parlour and into the road where as i still stood motionless i could hear his stick go taptaptapping into the distance  it was some time before either i or the captain seemed to gather our senses but at length and about at the same moment i released his wrist which i was still holding and he drew in his hand and looked sharply into the palm  ten oclock he cried six hours well do them yet and he sprang to his feet  even as he did so he reeled put his hand to his throat stood swaying for a moment and then with a peculiar sound fell from his whole height faceforemost to the floor  i ran to him at once calling to my mother but haste was all in vain the captain had been struck dead by thundering apoplexy it is a curious thing to understand for i had certainly never liked the man though of late i had begun to pity him but as soon as i saw that he was dead i burst into a flood of tears it was the second death i had known and the sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart       chapter iv    the sea chest   i lost no time of course in telling my mother all that i knew and perhaps should have told her long before and we saw ourselves at once in a difficult and dangerous position some of the mans moneyif he had anywas certainly due to us but it was not likely that our captains shipmates above all the two specimens seen by me black dog and the blind beggar would be inclined to give up their booty in payment of the dead mans debts the captains order to mount at once and ride for doctor livesey would have left my mother alone and unprotected which was not to be thought of indeed it seemed impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the house the fall of coals in the kitchengrate the very ticking of the clock filled us with alarms the neighbourhood to our ears seemed haunted by approaching footsteps and what between the dead body of the captain on the parlour floor and the thought of that detestable blind beggar hovering near at hand and ready to return there were moments when as the saying goes i jumped in my skin for terror something must speedily be resolved upon and it occurred to us at last to go forth together and seek help in the neighbouring hamlet no sooner said than done bareheaded as we were we ran out at once in the gathering evening and the frosty fog  the hamlet lay not many hundred yards away though out of view on the other side of the next cove and what greatly encouraged me it was in an opposite direction from that whence the blind man had made his appearance and whither he had presumably returned we were not many minutes on the road though we sometimes stopped to lay hold of each other and hearken but there was no unusual soundnothing but the low wash of the ripple and the croaking of the crows in the wood  it was already candlelight when we reached the hamlet and i shall never forget how much i was cheered to see the yellow shine in doors and windows but that as it proved was the best of the help we were likely to get in that quarter foryou would have thought men would have been ashamed of themselvesno soul would consent to return with us to the admiral benbow the more we told of our troubles the moreman woman and childthey clung to the shelter of their houses the name of captain flint though it was strange to me was well enough known to some there and carried a great weight of terror some of the men who had been to fieldwork on the far side of the admiral benbow remembered besides to have seen several strangers on the road and taking them to be smugglers to have bolted away and one at least had seen a little lugger in what we called kitts hole for that matter any one who was a comrade of the captains was enough to frighten them to death and the short and the long of the matter was that while we could get several who were willing enough to ride to dr liveseys which lay in another direction not one would help us to defend the inn  they say cowardice is infectious but then argument is on the other hand a great emboldener and so when each had said his say my mother made them a speech she would not she declared lose money that belonged to her fatherless boy if none of the rest of you dare she said jim and i dare back we will go the way we came and small thanks to you big hulking chickenhearted men well have that chest open if we die for it and ill thank you for that bag mrs crossley to bring back our lawful money in  of course i said i would go with my mother and of course they all cried out at our foolhardiness but even then not a man would go along with us all they would do was to give me a loaded pistol lest we were attacked and to promise to have horses ready saddled in case we were pursued on our return while one lad was to ride forward to the doctors in search of armed assistance  my heart was beating finely when we two set forth in the cold night upon this dangerous venture a full moon was beginning to rise and peered redly through the upper edges of the fog and this increased our haste for it was plain before we came forth again that all would be as bright as day and our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers we slipped along the hedges noiseless and swift nor did we see or hear anything to increase our terrors till to our huge relief the door of the admiral benbow had closed behind us  i slipped the bolt at once and we stood and panted for a moment in the dark alone in the house with the dead captains body then my mother got a candle in the bar and holding each others hands we advanced into the parlour he lay as we had left him on his back with his eyes open and one arm stretched out  draw down the blind jim whispered my mother they might come and watch outside and now said she when i had done so we have to get the key off that and whos to touch it i should like to know and she gave a kind of sob as she said the words  i went down on my knees at once on the floor close to his hand there was a little round of paper blackened on the one side i could not doubt that this was the black spot and taking it up i found written on the other side in a very good clear hand this short message you have till ten tonight  he had till ten mother said i and just as i said it our old clock began striking this sudden noise startled us shockingly but the news was good for it was only six  now jim she said that key  i felt in his pockets one after another a few small coins a thimble and some thread and big needles a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away at the end his gully with the crooked handle a pocket compass and a tinderbox were all that they contained and i began to despair  perhaps its round his neck suggested my mother  overcoming a strong repugnance i tore open his shirt at the neck and there sure enough hanging to a bit of tarry string which i cut with his own gully we found the key at this triumph we were filled with hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had slept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival  it was like any other seamans chest on the outside the initial b burned on the top of it with a hot iron and the corners somewhat smashed and broken as by long rough usage  give me the key said my mother and though the lock was very stiff she had turned it and thrown back the lid in a twinkling  a strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior but nothing was to be seen on the top except a suit of very good clothes carefully brushed and folded they had never been worn my mother said under that the miscellany begana quadrant a tin cannikin several sticks of tobacco two brace of very handsome pistols a piece of bar silver an old spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of foreign make a pair of compasses mounted with brass and five or six curious west indian shells it has often set me thinking since that he should have carried about these shells with him in his wandering guilty and hunted life  in the meantime we had found nothing of any value but the silver and the trinkets and neither of these were in our way underneath there was an old boatcloak whitened with seasalt on many a harbourbar my mother pulled it up with impatience and there lay before us the last things in the chest a bundle tied up in oilcloth and looking like papers and a canvas bag that gave forth at a touch the jingle of gold  ill show these rogues that im an honest woman said my mother ill have my dues and not a farthing over hold mrs crossleys bag and she began to count over the amount of the captains score from the sailors bag into the one that i was holding  it was a long difficult business for the coins were of all countries and sizesdoubloons and louisdors and guineas and pieces of eight and i know not what besides all shaken together at random the guineas too were about the scarcest and it was with these only that my mother knew how to make her count  when we were about halfway through i suddenly put my hand upon her arm for i had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my heart into my mouththe taptapping of the blind mans stick upon the frozen road it drew nearer and nearer while we sat holding our breath then it struck sharp on the inndoor and then we could hear the handle being turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter and then there was a long time of silence both within and without at last the tapping recommenced and to our indescribable joy and gratitude died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard  mother said i take the whole and lets be going for i was sure the bolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole hornets nest about our ears though how thankful i was that i had bolted it none could tell who had never met that terrible blind man  but my mother frightened as she was would not consent to take a fraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling to be content with less it was not yet seven she said by a long way she knew her rights and she would have them and she was still arguing with me when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the hill that was enough and more than enough for both of us  ill take what i have she said jumping to her feet  and ill take this to square the count said i picking up the oilskin packet  next moment we were both groping downstairs leaving the candle by the empty chest and the next we had opened the door and were in full retreat we had not started a moment too soon the fog was rapidly dispersing already the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on either side and it was only in the exact bottom of the dell and round the taverndoor that a thin veil still hung unbroken to conceal the first steps of our escape far less than halfway to the hamlet very little beyond the bottom of the hill we must come forth into the moonlight nor was this all for the sound of several footsteps running came already to our ears and as we looked back in their direction a light tossing to and fro and still rapidly advancing showed that one of the newcomers carried a lantern  my dear said my mother suddenly take the money and run on i am going to faint  this was certainly the end for both of us i thought how i cursed the cowardice of the neighbours how i blamed my poor mother for her honesty and her greed for her past foolhardiness and present weakness we were just at the little bridge by good fortune and i helped her tottering as she was to the edge of the bank where sure enough she gave a sigh and fell on my shoulder i do not know how i found the strength to do it at all and i am afraid it was roughly done but i managed to drag her down the bank and a little way under the arch farther i could not move her for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it so there we had to staymy mother almost entirely exposed and both of us within earshot of the inn       chapter v    the last of the blind man   my curiosity in a sense was stronger than my fear for i could not remain where i was but crept back to the bank again whence sheltering my head behind a bush of broom i might command the road before our door i was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive seven or eight of them running hard their feet beating out of time along the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front three men ran together hand in hand and i made out even through the mist that the middle man of this trio was the blind beggar the next moment his voice showed me that i was right  down with the door he cried  ay ay sir answered two or three and a rush was made upon the admiral benbow the lanternbearer following and then i could see them pause and hear speeches passed in a lower key as if they were surprised to find the door open but the pause was brief for the blind man again issued his commands his voice sounded louder and higher as if he were afire with eagerness and rage  in in in he shouted and cursed them for their delay  four or five of them obeyed at once two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar there was a pause then a cry of surprise and then a voice shouting from the house  bills dead  but the blind man swore at them again for their delay  search him some of you shirking lubbers and the rest of you aloft and get the chest he cried  i could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs so that the house must have shook with it promptly afterwards fresh sounds of astonishment arose the window of the captains room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass and a man leaned out into the moonlight head and shoulders and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him  pew he cried theyve been before us someones turned the chest out alow and aloft  is it there roared pew  the moneys there  the blind man cursed the money  flints fist i mean he cried  we dont see it here nohow returned the man  here you below there is it on bill cried the blind man again  at that another fellow probably him who had remained below to search the captains body came to the door of the inn bills been overhauled aready said he nothin left  its these people of the innits that boy i wish i had put his eyes out cried the blind man pew they were here no time agothey had the door bolted when i tried it scatter lads and find em  sure enough they left their glim here said the fellow from the window  scatter and find em rout the house out reiterated pew striking with his stick upon the road  then there followed a great todo through all our old inn heavy feet pounding to and fro furniture thrown over doors kicked in until the very rocks reechoed and the men came out again one after another on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found and just then the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captains money was once more clearly audible through the night but this time twice repeated i had thought it to be the blind mans trumpet so to speak summoning his crew to the assault but i now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet and from its effect upon the buccaneers a signal to warn them of approaching danger  theres dirk again said one twice well have to budge mates  budge you skulk cried pew dirk was a fool and a coward from the firstyou wouldnt mind him they must be close by they cant be far you have your hands on it scatter and look for them dogs oh shiver my soul he cried if i had eyes  this appeal seemed to produce some effect for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber but halfheartedly i thought and with half an eye to their own danger all the time while the rest stood irresolute on the road  you have your hands on thousands you fools and you hang a leg youd be as rich as kings if you could find it and you know its here and you stand there malingering there wasnt one of you dared face bill and i did ita blind man and im to lose my chance for you im to be a poor crawling beggar sponging for rum when i might be rolling in a coach if you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still  hang it pew weve got the doubloons grumbled one  they might have hid the blessed thing said another take the georges pew and dont stand here squalling  squalling was the word for it pews anger rose so high at these objections till at last his passion completely taking the upper hand he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one  these in their turn cursed back at the blind miscreant threatened him in horrid terms and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp  this quarrel was the saving of us for while it was still raging another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamletthe tramp of horses galloping almost at the same time a pistolshot flash and report came from the hedgeside and that was plainly the last signal of danger for the buccaneers turned at once and ran separating in every direction one seaward along the cove one slant across the hill and so on so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but pew him they had deserted whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows i know not but there he remained behind tapping up and down the road in a frenzy and groping and calling for his comrades finally he took the wrong turn and ran a few steps past me towards the hamlet crying  johnny black dog dirk and other names you wont leave old pew matesnot old pew  just then the noise of horses topped the rise and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope  at this pew saw his error turned with a scream and ran straight for the ditch into which he rolled but he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash now utterly bewildered right under the nearest of the coming horses  the rider tried to save him but in vain down went pew with a cry that rang high into the night and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by he fell on his side then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more  i leapt to my feet and hailed the riders they were pulling up at any rate horrified at the accident and i soon saw what they were one tailing out behind the rest was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to dr liveseys the rest were revenue officers whom he had met by the way and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once some news of the lugger in kitts hole had found its way to supervisor dance and set him forth that night in our direction and to that circumstance my mother and i owed our preservation from death  pew was dead stone dead as for my mother when we had carried her up to the hamlet a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again and she was none the worse for her terror though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money in the meantime the supervisor rode on as fast as he could to kitts hole but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle leading and sometimes supporting their horses and in continual fear of ambushes so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the hole the lugger was already under way though still close in he hailed her a voice replied telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm soon after the lugger doubled the point and disappeared mr dance stood there as he said like a fish out of water and all he could do was to despatch a man to b to warn the cutter and that said he is just about as good as nothing theyve got off clean and theres an end only he added im glad i trod on master pews corns for by this time he had heard my story  i went back with him to the admiral benbow and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself and though nothing had been actually taken away except the captains moneybag and a little silver from the till i could see at once that we were ruined mr dance could make nothing of the scene  they got the money you say well then hawkins what in fortune were they after more money i suppose  no sir not money i think replied i in fact sir i believe i have the thing in my breastpocket and to tell you the truth i should like to get it put in safety  to be sure boy quite right said he ill take it if you like  i thought perhaps dr livesey i began  perfectly right he interrupted very cheerily perfectly righta gentleman and a magistrate and now i come to think of it i might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire master pews dead when alls done not that i regret it but hes dead you see and people will make it out against an officer of his majestys revenue if make it out they can now ill tell you hawkins if you like ill take you along  i thanked him heartily for the offer and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were by the time i had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle  dogger said mr dance you have a good horse take up this lad behind you  as soon as i was mounted holding on to doggers belt the supervisor gave the word and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to dr liveseys house       chapter vi    the captains papers   we rode hard all the way till we drew up before dr liveseys door the house was all dark to the front  mr dance told me to jump down and knock and dogger gave me a stirrup to descend by the door was opened almost at once by the maid  is dr livesey in i asked  no she said he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire  so there we go boys said mr dance  this time as the distance was short i did not mount but ran with doggers stirrupleather to the lodge gates and up the long leafless moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens here mr dance dismounted and taking me along with him was admitted at a word into the house  the servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a great library all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them where the squire and dr livesey sat pipe in hand on either side of a bright fire  i had never seen the squire so near at hand he was a tall man over six feet high and broad in proportion and he had a bluff roughandready face all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels his eyebrows were very black and moved readily and this gave him a look of some tempernot bad you would say but quick and high  come in mr dance says he very stately and condescending  goodevening dance says the doctor with a nod and goodevening to you friend jim what good wind brings you here  the supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a lesson and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward and looked at each other and forgot to smoke in their surprise and interest when they heard how my mother went back to the inn dr livesey fairly slapped his thigh and the squire cried bravo and broke his long pipe against the grate long before it was done mr trelawney that you will remember was the squires name had got up from his seat and was striding about the room and the doctor as if to hear the better had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking very strange indeed with his own closecropped black poll  at last mr dance finished the story  mr dance said the squire you are a very noble fellow and as for riding down that black atrocious miscreant i regard it as an act of virtue sir like stamping on a cockroach this lad hawkins is a trump i perceivehawkins will you ring that bell mr dance must have some ale  and so jim said the doctor you have the thing that they were after have you  here it is sir said i and gave him the oilskin packet  the doctor looked it all over as if his fingers were itching to open it but instead of doing that he put it quietly in the pocket of his coat  squire said he when dance has had his ale he must of course be off on his majestys service but i mean to keep jim hawkins here to sleep at my house and with your permission i propose we should have up the cold pie and let him sup  as you will livesey said the squire hawkins has earned better than cold pie  so a big pigeonpie was brought in and put on a sidetable and i made a hearty supper for i was as hungry as a hawk while mr dance was further complimented and at last dismissed  and now squire said the doctor  and now livesey said the squire in the same breath  one at a time one at a time laughed dr liveseyyou have heard of this flint i suppose  heard of him cried the squire heard of him you say he was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed blackbeard was a child to flint the spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that i tell you sir i was sometimes proud he was an englishman ive seen his topsails with these eyes off trinidad and the cowardly son of a rumpuncheon that i sailed with put backput back sir into portofspain  well ive heard of him myself in england said the doctor but the point is had he money  money cried the squire have you heard the story what were these villains after but money what do they care for but money for what would they risk their rascal carcases but money  that we shall soon know replied the doctor but you are so confoundedly hotheaded and exclamatory that i cannot get a word in what i want to know is this supposing that i have here in my pocket some clue to where flint buried his treasure will that treasure amount to much  amount sir cried the squire it will amount to this if we have the clue you talk about i fit out a ship in bristol dock and take you and hawkins here along and ill have that treasure if i search a year  very well said the doctor now then if jim is agreeable well open the packet and he laid it before him on the table  the bundle was sewn together and the doctor had to get out his instrumentcase and cut the stitches with his medical scissors it contained two thingsa book and a sealed paper  first of all well try the book observed the doctor  the squire and i were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it for dr livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the sidetable where i had been eating to enjoy the sport of the search on the first page there were only some scraps of writing such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice one was the same as the tattoomark billy bones his fancy then there was mr w bones mate no more rum off palm key he got itt and some other snatches mostly single words and unintelligible i could not help wondering who it was that had got itt and what itt was that he got a knife in his back as like as not  not much instruction there said dr livesey as he passed on  the next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries there was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money as in common accountbooks but instead of explanatory writing only a varying number of crosses between the two on the 12th of june 1745 for instance a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become due to some one and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause in a few cases to be sure the name of a place would be added as offe caraccas or a mere entry of latitude and longitude as 62° 17 20 19° 2 40  the record lasted over nearly twenty years the amount of the separate entries growing larger as time went on and at the end a grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions and these words appended bones his pile  i cant make head or tail of this said dr livesey the thing is as clear as noonday cried the squire this is the blackhearted hounds accountbook these crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered the sums are the scoundrels share and where he feared an ambiguity you see he added something clearer offe caraccas now you see here was some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast god help the poor souls that manned hercoral long ago  right said the doctor see what it is to be a traveller right and the amounts increase you see as he rose in rank  there was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places noted in the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing french english and spanish moneys to a common value  thrifty man cried the doctor he wasnt the one to be cheated  and now said the squire for the other  the paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of seal the very thimble perhaps that i had found in the captains pocket the doctor opened the seals with great care and there fell out the map of an island with latitude and longitude soundings names of hills and bays and inlets and every particular that would be needed to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores it was about nine miles long and five across shaped you might say like a fat dragon standing up and had two fine landlocked harbours and a hill in the centre part marked the spyglass there were several additions of a later date but above all three crosses of red inktwo on the north part of the island one in the southwest and beside this last in the same red ink and in a small neat hand very different from the captains tottery characters these words bulk of treasure here  over on the back the same hand had written this further information     tall tree spyglass shoulder bearing a point to the n of nne     skeleton island ese and by e     ten feet     the bar silver is in the north cache you can find it by the trend    of the east hummock ten fathoms south of the black crag with the    face on it     the arms are easy found in the sand hill n point of north inlet    cape bearing e and a quarter n                         j f  that was all but brief as it was and to me incomprehensible it filled the squire and dr livesey with delight  livesey said the squire you will give up this wretched practice at once tomorrow i start for bristol in three weeks timethree weekstwo weeksten dayswell have the best ship sir and the choicest crew in england hawkins shall come as cabinboy youll make a famous cabinboy hawkins you livesey are ships doctor i am admiral well take redruth joyce and hunter well have favourable winds a quick passage and not the least difficulty in finding the spot and money to eatto roll into play duckanddrake with ever after  trelawney said the doctor ill go with you and ill go bail for it so will jim and be a credit to the undertaking theres only one man im afraid of  and whos that cried the squire name the dog sir  you replied the doctor for you cannot hold your tongue we are not the only men who know of this paper these fellows who attacked the inn tonightbold desperate blades for sureand the rest who stayed aboard that lugger and more i dare say not far off are one and all through thick and thin bound that theyll get that money we must none of us go alone till we get to sea jim and i shall stick together in the meanwhile youll take joyce and hunter when you ride to bristol and from first to last not one of us must breathe a word of what weve found  livesey returned the squire you are always in the right of it ill be as silent as the grave       part ii    the seacook       chapter vii    i go to bristol   it was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea and none of our first plansnot even dr liveseys of keeping me beside himcould be carried out as we intended the doctor had to go to london for a physician to take charge of his practice the squire was hard at work at bristol and i lived on at the hall under the charge of old redruth the gamekeeper almost a prisoner but full of seadreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures i brooded by the hour together over the map all the details of which i well remembered sitting by the fire in the housekeepers room i approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction i explored every acre of its surface i climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the spyglass and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects sometimes the isle was thick with savages with whom we fought sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual adventures  so the weeks passed on till one fine day there came a letter addressed to dr livesey with this addition to be opened in the case of his absence by tom redruth or young hawkins obeying this order we found or rather i foundfor the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but printthe following important news                               old anchor inn bristol march 1 17     dear liveseyas i do not know whether you are at the hall or still    in london i send this in double to both places     the ship is bought and fitted she lies at anchor ready for sea    you never imagined a sweeter schoonera child might sail hertwo    hundred tons name hispaniola     i got her through my old friend blandly who has proved himself    throughout the most surprising trump the admirable fellow literally    slaved in my interest and so i may say did every one in bristol    as soon as they got wind of the port we sailed fortreasure i    mean  redruth said i interrupting the letter dr livesey will not like that the squire has been talking after all  well whos a better right growled the gamekeeper a pretty rum go if squire aint to talk for dr livesey i should think  at that i gave up all attempt at commentary and read straight on     blandly himself found the hispaniola and by the most admirable    management got her for the merest trifle there is a class of men in    bristol monstrously prejudiced against blandly they go the length of    declaring that this honest creature would do anything for money that    the hispaniola belonged to him and that he sold it me absurdly    highthe most transparent calumnies none of them dare however to    deny the merits of the ship     so far there was not a hitch the workpeople to be sureriggers    and what notwere most annoyingly slow but time cured that it was    the crew that troubled me     i wished a round score of menin case of natives buccaneers or    the odious frenchand i had the worry of the deuce itself to find so    much as half a dozen till the most remarkable stroke of fortune    brought me the very man that i required     i was standing on the dock when by the merest accident i fell in    talk with him i found he was an old sailor kept a publichouse    knew all the seafaring men in bristol had lost his health ashore    and wanted a good berth as cook to get to sea again he had hobbled    down there that morning he said to get a smell of the salt     i was monstrously touchedso would you have beenand out of pure    pity i engaged him on the spot to be ships cook long john silver    he is called and has lost a leg but that i regarded as a    recommendation since he lost it in his countrys service under the    immortal hawke he has no pension livesey imagine the abominable    age we live in     well sir i thought i had only found a cook but it was a crew i    had discovered between silver and myself we got together in a few    days a company of the toughest old salts imaginablenot pretty to    look at but fellows by their faces of the most indomitable spirit    i declare we could fight a frigate     long john even got rid of two out of the six or seven i had already    engaged he showed me in a moment that they were just the sort of    freshwater swabs we had to fear in an adventure of importance     i am in the most magnificent health and spirits eating like a bull    sleeping like a tree yet i shall not enjoy a moment till i hear my    old tarpaulins tramping round the capstan seaward ho hang the    treasure its the glory of the sea that has turned my head so now    livesey come post do not lose an hour if you respect me     let young hawkins go at once to see his mother with redruth for a    guard and then both come full speed to bristol                                                      john trelawney     postscripti did not tell you that blandly who by the way is    to send a consort after us if we dont turn up by the end of august    had found an admirable fellow for sailing mastera stiff man which    i regret but in all other respects a treasure long john silver    unearthed a very competent man for a mate a man named arrow i have    a boatswain who pipes livesey so things shall go manowar fashion    on board the good ship hispaniola     i forgot to tell you that silver is a man of substance i know of my    own knowledge that he has a bankers account which has never been    overdrawn he leaves his wife to manage the inn and as she is a    woman of colour a pair of old bachelors like you and i may be    excused for guessing that it is the wife quite as much as the    health that sends him back to roving                      j t         ppshawkins may stay one night with his mother                                                               j t  you can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me i was half beside myself with glee and if ever i despised a man it was old tom redruth who could do nothing but grumble and lament any of the undergamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him but such was not the squires pleasure and the squires pleasure was like law among them all nobody but old redruth would have dared so much as even to grumble  the next morning he and i set out on foot for the admiral benbow and there i found my mother in good health and spirits the captain who had so long been a cause of so much discomfort was gone where the wicked cease from troubling the squire had had everything repaired and the public rooms and the sign repainted and had added some furnitureabove all a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar he had found her a boy as an apprentice also so that she should not want help while i was gone  it was on seeing that boy that i understood for the first time my situation i had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me not at all of the home that i was leaving and now at sight of this clumsy stranger who was to stay here in my place beside my mother i had my first attack of tears i am afraid i led that boy a dogs life for as he was new to the work i had a hundred opportunities of setting him right and putting him down and i was not slow to profit by them  the night passed and the next day after dinner redruth and i were afoot again and on the road i said goodbye to mother and the cove where i had lived since i was born and the dear old admiral benbowsince he was repainted no longer quite so dear one of my last thoughts was of the captain who had so often strode along the beach with his cocked hat his sabrecut cheek and his old brass telescope next moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight  the mail picked us up about dusk at the royal george on the heath i was wedged in between redruth and a stout old gentleman and in spite of the swift motion and the cold nightair i must have dozed a great deal from the very first and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through stage after stage for when i was awakened at last it was by a punch in the ribs and i opened my eyes to find that we were standing still before a large building in a city street and that the day had already broken a long time  where are we i asked  bristol said tom get down  mr trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to superintend the work upon the schooner thither we had now to walk and our way to my great delight lay along the quays and beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations in one sailors were singing at their work in another there were men aloft high over my head hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spiders though i had lived by the shore all my life i seemed never to have been near the sea till then the smell of tar and salt was something new i saw the most wonderful figureheads that had all been far over the ocean i saw besides many old sailors with rings in their ears and whiskers curled in ringlets and tarry pigtails and their swaggering clumsy seawalk and if i had seen as many kings or archbishops i could not have been more delighted  and i was going to sea myself to sea in a schooner with a piping boatswain and pigtailed singing seamen to sea bound for an unknown island and to seek for buried treasures  while i was still in this delightful dream we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met squire trelawney all dressed out like a seaofficer in stout blue cloth coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailors walk  here you are he cried and the doctor came last night from london bravo the ships company complete  oh sir cried i when do we sail  sail says he we sail tomorrow       chapter viii    at the sign of the spyglass   when i had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to john silver at the sign of the spyglass and told me i should easily find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign i set off overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and seamen and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and bales for the dock was now at its busiest until i found the tavern in question  it was a bright enough little place of entertainment the sign was newly painted the windows had neat red curtains the floor was cleanly sanded there was a street on either side and an open door on both which made the large low room pretty clear to see in in spite of clouds of tobaccosmoke  the customers were mostly seafaring men and they talked so loudly that i hung at the door almost afraid to enter  as i was waiting a man came out of a side room and at a glance i was sure he must be long john his left leg was cut off close by the hip and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch which he managed with wonderful dexterity hopping about upon it like a bird he was very tall and strong with a face as big as a hamplain and pale but intelligent and smiling indeed he seemed in the most cheerful spirits whistling as he moved about among the tables with a merry word or a slap on the shoulder for the more favoured of his guests  now to tell you the truth from the very first mention of long john in squire trelawneys letter i had taken a fear in my mind that he might prove to be the very onelegged sailor whom i had watched for so long at the old benbow but one look at the man before me was enough i had seen the captain and black dog and the blind man pew and i thought i knew what a buccaneer was likea very different creature according to me from this clean and pleasanttempered landlord  i plucked up courage at once crossed the threshold and walked right up to the man where he stood propped on his crutch talking to a customer  mr silver sir i asked holding out the note  yes my lad said he such is my name to be sure and who may you be and then as he saw the squires letter he seemed to me to give something almost like a start  oh said he quite loud and offering his hand i see you are our new cabinboy pleased i am to see you  and he took my hand in his large firm grasp  just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door it was close by him and he was out in the street in a moment but his hurry had attracted my notice and i recognised him at a glance it was the tallowfaced man wanting two fingers who had come first to the admiral benbow  oh i cried stop him its black dog  i dont care two coppers who he is cried silver but he hasnt paid his scoreharry run and catch him  one of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in pursuit  if he were admiral hawke he shall pay his score cried silver and then relinquishing my handwho did you say he was he asked black what  dog sir said i has mr trelawney not told you of the buccaneers he was one of them  so cried silver in my houseben run and help harry one of those swabs was he was that you drinking with him morgan step up here  the man whom he called morganan old greyhaired mahoganyfaced sailorcame forward pretty sheepishly rolling his quid  now morgan said long john very sternly you never clapped your eyes on that blackblack dog before did you now  not i sir said morgan with a salute  you didnt know his name did you  no sir  by the powers tom morgan its as good for you exclaimed the landlord if you had been mixed up with the like of that you would never have put another foot in my house you may lay to that and what was he saying to you  i dont rightly know sir answered morgan  do you call that a head on your shoulders or a blessed deadeye cried long john dont rightly know dont you perhaps you dont happen to rightly know who you was speaking to perhaps come now what was he jawingvyages capns ships pipe up what was it  we was atalkin of keelhauling answered morgan  keelhauling was you and a mighty suitable thing too and you may lay to that get back to your place for a lubber tom  and then as morgan rolled back to his seat silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering as i thought  hes quite an honest man tom morgan ony stupid and now he ran on again aloud lets seeblack dog no i dont know the name not i yet i kind of think iveyes ive seen the swab he used to come here with a blind beggar he used  that he did you may be sure said i i knew that blind man too his name was pew  it was cried silver now quite excited pew that were his name for certain ah he looked a shark he did if we run down this black dog now therell be news for capn trelawney bens a good runner few seamen run better than ben he should run him down hand over hand by the powers he talked o keelhauling did he ill keelhaul him  all the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and down the tavern on his crutch slapping tables with his hand and giving such a show of excitement as would have convinced an old bailey judge or a bow street runner my suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on finding black dog at the spyglass and i watched the cook narrowly but he was too deep and too ready and too clever for me and by the time the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost the track in a crowd and been scolded like thieves i would have gone bail for the innocence of long john silver  see here now hawkins said he heres a blessed hard thing on a man like me now aint it theres capn trelawneywhats he to think here i have this confounded son of a dutchman sitting in my own house drinking of my own rum here you comes and tells me of it plain and here i let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights now hawkins you do me justice with the capn youre a lad you are but youre as smart as paint i see that when you first came in now here it is what could i do with this old timber i hobble on when i was an a b master mariner id have come up alongside of him hand over hand and broached him to in a brace of old shakes i would but now  and then all of a sudden he stopped and his jaw dropped as though he had remembered something  the score he burst out three goes o rum why shiver my timbers if i hadnt forgotten my score  and falling on a bench he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks i could not help joining and we laughed together peal after peal until the tavern rang again  why what a precious old seacalf i am he said at last wiping his cheeks you and me should get on well hawkins for ill take my davy i should be rated ships boy but come now stand by to go about this wont do dooty is dooty messmates ill put on my old cocked hat and step along of you to capn trelawney and report this here affair for mind you its serious young hawkins and neither you nor mes come out of it with what i should make so bold as to call credit nor you neither says you not smartnone of the pair of us smart but dash my buttons that was a good un about my score  and he began to laugh again and that so heartily that though i did not see the joke as he did i was again obliged to join him in his mirth  on our little walk along the quays he made himself the most interesting companion telling me about the different ships that we passed by their rig tonnage and nationality explaining the work that was going forwardhow one was discharging another taking in cargo and a third making ready for sea and every now and then telling me some little anecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till i had learned it perfectly i began to see that here was one of the best of possible shipmates  when we got to the inn the squire and dr livesey were seated together finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it before they should go aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection  long john told the story from first to last with a great deal of spirit and the most perfect truth that was how it were now werent it hawkins he would say now and again and i could always bear him entirely out  the two gentlemen regretted that black dog had got away but we all agreed there was nothing to be done and after he had been complimented long john took up his crutch and departed  all hands aboard by four this afternoon shouted the squire after him  ay ay sir cried the cook in the passage  well squire said dr livesey i dont put much faith in your discoveries as a general thing but i will say this john silver suits me  the mans a perfect trump declared the squire  and now added the doctor jim may come on board with us may he not  to be sure he may says squiretake your hat hawkins and well see the ship       chapter ix    powder and arms   the hispaniola lay some way out and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel and sometimes swung above us at last however we got alongside and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate mr arrow a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint he and the squire were very thick and friendly but i soon observed that things were not the same between mr trelawney and the captain  this last was a sharplooking man who seemed angry with everything on board and was soon to tell us why for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us  captain smollett sir axing to speak with you said he  i am always at the captains orders show him in said the squire  the captain who was close behind his messenger entered at once and shut the door behind him  well captain smollett what have you to say all well i hope all shipshape and seaworthy  well sir said the captain better speak plain i believe even at the risk of offence i dont like this cruise i dont like the men and i dont like my officer thats short and sweet  perhaps sir you dont like the ship inquired the squire very angry as i could see  i cant speak as to that sir not having seen her tried said the captain she seems a clever craft more i cant say  possibly sir you may not like your employer either says the squire  but here dr livesey cut in  stay a bit said he stay a bit no use of such questions as that but to produce illfeeling the captain has said too much or he has said too little and im bound to say that i require an explanation of his words you dont you say like this cruise now why  i was engaged sir on what we call sealed orders to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me said the captain so far so good but now i find that every man before the mast knows more than i do i dont call that fair nowdo you  no said dr livesey i dont  next said the captain i learn we are going after treasurehear it from my own hands mind you now treasure is ticklish work i dont like treasurevoyages on any account and i dont like them above all when they are secret and when begging your pardon mr trelawney the secret has been told to the parrot  silvers parrot asked the squire  its a way of speaking said the captain blabbed i mean its my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about but ill tell you my way of itlife or death and a close run  that is all clear and i daresay true enough replied dr livesey we take the risk but we are not so ignorant as you believe usnext you say you dont like the crew are they not good seamen  i dont like them sir returned captain smollett and i think i should have had the choosing of my own hands if you go to that  perhaps you should replied the doctor my friend should perhaps have taken you along with him but the slight if there be one was unintentionaland you dont like mr arrow  i dont sir i believe hes a good seaman but hes too free with the crew to be a good officer a mate should keep himself to himselfshouldnt drink with the men before the mast  do you mean he drinks cried the squire  no sir replied the captain only that hes too familiar  well now and the short and long of it captain asked the doctor tell us what you want  well gentlemen are you determined to go on this cruise  like iron answered the squire  very good said the captain then as youve heard me very patiently saying things that i could not prove hear me a few words more they are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold now you have a good place under the cabin why not put them therefirst point then you are bringing four of your own people with you and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward why not give them the berths here beside the cabinsecond point  any more asked mr trelawney  one more said the captain theres been too much blabbing already  far too much agreed the doctor  ill tell you what ive heard myself continued captain smollett that you have a map of an island that theres crosses on the map to show where treasure is and that the island lies and then he named the latitude and longitude exactly  i never told that cried the squire to a soul  the hands know it sir returned the captain  livesey that must have been you or hawkins cried the squire  it doesnt much matter who it was replied the doctor and i could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to mr trelawneys protestations neither did i to be sure he was so loose a talker yet in this case i believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island  well gentlemen continued the captain i dont know who has this map but i make it a point it shall be kept secret even from me and mr arrow otherwise i would ask you to let me resign  i see said the doctor you wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship manned with my friends own people and provided with all the arms and powder on board in other words you fear a mutiny  sir said captain smollett with no intention to take offence i deny your right to put words into my mouth no captain sir would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that as for mr arrow i believe him thoroughly honest some of the men are the same all may be for what i know but i am responsible for the ships safety and the life of every manjack aboard of her i see things going as i think not quite right and i ask you to take certain precautions or let me resign my berth and thats all  captain smollett began the doctor with a smile did ever you hear the fable of the mountain and the mouse youll excuse me i daresay but you remind me of that fable when you came in here ill stake my wig you meant more than this  doctor said the captain you are smart when i came in here i meant to get discharged i had no thought that mr trelawney would hear a word  no more i would cried the squire had livesey not been here i should have seen you to the deuce as it is i have heard you i will do as you desire but i think the worse of you  thats as you please sir said the captain youll find i do my duty  and with that he took his leave  trelawney said the doctor contrary to all my notions i believe you have managed to get two honest men on board with youthat man and john silver  silver if you like cried the squire but as for that intolerable humbug i declare i think his conduct unmanly unsailorly and downright unenglish  well says the doctor we shall see  when we came on deck the men had begun already to take out the arms and powder yohoing at their work while the captain and mr arrow stood by superintending  the new arrangement was quite to my liking the whole schooner had been overhauled six berths had been made astern out of what had been the afterpart of the main hold and this set of cabins was only joined to the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side it had been originally meant that the captain mr arrow hunter joyce the doctor and the squire were to occupy these six berths now redruth and i were to get two of them and mr arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck in the companion which had been enlarged on each side till you might almost have called it a roundhouse very low it was still of course but there was room to swing two hammocks and even the mate seemed pleased with the arrangement even he perhaps had been doubtful as to the crew but that is only guess for as you shall hear we had not long the benefit of his opinion  we were all hard at work changing the powder and the berths when the last man or two and long john along with them came off in a shoreboat  the cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness and as soon as he saw what was doing so ho mates says he whats this  were achanging of the powder jack answers one  why by the powers cried long john if we do well miss the morning tide  my orders said the captain shortly you may go below my man hands will want supper  ay ay sir answered the cook and touching his forelock he disappeared at once in the direction of the galley  thats a good man captain said the doctor  very likely sir replied captain smolletteasy with that meneasy he ran on to the fellows who were shifting the powder and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships a long brass ninehere you ships boy he cried out o that off with you to the cook and get some work  and then as i was hurrying off i heard him say quite loudly to the doctor  ill have no favourites on my ship  i assure you i was quite of the squires way of thinking and hated the captain deeply       chapter x    the voyage   all the night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their place and boatfuls of the squires friends mr blandly and the like coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return we never had a night at the admiral benbow when i had half the work and i was dogtired when a little before dawn the boatswain sounded his pipe and the crew began to man the capstanbars i might have been twice as weary yet i would not have left the deck all was so new and interesting to methe brief commands the shrill note of the whistle the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ships lanterns  now barbecue tip us a stave cried one voice  the old one cried another  ay ay mates said long john who was standing by with his crutch under his arm and at once broke out in the air and words i knew so well    fifteen men on the dead mans chest  and then the whole crew bore chorus    yohoho and a bottle of rum  and at the third ho drove the bars before them with a will  even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old admiral benbow in a second and i seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping in the chorus but soon the anchor was short up soon it was hanging dripping at the bows soon the sails began to draw and the land and shipping to flit by on either side and before i could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the hispaniola had begun her voyage to the isle of treasure  i am not going to relate that voyage in detail it was fairly prosperous the ship proved to be a good ship the crew were capable seamen and the captain thoroughly understood his business but before we came the length of treasure island two or three things had happened which require to be known  mr arrow first of all turned out even worse than the captain had feared he had no command among the men and people did what they pleased with him but that was by no means the worst of it for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye red cheeks stuttering tongue and other marks of drunkenness time after time he was ordered below in disgrace sometimes he fell and cut himself sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the companion sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and attend to his work at least passably  in the meantime we could never make out where he got the drink that was the ships mystery watch him as we pleased we could do nothing to solve it and when we asked him to his face he would only laugh if he were drunk and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted anything but water  he was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst the men but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself outright so nobody was much surprised nor very sorry when one dark night with a head sea he disappeared entirely and was seen no more  overboard said the captain well gentlemen that saves the trouble of putting him in irons  but there we were without a mate and it was necessary of course to advance one of the men the boatswain job anderson was the likeliest man aboard and though he kept his old title he served in a way as mate mr trelawney had followed the sea and his knowledge made him very useful for he often took a watch himself in easy weather and the coxswain israel hands was a careful wily old experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything  he was a great confidant of long john silver and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ships cook barbecue as the men called him  aboardship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck to have both hands as free as possible it was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead and propped against it yielding to every movement of the ship get on with his cooking like some one safe ashore still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck he had a line or two rigged up to help him across the widest spaceslong johns earrings they were called and he would hand himself from one place to another now using the crutch now trailing it alongside by the lanyard as quickly as another man could walk yet some of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see him so reduced  hes no common man barbecue said the coxswain to me he had good schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded and bravea lions nothing alongside of long john i seen him grapple four and knock their heads togetherhim unarmed  all the crew respected and even obeyed him he had a way of talking to each and doing everybody some particular service to me he was unweariedly kind and always glad to see me in the galley which he kept as clean as a new pin the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in a cage in one corner  come away hawkins he would say come and have a yarn with john nobody more welcome than yourself my son sit you down and hear the news heres capn flinti calls my parrot capn flint after the famous buccaneerheres capn flint predicting success to our vyagewasnt you capn  and the parrot would say with great rapidity pieces of eight pieces of eight pieces of eight till you wondered that it was not out of breath or till john threw his handkerchief over the cage  now that bird he would say is maybe two hundred years old hawkinsthey lives for ever mostly and if anybodys seen more wickedness it must be the devil himself shes sailed with england the great capn england the pirate shes been at madagascar and at malabar and surinam and providence and portobello she was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships its there she learned pieces of eight and little wonder three hundred and fifty thousand of em hawkins she was at the boarding of the viceroy of the indies out of goa she was and to look at her you would think she was a babby but you smelt powderdidnt you capn  stand by to go about the parrot would scream  ah shes a handsome craft she is the cook would say and give her sugar from his pocket and then the bird would peck at the bars and swear straight on passing belief for wickedness there john would add you cant touch pitch and not be mucked lad heres this poor old innocent bird o mine swearing blue fire and none the wiser you may lay to that she would swear the same in a manner of speaking before chaplain and john would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had that made me think he was the best of men  in the meantime the squire and captain smollett were still on pretty distant terms with one another the squire made no bones about the matter he despised the captain the captain on his part never spoke but when he was spoken to and then sharp and short and dry and not a word wasted he owned when driven into a corner that he seemed to have been wrong about the crew that some of them were as brisk as he wanted to see and all had behaved fairly well as for the ship he had taken a downright fancy to her shell lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife sir but he would add all i say is were not home again and i dont like the cruise  the squire at this would turn away and march up and down the deck chin in air  a trifle more of that man he would say and i should explode  we had some heavy weather which only proved the qualities of the hispaniola every man on board seemed well content and they must have been hard to please if they had been otherwise for it is my belief that there was never a ships company so spoiled since noah put to sea double grog was going on the least excuse there was duff on odd days as for instance if the squire heard it was any mans birthday and always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for any one to help himself that had a fancy  never knew good come of it yet the captain said to dr livesey spoil focsle hands make devils thats my belief  but good did come of the applebarrel as you shall hear for if it had not been for that we should have had no note of warning and might all have perished by the hand of treachery  this was how it came about  we had ran up the trades to get the wind of the island we were afteri am not allowed to be more plainand now we were running down for it with a bright lookout day and night it was about the last day of our outward voyage by the largest computation some time that night or at latest before noon of the morrow we should sight the treasure island we were heading ssw and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea the hispaniola rolled steadily dipping her bowsprit now and then with a whiff of spray all was drawing alow and aloft every one was in the bravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of our adventure  now just after sundown when all my work was over and i was on my way to my berth it occurred to me that i should like an apple i ran on deck the watch was all forward looking out for the island the man at the helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently to himself and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea against the bows and around the sides of the ship  in i got bodily into the applebarrel and found there was scarce an apple left but sitting down there in the dark what with the sound of the waters and the rocking movement of the ship i had either fallen asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with rather a clash close by the barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders against it and i was just about to jump up when the man began to speak it was silvers voice and before i had heard a dozen words i would not have shown myself for all the world but lay there trembling and listening in the extreme of fear and curiosity for from these dozen words i understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended upon me alone       chapter xi    what i heard in the applebarrel   no not i said silver flint was capn i was quartermaster along of my timber leg the same broadside i lost my leg old pew lost his deadlights it was a master surgeon him that ampytated meout of college and alllatin by the bucket and what not but he was hanged like a dog and sundried like the rest at corso castle that was roberts men that was and comed of changing names to their shipsroyal fortune and so on now what a ship was christened so let her stay i say so it was with the cassandra as brought us all safe home from malabar after england took the viceroy of the indies so it was with the old walrus flints old ship as ive seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold  ah cried another voice that of the youngest hand on board and evidently full of admiration he was the flower of the flock was flint  davis was a man too by all accounts said silver i never sailed along of him first with england then with flint thats my story and now here on my own account in a manner of speaking i laid by nine hundred safe from england and two thousand after flint that aint bad for a man before the mastall safe in bank taint earning now its saving does it you may lay to that wheres all englands men now i dunno wheres flints why most on em aboard here and glad to get the duffbeen begging before that some on em old pew as had lost his sight and might have thought shame spends twelve hundred pound in a year like a lord in parliament where is he now well hes dead now and under hatches but for two year before that shiver my timbers the man was starving he begged and he stole and he cut throats and starved at that by the powers  well it aint much use after all said the young seaman  taint much use for fools you may lay to itthat nor nothing cried silver but now you look here youre young you are but youre as smart as paint i see that when i set my eyes on you and ill talk to you like a man  you may imagine how i felt when i heard this abominable old rogue addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used to myself i think if i had been able that i would have killed him through the barrel meantime he ran on little supposing he was overheard  here it is about gentlemen of fortune they lives rough and they risk swinging but they eat and drink like fighting cocks and when a cruise is done why its hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in their pockets now the most goes for rum and a good fling and to sea again in their shirts but thats not the course i lay i puts it all away some here some there and none too much anywheres by reason of suspicion im fifty mark you once back from this cruise i set up gentleman in earnest time enough too says you ah but ive lived easy in the meantime never denied myself o nothing heart desires and slep soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea and how did i begin before the mast like you  well said the other but all the other moneys gone now aint it you darent show face in bristol after this  why where might you suppose it was asked silver derisively  at bristol in banks and places answered his companion  it were said the cook it were when we weighed anchor but my old missis has it all by now and the spyglass is sold lease and goodwill and rigging and the old girls off to meet me i would tell you where for i trust you but it ud make jealousy among the mates  and can you trust your missis asked the other  gentlemen of fortune returned the cook usually trusts little among themselves and right they are you may lay to it but i have a way with me i have when a mate brings a slip on his cableone as knows me i meanit wont be in the same world with old john there was some that was feared of pew and some that was feared of flint but flint his own self was feared of me feared he was and proud they was the roughest crew afloat was flints the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them well now i tell you im not a boasting man and you seen yourself how easy i keep company but when i was quartermaster lambs wasnt the word for flints old buccaneers ah you may be sure of yourself in old johns ship  well i tell you now replied the lad i didnt half a quarter like the job till i had this talk with you john but theres my hand on it now  and a brave lad you were and smart too answered silver shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook and a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune i never clapped my eyes on  by this time i had begun to understand the meaning of their terms by a gentleman of fortune they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate and the little scene that i had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest handsperhaps of the last one left aboard but on this point i was soon to be relieved for silver giving a little whistle a third man strolled up and sat down by the party  dicks square said silver  oh i knowd dick was square returned the voice of the coxswain israel hands hes no fool is dick and he turned his quid and spat but look here he went on heres what i want to know barbecue how long are we agoing to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat ive had amost enough o capn smollett hes hazed me long enough by thunder i want to go into that cabin i do i want their pickles and wines and that  israel said silver your head aint much account nor ever was but youre able to hear i reckon leastways your ears is big enough now heres what i say youll berth forward and youll live hard and youll speak soft and youll keep sober till i give the word and you may lay to that my son  well i dont say no do i growled the coxswain what i say is when thats what i say  when by the powers cried silver well now if you want to know ill tell you when the last moment i can manage and thats when heres a firstrate seaman capn smollett sails the blessed ship for us heres this squire and doctor with a map and suchi dont know where it is do i no more do you says you well then i mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff and help us to get it aboard by the powers then well see if i was sure of you all sons of double dutchmen id have capn smollett navigate us halfway back again before i struck  why were all seamen aboard here i should think said the lad dick  were all focsle hands you mean snapped silver we can steer a course but whos to set one thats what all you gentlemen split on first and last if i had my way id have capn smollett work us back into the trades at least then wed have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day but i know the sort you are ill finish with em at the island as soons the blunts on board and a pity it is but youre never happy till youre drunk split my sides ive a sick heart to sail with the likes of you  easy all long john cried israel whos acrossin of you  why how many tall ships think ye now have i seen laid aboard and how many brisk lads drying in the sun at execution dock cried silver and all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry you hear me i seen a thing or two at sea i have if you would ony lay your course and a pint to windward you would ride in carriages you would but not you i know you youll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow and go hang  everybody knowd you was a kind of a chapling john but theres others as could hand and steer as well as you said israel they liked a bit o fun they did they wasnt so high and dry nohow but took their fling like jolly companions every one  so says silver well and where are they now pew was of that sort and he died a beggarman flint was and he died of rum at savannah ah they was a sweet crew they was ony where are they  but asked dick when we do lay em athwart what are we to do with em anyhow  theres the man for me cried the cook admiringly thats what i call business well what would you think put em ashore like maroons that would have been englands way or cut em down like that much pork that would have been flints or billy boness  billy was the man for that said israel dead men dont bite says he well hes dead now hisself he knows the long and short on it now and if ever a rough hand come to port it was billy  right you are said silver rough and ready but mark you here im an easy manim quite the gentleman says you but this time its serious dooty is dooty mates i give my votedeath when im in parlyment and riding in my coach i dont want none of these sealawyers in the cabin acoming home unlooked for like the devil at prayers wait is what i say but when the time comes why let her rip  john cries the coxswain youre a man  youll say so israel when you see said silver only one thing i claimi claim trelawney ill wring his calfs head off his body with these hands dick he added breaking off you just jump up like a sweet lad and get me an apple to wet my pipe like  you may fancy the terror i was in i should have leaped out and run for it if i had found the strength but my limbs and heart alike misgave me i heard dick begin to rise and then some one seemingly stopped him and the voice of hands exclaimed  oh stow that dont you get sucking of that bilge john lets have a go of the rum  dick said silver i trust you ive a gauge on the keg mind theres the key you fill a pannikin and bring it up  terrified as i was i could not help thinking to myself that this must have been how mr arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him  dick was gone but a little while and during his absence israel spoke straight on in the cooks ear it was but a word or two that i could catch and yet i gathered some important news for besides other scraps that tended to the same purpose this whole clause was audible not another man of themll jine hence there were still faithful men on board  when dick returned one after another of the trio took the pannikin and drankone to luck another with a heres to old flint and silver himself saying in a kind of song heres to ourselves and hold your luff plenty of prizes and plenty of duff  just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel and looking up i found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzentop and shining white on the luff of the foresail and almost at the same time the voice of the lookout shouted land ho       chapter xii    council of war   there was a great rush of feet across the deck i could hear people tumbling up from the cabin and the focsle and slipping in an instant outside my barrel i dived behind the foresail made a double towards the stern and came out upon the open deck in time to join hunter and dr livesey in the rush for the weather bow  there all hands were already congregated a belt of fog had lifted almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon away to the southwest of us we saw two low hills about a couple of miles apart and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill whose peak was still buried in the fog all three seemed sharp and conical in figure  so much i saw almost in a dream for i had not yet recovered from my horrid fear of a minute or two before and then i heard the voice of captain smollett issuing orders the hispaniola was laid a couple of points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the island on the east  and now men said the captain when all was sheeted home has any one of you ever seen that land ahead  i have sir said silver ive watered there with a trader i was cook in  the anchorage is on the south behind an islet i fancy asked the captain  yes sir skeleton island they calls it it were a main place for pirates once and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it that hill to the norard they calls the foremast hill there are three hills in a row running southardfore main and mizzen sir but the mainthats the big un with the cloud on itthey usually calls the spyglass by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the anchorage cleaning for its there they cleaned their ships sir asking your pardon  i have a chart here says captain smollett see if thats the place  long johns eyes burned in his head as he took the chart but by the fresh look of the paper i knew he was doomed to disappointment this was not the map we found in billy boness chest but an accurate copy complete in all thingsnames and heights and soundingswith the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes sharp as must have been his annoyance silver had the strength of mind to hide it  yes sir said he this is the spot to be sure and very prettily drawed out who might have done that i wonder the pirates were too ignorant i reckon ay here it is capt kidds anchoragejust the name my shipmate called it theres a strong current runs along the south and then away norard up the west coast right you was sir says he to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island leastways if such was your intention as to enter and careen and there aint no better place for that in these waters  thank you my man says captain smollett ill ask you later on to give us a help you may go  i was surprised at the coolness with which john avowed his knowledge of the island and i own i was halffrightened when i saw him drawing nearer to myself he did not know to be sure that i had overheard his council from the applebarrel and yet i had by this time taken such a horror of his cruelty duplicity and power that i could scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm  ah says he this here is a sweet spot this islanda sweet spot for a lad to get ashore on youll bathe and youll climb trees and youll hunt goats you will and youll get aloft on them hills like a goat yourself why it makes me young again i was going to forget my timber leg i was its a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes and you may lay to that when you want to go a bit of exploring you just ask old john and hell put up a snack for you to take along  and clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder he hobbled off forward and went below  captain smollett the squire and dr livesey were talking together on the quarterdeck and anxious as i was to tell them my story i durst not interrupt them openly while i was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse dr livesey called me to his side he had left his pipe below and being a slave to tobacco had meant that i should fetch it but as soon as i was near enough to speak and not to be overheard i broke out immediately doctor let me speak get the captain and squire down to the cabin and then make some pretence to send for me i have terrible news  the doctor changed countenance a little but next moment he was master of himself  thank you jim said he quite loudly that was all i wanted to know as if he had asked me a question  and with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two they spoke together for a little and though none of them started or raised his voice or so much as whistled it was plain enough that dr livesey had communicated my request for the next thing that i heard was the captain giving an order to job anderson and all hands were piped on deck  my lads said captain smollett ive a word to say to you this land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing to mr trelawney being a very openhanded gentleman as we all know has just asked me a word or two and as i was able to tell him that every man on board had done his duty alow and aloft as i never ask to see it done better why he and i and the doctor are going below to the cabin to drink your health and luck and youll have grog served out for you to drink our health and luck ill tell you what i think of this i think it handsome and if you think as i do youll give a good sea cheer for the gentleman that does it  the cheer followedthat was a matter of course but it rang out so full and hearty that i confess i could hardly believe these same men were plotting for our blood  one more cheer for capn smollett cried long john when the first had subsided  and this also was given with a will  on the top of that the three gentlemen went below and not long after word was sent forward that jim hawkins was wanted in the cabin  i found them all three seated round the table a bottle of spanish wine and some raisins before them and the doctor smoking away with his wig on his lap and that i knew was a sign that he was agitated the stern window was open for it was a warm night and you could see the moon shining behind on the ships wake  now hawkins said the squire you have something to say speak up  i did as i was bid and as short as i could make it told the whole details of silvers conversation nobody interrupted me till i was done nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last  jim said dr livesey take a seat  and they made me sit down at table beside them poured me out a glass of wine filled my hands with raisins and all three one after the other and each with a bow drank my good health and their service to me for my luck and courage  now captain said the squire you were right and i was wrong i own myself an ass and i await your orders  no more an ass than i sir returned the captain i never heard of a crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before for any man that had an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according but this crew he added beats me  captain said the doctor with your permission thats silver a very remarkable man  hed look remarkably well from a yardarm sir returned the captain but this is talk this dont lead to anything i see three or four points and with mr trelawneys permission ill name them  you sir are the captain it is for you to speak says mr trelawney grandly  first point began mr smollett we must go on because we cant turn back if i gave the word to go about they would rise at once second point we have time before usat least until this treasures found third point there are faithful hands now sir its got to come to blows sooner or later and what i propose is to take time by the forelock as the saying is and come to blows some fine day when they least expect it we can count i take it on your own home servants mr trelawney  as upon myself declared the squire  three reckoned the captain ourselves make seven counting hawkins here now about the honest hands  most likely trelawneys own men said the doctor those he had picked up for himself before he lit on silver  nay replied the squire hands was one of mine  i did think i could have trusted hands added the captain  and to think that theyre all englishmen broke out the squire sir i could find it in my heart to blow the ship up  well gentlemen said the captain the best that i can say is not much we must layto if you please and keep a bright lookout its trying on a man i know it would be pleasanter to come to blows but theres no help for it till we know our men layto and whistle for a wind thats my view  jim here said the doctor can help us more than any one the men are not shy with him and jim is a noticing lad  hawkins i put prodigious faith in you added the squire  i began to feel pretty desperate at this for i felt altogether helpless and yet by an odd train of circumstances it was indeed through me that safety came in the meantime talk as we pleased there were only seven out of the twentysix on whom we knew we could rely and out of these seven one was a boy so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen       part iii    my shore adventure       chapter xiii    how i began my shore adventure   the appearance of the island when i came on deck next morning was altogether changed although the breeze had now utterly failed we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the southeast of the low eastern coast greycoloured woods covered a large part of the surface this even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sandbreak in the lower lands and by many tall trees of the pine family outtopping the otherssome singly some in clumps but the general colouring was uniform and sad the hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock all were strangely shaped and the spyglass which was by three or four hundred feet the tallest on the island was likewise the strangest in configuration running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on  the hispaniola was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell the booms were tearing at the blocks the rudder was banging to and fro and the whole ship creaking groaning and jumping like a manufactory i had to cling tight to the backstay and the world turned giddily before my eyes for though i was a good enough sailor when there was way on this standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing i never learned to stand without a qualm or so above all in the morning on an empty stomach  perhaps it was thisperhaps it was the look of the island with its grey melancholy woods and wild stone spires and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beachat least although the sun shone bright and hot and the shorebirds were fishing and crying all around us and you would have thought any one would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea my heart sank as the saying is into my boots and from that first look onward i hated the very thought of treasure island  we had a dreary mornings work before us for there was no sign of any wind and the boats had to be got out and manned and the ship warped three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the haven behind skeleton island i volunteered for one of the boats where i had of course no business the heat was sweltering and the men grumbled fiercely over their work anderson was in command of my boat and instead of keeping the crew in order he grumbled as loud as the worst  well he said with an oath its not for ever  i thought this was a very bad sign for up to that day the men had gone briskly and willingly about their business but the very sight of the island had relaxed the cords of discipline  all the way in long john stood by the steersman and conned the ship he knew the passage like the palm of his hand and though the man in the chains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart john never hesitated once  theres a strong scour with the ebb he said and this here passage has been dug out in a manner of speaking with a spade  we brought up just where the anchor was in the chart about a third of a mile from either shore the mainland on one side and skeleton island on the other the bottom was clean sand the plunge of our anchor sent up clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods but in less than a minute they were down again and all was once more silent  the place was entirely landlocked buried in woods the trees coming right down to highwater mark the shores mostly flat and the hilltops standing round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre one here one there two little rivers or rather two swamps emptied out into this pond as you might call it and the foliage round that part of the shore had a kind of poisonous brightness from the ship we could see nothing of the house or stockade for they were quite buried among trees and if it had not been for the chart on the companion we might have been the first that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the seas  there was not a breath of air moving nor a sound but that of the surf booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the rocks outside a peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchoragea smell of sodden leaves and rotting treetrunks i observed the doctor sniffing and sniffing like some one tasting a bad egg  i dont know about treasure he said but ill stake my wig theres fever here  if the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat it became truly threatening when they had come aboard they lay about the deck growling together in talk the slightest order was received with a black look and grudgingly and carelessly obeyed even the honest hands must have caught the infection for there was not one man aboard to mend another mutiny it was plain hung over us like a thundercloud  and it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the danger long john was hard at work going from group to group spending himself in good advice and as for example no man could have shown a better he fairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility he was all smiles to every one if an order were given john would be on his crutch in an instant with the cheeriest ay ay sir in the world and when there was nothing else to do he kept up one song after another as if to conceal the discontent of the rest  of all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon this obvious anxiety on the part of long john appeared the worst  we held a council in the cabin  sir said the captain if i risk another order the whole shipll come about our ears by the run you see sir here it is i get a rough answer do i not well if i speak back pikes will be going in two shakes if i dont silver will see theres something under that and the games up now weve only one man to rely on  and who is that asked the squire  silver sir returned the captain hes as anxious as you and i to smother things up this is a tiff hed soon talk em out of it if he had the chance and what i propose to do is to give him the chance lets allow the men an afternoon ashore if they all go why well fight the ship if they none of them gowell then we hold the cabin and god defend the right if some go you mark my words sir silverll bring em aboard again as mild as lambs  it was so decided loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men hunter joyce and redruth were taken into our confidence and received the news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for and then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew  my lads said he weve had a hot day and are all tired and out of sorts a turn ashorell hurt nobodythe boats are still in the water you can take the gigs and as many as please can go ashore for the afternoon ill fire a gun half an hour before sundown  i believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their shins over treasure as soon as they were landed for they all came out of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a faraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the anchorage  the captain was too bright to be in the way he whipped out of sight in a moment leaving silver to arrange the party and i fancy it was as well he did so had he been on deck he could no longer so much as have pretended not to understand the situation it was as plain as day silver was the captain and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it the honest handsand i was soon to see it proved that there were such on boardmust have been very stupid fellows or rather i suppose the truth was this that all hands were disaffected by the example of the ringleadersonly some more some less and a few being good fellows in the main could neither be led nor driven any further it is one thing to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a number of innocent men  at last however the party was made up six fellows were to stay on board and the remaining thirteen including silver began to embark  then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions that contributed so much to save our lives if six men were left by silver it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship and since only six were left it was equally plain that the cabin party had no present need of my assistance it occurred to me at once to go ashore in a jiffy i had slipped over the side and curled up in the foresheets of the nearest boat and almost at the same moment she shoved off  no one took notice of me only the bow oar saying is that you jim keep your head down but silver from the other boat looked sharply over and called out to know if that were me and from that moment i began to regret what i had done  the crews raced for the beach but the boat i was in having some start and being at once the lighter and the better manned shot far ahead of her consort and the bow had struck among the shoreside trees and i had caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest thicket while silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind  jim jim i heard him shouting  but you may suppose i paid no heed jumping ducking and breaking through i ran straight before my nose till i could run no longer       chapter xiv    the first blow   i was so pleased at having given the slip to long john that i began to enjoy myself and look around me with some interest on the strange land that i was in  i had crossed a marshy track full of willows bulrushes and odd outlandish swampy trees and i had now come out upon the skirts of an open piece of undulating sandy country about a mile long dotted with a few pines and a great number of contorted trees not unlike the oak in growth but pale in foliage like willows on the far side of the open stood one of the hills with two quaint craggy peaks shining vividly in the sun  i now felt for the first time the joy of exploration the isle was uninhabited my shipmates i had left behind and nothing lived in front of me but dumb brutes and fowls i turned hither and thither among the trees here and there were flowering plants unknown to me here and there i saw snakes and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top little did i suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous rattle  then i came to a long thicket of these oaklike treeslive or evergreen oaks i heard afterwards they should be calledwhich grew low along the sand like brambles the boughs curiously twisted the foliage compact like thatch the thicket stretched down from the top of one of the sandy knolls spreading and growing taller as it went until it reached the margin of the broad reedy fen through which the nearest of the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage the marsh was steaming in the strong sun and the outline of the spyglass trembled through the haze  all at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the bulrushes a wild duck flew up with a quack another followed and soon over the whole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and circling in the air i judged at once that some of my shipmates must be drawing near along the borders of the fen nor was i deceived for soon i heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice which as i continued to give ear grew steadily louder and nearer  this put me in a great fear and i crawled under cover of the nearest liveoak and squatted there hearkening as silent as a mouse  another voice answered and then the first voice which i now recognised to be silvers once more took up the story and ran on for a long while in a stream only now and again interrupted by the other by the sound they must have been talking earnestly and almost fiercely but no distinct word came to my hearing  at last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down for not only did they cease to draw any nearer but the birds themselves began to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the swamp  and now i began to feel that i was neglecting my business that since i had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes the least i could do was to overhear them at their councils and that my plain and obvious duty was to draw as close as i could manage under the favourable ambush of the crouching trees  i could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly not only by the sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that still hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders  crawling on allfours i made steadily but slowly towards them till at last raising my head to an aperture among the leaves i could see clear down into a little green dell beside the marsh and closely set about with trees where long john silver and another of the crew stood face to face in conversation  the sun beat full upon them silver had thrown his hat beside him on the ground and his great smooth blonde face all shining with heat was lifted to the other mans in a kind of appeal  mate he was saying its because i thinks gold dust of yougold dust and you may lay to that if i hadnt took to you like pitch do you think id have been here awarning of you alls upyou cant make nor mend its to save your neck that im aspeaking and if one of the wild uns knew it where ud i be tomnow tell me where ud i be  silver said the other manand i observed he was not only red in the face but spoke as hoarse as a crow and his voice shook too like a taut ropesilver says he youre old and youre honest or has the name for it and youve money too which lots of poor sailors hasnt and youre brave or im mistook and will you tell me youll let yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs not you as sure as god sees me id sooner lose my hand if i turn agin my dooty  and then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise i had found one of the honest handswell here at that same moment came news of another far away out in the marsh there arose all of a sudden a sound like the cry of anger then another on the back of it and then one horrid longdrawn scream the rocks of the spyglass reechoed it a score of times the whole troop of marshbirds rose again darkening heaven with a simultaneous whirr and long after that deathyell was still ringing in my brain silence had reestablished its empire and only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon  tom had leaped at the sound like a horse at the spur but silver had not winked an eye he stood where he was resting lightly on his crutch watching his companion like a snake about to spring  john said the sailor stretching out his hand  hands off cried silver leaping back a yard as it seemed to me with the speed and security of a trained gymnast  hands off if you like john silver said the other its a black conscience that can make you feared of me but in heavens name tell me what was that  that returned silver smiling away but warier than ever his eye a mere pinpoint in his big face but gleaming like a crumb of glass that oh i reckon thatll be alan  and at this poor tom flashed out like a hero  alan he cried then rest his soul for a true seaman and as for you john silver long youve been a mate of mine but youre mate of mine no more if i die like a dog ill die in my dooty youve killed alan have you kill me too if you can but i defies you  and with that this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook and set off walking for the beach but he was not destined to go far with a cry john seized the branch of a tree whipped the crutch out of his armpit and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air it struck poor tom point foremost and with stunning violence right between the shoulders in the middle of his back his hands flew up he gave a sort of gasp and fell  whether he were injured much or little none could ever tell like enough to judge from the sound his back was broken on the spot but he had no time given him to recover silver agile as a monkey even without leg or crutch was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body from my place of ambush i could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows  i do not know what it rightly is to faint but i do know that for the next little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling mist silver and the birds and the tall spyglass hilltop going round and round and topsyturvy before my eyes and all manner of bells ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear  when i came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together his crutch under his arm his hat upon his head just before him tom lay motionless upon the sward but the murderer minded him not a whit cleansing his bloodstained knife the while upon a wisp of grass everything else was unchanged the sun still shining mercilessly on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain and i could scarce persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes  but now john put his hand into his pocket brought out a whistle and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated air i could not tell of course the meaning of the signal but it instantly awoke my fears more men would be coming i might be discovered they had already slain two of the honest people after tom and alan might not i come next  instantly i began to extricate myself and crawl back again with what speed and silence i could manage to the more open portion of the wood as i did so i could hear hails coming and going between the old buccaneer and his comrades and this sound of danger lent me wings as soon as i was clear of the thicket i ran as i never ran before scarce minding the direction of my flight so long as it led me from the murderers and as i ran fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into a kind of frenzy  indeed could any one be more entirely lost than i when the gun fired how should i dare to go down to the boats among those fiends still smoking from their crime would not the first of them who saw me wring my neck like a snipes would not my absence itself be an evidence to them of my alarm and therefore of my fatal knowledge it was all over i thought goodbye to the hispaniola goodbye to the squire the doctor and the captain there was nothing left for me but death by starvation or death by the hands of the mutineers  all this while as i say i was still running and without taking any notice i had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two peaks and had got into a part of the island where the liveoaks grew more widely apart and seemed more like foresttrees in their bearing and dimensions mingled with these were a few scattered pines some fifty some nearer seventy feet high the air too smelt more freshly than down beside the marsh  and here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with a thumping heart       chapter xv    the man of the island   from the side of the hill which was here steep and stony a spout of gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees my eyes turned instinctively in that direction and i saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine what it was whether bear or man or monkey i could in no wise tell it seemed dark and shaggy more i knew not but the terror of this new apparition brought me to a stand  i was now it seemed cut off upon both sides behind me the murderers before me this lurking nondescript and immediately i began to prefer the dangers that i knew to those i knew not silver himself appeared less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods and i turned on my heel and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder began to retrace my steps in the direction of the boats  instantly the figure reappeared and making a wide circuit began to head me off i was tired at any rate but had i been as fresh as when i rose i could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary from trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer running manlike on two legs but unlike any man that i had ever seen stooping almost double as it ran yet a man it was i could no longer be in doubt about that  i began to recall what i had heard of cannibals i was within an ace of calling for help but the mere fact that he was a man however wild had somewhat reassured me and my fear of silver began to revive in proportion i stood still therefore and cast about for some method of escape and as i was so thinking the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind as soon as i remembered i was not defenceless courage glowed again in my heart and i set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked briskly towards him  he was concealed by this time behind another treetrunk but he must have been watching me closely for as soon as i began to move in his direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me then he hesitated drew back came forward again and at last to my wonder and confusion threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in supplication  at that i once more stopped  who are you i asked  ben gunn he answered and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward like a rusty lock im poor ben gunn i am and i havent spoke with a christian these three years  i could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his features were even pleasing his skin whereever it was exposed was burnt by the sun even his lips were black and his fair eyes looked quite startling in so dark a face of all the beggarmen that i had seen or fancied he was the chief for raggedness he was clothed with tatters of old ships canvas and old sea cloth and this extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous fasteningsbrass buttons bits of stick and loops of tarry gaskin about his waist he wore an old brassbuckled leather belt which was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement  three years i cried were you shipwrecked  nay mate said hemarooned  i had heard the word and i knew it stood for a horrible kind of punishment common enough among the buccaneers in which the offender is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some desolate and distant island  marooned three years agone he continued and lived on goats since then and berries and oysters whereever a man is says i a man can do for himself but mate my heart is sore for christian diet you mightnt happen to have a piece of cheese about you now no well manys the long night ive dreamed of cheesetoasted mostlyand woke up again and here i were  if ever i can get aboard again said i you shall have cheese by the stone  all this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket smoothing my hands looking at my boots and generally in the intervals of his speech showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellowcreature but at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness  if ever you can get aboard again says you he repeated why now whos to hinder you  not you i know was my reply  and right you was he cried now youwhat do you call yourself mate  jim i told him  jim jim says he quite pleased apparently well now jim ive lived that rough as youd be ashamed to hear of now for instance you wouldnt think i had had a pious motherto look at me he asked  why nonot in particular i answered  ah well said he but i hadremarkable pious and i was a civil pious boy and could rattle off my catechism that fast as you couldnt tell one word from another and heres what it come to jim and it begun with chuckfarthen on the blessed gravestones thats what it begun with but it went furthern that and so my mother told me and predicked the whole she did the pious woman but it were providence that put me here ive thought it all out in this here lonely island and im back on piety you dont catch me tasting rum so much but just a thimbleful for luck of course the first chance i have im bound ill be good and i see the way to and jimlooking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisperim rich  i now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude and i suppose i must have shown the feeling in my face for he repeated the statement hotly  rich rich i says and ill tell you what ill make a man of you jim ah jim youll bless your stars you will you was the first that found me  and at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes  now jim you tell me true that aint flints ship he asked  at this i had a happy inspiration i began to believe that i had found an ally and i answered him at once  its not flints ship and flint is dead but ill tell you true as you ask methere are some of flints hands aboard worse luck for the rest of us  not a manwith oneleg he gasped  silver i asked  ah silver says he that were his name  hes the cook and the ringleader too  he was still holding me by the wrist and at that he gave it quite a wring  if you was sent by long john he said im as good as pork and i know it but where was you do you suppose  i had made my mind up in a moment and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves he heard me with the keenest interest and when i had done he patted me on the head  youre a good lad jim he said and youre all in a clove hitch aint you well you just put your trust in ben gunnben gunns the man to do it would you think it likely now that your squire would prove a liberalminded one in case of helphim being in a clove hitch as you remark  i told him the squire was the most liberal of men  ay but you see returned ben gunn i didnt mean giving me a gate to keep and a shuit of liveryclothes and such thats not my mark jim what i mean is would he be likely to come down to the toon of say one thousand pounds out of money thats as good as a mans own already  i am sure he would said i as it was all hands were to share  and a passage home he added with a look of great shrewdness  why i cried the squires a gentleman and besides if we got rid of the others we should want you to help work the vessel home  ah said he so you would and he seemed very much relieved  now ill tell you what he went on so much ill tell you and no more i were in flints ship when he buried the treasure he and six alongsix strong seamen they was ashore nigh on a week and us standing off and on in the old walrus one fine day up went the signal and here come flint by himself in a little boat and his head done up in a blue scarf the sun was getting up and mortal white he looked about the cutwater but there he was you mind and the six all deaddead and buried how he done it not a man aboard us could make out it was battle murder and sudden death leastwayshim against six billy bones was the mate long john he was quartermaster and they asked him where the treasure was ah says he you can go ashore if you like and stay he says but as for the ship shell beat up for more by thunder thats what he said  well i was in another ship three years back and we sighted this island boys said i heres flints treasure lets land and find it the capn was displeased at that but my messmates were all of a mind and landed twelve days they looked for it and every day they had the worse word for me until one fine morning all hands went aboard as for you benjamin gunn says they heres a musket they says and a spade and pickaxe you can stay here and find flints money for yourself they says  well jim three years have i been here and not a bite of christian diet from that day to this but now you look here look at me do i look like a man before the mast no says you nor i werent neither i says  and with that he winked and pinched me hard  just you mention them words to your squire jimhe went on nor he werent neitherthats the words three years he were the man of this island light and dark fair and rain and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer says you and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother so be as shes alive youll say but the most part of gunns time this is what youll saythe most part of his time was took up with another matter and then youll give him a nip like i do  and he pinched me again in the most confidential manner  then he continuedthen youll up and youll say thisgunn is a good man youll say and he puts a precious sight more confidencea precious sight mind thatin a genleman born than in these genlemen of fortune having been one hisself  well i said i dont understand one word that youve been saying but thats neither here nor there for how am i to get on board  ah said he thats the hitch for sure well theres my boat that i made with my two hands i keep her under the white rock if the worst come to the worst we might try that after darkhi he broke out whats that  for just then although the sun had still an hour or two to run all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon  they have begun to fight i cried follow me  and i began to run towards the anchorage my terrors all forgotten while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily and lightly  left left says he keep to your left hand mate jim under the trees with you theers where i killed my first goat they dont come down here now theyre all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear of benjamin gunn ah and theres the cetemerycemetery he must have meant you see the mounds i come here and prayed nows and thens when i thought maybe a sunday would be about doo it werent quite a chapel but it seemed more solemn like and then says you ben gunn was shorthandedno chapling nor so much as a bible and a flag you says  so he kept talking as i ran neither expecting nor receiving any answer  the cannonshot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms  another pause and then not a quarter of a mile in front of me i beheld the union jack flutter in the air above a wood       part iv    the stockade       chapter xvi    narrative continued by the doctorhow the ship was abandoned   it was about halfpast onethree bells in the sea phrasethat the two boats went ashore from the hispaniola the captain the squire and i were talking matters over in the cabin had there been a breath of wind we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us slipped our cable and away to sea but the wind was wanting and to complete our helplessness down came hunter with the news that jim hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest  it never occurred to us to doubt jim hawkins but we were alarmed for his safety with the men in the temper they were in it seemed an even chance if we should see the lad again we ran on deck the pitch was bubbling in the seams the nasty stench of the place turned me sick if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery it was in that abominable anchorage the six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the forecastle ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting in each hard by where the river runs in one of them was whistling lillibullero  waiting was a strain and it was decided that hunter and i should go ashore with the jollyboat in quest of information  the gigs had leaned to their right but hunter and i pulled straight in in the direction of the stockade upon the chart the two who were left guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance lillibullero stopped off and i could see the pair discussing what they ought to do had they gone and told silver all might have turned out differently but they had their orders i suppose and decided to sit quietly where they were and hark back again to lillibullero  there was a slight bend in the coast and i steered so as to put it between us even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the gigs i jumped out and came as near running as i durst with a big silk handkerchief under my hat for coolness sake and a brace of pistols ready primed for safety  i had not gone a hundred yards when i came on the stockade  this was how it was a spring of clear water rose almost at the top of a knoll well on the knoll and enclosing the spring they had clapped a stout loghouse fit to hold twoscore people on a pinch and loopholed for musketry on every side all round this they had cleared a wide space and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high without door or opening too strong to pull down without time and labour and too open to shelter the besiegers the people in the loghouse had them in every way they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like partridges all they wanted was a good watch and food for short of a complete surprise they might have held the place against a regiment  what particularly took my fancy was the spring for though we had a good enough place of it in the cabin of the hispaniola with plenty of arms and ammunition and things to eat and excellent wines there had been one thing overlookedwe had no water i was thinking this over when there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of death i was not new to violent deathi have served his royal highness the duke of cumberland and got a wound myself at fontenoybut i know my pulse went dot and carry one jim hawkins is gone was my first thought  it is something to have been an old soldier but more still to have been a doctor there is no time to dillydally in our work and so now i made up my mind instantly and with no time lost returned to the shore and jumped on board the jollyboat  by good fortune hunter pulled a good oar we made the water fly and the boat was soon alongside and i aboard the schooner  i found them all shaken as was natural the squire was sitting down as white as a sheet thinking of the harm he had led us to the good soul and one of the six forecastle hands was little better  theres a man says captain smollett nodding towards him new to this work he came nighhand fainting doctor when he heard the cry another touch of the rudder and that man would join us  i told my plan to the captain and between us we settled on the details of its accomplishment  we put old redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle with three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection hunter brought the boat round under the sternport and joyce and i set to work loading her with powdertins muskets bags of biscuits kegs of pork a cask of cognac and my invaluable medicinechest  in the meantime the squire and the captain stayed on deck and the latter hailed the coxswain who was the principal man aboard  mr hands he said here are two of us with a brace of pistols each if any one of you six make a signal of any description that mans dead  they were a good deal taken aback and after a little consultation one and all tumbled down the fore companion thinking no doubt to take us on the rear but when they saw redruth waiting for them in the sparred gallery they went aboutship at once and a head popped out again on deck  down dog cries the captain  and the head popped back again and we heard no more for the time of these six very fainthearted seamen  by this time tumbling things in as they came we had the jollyboat loaded as much as we dared joyce and i got out through the sternport and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us  this second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore lillibullero was dropped again and just before we lost sight of them behind the little point one of them whipped ashore and disappeared i had half a mind to change my plan and destroy their boats but i feared that silver and the others might be close at hand and all might very well be lost by trying for too much  we had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to provision the blockhouse all three made the first journey heavily laden and tossed our stores over the palisade then leaving joyce to guard themone man to be sure but with half a dozen musketshunter and i returned to the jollyboat and loaded ourselves once more so we proceeded without pausing to take breath till the whole cargo was bestowed when the two servants took up their positions in the blockhouse and i with all my power sculled back to the hispaniola  that we should have risked a second boatload seems more daring than it really was they had the advantage of numbers of course but we had the advantage of arms not one of the men ashore had a musket and before they could get within range for pistolshooting we flattered ourselves we should be able to give a good account of a halfdozen at least  the squire was waiting for me at the stern window all his faintness gone from him he caught the painter and made it fast and we fell to loading the boat for our very lives pork powder and biscuit was the cargo with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me and redruth and the captain the rest of the arms and powder we dropped overboard in two fathoms and a half of water so that we could see the bright steel shining far below us in the sun on the clean sandy bottom  by this time the tide was beginning to ebb and the ship was swinging round to her anchor voices were heard faintly halloaing in the direction of the two gigs and though this reassured us for joyce and hunter who were well to the eastward it warned our party to be off  redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the boat which we then brought round to the ships counter to be handier for captain smollett  now men said he do you hear me  there was no answer from the forecastle  its to you abraham grayits to you i am speaking  still no reply  gray resumed mr smollett a little louder i am leaving this ship and i order you to follow your captain i know you are a good man at bottom and i daresay not one of the lot of yous as bad as he makes out i have my watch here in my hand i give you thirty seconds to join me in  there was a pause  come my fine fellow continued the captain dont hang so long in stays im risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every second  there was a sudden scuffle a sound of blows and out burst abraham gray with a knifecut on the side of the cheek and came running to the captain like a dog to the whistle  im with you sir said he  and the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us and we had shoved off and given way  we were clear out of the ship but not yet ashore in our stockade       chapter xvii    narrative continued by the doctorthe jollyboats last trip   this fifth trip was quite different from any of the others in the first place the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely overloaded five grown men and three of themtrelawney redruth and the captainover six feet high was already more than she was meant to carry add to that the powder pork and breadbags the gunwale was lipping astern several times we shipped a little water and my breeches and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a hundred yards  the captain made us trim the boat and we got her to lie a little more evenly all the same we were afraid to breathe  in the second place the ebb was now makinga strong rippling current running westward through the basin and then southard and seaward down the straits by which we had entered in the morning even the ripples were a danger to our overloaded craft but the worst of it was that we were swept out of our true course and away from our proper landingplace behind the point if we let the current have its way we should come ashore beside the gigs where the pirates might appear at any moment  i cannot keep her head for the stockade sir said i to the captain i was steering while he and redruth two fresh men were at the oars the tide keeps washing her down could you pull a little stronger  not without swamping the boat said he you must bear up sir if you pleasebear up till you see youre gaining  i tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward until i had laid her head due east or just about right angles to the way we ought to go  well never get ashore at this rate said i  if its the only course that we can lie sir we must even lie it returned the captain we must keep upstream you see sir he went on if once we dropped to leeward of the landingplace its hard to say where we should get ashore besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs whereas the way we go the current must slacken and then we can dodge back along the shore  the currents less aready sir said the man gray who was sitting in the foresheets you can ease her off a bit  thank you my man said i quite as if nothing had happened for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves  suddenly the captain spoke up again and i thought his voice was a little changed  the gun said he  i have thought of that said i for i made sure he was thinking of a bombardment of the fort they could never get the gun ashore and if they did they could never haul it through the woods  look astern doctor replied the captain  we had entirely forgotten the long nine and there to our horror were the five rogues busy about her getting off her jacket as they called the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed not only that but it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the roundshot and the powder for the gun had been left behind and a stroke with an axe would put it all into the possession of the evil ones aboard  israel was flints gunner said gray hoarsely  at any risk we put the boats head direct for the landingplace by this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept steerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing and i could keep her steady for the goal but the worst of it was that with the course i now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the hispaniola and offered a target like a barndoor  i could hear as well as see that brandyfaced rascal israel hands plumping down a roundshot on the deck  whos the best shot asked the captain  mr trelawney out and away said i  mr trelawney will you please pick me off one of these men sir hands if possible said the captain  trelawney was as cool as steel he looked to the priming of his gun  now cried the captain easy with that gun sir or youll swamp the boat all hands stand by to trim her when he aims  the squire raised his gun the rowing ceased and we leaned over to the other side to keep the balance and all was so nicely contrived that we did not ship a drop  they had the gun by this time slewed round upon the swivel and hands who was at the muzzle with the rammer was in consequence the most exposed however we had no luck for just as trelawney fired down he stooped the ball whistled over him and it was one of the other four who fell  the cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a great number of voices from the shore and looking in that direction i saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling into their places in the boats  here come the gigs sir said i  give way then cried the captain we mustnt mind if we swamp her now if we cant get ashore alls up  only one of the gigs is being manned sir i added the crew of the other most likely going round by shore to cut us off  theyll have a hot run sir returned the captain jack ashore you know its not them i mind its the roundshot carpet bowls my ladys maid couldnt miss tell us squire when you see the match and well hold water  in the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so overloaded and we had shipped but little water in the process we were now close in thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her for the ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering trees the gig was no longer to be feared the little point had already concealed it from our eyes the ebbtide which had so cruelly delayed us was now making reparation and delaying our assailants the one source of danger was the gun  if i durst said the captain id stop and pick off another man  but it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot they had never so much as looked at their fallen comrade though he was not dead and i could see him trying to crawl away  ready cried the squire  hold cried the captain quick as an echo  and he and redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily under water the report fell in at the same instant of time this was the first that jim heard the sound of the squires shot not having reached him where the ball passed not one of us precisely knew but i fancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have contributed to our disaster  at any rate the boat sank by the stern quite gently in three feet of water leaving the captain and myself facing each other on our feet the other three took complete headers and came up again drenched and bubbling  so far there was no great harm no lives were lost and we could wade ashore in safety but there were all our stores at the bottom and to make things worse only two guns out of five remained in a state for service mine i had snatched from my knees and held over my head by a sort of instinct as for the captain he had carried his over his shoulder by a bandoleer and like a wise man lock uppermost the other three had gone down with the boat  to add to our concern we heard voices already drawing near us in the woods along shore and we had not only the danger of being cut off from the stockade in our halfcrippled state but the fear before us whether if hunter and joyce were attacked by half a dozen they would have the sense and conduct to stand firm hunter was steady that we knew joyce was a doubtful casea pleasant polite man for a valet and to brush ones clothes but not entirely fitted for a man of war  with all this in our minds we waded ashore as fast as we could leaving behind us the poor jollyboat and a good half of all our powder and provisions       chapter xviii    narrative continued by the doctorend of the first days fighting   we made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from the stockade and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers rang nearer soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the cracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket  i began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my priming  captain said i trelawney is the dead shot give him your gun his own is useless  they exchanged guns and trelawney silent and cool as he had been since the beginning of the bustle hung a moment on his heel to see that all was fit for service at the same time observing gray to be unarmed i handed him my cutlass it did all our hearts good to see him spit in his hand knit his brows and make the blade sing through the air it was plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt  forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade in front of us we struck the enclosure about the middle of the south side and almost at the same time seven mutineersjob anderson the boatswain at their headappeared in full cry at the southwestern corner  they paused as if taken aback and before they recovered not only the squire and i but hunter and joyce from the blockhouse had time to fire the four shots came in rather a scattering volley but they did the business one of the enemy actually fell and the rest without hesitation turned and plunged into the trees  after reloading we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to the fallen enemy he was stone deadshot through the heart  we began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a pistol cracked in the bush a ball whistled close past my ear and poor tom redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground both the squire and i returned the shot but as we had nothing to aim at it is probable we only wasted powder then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor tom  the captain and gray were already examining him and i saw with half an eye that all was over  i believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried groaning and bleeding into the loghouse  poor old fellow he had not uttered one word of surprise complaint fear or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till now when we had laid him down in the loghouse to die he had lain like a trojan behind his mattress in the gallery he had followed every order silently doggedly and well he was the oldest of our party by a score of years and now sullen old serviceable servant it was he that was to die  the squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand crying like a child  be i going doctor he asked  tom my man said i youre going home  i wish i had had a lick at them with the gun first he replied  tom said the squire say you forgive me wont you  would that be respectful like from me to you squire was the answer howsoever so be itamen  after a little while of silence he said he thought somebody might read a prayer its the custom sir he added apologetically and not long after without another word he passed away  in the meantime the captain whom i had observed to be wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets had turned out a great many various storesthe british colours a bible a coil of stoutish rope pen ink the logbook and pounds of tobacco he had found a longish firtree lying felled and cleared in the enclosure and with the help of hunter he had set it up at the corner of the loghouse where the trunks crossed and made an angle then climbing on the roof he had with his own hand bent and run up the colours  this seemed mightily to relieve him he reentered the loghouse and set about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed but he had an eye on toms passage for all that and as soon as all was over came forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body  dont you take on sir he said shaking the squires hand alls well with him no fear for a hand thats been shot down in his duty to captain and owner it maynt be good divinity but its a fact  then he pulled me aside  dr livesey he said in how many weeks do you and squire expect the consort  i told him it was a question not of weeks but of months that if we were not back by the end of august blandly was to send to find us but neither sooner nor later you can calculate for yourself i said  why yes returned the captain scratching his head and making a large allowance sir for all the gifts of providence i should say we were pretty close hauled  how do you mean i asked  its a pity sir we lost that second load thats what i mean replied the captain as for powder and shot well do but the rations are short very shortso short doctor livesey that were perhaps as well without that extra mouth  and he pointed to the dead body under the flag  just then with a roar and a whistle a roundshot passed high above the roof of the loghouse and plumped far beyond us in the wood  oho said the captain blaze away youve little enough powder already my lads  at the second trial the aim was better and the ball descended inside the stockade scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage  captain said the squire the house is quite invisible from the ship it must be the flag they are aiming at would it not be wiser to take it in  strike my colours cried the captain no sir not i and as soon as he had said the words i think we all agreed with him for it was not only a piece of stout seamanly good feeling it was good policy besides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade  all through the evening they kept thundering away ball after ball flew over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure but they had to fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft sand we had no ricochet to fear and though one popped in through the roof of the loghouse and out again through the floor we soon got used to that sort of horseplay and minded it no more than cricket  there is one thing good about all this observed the captain the wood in front of us is likely clear the ebb has made a good while our stores should be uncovered volunteers to go and bring in pork  gray and hunter were the first to come forward well armed they stole out of the stockade but it proved a fruitless mission the mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in israels gunnery for four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay close by pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the current silver was in the sternsheets in command and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of their own  the captain sat down to his log and here is the beginning of the entry  alexander smollett master david livesey ships doctor abraham gray carpenters mate john trelawney owner john hunter and richard joyce owners servants landsmenbeing all that is left faithful of the ships companywith stores for ten days at short rations came ashore this day and flew british colours on the loghouse in treasure island thomas redruth owners servant landsman shot by the mutineers james hawkins cabinboy  and at the same time i was wondering over poor jim hawkinss fate  a hail on the land side  somebody hailing us said hunter who was on guard  doctor squire captain hullo hunter is that you came the cries  and i ran to the door in time to see jim hawkins safe and sound come climbing over the stockade       chapter xix    narrative resumed by jim hawkinsthe garrison in the stockade   as soon as ben gunn saw the colours he came to a halt stopped me by the arm and sat down  now said he theres your friends sure enough  far more likely its the mutineers i answered  that he cried why in a place like this where nobody puts in but genlemen of fortune silver would fly the jolly roger you dont make no doubt of that no thats your friends theres been blows too and i reckon your friends has had the best of it and here they are ashore in the old stockade as was made years and years ago by flint ah he was the man to have a headpiece was flint barring rum his match were never seen he were afraid of none not he ony silversilver was that genteel  well said i that may be so and so be it all the more reason that i should hurry on and join my friends  nay mate returned ben not you youre a good boy or im mistook but youre ony a boy all told now ben gunn is fly rum wouldnt bring me there where youre goingnot rum wouldnt till i see your born genleman and gets it on his word of honour and you wont forget my words a precious sight thats what youll say a precious sight more confidenceand then nips him  and he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness  and when ben gunn is wanted you know where to find him jim just wheer you found him today and him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand and hes to come alone o and youll say this ben gunn says you has reasons of his own  well said i i believe i understand you have something to propose and you wish to see the squire or the doctor and youre to be found where i found you is that all  and when says you he added why from about noon observation to about six bells  good said i and now may i go  you wont forget he inquired anxiously precious sight and reasons of his own says you reasons of his own thats the mainstay as between man and man well thenstill holding mei reckon you can go jim and jim if you was to see silver you wouldnt go for to sell ben gunn wild horses wouldnt draw it from you no says you and if them pirates camp ashore jim what would you say but thered be widders in the morning  here he was interrupted by a loud report and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking the next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different direction  for a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island and balls kept crashing through the woods i moved from hidingplace to hidingplace always pursued or so it seemed to me by these terrifying missiles but towards the end of the bombardment though still i durst not venture in the direction of the stockade where the balls fell oftenest i had begun in a manner to pluck up my heart again and after a long detour to the east crept down among the shoreside trees  the sun had just set the seabreeze was rustling and tumbling in the woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage the tide too was far out and great tracts of sand lay uncovered the air after the heat of the day chilled me through my jacket  the hispaniola still lay where she had anchored but sure enough there was the jolly rogerthe black flag of piracyflying from her peak even as i looked there came another red flash and another report that sent the echoes clattering and one more roundshot whistled through the air it was the last of the cannonade  i lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack men were demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockade the poor jollyboat i afterwards discovered away near the mouth of the river a great fire was glowing among the trees and between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going the men whom i had seen so gloomy shouting at the oars like children but there was a sound in their voices which suggested rum  at length i thought i might return towards the stockade i was pretty far down on the low sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east and is joined at halfwater to skeleton island and now as i rose to my feet i saw some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes an isolated rock pretty high and peculiarly white in colour it occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which ben gunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and i should know where to look for one  then i skirted among the woods until i had regained the rear or shoreward side of the stockade and was soon warmly welcomed by the faithful party  i had soon told my story and began to look about me the loghouse was made of unsquared trunks of pineroof walls and floor the latter stood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the surface of the sand there was a porch at the door and under this porch the little spring welled up into an artificial basin of a rather odd kindno other than a great ships kettle of iron with the bottom knocked out and sunk to her bearings as the captain said among the sand  little had been left beside the framework of the house but in one corner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an old rusty iron basket to contain the fire  the slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had been cleared of timber to build the house and we could see by the stumps what a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed most of the soil had been washed away or buried in drift after the removal of the trees only where the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss and some ferns and little creeping bushes were still green among the sand very close around the stockadetoo close for defence they saidthe wood still flourished high and dense all of fir on the land side but towards the sea with a large admixture of liveoaks  the cold evening breeze of which i have spoken whistled through every chink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor with a continual rain of fine sand there was sand in our eyes sand in our teeth sand in our suppers sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle for all the world like porridge beginning to boil our chimney was a square hole in the roof it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way out and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping the eye  add to this that gray the new man had his face tied up in a bandage for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor old tom redruth still unburied lay along the wall stiff and stark under the union jack  if we had been allowed to sit idle we should all have fallen in the blues but captain smollett was never the man for that all hands were called up before him and he divided us into watches the doctor and gray and i for one the squire hunter and joyce upon the other tired as we all were two were sent out for firewood two more were set to dig a grave for redruth the doctor was named cook i was put sentry at the door and the captain himself went from one to another keeping up our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted  from time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to rest his eyes which were almost smoked out of his head and whenever he did so he had a word for me  that man smollett he said once is a better man than i am and when i say that it means a deal jim  another time he came and was silent for a while then he put his head on one side and looked at me  is this ben gunn a man he asked  i do not know sir said i i am not very sure whether hes sane  if theres any doubt about the matter he is returned the doctor a man who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island jim cant expect to appear as sane as you or me it doesnt lie in human nature was it cheese you said he had a fancy for  yes sir cheese i answered  well jim says he just see the good that comes of being dainty in your food youve seen my snuffbox havent you and you never saw me take snuff the reason being that in my snuffbox i carry a piece of parmesan cheesea cheese made in italy very nutritious well thats for ben gunn  before supper was eaten we buried old tom in the sand and stood round him for a while bareheaded in the breeze a good deal of firewood had been got in but not enough for the captains fancy and he shook his head over it and told us we must get back to this tomorrow rather livelier then when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff glass of brandy grog the three chiefs got together in a corner to discuss our prospects  it appears they were at their wits end what to do the stores being so low that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came but our best hope it was decided was to kill off the buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the hispaniola from nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen two others were wounded and one at leastthe man shot beside the gunseverely wounded if he were not dead every time we had a crack at them we were to take it saving our own lives with the extremest care and besides that we had two able alliesrum and the climate  as for the first though we were about half a mile away we could hear them roaring and singing late into the night and as for the second the doctor staked his wig that camped where they were in the marsh and unprovided with remedies the half of them would be on their backs before a week  so he added if we are not all shot down first theyll be glad to be packing in the schooner its always a ship and they can get to buccaneering again i suppose  first ship that ever i lost said captain smollett  i was dead tired as you may fancy and when i got to sleep which was not till after a great deal of tossing i slept like a log of wood  the rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when i was awakened by a bustle and the sound of voices  flag of truce i heard some one say and then immediately after with a cry of surprise silver himself  and at that up i jumped and rubbing my eyes ran to a loophole in the wall       chapter xx    silvers embassy   sure enough there were two men just outside the stockade one of them waving a white cloth the other no less a person than silver himself standing placidly by  it was still quite early and the coldest morning that i think i ever was abroad in a chill that pierced into the marrow the sky was bright and cloudless overhead and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun but where silver stood with his lieutenant all was still in shadow and they waded kneedeep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass the chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island it was plainly a damp feverish unhealthy spot  keep indoors men said the captain ten to one this is a trick  then he hailed the buccaneer  who goes stand or we fire  flag of truce cried silver  the captain was in the porch keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot should any be intended he turned and spoke to us  doctors watch on the lookout dr livesey take the north side if you please jim the east gray west the watch below all hands to load muskets lively men and careful  and then he turned again to the mutineers  and what do you want with your flag of truce he cried  this time it was the other man who replied  capn silver sir to come on board and make terms he shouted  capn silver dont know him whos he cried the captain and we could hear him adding to himself capn is it my heart and heres promotion  long john answered for himself  me sir these poor lads have chosen me capn after your desertion sirlaying a particular emphasis upon the word desertion were willing to submit if we can come to terms and no bones about it all i ask is your word capn smollett to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade and one minute to get out o shot before a gun is fired  my man said captain smollett i have not the slightest desire to talk to you if you wish to talk to me you can come thats all if theres any treachery itll be on your side and the lord help you  thats enough capn shouted long john cheerily a word from yous enough i know a gentleman and you may lay to that  we could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold silver back nor was that wonderful seeing how cavalier had been the captains answer but silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd then he advanced to the stockade threw over his crutch got a leg up and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side  i will confess that i was far too much taken up with what was going on to be of the slightest use as sentry indeed i had already deserted my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain who had now seated himself on the threshold with his elbows on his knees his head in his hands and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron kettle in the sand he was whistling to himself come lasses and lads  silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll what with the steepness of the incline the thick treestumps and the soft sand he and his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays but he stuck to it like a man in silence and at last arrived before the captain whom he saluted in the handsomest style he was tricked out in his best an immense blue coat thick with brass buttons hung as low as to his knees and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head  here you are my man said the captain raising his head you had better sit down  you aint agoing to let me inside capn complained long john its a main cold morning to be sure sir to sit outside upon the sand  why silver said the captain if you had pleased to be an honest man you might have been sitting in your galley its your own doing youre either my ships cookand then you were treated handsomeor capn silver a common mutineer and pirate and then you can go hang  well well capn returned the sea cook sitting down as he was bidden on the sand youll have to give me a hand up again thats all a sweet pretty place you have of it hereah theres jim the top of the morning to you jimdoctor heres my service why there you all are together like a happy family in a manner of speaking  if you have anything to say my man better say it said the captain  right you were capn smollett replied silver dooty is dooty to be sure well now you look here that was a good lay of yours last night i dont deny it was a good lay some of you pretty handy with a handspikeend and ill not deny neither but what some of my people was shookmaybe all was shook maybe i was shook myself maybe thats why im here for terms but you mark me capn it wont do twice by thunder well have to do sentrygo and ease off a point or so on the rum maybe you think we were all a sheet in the winds eye but ill tell you i was sober i was ony dogtired and if id awoke a second sooner id acaught you at the act i would he wasnt dead when i got round to him not he  well says captain smollett as cool as can be  all that silver said was a riddle to him but you would never have guessed it from his tone as for me i began to have an inkling ben gunns last words came back to my mind i began to suppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round their fire and i reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with  well here it is said silver we want that treasure and well have itthats our point you would just as soon save your lives i reckon and thats yours you have a chart havent you  thats as may be replied the captain  oh well you have i know that returned long john you neednt be so husky with a man there aint a particle of service in that and you may lay to it what i mean is we want your chart now i never meant you no harm myself  that wont do with me my man interrupted the captain we know exactly what you meant to do and we dont care for now you see you cant do it  and the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe  if abe gray silver broke out  avast there cried mr smollett gray told me nothing and i asked him nothing and whats more i would see you and him and this whole island blown clean out of the water into blazes first so theres my mind for you my man on that  this little whiff of temper seemed to cool silver down he had been growing nettled before but now he pulled himself together  like enough said he i would set no limits to what gentlemen might consider shipshape or might not as the case were and seein as how you are about to take a pipe capn ill make so free as do likewise  and he filled a pipe and lighted it and the two men sat silently smoking for quite a while now looking each other in the face now stopping their tobacco now leaning forward to spit it was as good as the play to see them  now resumed silver here it is you give us the chart to get the treasure by and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in while asleep you do that and well offer you a choice either you come aboard along of us once the treasure shipped and then ill give you my affydavy upon my word of honour to clap you somewhere safe ashore or if that aint to your fancy some of my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing then you can stay here you can well divide stores with you man for man and ill give my affydavy as before to speak the first ship i sight and send em here to pick you up now youll own thats talking handsomer you couldnt look to get not you and i hoperaising his voicethat all hands in this here blockhouse will overhaul my words for what is spoke to one is spoke to all  captain smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his pipe in the palm of his left hand  is that all he asked  every last word by thunder answered john refuse that and youve seen the last of me but musketballs  very good said the captain now youll hear me if youll come up one by one unarmed ill engage to clap you all in irons and take you home to a fair trial in england if you wont my name is alexander smollett ive flown my sovereigns colours and ill see you all to davy jones you cant find the treasure you cant sail the shiptheres not a man among you fit to sail the ship you cant fight usgray there got away from five of you your ships in irons master silver youre on a lee shore and so youll find i stand here and tell you so and theyre the last good words youll get from me for in the name of heaven ill put a bullet in your back when next i meet you tramp my lad bundle out of this please hand over hand and double quick  silvers face was a picture his eyes started in his head with wrath he shook the fire out of his pipe  give me a hand up he cried  not i returned the captain  wholl give me a hand up he roared  not a man among us moved growling the foulest imprecations he crawled along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself again upon his crutch then he spat into the spring  there he cried thats what i think of ye before an hours out ill stove in your old blockhouse like a rumpuncheon laugh by thunder laugh before an hours out yell laugh upon the other side them that diell be the lucky ones  and with a dreadful oath he stumbled off ploughed down the sand was helped across the stockade after four or five failures by the man with the flag of truce and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the trees       chapter xxi    the attack   as soon as silver disappeared the captain who had been closely watching him turned towards the interior of the house and found not a man of us at his post but gray it was the first time we had ever seen him angry  quarters he roared and then as we all slunk back to our places gray he said ill put your name in the log youve stood by your duty like a seamanmr trelawney im surprised at you sirdoctor i thought you had worn the kings coat if that was how you served at fontenoy sir youd have been better in your berth  the doctors watch were all back at their loopholes the rest were busy loading the spare muskets and every one with a red face you may be certain and a flea in his ear as the saying is  the captain looked on for a while in silence then he spoke  my lads said he ive given silver a broadside i pitched it in redhot on purpose and before the hours out as he said we shall be boarded were outnumbered i neednt tell you that but we fight in shelter and a minute ago i should have said we fought with discipline ive no manner of doubt that we can drub them if you choose  then he went the rounds and saw as he said that all was clear  on the two short sides of the house east and west there were only two loopholes on the south side where the porch was two again and on the north side five there was a round score of muskets for the seven of us the firewood had been built into four pilestables you might sayone about the middle of each side and on each of these tables some ammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the defenders in the middle the cutlasses lay ranged  toss out the fire said the captain the chill is past and we mustnt have smoke in our eyes  the iron firebasket was carried bodily out by mr trelawney and the embers smothered among sand  hawkins hasnt had his breakfasthawkins help yourself and back to your post to eat it continued captain smollett lively now my lad youll want it before youve donehunter serve out a round of brandy to all hands  and while this was going on the captain completed in his own mind the plan of the defence  doctor you will take the door he resumed see and dont expose yourself keep within and fire through the porchhunter take the east side therejoyce you stand by the west my man mr trelawney you are the best shotyou and gray will take this long north side with the five loopholes its there the danger is if they can get up to it and fire in upon us through our own ports things would begin to look dirtyhawkins neither you nor i are much account at the shooting well stand by to load and bear a hand  as the captain had said the chill was past as soon as the sun had climbed above our girdle of trees it fell with all its force upon the clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught soon the sand was baking and the resin melting in the logs of the blockhouse jackets and coats were flung aside shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the shoulders and we stood there each at his post in a fever of heat and anxiety  an hour passed away  hang them said the captain this is as dull as the doldrumsgray whistle for a wind  and just at that moment came the first news of the attack  if you please sir said joyce if i see any one am i to fire  i told you so cried the captain  thank you sir returned joyce with the same quiet civility  nothing followed for a time but the remark had set us all on the alert straining ears and eyesthe musketeers with their pieces balanced in their hands the captain out in the middle of the blockhouse with his mouth very tight and a frown on his face  so some seconds passed till suddenly joyce whipped up his musket and fired the report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and repeated from without in a scattering volley shot behind shot like a string of geese from every side of the enclosure several bullets struck the loghouse but not one entered and as the smoke cleared away and vanished the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and empty as before not a bough waved not the gleam of a musketbarrel betrayed the presence of our foes  did you hit your man asked the captain  no sir replied joyce i believe not sir  next best thing to tell the truth muttered captain smollett load his gun hawkins how many should you say there were on your side doctor  i know precisely said dr livesey three shots were fired on this side i saw the three flashestwo close togetherone farther to the west  three repeated the captain and how many on yours mr trelawney  but this was not so easily answered there had come many from the northseven by the squires computation eight or nine according to gray from the east and west only a single shot had been fired it was plain therefore that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities but captain smollett made no change in his arrangement if the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade he argued they would take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats in our own stronghold  nor had we much time left to us for thought suddenly with a loud huzza a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side and ran straight on the stockade at the same moment the fire was once more opened from the woods and a rifleball sang through the doorway and knocked the doctors musket into bits  the boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys squire and gray fired again and yet again three men fell one forwards into the enclosure two back on the outside but of these one was evidently more frightened than hurt for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly disappeared among the trees  two had bit the dust one had fled four had made good their footing inside our defences while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight men each evidently supplied with several muskets kept up a hot though useless fire on the loghouse  the four who had boarded made straight before them for the building shouting as they ran and the men among the trees shouted back to encourage them several shots were fired but such was the hurry of the marksmen that not one appeared to have taken effect in a moment the four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us  the head of job anderson the boatswain appeared at the middle loophole  at em all handsall hands he roared in a voice of thunder  at the same moment another pirate grasped hunters musket by the muzzle wrenched it from his hands plucked it through the loophole and with one stunning blow laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor meanwhile a third running unharmed all round the house appeared suddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor  our position was utterly reversed a moment since we were firing under cover at an exposed enemy now it was we who lay uncovered and could not return a blow  the loghouse was full of smoke to which we owed our comparative safety cries and confusion the flashes and reports of pistolshots and one loud groan rang in my ears  out lads out and fight em in the open cutlasses cried the captain  i snatched a cutlass from the pile and some one at the same time snatching another gave me a cut across the knuckles which i hardly felt i dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight some one was close behind i knew not whom right in front the doctor was pursuing his assailant down the hill and just as my eyes fell upon him beat down his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash across the face  round the house lads round the house cried the captain and even in the hurlyburly i perceived a change in his voice  mechanically i obeyed turned eastwards and with my cutlass raised ran round the corner of the house next moment i was face to face with anderson he roared aloud and his hanger went up above his head flashing in the sunlight i had not time to be afraid but as the blow still hung impending leaped in a trice upon one side and missing my foot in the soft sand rolled headlong down the slope  when i had first sallied from the door the other mutineers had been already swarming up the palisade to make an end of us one man in a red nightcap with his cutlass in his mouth had even got upon the top and thrown a leg across well so short had been the interval that when i found my feet again all was in the same posture the fellow with the red nightcap still halfway over another still just showing his head above the top of the stockade and yet in this breath of time the fight was over and the victory was ours  gray following close behind me had cut down the big boatswain ere he had time to recover from his lost blow another had been shot at a loophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony the pistol still smoking in his hand a third as i had seen the doctor disposed of at a blow of the four who had scaled the palisade one only remained unaccounted for and he having left his cutlass on the field was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him  firefire from the house cried the doctor and you lads back into cover  but his words were unheeded no shot was fired and the last boarder made good his escape and disappeared with the rest into the wood in three seconds nothing remained of the attacking party but the five who had fallen four on the inside and one on the outside of the palisade  the doctor and gray and i ran full speed for shelter the survivors would soon be back where they had left their muskets and at any moment the fire might recommence  the house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke and we saw at a glance the price we had paid for victory hunter lay beside his loophole stunned joyce by his shot through the head never to move again while right in the centre the squire was supporting the captain one as pale as the other  the captains wounded said mr trelawney  have they run asked mr smollett  all that could you may be bound returned the doctor but theres five of them will never run again  five cried the captain come thats better five against three leaves us four to nine thats better odds than we had at starting we were seven to nineteen then or thought we were and thats as bad to bear1   footnote    1 the mutineers were soon only eight in number for the man shot by     mr trelawney on board the schooner died that same evening of his     wound but this was of course not known till after by the faithful     party       part v    my sea adventure       chapter xxii    how i began my sea adventure   there was no return of the mutineersnot so much as another shot out of the woods they had got their rations for that day as the captain put it and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the wounded and get dinner squire and i cooked outside in spite of the danger and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at for horror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctors patients  out of the eight men who had fallen in the action only three still breathedthat one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole hunter and captain smollett and of these the first two were as good as dead the mutineer indeed died under the doctors knife and hunter do what we could never recovered consciousness in this world he lingered all day breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his apoplectic fit but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the blow and his skull fractured in falling and some time in the following night without sign or sound he went to his maker  as for the captain his wounds were grievous indeed but not dangerous no organ was fatally injured andersons ballfor it was job that shot him firsthad broken his shoulderblade and touched the lung not badly the second had only torn and displaced some muscles in the calf he was sure to recover the doctor said but in the meantime and for weeks to come he must not walk nor move his arm nor so much as speak when he could help it  my own accidental cut across the knuckles was a fleabite dr livesey patched it up with plaster and pulled my ears for me into the bargain  after dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captains side a while in consultation and when they had talked to their hearts content it being then a little past noon the doctor took up his hat and pistols girt on a cutlass put the chart in his pocket and with a musket over his shoulder crossed the palisade on the north side and set off briskly through the trees  gray and i were sitting together at the far end of the blockhouse to be out of earshot of our officers consulting and gray took his pipe out of his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again so thunderstruck he was at this occurrence  why in the name of davy jones said he is dr livesey mad  why no says i hes about the last of this crew for that i take it  well shipmate said gray mad he may not be but if hes not you mark my words i am  i take it replied i the doctor has his idea and if i am right hes going now to see ben gunn  i was right as appeared later but in the meantime the house being stifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze with midday sun i began to get another thought into my head which was not by any means so right what i began to do was to envy the doctor walking in the cool shadow of the woods with the birds about him and the pleasant smell of the pines while i sat grilling with my clothes stuck to the hot resin and so much blood about me and so many poor dead bodies lying all around that i took a disgust of the place that was almost as strong as fear  all the time i was washing out the blockhouse and then washing up the things from dinner this disgust and envy kept growing stronger and stronger till at last being near a breadbag and no one then observing me i took the first step towards my escapade and filled both pockets of my coat with biscuit  i was a fool if you like and certainly i was going to do a foolish overbold act but i was determined to do it with all the precautions in my power these biscuits should anything befall me would keep me at least from starving till far on in the next day  the next thing i laid hold of was a brace of pistols and as i already had a powderhorn and bullets i felt myself well supplied with arms  as for the scheme i had in my head it was not a bad one in itself i was to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east from the open sea find the white rock i had observed last evening and ascertain whether it was there or not that ben gunn had hidden his boat a thing quite worth doing as i still believe but as i was certain i should not be allowed to leave the enclosure my only plan was to take french leave and slip out when nobody was watching and that was so bad a way of doing it as made the thing itself wrong but i was only a boy and i had made my mind up  well as things at last fell out i found an admirable opportunity the squire and gray were busy helping the captain with his bandages the coast was clear i made a bolt for it over the stockade and into the thickest of the trees and before my absence was observed i was out of cry of my companions  this was my second folly far worse than the first as i left but two sound men to guard the house but like the first it was a help towards saving all of us  i took my way straight for the east coast of the island for i was determined to go down the sea side of the spit to avoid all chance of observation from the anchorage it was already late in the afternoon although still warm and sunny as i continued to thread the tall woods i could hear from far before me not only the continuous thunder of the surf but a certain tossing of foliage and grinding of boughs which showed me the sea breeze had set in higher than usual soon cool draughts of air began to reach me and a few steps farther i came forth into the open borders of the grove and saw the sea lying blue and sunny to the horizon and the surf tumbling and tossing its foam along the beach  i have never seen the sea quiet round treasure island the sun might blaze overhead the air be without a breath the surface smooth and blue but still these great rollers would be running along all the external coast thundering and thundering by day and night and i scarce believe there is one spot in the island where a man would be out of earshot of their noise  i walked along beside the surf with great enjoyment till thinking i was now got far enough to the south i took the cover of some thick bushes and crept warily up to the ridge of the spit  behind me was the sea in front the anchorage the sea breeze as though it had the sooner blown itself out by its unusual violence was already at an end it had been succeeded by light variable airs from the south and southeast carrying great banks of fog and the anchorage under lee of skeleton island lay still and leaden as when first we entered it the hispaniola in that unbroken mirror was exactly portrayed from the truck to the waterline the jolly roger hanging from her peak  alongside lay one of the gigs silver in the sternsheetshim i could always recognisewhile a couple of men were leaning over the stern bulwarks one of them with a red capthe very rogue that i had seen some hours before stridelegs upon the palisade apparently they were talking and laughing though at that distanceupwards of a milei could of course hear no word of what was said all at once there began the most horrid unearthly screaming which at first startled me badly though i had soon remembered the voice of captain flint and even thought i could make out the bird by her bright plumage as she sat perched upon her masters wrist  soon after the jollyboat shoved off and pulled for shore and the man with the red cap and his comrade went below by the cabin companion  just about the same time the sun had gone down behind the spyglass and as the fog was collecting rapidly it began to grow dark in earnest i saw i must lose no time if i were to find the boat that evening  the white rock visible enough above the brush was still some eighth of a mile farther down the spit and it took me a goodish while to get up with it crawling often on allfours among the scrub night had almost come when i laid my hand on its rough sides right below it there was an exceedingly small hollow of green turf hidden by banks and a thick underwood about kneedeep that grew there very plentifully and in the centre of the dell sure enough a little tent of goatskins like what the gipsies carry about with them in england  i dropped into the hollow lifted the side of the tent and there was ben gunns boathomemade if ever anything was homemade a rude lopsided framework of tough wood and stretched upon that a covering of goatskin with the hair inside the thing was extremely small even for me and i can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a fullsized man there was one thwart set as low as possible a kind of stretcher in the bows and a double paddle for propulsion  i had not then seen a coracle such as the ancient britons made but i have seen one since and i can give you no fairer idea of ben gunns boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever made by man but the great advantage of the coracle it certainly possessed for it was exceedingly light and portable  well now that i had found the boat you would have thought i had had enough of truantry for once but in the meantime i had taken another notion and become so obstinately fond of it that i would have carried it out i believe in the teeth of captain smollett himself this was to slip out under cover of the night cut the hispaniola adrift and let her go ashore where she fancied i had quite made up my mind that the mutineers after their repulse of the morning had nothing nearer their hearts than to up anchor and away to sea this i thought it would be a good thing to prevent and now that i had seen how they left their watchmen unprovided with a boat i thought it might be done with little risk  down i sat to wait for darkness and made a hearty meal of biscuit it was a night out of ten thousand for my purpose the fog had now buried all heaven as the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared absolute blackness settled down on treasure island and when at last i shouldered the coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow where i had supped there were but two points visible on the whole anchorage  one was the great fire on shore by which the defeated pirates lay carousing in the swamp the other a mere blur of light upon the darkness indicated the position of the anchored ship she had swung round to the ebbher bow was now towards methe only lights on board were in the cabin and what i saw was merely a reflection on the fog of the strong rays that flowed from the stern window  the ebb had already run some time and i had to wade through a long belt of swampy sand where i sank several times above the ankle before i came to the edge of the retreating water and wading a little way in with some strength and dexterity set my coracle keel downwards on the surface       chapter xxiii    the ebbtide runs   the coracleas i had ample reason to know before i was done with herwas a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight both buoyant and clever in a seaway but she was the most crossgrained lopsided craft to manage do as you pleased she always made more leeway than anything else and turning round and round was the manoeuvre she was best at even ben gunn himself has admitted that she was queer to handle till you knew her way  certainly i did not know her way she turned in every direction but the one i was bound to go the most part of the time we were broadside on and i am very sure i never should have made the ship at all but for the tide by good fortune paddle as i pleased the tide was still sweeping me down and there lay the hispaniola right in the fairway hardly to be missed  first she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than darkness then her spars and hull began to take shape and the next moment as it seemed for the farther i went the brisker grew the current of the ebb i was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold  the hawser was as taut as a bowstringso strong she pulled upon her anchor all round the hull in the blackness the rippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream one cut with my seagully and the hispaniola would go humming down the tide  so far so good but it next occurred to my recollection that a taut hawser suddenly cut is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse ten to one if i were so foolhardy as to cut the hispaniola from her anchor i and the coracle would be knocked clean out of the water  this brought me to a full stop and if fortune had not again particularly favoured me i should have had to abandon my design but the light airs which had begun blowing from the southeast and south had hauled round after nightfall into the southwest just while i was meditating a puff came caught the hispaniola and forced her up into the current and to my great joy i felt the hawser slacken in my grasp and the hand by which i held it dip for a second under water  with that i made my mind up took out my gully opened it with my teeth and cut one strand after another till the vessel only swung by two then i lay quiet waiting to sever these last when the strain should be once more lightened by a breath of wind  all this time i had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin but to say truth my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughts that i had scarcely given ear now however when i had nothing else to do i began to pay more heed  one i recognised for the coxswains israel hands that had been flints gunner in former days the other was of course my friend of the red nightcap both men were plainly the worse for drink and they were still drinking for even while i was listening one of them with a drunken cry opened the stern window and threw out something which i divined to be an empty bottle but they were not only tipsy it was plain that they were furiously angry oaths flew like hailstones and every now and then there came forth such an explosion as i thought was sure to end in blows but each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled lower for a while until the next crisis came and in its turn passed away without result  on shore i could see the glow of the great campfire burning warmly through the shoreside trees some one was singing a dull old droning sailors song with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer i had heard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words    but one man of her crew alive    what put to sea with seventyfive  and i thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a company that had met such cruel losses in the morning but indeed from what i saw all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed on  at last the breeze came the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the dark i felt the hawser slacken once more and with a good tough effort cut the last fibres through  the breeze had but little action on the coracle and i was almost instantly swept against the bows of the hispaniola at the same time the schooner began to turn upon her heel spinning slowly end for end across the current  i wrought like a fiend for i expected every moment to be swamped and since i found i could not push the coracle directly off i now shoved straight astern at length i was clear of my dangerous neighbour and just as i gave the last impulsion my hands came across a light cord that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks instantly i grasped it  why i should have done so i can hardly say it was at first mere instinct but once i had it in my hands and found it fast curiosity began to get the upper hand and i determined i should have one look through the cabin window  i pulled in hand over hand on the cord and when i judged myself near enough rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded the roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin  by this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding pretty swiftly through the water indeed we had already fetched up level with the campfire the ship was talking as sailors say loudly treading the innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash and until i got my eye above the windowsill i could not comprehend why the watchmen had taken no alarm one glance however was sufficient and it was only one glance that i durst take from that unsteady skiff it showed me hands and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle each with a hand upon the others throat  i dropped upon the thwart again none too soon for i was near overboard i could see nothing for the moment but these two furious encrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp and i shut my eyes to let them grow once more familiar with the darkness  the endless ballad had come to an end at last and the whole diminished company about the campfire had broken into the chorus i had heard so often    fifteen men on the dead mans chest      yohoho and a bottle of rum    drink and the devil had done for the rest      yohoho and a bottle of rum  i was just thinking how busy drink and the devil were at that very moment in the cabin of the hispaniola when i was surprised by a sudden lurch of the coracle at the same moment she yawed sharply and seemed to change her course the speed in the meantime had strangely increased  i opened my eyes at once all round me were little ripples combing over with a sharp bristling sound and slightly phosphorescent the hispaniola herself a few yards in whose wake i was still being whirled along seemed to stagger in her course and i saw her spars toss a little against the blackness of the night nay as i looked longer i made sure she also was wheeling to the southward  i glanced over my shoulder and my heart jumped against my ribs there right behind me was the glow of the campfire the current had turned at right angles sweeping round along with it the tall schooner and the little dancing coracle ever quickening ever bubbling higher ever muttering louder it went spinning through the narrows for the open sea  suddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw turning perhaps through twenty degrees and almost at the same moment one shout followed another from on board i could hear feet pounding on the companionladder and i knew that the two drunkards had at last been interrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a sense of their disaster  i lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched skiff and devoutly recommended my spirit to its maker at the end of the straits i made sure we must fall into some bar of raging breakers where all my troubles would be ended speedily and though i could perhaps bear to die i could not bear to look upon my fate as it approached  so i must have lain for hours continually beaten to and fro upon the billows now and again wetted with flying sprays and never ceasing to expect death at the next plunge gradually weariness grew upon me a numbness an occasional stupor fell upon my mind even in the midst of my terrors until sleep at last supervened and in my seatossed coracle i lay and dreamed of home and the old admiral benbow       chapter xxiv    the cruise of the coracle   it was broad day when i awoke and found myself tossing at the southwest end of treasure island the sun was up but was still hid from me behind the great bulk of the spyglass which on this side descended almost to the sea in formidable cliffs  haulbowline head and mizzenmast hill were at my elbow the hill bare and dark the head bound with cliffs forty or fifty feet high and fringed with great masses of fallen rock i was scarce a quarter of a mile to seaward and it was my first thought to paddle in and land  that notion was soon given over among the fallen rocks the breakers spouted and bellowed loud reverberations heavy sprays flying and falling succeeded one another from second to second and i saw myself if i ventured nearer dashed to death upon the rough shore or spending my strength in vain to scale the beetling crags  nor was that all for crawling together on flat tables of rock or letting themselves drop into the sea with loud reports i beheld huge slimy monsterssoft snails as it were of incredible bignesstwo or three score of them together making the rocks to echo with their barkings  i have understood since that they were sealions and entirely harmless but the look of them added to the difficulty of the shore and the high running of the surf was more than enough to disgust me of that landing place i felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront such perils  in the meantime i had a better chance as i supposed before me north of haulbowline head the land runs in a long way leaving at low tide a long stretch of yellow sand to the north of that again there comes another capecape of the woods as it was marked upon the chartburied in tall green pines which descended to the margin of the sea  i remembered what silver had said about the current that sets northward along the whole west coast of treasure island and seeing from my position that i was already under its influence i preferred to leave haulbowline head behind me and reserve my strength for an attempt to land upon the kindlierlooking cape of the woods  there was a great smooth swell upon the sea the wind blowing steady and gentle from the south there was no contrariety between that and the current and the billows rose and fell unbroken  had it been otherwise i must long ago have perished but as it was it is surprising how easily and securely my little and light boat could ride often as i still lay at the bottom and kept no more than an eye above the gunwale i would see a big blue summit heaving close above me yet the coracle would but bounce a little dance as if on springs and subside on the other side into the trough as lightly as a bird  i began after a little to grow very bold and sat up to try my skill at paddling but even a small change in the disposition of the weight will produce violent changes in the behaviour of a coracle and i had hardly moved before the boat giving up at once her gentle dancing movement ran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made me giddy and struck her nose with a spout of spray deep into the side of the next wave  i was drenched and terrified and fell instantly back into my old position whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and led me as softly as before among the billows it was plain she was not to be interfered with and at that rate since i could in no way influence her course what hope had i left of reaching land  i began to be horribly frightened but i kept my head for all that first moving with all care i gradually baled out the coracle with my seacap then getting my eye once more above the gunwale i set myself to study how it was she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers  i found each wave instead of the big smooth glossy mountain it looks from the shore or from a vessels deck was for all the world like any range of hills on the dry land full of peaks and smooth places and valleys the coracle left to herself turning from side to side threaded so to speak her way through these lower parts and avoided the steep slopes and higher toppling summits of the wave  well now thought i to myself it is plain i must lie where i am and not disturb the balance but it is plain also that i can put the paddle over the side and from time to time in smooth places give her a shove or two towards land no sooner thought upon than done there i lay on my elbows in the most trying attitude and every now and again gave a weak stroke or two to turn her head to shore  it was very tiring and slow work yet i did visibly gain ground and as we drew near the cape of the woods though i saw i must infallibly miss that point i had still made some hundred yards of easting i was indeed close in i could see the cool green treetops swaying together in the breeze and i felt sure i should make the next promontory without fail  it was high time for i now began to be tortured with thirst the glow of the sun from above its thousandfold reflection from the waves the seawater that fell and dried upon me caking my very lips with salt combined to make my throat burn and my brain ache the sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing but the current had soon carried me past the point and as the next reach of sea opened out i beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts  right in front of me not half a mile away i beheld the hispaniola under sail i made sure of course that i should be taken but i was so distressed for want of water that i scarce knew whether to be glad or sorry at the thought and long before i had come to a conclusion surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and i could do nothing but stare and wonder  the hispaniola was under her mainsail and two jibs and the beautiful white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver when i first sighted her all her sails were drawing she was lying a course about northwest and i presumed the men on board were going round the island on their way back to the anchorage presently she began to fetch more and more to the westward so that i thought they had sighted me and were going about in chase at last however she fell right into the winds eye was taken dead aback and stood there a while helpless with her sails shivering  clumsy fellows said i they must still be drunk as owls and i thought how captain smollett would have set them skipping  meanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon another tack sailed swiftly for a minute or so and brought up once more dead in the winds eye again and again was this repeated to and fro up and down north south east and west the hispaniola sailed by swoops and dashes and at each repetition ended as she had begun with idlyflapping canvas it became plain to me that nobody was steering and if so where were the men either they were dead drunk or had deserted her i thought and perhaps if i could get on board i might return the vessel to her captain  the current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate as for the latters sailing it was so wild and intermittent and she hung each time so long in irons that she certainly gained nothing if she did not even lose if only i dared to sit up and paddle i made sure that i could overhaul her the scheme had an air of adventure that inspired me and the thought of the waterbreaker beside the forecompanion doubled my growing courage  up i got was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray but this time stuck to my purpose and set myself with all my strength and caution to paddle after the unsteered hispaniola once i shipped a sea so heavy that i had to stop and bale with my heart fluttering like a bird but gradually i got into the way of the thing and guided my coracle among the waves with only now and then a blow upon her bows and a dash of foam in my face  i was now gaining rapidly on the schooner i could see the brass glisten on the tiller as it banged about and still no soul appeared upon her decks i could not choose but suppose she was deserted if not the men were lying drunk below where i might batten them down perhaps and do what i chose with the ship  for some time she had been doing the worst thing possible for mestanding still she headed nearly due south yawing of course all the time each time she fell off her sails partly filled and these brought her in a moment right to the wind again i have said this was the worst thing possible for me for helpless as she looked in this situation with the canvas cracking like cannon and the blocks trundling and banging on the deck she still continued to run away from me not only with the speed of the current but by the whole amount of her leeway which was naturally great  but now at last i had my chance the breeze fell for some seconds very low and the current gradually turning her the hispaniola revolved slowly round her centre and at last presented me her stern with the cabin window still gaping open and the lamp over the table still burning on into the day the mainsail hung drooped like a banner she was stockstill but for the current  for the last little while i had even lost but now redoubling my efforts i began once more to overhaul the chase  i was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap she filled on the port tack and was off again stooping and skimming like a swallow  my first impulse was one of despair but my second was towards joy round she came till she was broadside on to meround still till she had covered a half and then twothirds and then threequarters of the distance that separated us i could see the waves boiling white under her forefoot immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the coracle  and then of a sudden i began to comprehend i had scarce time to thinkscarce time to act and save myself i was on the summit of one swell when the schooner came stooping over the next the bowsprit was over my head i sprang to my feet and leaped stamping the coracle under water with one hand i caught the jibboom while my foot was lodged between the stay and the brace and as i still clung there panting a dull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the coracle and that i was left without retreat on the hispaniola       chapter xxv    i strike the jolly roger   i had scarce gained a position on the bowsprit when the flying jib flapped and filled upon the other tack with a report like a gun the schooner trembled to her keel under the reverse but next moment the other sails still drawing the jib flapped back again and hung idle  this had nearly tossed me off into the sea and now i lost no time crawled back along the bowsprit and tumbled headforemost on the deck  i was on the lee side of the forecastle and the mainsail which was still drawing concealed from me a certain portion of the afterdeck not a soul was to be seen the planks which had not been swabbed since the mutiny bore the print of many feet and an empty bottle broken by the neck tumbled to and fro like a live thing in the scuppers  suddenly the hispaniola came right into the wind the jibs behind me cracked aloud the rudder slammedto the whole ship gave a sickening heave and shudder and at the same moment the mainboom swung inboard the sheet groaning in the blocks and showed me the lee afterdeck  there were the two watchmen sure enough redcap on his back as stiff as a handspike with his arms stretched out like those of a crucifix and his teeth showing through his open lips israel hands propped against the bulwarks his chin on his chest his hands lying open before him on the deck his face as white under its tan as a tallowcandle  for a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse the sails filling now on one tack now on another and the boom swinging to and fro till the mast groaned aloud under the strain now and again too there would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark and a heavy blow of the ships bows against the swell so much heavier weather was made of it by this great rigged ship than by my homemade lopsided coracle now gone to the bottom of the sea  at every jump of the schooner redcap slipped to and fro butwhat was ghastly to beholdneither his attitude nor his fixed teethdisclosing grin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage at every jump too hands appeared still more to sink into himself and settle down upon the deck his feet sliding ever the farther out and the whole body canting towards the stern so that his face became little by little hid from me and at last i could see nothing beyond his ear and the frayed ringlet of one whisker  at the same time i observed around both of them splashes of dark blood upon the planks and began to feel sure that they had killed each other in their drunken wrath  while i was thus looking and wondering in a calm moment when the ship was still israel hands turned partly round and with a low moan writhed himself back to the position in which i had seen him first the moan which told of pain and deadly weakness and the way in which his jaw hung open went right to my heart but when i remembered the talk i had overheard from the applebarrel all pity left me  i walked aft until i reached the mainmast  come aboard mr hands i said ironically  he rolled his eyes round heavily but he was too far gone to express surprise all he could do was to utter one word brandy  it occurred to me there was no time to lose and dodging the boom as it once more lurched across the deck i slipped aft and down the companionstairs into the cabin  it was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy all the lockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart the floor was thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after wading in the marshes round their camp the bulkheads all painted in clear white and beaded round with gilt bore a pattern of dirty hands dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of the ship one of the doctors medical books lay open on the table half of the leaves gutted out i suppose for pipelights in the midst of all this the lamp still cast a smoky glow obscure and brown as umber  i went into the cellar all the barrels were gone and of the bottles a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away certainly since the mutiny began not a man of them could ever have been sober  foraging about i found a bottle with some brandy left for hands and for myself i routed out some biscuit some pickled fruits a great bunch of raisins and a piece of cheese with these i came on deck put down my own stock behind the rudderhead and well out of the coxswains reach went forward to the waterbreaker and had a good deep drink of water and then and not till then gave hands the brandy  he must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his mouth  ay said he by thunder but i wanted some o that  i had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat  much hurt i asked him  he grunted or rather i might say he barked  if that doctor was aboard he said id be right enough in a couple of turns but i dont have no manner of luck you see and thats whats the matter with meas for that swab hes good and dead he is he added indicating the man with the red cap he warnt no seaman anyhowand where mought you have come from  well said i ive come aboard to take possession of this ship mr hands and youll please regard me as your captain until further notice  he looked at me sourly enough but said nothing some of the colour had come back into his cheeks though he still looked very sick and still continued to slip out and settle down as the ship banged about  by the bye i continued i cant have these colours mr hands and by your leave ill strike em better none than these  and again dodging the boom i ran to the colour lines handed down their cursed black flag and chucked it overboard  god save the king said i waving my cap and theres an end to captain silver  he watched me keenly and slyly his chin all the while on his breast  i reckon he said at lasti reckon capn hawkins youll kind of want to get ashore now spose we talks  why yes says i with all my heart mr hands say on and i went back to my meal with a good appetite  this man he began nodding feebly at the corpseobrien were his namea rank irelanderthis man and me got the canvas on her meaning for to sail her back well hes dead now he isas dead as bilge and whos to sail this ship i dont see without i gives you a hint you aint that man as fars i can tell now look here you gives me food and drink and a old scarf or ankercher to tie my wound up you do and ill tell you how to sail her and thats about square all round i take it  ill tell you one thing says i im not going back to captain kidds anchorage i mean to get into north inlet and beach her quietly there  to be sure you did he cried why i aint sich an infernal lubber after all i can see cant i ive tried my fling i have and ive lost and its you has the wind of me north inlet why i havent no chice not i id help you sail her up to execution dock by thunder so i would  well as it seemed to me there was some sense in this we struck our bargain on the spot in three minutes i had the hispaniola sailing easily before the wind along the coast of treasure island with good hopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again as far as north inlet before high water when we might beach her safely and wait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land  then i lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest where i got a soft silk handkerchief of my mothers with this and with my aid hands bound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh and after he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy he began to pick up visibly sat straighter up spoke louder and clearer and looked in every way another man  the breeze served us admirably we skimmed before it like a bird the coast of the island flashing by and the view changing every minute soon we were past the high lands and bowling beside low sandy country sparsely dotted with dwarf pines and soon we were beyond that again and had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on the north  i was greatly elated with my new command and pleased with the bright sunshiny weather and these different prospects of the coast i had now plenty of water and good things to eat and my conscience which had smitten me hard for my desertion was quieted by the great conquest i had made i should i think have had nothing left me to desire but for the eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deck and the odd smile that appeared continually on his face it was a smile that had in it something both of pain and weaknessa haggard old mans smile but there was besides that a grain of derision a shadow of treachery in his expression as he craftily watched and watched and watched me at my work       chapter xxvi    israel hands   the wind serving us to a desire now hauled into the west we could run so much the easier from the northeast corner of the island to the mouth of the north inlet only as we had no power to anchor and dared not beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther time hung on our hands the coxswain told me how to lay the ship to after a good many trials i succeeded and we both sat in silence over another meal  capn said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile heres my old shipmate obrien spose you was to heave him overboard i aint particlar as a rule and i dont take no blame for settling his hash but i dont reckon him ornamental now do you  im not strong enough and i dont like the job and there he lies for me said i  this heres an unlucky shipthis hispaniola jim he went on blinking theres a power of men have been killed in this hispaniolaa sight o poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to bristol i never seen sich dirty luck not i there was this here obrien nowhes dead aint he well now im no scholar and youre a lad as can read and figure and to put it straight do you take it as a dead man is dead for good or do he come alive again  you can kill the body mr hands but not the spirit you must know that already i replied obrien there is in another world and maybe watching us  ah says he well thats unfortnateappears as if killing parties was a waste of time howsomever sperrits dont reckon for much by what ive seen ill chance it with the sperrits jim and now youve spoke up free and ill take it kind if youd step down into that there cabin and get me awell ashiver my timbers i cant hit the name ont well you get me a bottle of wine jimthis here brandys too strong for my head  now the coxswains hesitation seemed to be unnatural and as for the notion of his preferring wine to brandy i entirely disbelieved it the whole story was a pretext he wanted me to leave the deckso much was plain but with what purpose i could in no way imagine his eyes never met mine they kept wandering to and fro up and down now with a look to the sky now with a flitting glance upon the dead obrien all the time he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty embarrassed manner so that a child could have told that he was bent on some deception i was prompt with my answer however for i saw where my advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid i could easily conceal my suspicions to the end  some wine i said far better will you have white or red  well i reckon its about the blessed same to me shipmate he replied so its strong and plenty of it whats the odds  all right i answered ill bring you port mr hands but ill have to dig for it  with that i scuttled down the companion with all the noise i could slipped off my shoes ran quietly along the sparred gallery mounted the forecastle ladder and popped my head out of the forecompanion i knew he would not expect to see me there yet i took every precaution possible and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true  he had risen from his position to his hands and knees and though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he movedfor i could hear him stifle a groanyet it was at a good rattling rate that he trailed himself across the deck in half a minute he had reached the port scuppers and picked out of a coil of rope a long knife or rather a short dirk discoloured to the hilt with blood he looked upon it for a moment thrusting forth his underjaw tried the point upon his hand and then hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket trundled back again into his old place against the bulwark  this was all that i required to know israel could move about he was now armed and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me it was plain that i was meant to be the victim what he would do afterwardswhether he would try to crawl right across the island from north inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire long tom trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him was of course more than i could say  yet i felt sure that i could trust him in one point since in that our interests jumped together and that was in the disposition of the schooner we both desired to have her stranded safe enough in a sheltered place and so that when the time came she could be got off again with as little labour and danger as might be and until that was done i considered that my life would certainly be spared  while i was thus turning the business over in my mind i had not been idle with my body i had stolen back to the cabin slipped once more into my shoes and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine and now with this for an excuse i made my reappearance on the deck  hands lay as i had left him all fallen together in a bundle and with his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light he looked up however at my coming knocked the neck off the bottle like a man who had done the same thing often and took a good swig with his favourite toast of heres luck then he lay quiet for a little and then pulling out a stick of tobacco begged me to cut him a quid  cut me a junk o that says he for i havent no knife and hardly strength enough so be as i had ah jim jim i reckon ive missed stays cut me a quid asll likely be the last lad for im for my long home and no mistake  well said i ill cut you some tobacco but if i was you and thought myself so badly i would go to my prayers like a christian man  why said he now you tell me why  why i cried you were asking me just now about the dead youve broken your trust youve lived in sin and lies and blood theres a man you killed lying at your feet this moment and you ask me why for gods mercy mr hands thats why  i spoke with a little heat thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden in his pocket and designed in his ill thoughts to end me with he for his part took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most unusual solemnity  for thirty years he said ive sailed the seas and seen good and bad better and worse fair weather and foul provisions running out knives going and what not well now i tell you i never seen good come o goodness yet him as strikes first is my fancy dead men dont bite thems my viewsamen so be it and now you look here he added suddenly changing his tone weve had about enough of this foolery the tides made good enough by now you just take my orders capn hawkins and well sail slap in and be done with it  all told we had scarce two miles to run but the navigation was delicate the entrance to this northern anchorage was not only narrow and shoal but lay east and west so that the schooner must be nicely handled to be got in i think i was a good prompt subaltern and i am very sure that hands was an excellent pilot for we went about and about and dodged in shaving the banks with a certainty and a neatness that were a pleasure to behold  scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us the shores of north inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern anchorage but the space was longer and narrower and more like what in truth it was the estuary of a river right before us at the southern end we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation it had been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to the injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of dripping seaweed and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and now flourished thick with flowers it was a sad sight but it showed us that the anchorage was calm  now said hands look there theres a pet bit for to beach a ship in fine flat sand never a catspaw trees all around of it and flowers ablowing like a garding on that old ship  and once beached i inquired how shall we get her off again  why so he replied you take a line ashore there on the other side at low water take a turn about one o them big pines bring it back take a turn around the capstan and lieto for the tide come high water all hands take a pull upon the line and off she comes as sweet as natur and now boy you stand by were near the bit now and shes too much way on her starboard a littlesosteadystarboardlarboard a littlesteadysteady  so he issued his commands which i breathlessly obeyed till all of a sudden he cried now my hearty luff and i put the helm hard up and the hispaniola swung round rapidly and ran stem on for the lowwooded shore  the excitement of these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered with the watch i had kept hitherto sharply enough upon the coxswain even then i was still so much interested waiting for the ship to touch that i had quite forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood craning over the starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide before the bows i might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a sudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head perhaps i had heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye perhaps it was an instinct like a cats but sure enough when i looked round there was hands already halfway towards me with the dirk in his right hand  we must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met but while mine was the shrill cry of terror his was a roar of fury like a charging bulls at the same instant he threw himself forward and i leapt sideways towards the bows as i did so i left hold of the tiller which sprang sharp to leeward and i think this saved my life for it struck hands across the chest and stopped him for the moment dead  before he could recover i was safe out of the corner where he had me trapped with all the deck to dodge about just forward of the mainmast i stopped drew a pistol from my pocket took a cool aim though he had already turned and was once more coming directly after me and drew the trigger the hammer fell but there followed neither flash nor sound the priming was useless with seawater i cursed myself for my neglect why had not i long before reprimed and reloaded my only weapons then i should not have been as now a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher  wounded as he was it was wonderful how fast he could move his grizzled hair tumbling over his face and his face itself as red as a red ensign with his haste and fury i had no time to try my other pistol nor indeed much inclination for i was sure it would be useless one thing i saw plainly i must not simply retreat before him or he would speedily hold me boxed into the bows as a moment since he had so nearly boxed me in the stern once so caught and nine or ten inches of the bloodstained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity i placed my palms against the mainmast which was of a goodish bigness and waited every nerve upon the stretch  seeing that i meant to dodge he also paused and a moment or two passed in feints on his part and corresponding movements upon mine it was such a game as i had often played at home about the rocks of black hill cove but never before you may be sure with such a wildly beating heart as now still as i say it was a boys game and i thought i could hold my own at it against an elderly seaman with a wounded thigh indeed my courage had begun to rise so high that i allowed myself a few darting thoughts on what would be the end of the affair and while i saw certainly that i could spin it out for long i saw no hope of any ultimate escape  well while things stood thus suddenly the hispaniola struck staggered ground for an instant in the sand and then swift as a blow canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle of fortyfive degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into the scupper holes and lay in a pool between the deck and bulwark  we were both of us capsized in a second and both of us rolled almost together into the scuppers the dead redcap with his arms still spread out tumbling stiffly after us so near were we indeed that my head came against the coxswains foot with a crack that made my teeth rattle blow and all i was the first afoot again for hands had got involved with the dead body the sudden canting of the ship had made the deck no place for running on i had to find some new way of escape and that upon the instant for my foe was almost touching me quick as thought i sprang into the mizzen shrouds rattled up hand over hand and did not draw breath till i was seated on the crosstrees  i had been saved by being prompt the dirk had struck not half a foot below me as i pursued my upward flight and there stood israel hands with his mouth open and his face upturned to mine a perfect statue of surprise and disappointment  now that i had a moment to myself i lost no time in changing the priming of my pistol and then having one ready for service and to make assurance doubly sure i proceeded to draw the load of the other and recharge it afresh from the beginning  my new employment struck hands all of a heap he began to see the dice going against him and after an obvious hesitation he also hauled himself heavily into the shrouds and with the dirk in his teeth began slowly and painfully to mount it cost him no end of time and groans to haul his wounded leg behind him and i had quietly finished my arrangements before he was much more than a third of the way up then with a pistol in either hand i addressed him  one more step mr hands said i and ill blow your brains out dead men dont bite you know i added with a chuckle  he stopped instantly i could see by the working of his face that he was trying to think and the process was so slow and laborious that in my newfound security i laughed aloud at last with a swallow or two he spoke his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity in order to speak he had to take the dagger from his mouth but in all else he remained unmoved  jim says he i reckon were fouled you and me and well have to sign articles id have had you but for that there lurch but i dont have no luck not i and i reckon ill have to strike which comes hard you see for a master mariner to a ships younker like you jim  i was drinking in his words and smiling away as conceited as a cock upon a wall when all in a breath back went his right hand over his shoulder something sang like an arrow through the air i felt a blow and then a sharp pang and there i was pinned by the shoulder to the mast in the horrid pain and surprise of the momenti scarce can say it was by my own volition and i am sure it was without a conscious aimboth my pistols went off and both escaped out of my hands they did not fall alone with a choked cry the coxswain loosed his grasp upon the shrouds and plunged head first into the water       chapter xxvii    pieces of eight   owing to the cant of the vessel the masts hung far out over the water and from my perch on the crosstrees i had nothing below me but the surface of the bay hands who was not so far up was in consequence near to the ship and fell between me and the bulwarks he rose once to the surface in a lather of foam and blood and then sank again for good as the water settled i could see him lying huddled together on the clean bright sand in the shadow of the vessels sides a fish or two whipped past his body sometimes by the quivering of the water he appeared to move a little as if he were trying to rise but he was dead enough for all that being both shot and drowned and was food for fish in the very place where he had designed my slaughter  i was no sooner certain of this than i began to feel sick faint and terrified the hot blood was running over my back and chest the dirk where it had pinned my shoulder to the mast seemed to burn like a hot iron yet it was not so much these real sufferings that distressed me for these it seemed to me i could bear without a murmur it was the horror i had upon my mind of falling from the crosstrees into that still green water beside the body of the coxswain  i clung with both hands till my nails ached and i shut my eyes as if to cover up the peril gradually my mind came back again my pulses quieted down to a more natural time and i was once more in possession of myself  it was my first thought to pluck forth the dirk but either it stuck too hard or my nerve failed me and i desisted with a violent shudder oddly enough that very shudder did the business the knife in fact had come the nearest in the world to missing me altogether it held me by a mere pinch of skin and this the shudder tore away the blood ran down the faster to be sure but i was my own master again and only tacked to the mast by my coat and shirt  these last i broke through with a sudden jerk and then regained the deck by the starboard shrouds for nothing in the world would i have again ventured shaken as i was upon the overhanging port shrouds from which israel had so lately fallen  i went below and did what i could for my wound it pained me a good deal and still bled freely but it was neither deep nor dangerous nor did it greatly gall me when i used my arm then i looked around me and as the ship was now in a sense my own i began to think of clearing it from its last passengerthe dead man obrien  he had pitched as i have said against the bulwarks where he lay like some horrible ungainly sort of puppet lifesize indeed but how different from lifes colour or lifes comeliness in that position i could easily have my way with him and as the habit of tragical adventures had worn off almost all my terror for the dead i took him by the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with one good heave tumbled him overboard he went in with a sounding plunge the red cap came off and remained floating on the surface and as soon as the splash subsided i could see him and israel lying side by side both wavering with the tremulous movement of the water obrien though still quite a young man was very bald there he lay with that bald head across the knees of the man who had killed him and the quick fishes steering to and fro over both  i was now alone upon the ship the tide had just turned the sun was within so few degrees of setting that already the shadow of the pines upon the western shore began to reach right across the anchorage and fall in patterns on the deck the evening breeze had sprung up and though it was well warded off by the hill with the two peaks upon the east the cordage had begun to sing a little softly to itself and the idle sails to rattle to and fro  i began to see a danger to the ship the jibs i speedily doused and brought tumbling to the deck but the mainsail was a harder matter of course when the schooner canted over the boom had swung outboard and the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water i thought this made it still more dangerous yet the strain was so heavy that i half feared to meddle at last i got my knife and cut the halyards the peak dropped instantly a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon the water and since pull as i liked i could not budge the downhaul that was the extent of what i could accomplish for the rest the hispaniola must trust to luck like myself  by this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadowthe last rays i remember falling through a glade of the wood and shining bright as jewels on the flowery mantle of the wreck it began to be chill the tide was rapidly fleeting seaward the schooner settling more and more on her beamends  i scrambled forward and looked over it seemed shallow enough and holding the cut hawser in both hands for a last security i let myself drop softly overboard the water scarcely reached my waist the sand was firm and covered with ripplemarks and i waded ashore in great spirits leaving the hispaniola on her side with her mainsail trailing wide upon the surface of the bay about the same time the sun went fairly down and the breeze whistled low in the dusk among the tossing pines  at least and at last i was off the sea nor had i returned thence emptyhanded there lay the schooner clear at last from buccaneers and ready for our own men to board and get to sea again i had nothing nearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and boast of my achievements possibly i might be blamed a bit for my truantry but the recapture of the hispaniola was a clenching answer and i hoped that even captain smollett would confess i had not lost my time  so thinking and in famous spirits i began to set my face homeward for the blockhouse and my companions i remembered that the most easterly of the rivers which drain into captain kidds anchorage ran from the twopeaked hill upon my left and i bent my course in that direction that i might pass the stream while it was small the wood was pretty open and keeping along the lower spurs i had soon turned the corner of that hill and not long after waded to the midcalf across the watercourse  this brought me near to where i had encountered ben gunn the maroon and i walked more circumspectly keeping an eye on every side the dusk had come nigh hand completely and as i opened out the cleft between the two peaks i became aware of a wavering glow against the sky where as i judged the man of the island was cooking his supper before a roaring fire and yet i wondered in my heart that he should show himself so careless for if i could see this radiance might it not reach the eyes of silver himself where he camped upon the shore among the marshes  gradually the night fell blacker it was all i could do to guide myself even roughly towards my destination the double hill behind me and the spyglass on my right hand loomed faint and fainter the stars were few and pale and in the low ground where i wandered i kept tripping among bushes and rolling into sandy pits  suddenly a kind of brightness fell about me i looked up a pale glimmer of moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the spyglass and soon after i saw something broad and silvery moving low down behind the trees and knew the moon had risen  with this to help me i passed rapidly over what remained to me of my journey and sometimes walking sometimes running impatiently drew near to the stockade yet as i began to thread the grove that lies before it i was not so thoughtless but that i slackened my pace and went a trifle warily it would have been a poor end of my adventures to get shot down by my own party in mistake  the moon was climbing higher and higher its light began to fall here and there in masses through the more open districts of the wood and right in front of me a glow of a different colour appeared among the trees it was red and hot and now and again it was a little darkenedas it were the embers of a bonfire smouldering  for the life of me i could not think what it might be  at last i came right down upon the borders of the clearing the western end was already steeped in moonshine the rest and the blockhouse itself still lay in a black shadow chequered with long silvery streaks of light on the other side of the house an immense fire had burned itself into clear embers and shed a steady red reverberation contrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon there was not a soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breezes  i stopped with much wonder in my heart and perhaps a little terror also it had not been our way to build great fires we were indeed by the captains orders somewhat niggardly of firewood and i began to fear that something had gone wrong while i was absent  i stole round by the eastern end keeping close in shadow and at a convenient place where the darkness was thickest crossed the palisade  to make assurance surer i got upon my hands and knees and crawled without a sound towards the corner of the house as i drew nearer my heart was suddenly and greatly lightened it is not a pleasant noise in itself and i have often complained of it at other times but just then it was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud and peaceful in their sleep the seacry of the watch that beautiful alls well never fell more reassuringly on my ear  in the meantime there was no doubt of one thing they kept an infamous bad watch if it had been silver and his lads that were now creeping in on them not a soul would have seen daybreak that was what it was thought i to have the captain wounded and again i blamed myself sharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to mount guard  by this time i had got to the door and stood up all was dark within so that i could distinguish nothing by the eye as for sounds there was the steady drone of the snorers and a small occasional noise a flickering or pecking that i could in no way account for  with my arms before me i walked steadily in i should lie down in my own place i thought with a silent chuckle and enjoy their faces when they found me in the morning  my foot struck something yieldingit was a sleepers leg and he turned and groaned but without awaking  and then all of a sudden a shrill voice broke forth out of the darkness  pieces of eight pieces of eight pieces of eight pieces of eight pieces of eight and so forth without pause or change like the clacking of a tiny mill  silvers green parrot captain flint it was she whom i had heard pecking at a piece of bark it was she keeping better watch than any human being who thus announced my arrival with her wearisome refrain  i had no time left me to recover at the sharp clipping tone of the parrot the sleepers awoke and sprang up and with a mighty oath the voice of silver cried  who goes  i turned to run struck violently against one person recoiled and ran full into the arms of a second who for his part closed upon and held me tight  bring a torch dick said silver when my capture was thus assured  and one of the men left the loghouse and presently returned with a lighted brand       part vi    captain silver       chapter xxviii    in the enemys camp   the red glare of the torch lighting up the interior of the blockhouse showed me the worst of my apprehensions realised the pirates were in possession of the house and stores there was the cask of cognac there were the pork and bread as before and what tenfold increased my horror not a sign of any prisoner i could only judge that all had perished and my heart smote me sorely that i had not been there to perish with them  there were six of the buccaneers all told not another man was left alive five of them were on their feet flushed and swollen suddenly called out of the first sleep of drunkenness the sixth had only risen upon his elbow he was deadly pale and the bloodstained bandage round his head told that he had recently been wounded and still more recently dressed i remembered the man who had been shot and had run back among the woods in the great attack and doubted not that this was he  the parrot sat preening her plumage on long johns shoulder he himself i thought looked somewhat paler and more stern than i was used to he still wore the fine broadcloth suit in which he had fulfilled his mission but it was bitterly the worse for wear daubed with clay and torn with the sharp briers of the wood  so said he heres jim hawkins shiver my timbers dropped in like eh well come i take that friendly  and thereupon he sat down across the brandy cask and began to fill a pipe  give me a loan of the link dick said he and then when he had a good light thatll do lad he added stick the glim in the woodheap and you gentlemen bring yourselves toyou neednt stand up for mr hawkins hell excuse you you may lay to that and so jimstopping the tobaccohere you were and quite a pleasant surprise for poor old john i see you were smart when first i set my eyes on you but this here gets away from me clean it do  to all this as may be well supposed i made no answer they had set me with my back against the wall and i stood there looking silver in the face pluckily enough i hope to all outward appearance but with black despair in my heart  silver took a whiff or two of his pipe with great composure and then ran on again  now you see jim so be as you are here says he ill give you a piece of my mind ive always liked you i have for a lad of spirit and the picter of my own self when i was young and handsome i always wanted you to jine and take your share and die a gentleman and now my cock youve got to capn smolletts a fine seaman as ill own up to

long of the whole story is about here you cant go back to your own lot for they wont have you and without you start a third ships company all by yourself which might be lonely youll have to jine with capn silver  so far so good my friends then were still alive and though i partly believed the truth of silvers statement that the cabin party were incensed at me for my desertion i was more relieved than distressed by what i heard  i dont say nothing as to your being in our hands continued silver though there you are and you may lay to it im all for argyment i never seen good come out o threatening if you like the service well youll jine and if you dont jim why youre free to answer nofree and welcome shipmate and if fairer can be said by mortal seaman shiver my sides  am i to answer then i asked with a very tremulous voice through all this sneering talk i was made to feel the threat of death that overhung me and my cheeks burned and my heart beat painfully in my breast  lad said silver no ones apressing of you take your bearings none of us wont hurry you mate time goes so pleasant in your company you see  well says i growing a bit bolder if im to choose i declare i have a right to know whats what and why youre here and where my friends are  wots wot repeated one of the buccaneers in a deep growl ah hed be a lucky one as knowed that  youll perhaps batten down your hatches till youre spoke to my friend cried silver truculently to this speaker and then in his first gracious tones he replied to me yesterday morning mr hawkins said he in the dogwatch down came dr livesey with a flag of truce says he capn silver youre sold out ships gone well maybe wed been taking a glass and a song to help it round i wont say no leastways none of us had looked out we looked

i and here we are stores brandy blockhouse the firewood you was thoughtful enough to cut and in a manner of speaking the whole blessed boat from crosstrees to kelson as for them theyve tramped i dont

i asked  well its all that youre to hear my son returned silver  and now i am to choose  and now you are to choose and you may lay to that said silver  well said i i am not such a fool but i know pretty well what i have to look for let the worst come to the worst its little i care ive seen too many die since i fell in with you but theres a thing or two i have to tell you i said and by this time i was quite excited and the first is this here you are in a bad way ship lost treasure lost men lost your whole business gone to wreck and if you want to know who did itit was i i was in the applebarrel the night we sighted land and i heard you john and you dick johnson and hands who is now at the bottom of the sea and told every word you said before the hour was out and as for the schooner it was i who cut her cable and it was i that killed the men you had aboard of her and it was i who brought her where youll never see her more not one of you the laughs on my side ive had the top of this business from the first i no more fear you than i fear a fly kill me if you please or spare me but one thing ill say and no more if you spare me bygones are bygones and when you fellows are in court for piracy ill save you all i can it is for you to choose kill another and do yourselves no good or spare me and keep a witness to save you from the gallows  i stopped for i tell you i was out of breath and to my wonder not a man of them moved but all sat staring at me like as many sheep and while they were still staring i broke out again  and now mr silver i said i believe youre the best man here and if things go the worst ill take it kind of you to let the doctor know the way i took it  ill bear it in mind said silver with an accent so curious that i could not for the life of me decide whether he were laughing at my request or had been favourably affected by my courage  ill put one to that cried the old mahoganyfaced seamanmorgan by namewhom i had seen in long johns publichouse upon the quays of bristol it was him that knowed black dog  well and see here added the seacook ill put another again to that by thunder for it was this same boy that faked the chart from billy bones first and last weve split upon jim hawkins  then here goes said morgan with an oath  and he sprang up drawing his knife as if he had been twenty  avast there cried silver who are you tom morgan maybe you thought you was capn here perhaps by the powers but ill teach you better cross me and youll go where many a good mans gone before you first and last these thirty year backsome to the yardarm shiver my sides and some by the board and all to feed the fishes theres never a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day aterwards tom morgan you may lay to that  morgan paused but a hoarse murmur rose from the others  toms right said one  i stood hazing long enough from one added another ill be hanged if ill be hazed by you john silver  did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with me roared silver bending far forward from his position on the keg with his pipe still glowing in his right hand put a name on what youre at you aint dumb i reckon him that wants shall get it have i lived this many years and a son of a rumpuncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the latter end of it you know the way youre all gentlemen o fortune by your account well im ready take a cutlass him that dares and ill see the colour of his inside crutch and all before that pipes empty  not a man stirred not a man answered  thats your sort is it he added returning his pipe to his mouth well youre a gay lot to look at anyway not much worth to fight you aint praps you can understand king georges english im capn here by lection im capn here because im the best man by a long seamile you wont fight as gentlemen o fortune should then by thunder youll obey and you may lay to it i like that boy now i never seen a better boy than that hes more a man than any pair of rats of you in this here house and what i say is this let me see him thatll lay a hand on himthats what i say and you may lay to it  there was a long pause after this i stood straight up against the wall my heart still going like a sledgehammer but with a ray of hope now shining in my bosom silver leant back against the wall his arms crossed his pipe in the corner of his mouth as calm as though he had been in church yet his eye kept wandering furtively and he kept the tail of it on his unruly followers they on their part drew gradually together towards the far end of the blockhouse and the low hiss of their whispering sounded in my ear continuously like a stream one after another they would look up and the red light of the torch would fall for a second on their nervous faces but it was not towards me it was towards silver that they turned their eyes  you seem to have a lot to say remarked silver spitting far into the air pipe up and let me hear it or layto  ax your pardon sir returned one of the men youre pretty free with some of the rules maybe youll kindly keep an eye upon the rest this crews dissatisfied this crew dont vally bullying a marlinspike this crew has its rights like other crews ill make so free as that and by your own rules i take it we can talk together i ax your pardon sir acknowledging you to be capting at this present but i claim my right and steps outside for a council  and with an elaborate seasalute this fellow a long illlooking yelloweyed man of fiveandthirty stepped coolly towards the door and disappeared out of the house one after another the rest followed his example each making a salute as he passed each adding some apology according to rules said one focsle council said morgan and so with one remark or another all marched out and left silver and me alone with the torch  the seacook instantly removed his pipe  now look you here jim hawkins he said in a steady whisper that was no more than audible youre within half a plank of death and whats a long sight worse of torture theyre going to throw me off but you mark i stand by you through thick and thin i didnt mean to no not till you spoke up i was about desperate to lose that much blunt and be hanged into the bargain but i see you was the right sort i says to myself you stand by hawkins john and hawkinsll stand by you youre his last card and by the living thunder john hes yours back to back says i you save your witness and hell save your neck  i began dimly to understand  you mean alls lost i asked  ay by gum i do he answered ship gone neck gonethats the size of it once i looked into that bay jim hawkins and seen no schoonerwell im tough but i gave out as for that lot and their council mark me theyre outright fools and cowards ill save your lifeif so be as i canfrom them but see here jimtit for tatyou save long john from swinging  i was bewildered it seemed a thing so hopeless he was askinghe the old buccaneer the ringleader throughout  what i can do that ill do i said  its a bargain cried long john you speak up plucky and by thunder ive a chance  he hobbled to the torch where it stood propped among the firewood and took a fresh light to his pipe  understand me jim he said returning ive a head on my shoulders i have im on squires side now i know youve got that ship safe somewheres how you done it i dont know but safe it is i guess hands and obrien turned soft i never much believed in neither of them now you mark me i ask no questions nor i wont let others i know when a games up i do and i know a lad thats staunch ah you thats youngyou and me might have done a power of good together  he drew some cognac from the cask into a tin cannikin  will you taste messmate he asked and when i had refused well ill take a drain myself jim said he i need a caulker for theres trouble on hand and talking o trouble why did that doctor give me the chart jim  my face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw the needlessness of further questions  ah well he did though said he and theres something under that no doubtsomething surely under that jimbad or good  and he took another swallow of the brandy shaking his great fair head like a man who looks forward to the worst       chapter xxix    the black spot again   the council of the buccaneers had lasted some time when one of them reentered the house and with a repetition of the same salute which had in my eyes an ironical air begged for a moments loan of the torch silver briefly agreed and this emissary retired again leaving us together in the dark  theres a breeze coming jim said silver who had by this time adopted quite a friendly and familiar tone  i turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out the embers of the great fire had so far burned themselves out and now glowed so low and duskily that i understood why these conspirators desired a torch about halfway down the slope to the stockade they were collected in a group one held the light another was on his knees in their midst and i saw the blade of an open knife shine in his hand with varying colours in the moon and torchlight the rest were all somewhat stooping as though watching the manoeuvres of this last i could just make out that he had a book as well as a knife in his hand and was still wondering how anything so incongruous had come in their possession when the kneeling figure rose once more to his feet and the whole party began to move together towards the house  here they come said i and i returned to my former position for it seemed beneath my dignity that they should find me watching them  well let em come ladlet em come said silver cheerily ive still a shot in my locker  the door opened and the five men standing huddled together just inside pushed one of their number forward in any other circumstances it would have been comical to see his slow advance hesitating as he set down each foot but holding his closed right hand in front of him  step up lad cried silver i wont eat you hand it over lubber i know the rules i do i wont hurt a depytation  thus encouraged the buccaneer stepped forth more briskly and having passed something to silver from hand to hand slipped yet more smartly back again to his companions  the seacook looked at what had been given him  the black spot i thought so he observed where might you have got the paper why hillo look here now this aint lucky youve gone and cut this out of a bible what fools cut a bible  ah there said morganthere wot did i say no goodll come o that i said  well youve about fixed it now among you continued silver youll all swing now i reckon what softheaded lubber had a bible  it was dick said one  dick was it then dick can get to prayers said silver hes seen his slice of luck has dick and you may lay to that  but here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in  belay that talk john silver he said this crew has tipped you the black spot in full council as in dooty bound just you turn it over as in dooty bound and see whats wrote there then you can talk  thanky george replied the seacook you always was brisk for business and has the rules by heart george as im pleased to see well what is it anyway ah deposedthats it is it very pretty wrote to be sure like print i swear your hand o write george why you was gettin quite a leadin man in this here crew youll be capn next i shouldnt wonder just oblige me with that torch again will you this pipe dont draw  come now said george you dont fool this crew no more youre a funny man by your account but youre over now and youll maybe step down off that barrel and help vote  i thought you said you knowed the rules returned silver contemptuously leastways if you dont i do and i wait hereand im still your capn mindtill you outs with your grievances and i reply in the meantime your black spot aint worth a biscuit after that well see  oh replied george you dont be under no kind of apprehension were all square we are first youve made a hash of this cruiseyoull be a bold man to say no to that second you let the enemy out o this here trap for nothing why did they want out i dunno but its pretty plain they wanted it third you wouldnt let us go at them upon the march oh we see through you john silver you want to play booty thats whats wrong with you and then fourth theres this here boy  is that all asked silver quietly  enough too retorted george well all swing and sundry for your bungling  well now look here ill answer these four pints one after another ill answer em i made a hash o this cruise did i well now you all know what i wanted and you all know if that had been done that wed a been aboard the hispaniola this night as ever was every man of us alive and fit and full of good plumduff and the treasure in the hold of her by thunder well who crossed me who forced my hand as was the lawful capn who tipped me the black spot the day we landed and began this dance ah its a fine danceim with you thereand looks mighty like a hornpipe in a ropes end at execution dock by london town it does but who done it why it was anderson and hands and you george merry and youre the last above board of that same meddling crew and you have the davy joness insolence to up and stand for capn over meyou that sank the lot of us by the powers but this tops the stiffest yarn to nothing  silver paused and i could see by the faces of george and his late comrades that these words had not been said in vain  thats for number one cried the accused wiping the sweat from his brow for he had been talking with a vehemence that shook the house why i give you my word im sick to speak to you youve neither sense nor memory and i leave it to fancy where your mothers was that let you come to sea sea gentlemen o fortune i reckon tailors is your trade  go on john said morgan speak up to the others  ah the others returned john theyre a nice lot aint they you say this cruise is bungled ah by gum if you could understand how bad its bungled you would see were that near the gibbet that my necks stiff with thinking on it youve seen em maybe hanged in chains birds about em seamen pinting em out as they go down with the tide whos that says one that why thats john silver i knowed him well says another and you can hear the chains ajangle as you go about and reach for the other buoy now thats about where we are every mothers son of us thanks to him and hands and anderson and other ruination fools of you and if you want to know about number four and that boy why shiver my timbers isnt he a hostage are we agoing to waste a hostage no not us he might be our last chance and i shouldnt wonder kill that boy not me mates and number three ah well theres a deal to say to number three maybe you dont count it nothing to have a real college doctor come to see you every dayyou john with your head brokeor you george merry that had the agueshakes upon you not six hours agone and has your eyes the colour of lemonpeel to this same moment on the clock and maybe perhaps you didnt know there was a consort coming either but there is and not so long till then and well see wholl be glad to have a hostage when it comes to that and as for number two and why i made a bargainwell you came crawling on your knees to me to make iton your knees you came you was that downheartedand youd have starved too if i hadntbut thats a trifle you look therethats why  and he cast down upon the floor a paper that i instantly recognisednone other than the chart on yellow paper with the three red crosses that i had found in the oilcloth at the bottom of the captains chest why the doctor had given it to him was more than i could fancy  but if it were inexplicable to me the appearance of the chart was incredible to the surviving mutineers they leaped upon it like cats upon a mouse it went from hand to hand one tearing it from another and by the oaths and the cries and the childish laughter with which they accompanied their examination you would have thought not only they were fingering the very gold but were at sea with it besides in safety  yes said one thats flint sure enough j f and a score below with a clove hitch to it so he done ever  mighty pretty said george but how are we to get away with it and us no ship  silver suddenly sprang up and supporting himself with a hand against the wall now i give you warning george he cried one more word of your sauce and ill call you down and fight you how why how do i know you had ought to tell me thatyou and the rest that lost me my schooner with your interference burn you but not you you cant you haint got the invention of a cockroach but civil you can speak and shall george merry you may lay to that  thats fair enow said the old man morgan  fair i reckon so said the seacook you lost the ship i found the treasure whos the better man at that and now i resign by thunder elect whom you please to be your capn now im done with it  silver they cried barbecue for ever barbecue for capn  so thats the toon is it cried the cook george i reckon youll have to wait another turn friend and lucky for you as im not a revengeful man but that was never my way and now shipmates this black spot taint much good now is it dicks crossed his luck and spoiled his bible and thats about all  itll do to kiss the book on still wont it growled dick who was evidently uneasy at the curse he had brought upon himself  a bible with a bit cut out returned silver derisively not it it dont bind no moren a balladbook  dont it though cried dick with a sort of joy well i reckon thats worth having too  here jimheres a curosity for you said silver and he tossed me the paper  it was a round about the size of a crownpiece one side was blank for it had been the last leaf the other contained a verse or two of revelationthese words among the rest which struck sharply home upon my mind without are dogs and murderers the printed side had been blackened with wood ash which already began to come off and soil my fingers on the blank side had been written with the same material the one word depposed i have that curiosity beside me at this moment but not a trace of writing now remains beyond a single scratch such as a man might make with his thumbnail  that was the end of the nights business soon after with a drink all round we lay down to sleep and the outside of silvers vengeance was to put george merry up for sentinel and threaten him with death if he should prove unfaithful  it was long ere i could close an eye and heaven knows i had matter enough for thought in the man whom i had slain that afternoon in my own most perilous position and above all in the remarkable game that i saw silver now engaged uponkeeping the mutineers together with one hand and grasping with the other after every means possible and impossible to make his peace and save his miserable life he himself slept peacefully and snored aloud yet my heart was sore for him wicked as he was to think on the dark perils that environed and the shameful gibbet that awaited him       chapter xxx    on parole   i was wakenedindeed we were all wakened for i could see even the sentinel shake himself together from where he had fallen against the doorpostby a clear hearty voice hailing us from the margin of the wood  blockhouse ahoy it cried heres the doctor  and the doctor it was although i was glad to hear the sound yet my gladness was not without admixture i remembered with confusion my insubordinate and stealthy conduct and when i saw where it had brought meamong what companions and surrounded by what dangersi felt ashamed to look him in the face  he must have risen in the dark for the day had hardly come and when i ran to a loophole and looked out i saw him standing like silver once before up to the midleg in creeping vapour  you doctor top o the morning to you sir cried silver broad awake and beaming with goodnature in a moment bright and early to be sure and its the early bird as the saying goes that gets the rationsgeorge shake up your timbers son and help dr livesey over the ships side all adoin well your patients wasall well and merry  so he pattered on standing on the hilltop with his crutch under his elbow and one hand upon the side of the loghousequite the old john in voice manner and expression  weve quite a surprise for you too sir he continued weve a little stranger herehe he a noo boarder and lodger sir and looking fit and taut as a fiddle slep like a supercargo he did right alongside of johnstem to stem we was all night  dr livesey was by this time across the stockade and pretty near the cook and i could hear the alteration in his voice as he said  not jim  the very same jim as ever was says silver  the doctor stopped outright although he did not speak and it was some seconds before he seemed able to move on  well well he said at last duty first and pleasure afterwards as you might have said yourself silver let us overhaul these patients of yours  a moment afterwards he had entered the blockhouse and with one grim nod to me proceeded with his work among the sick he seemed under no apprehension though he must have known that his life among these treacherous demons depended on a hair and he rattled on to his patients as if he were paying an ordinary professional visit in a quiet english family his manner i suppose reacted on the men for they behaved to him as if nothing had occurredas if he were still ships doctor and they still faithful hands before the mast  youre doing well my friend he said to the fellow with the bandaged head and if ever any person had a close shave it was you your head must be as hard as ironwell george how goes it youre a pretty colour certainly why your liver man is upside down did you take that medicinedid he take that medicine men  ay ay sir he took it sure enough returned morgan  because you see since i am mutineers doctor or prison doctor as i prefer to call it says dr livesey in his pleasantest way i make it a point of honour not to lose a man for king george god bless him and the gallows  the rogues looked at each other but swallowed the homethrust in silence  dick dont feel well sir said one  dont he replied the doctor well step up here dick and let me see your tongue no i should be surprised if he did the mans tongue is fit to frighten the french another fever  ah there said morgan that comed of spiling bibles  that comedas you call itof being arrant asses retorted the doctor and not having sense enough to know honest air from poison and the dry land from a vile pestiferous slough i think it most probablethough of course its only an opinionthat youll all have the deuce to pay before you get that malaria out of your systems camp in a bog would yousilver im surprised at you youre less a fool than many take you all round but you dont appear to me to have the rudiments of a notion of the rules of health  well he added after he had dosed them round and they had taken his prescriptions with really laughable humility more like charityschool children than bloodguilty mutineers and pirateswell thats done for today and now i should wish to have a talk with that boy please  and he nodded his head in my direction carelessly  george merry was at the door spitting and spluttering over some badtasted medicine but at the first word of the doctors proposal he swung round with a deep flush and cried no and swore  silver struck the barrel with his open hand  silence he roared and looked about him positively like a lion doctor he went on in his usual tones i was athinking of that knowing as how you had a fancy for the boy were all humbly grateful for your kindness and as you see puts faith in you and takes the drugs down like that much grog and i take it ive found a way asll suit allhawkins will you give me your word of honour as a young gentlemanfor a young gentleman you are although poor bornyour word of honour not to slip your cable  i readily gave the pledge required  then doctor said silver you just step outside o that stockade and once youre there ill bring the boy down on the inside and i reckon you can yarn through the spars goodday to you sir and all our dooties to the squire and capn smollett  the explosion of disapproval which nothing but silvers black looks had restrained broke out immediately the doctor had left the house silver was roundly accused of playing doubleof trying to make a separate peace for himselfof sacrificing the interests of his accomplices and victims and in one word of the identical exact thing that he was doing it seemed to me so obvious in this case that i could not imagine how he was to turn their anger but he was twice the man the rest were and his last nights victory had given him a huge preponderance on their minds he called them all the fools and dolts you can imagine said it was necessary i should talk to the doctor fluttered the chart in their faces asked them if they could afford to break the treaty the very day they were bound atreasurehunting  no by thunder he cried its us must break the treaty when the time comes and till then ill gammon that doctor if i have to ile his boots with brandy  and then he bade them get the fire lit and stalked out upon his crutch with his hand on my shoulder leaving them in a disarray and silenced by his volubility rather than convinced  slow lad slow he said they might round upon us in a twinkle of an eye if we was seen to hurry  very deliberately then did we advance across the sand to where the doctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade and as soon as we were within easy speaking distance silver stopped  youll make a note of this here also doctor says he and the boyll tell you how i saved his life and were deposed for it too and you may lay to that doctor when a mans steering as near the wind as meplaying chuckfarthing with the last breath in his body likeyou wouldnt think it too much mayhap to give him one good word youll please bear in mind its not my life only nowits that boys into the bargain and youll speak me fair doctor and give me a bit o hope to go on for the sake of mercy  silver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his friends and the blockhouse his cheeks seemed to have fallen in his voice trembled never was a soul more dead in earnest  why john youre not afraid asked doctor livesey  doctor im no coward no not inot so much and he snapped his fingers if i was i wouldnt say it but ill own up fairly ive the shakes upon me for the gallows youre a good man and a true i never seen a better man and youll not forget what i done good not any more than youll forget the bad i know and i step asidesee hereand leave you and jim alone and youll put that down for me too for its a long stretch is that  so saying he stepped back a little way till he was out of earshot and there sat down upon a treestump and began to whistle spinning round now and again upon his seat so as to command a sight sometimes of me and the doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and fro in the sand between the firewhich they were busy rekindlingand the house from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the breakfast  so jim said the doctor sadly here you are as you have brewed so shall you drink my boy heaven knows i cannot find it in my heart to blame you but this much i will say be it kind or unkind when captain smollett was well you dared not have gone off and when he was ill and couldnt help it by george it was downright cowardly  i will own that i here began to weep doctor i said you might spare me i have blamed myself enough my lifes forfeit anyway and i should have been dead by now if silver hadnt stood for me and doctor believe this i can dieand i daresay i deserve itbut what i fear is torture if they come to torture me  jim the doctor interrupted and his voice was quite changed jim i cant have this whip over and well run for it  doctor said i i passed my word  i know i know he cried we cant help that jim now ill take it on my shoulders holus bolus blame and shame my boy but stay here i cannot let you jump one jump and youre out and well run for it like antelopes  no i replied you know right well you wouldnt do the thing yourself neither you nor squire nor captain and no more will i silver trusted me i passed my word and back i go but doctor you did not let me finish if they come to torture me i might let slip a word of where the ship is for i got the ship part by luck and part by risking and she lies in north inlet on the southern beach and just below high water at halftide she must be high and dry  the ship exclaimed the doctor  rapidly i described to him my adventures and he heard me out in silence  there is a kind of fate in this he observed when i had done every step its you that saves our lives and do you suppose by any chance that we are going to let you lose yours that would be a poor return my boy you found out the plot you found ben gunnthe best deed that ever you did or will do though you live to ninety oh by jupiter and talking of ben gunn why this is the mischief in person silver he cried silverill give you a piece of advice he continued as the cook drew near again dont you be in any great hurry after that treasure  why sir i do my possible which that aint said silver i can only asking your pardon save my life and the boys by seeking for that treasure and you may lay to that  well silver replied the doctor if that is so ill go one step further look out for squalls when you find it  sir said silver as between man and man thats too much and too little what youre after why you left the blockhouse why you given me that there chart i dont know now do i and yet i done your bidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope but no this heres too much if you wont tell me what you mean plain out just say so and ill leave the helm  no said the doctor musingly ive no right to say more its not my secret you see silver or i give you my word id tell it you but ill go as far with you as i dare go and a step beyond for ill have my wig sorted by the captain or im mistaken and first ill give you a bit of hope silver if we both get alive out of this wolftrap ill do my best to save you short of perjury  silvers face was radiant you couldnt say more im sure sir not if you was my mother he cried  well thats my first concession added the doctor my second is a piece of advice keep the boy close beside you and when you need help halloo im off to seek it for you and that itself will show you if i speak at randomgoodbye jim  and dr livesey shook hands with me through the stockade nodded to silver and set off at a brisk pace into the wood       chapter xxxi    the treasure huntflints pointer   jim said silver when we were alone if i saved your life you saved mine and ill not forget it i seen the doctor waving you to run for itwith the tail of my eye i did and i seen you say no as plain as hearing jim thats one to you this is the first glint of hope i had since the attack failed and i owe it you and now jim were to go in for this here treasurehunting with sealed orders too and i dont like it and you and me must stick close back to back like and well save our necks in spite o fate and fortune  just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk they had lit a fire fit to roast an ox and it was now grown so hot that they could only approach it from the windward and even there not without precaution in the same wasteful spirit they had cooked i suppose three times more than we could eat and one of them with an empty laugh threw what was left into the fire which blazed and roared again over this unusual fuel i never in my life saw men so careless of the morrow hand to mouth is the only word that can describe their way of doing and what with wasted food and sleeping sentries though they were bold enough for a brush and be done with it i could see their entire unfitness for anything like a prolonged campaign  even silver eating away with captain flint upon his shoulder had not a word of blame for their recklessness and this the more surprised me for i thought he had never shown himself so cunning as he did then  ay mates said he its lucky you have barbecue to think for you with this here head i got what i wanted i did sure enough they have the ship where they have it i dont know yet but once we hit the treasure well have to jump about and find out and then mates us that has the boats i reckon has the upper hand  thus he kept running on with his mouth full of the hot bacon thus he restored their hope and confidence and i more than suspect repaired his own at the same time  as for hostage he continued thats his last talk i guess with them he loves so dear ive got my piece o news and thanky to him for that but its over and done ill take him in a line when we go treasurehunting for well keep him like so much gold in case of accidents you mark and in the meantime once we got the ship and treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions why then well talk mr hawkins over we will and well give him his share to be sure for all his kindness  it was no wonder the men were in a good humour now for my part i was horribly cast down should the scheme he had now sketched prove feasible silver already doubly a traitor would not hesitate to adopt it he had still a foot in either camp and there was no doubt he would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from hanging which was the best he had to hope on our side  nay and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith with dr livesey even then what danger lay before us what a moment that would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty and he and i should have to fight for dear lifehe a cripple and i a boyagainst five strong and active seamen  add to this double apprehension the mystery that still hung over the behaviour of my friends their unexplained desertion of the stockade their inexplicable cession of the chart or harder still to understand the doctors last warning to silver look out for squalls when you find it and you will readily believe how little taste i found in my breakfast and with how uneasy a heart i set forth behind my captors on the quest for treasure  we made a curious figure had any one been there to see us all in soiled sailor clothes and all but me armed to the teeth silver had two guns slung about himone before and one behindbesides the great cutlass at his waist and a pistol in each pocket of his squaretailed coat to complete his strange appearance captain flint sat perched upon his shoulder and gabbling odds and ends of purposeless seatalk i had a line about my waist and followed obediently after the seacook who held the loose end of the rope now in his free hand now between his powerful teeth for all the world i was led like a dancing bear  the other men were variously burthened some carrying picks and shovelsfor that had been the very first necessary they brought ashore from the hispaniolaothers laden with pork bread and brandy for the midday meal all the stores i observed came from our stock and i could see the truth of silvers words the night before had he not struck a bargain with the doctor he and his mutineers deserted by the ship must have been driven to subsist on clear water and the proceeds of their hunting water would have been little to their taste a sailor is not usually a good shot and besides all that when they were so short of eatables it was not likely they would be very flush of powder  well thus equipped we all set outeven the fellow with the broken head who should certainly have kept in shadowand straggled one after another to the beach where the two gigs awaited us even these bore trace of the drunken folly of the pirates one in a broken thwart and both in their muddied and unbaled condition both were to be carried along with us for the sake of safety and so with our numbers divided between them we set forth upon the bosom of the anchorage  as we pulled over there was some discussion on the chart the red cross was of course far too large to be a guide and the terms of the note on the back as you will hear admitted of some ambiguity they ran the reader may remember thus    tall tree spyglass shoulder bearing a point to the n of nne    skeleton island ese and by e    ten feet  a tall tree was thus the principal mark now right before us the anchorage was bounded by a plateau from two to three hundred feet high adjoining on the north the sloping southern shoulder of the spyglass and rising again towards the south into the rough cliffy eminence called the mizzenmast hill the top of the plateau was dotted thickly with pine trees of varying height every here and there one of a different species rose forty or fifty feet clear above its neighbours and which of these was the particular tall tree of captain flint could only be decided on the spot and by the readings of the compass  yet although that was the case every man on board the boats had picked a favourite of his own ere we were halfway over long john alone shrugging his shoulders and bidding them wait till they were there  we pulled easily by silvers directions not to weary the hands prematurely and after quite a long passage landed at the mouth of the second riverthat which runs down a woody cleft of the spyglass thence bending to our left we began to ascend the slope towards the plateau  at the first outset heavy miry ground and a matted marish vegetation greatly delayed our progress but by little and little the hill began to steepen and become stony under foot and the wood to change its character and to grow in a more open order it was indeed a most pleasant portion of the island that we were now approaching a heavyscented broom and many flowering shrubs had almost taken the place of grass thickets of green nutmeg trees were dotted here and there with the red columns and the broad shadow of the pines and the first mingled their spice with the aroma of the others the air besides was fresh and stirring and this under the sheer sunbeams was a wonderful refreshment to our senses  the party spread itself abroad in a fan shape shouting and leaping to and fro about the centre and a good way behind the rest silver and i followedi tethered by my rope he ploughing with deep pants among the sliding gravel from time to time indeed i had to lend him a hand or he must have missed his footing and fallen backward down the hill  we had thus proceeded for about half a mile and were approaching the brow of the plateau when the man upon the farthest left began to cry aloud as if in terror shout after shout came from him and the others began to run in his direction  he cant a found the treasure said old morgan hurrying past us from the right for thats clean atop  indeed as we found when we also reached the spot it was something very different at the foot of a pretty big pine and involved in a green creeper which had even partly lifted some of the smaller bones a human skeleton lay with a few shreds of clothing on the ground i believe a chill struck for a moment to every heart  he was a seaman said george merry who bolder than the rest had gone up close and was examining the rags of clothing leastways this is good seacloth  ay ay said silver like enough you wouldnt look to find a bishop here i reckon but what sort of a way is that for bones to lie taint in natur  indeed on a second glance it seemed impossible to fancy that the body was in a natural position but for some disarray the work perhaps of the birds that had fed upon him or of the slowgrowing creeper that had gradually enveloped his remains the man lay perfectly straighthis feet pointing in one direction his hands raised above his head like a divers pointing directly in the opposite  ive taken a notion into my old numskull observed silver heres the compass theres the tiptop pint o skeleton island stickin out like a tooth just take a bearing will you along the line of them bones  it was done the body pointed straight in the direction of the island and the compass read duly ese and by e  i thought so cried the cook this here is a pinter right up there is our line for the pole star and the jolly dollars but by thunder if it dont make me cold inside to think of flint this is one of his jokes and no mistake him and these six was alone here he killed em every man and this one he hauled here and laid down by compass shiver my timbers theyre long bones and the hairs been yellow ay that would be allardyceyou mind allardyce tom morgan  ay ay returned morgan i mind him he owed me money he did and took my knife ashore with him  speaking of knives said another why dont we find hisn lying round flint warnt the man to pick a seamans pocket and the birds i guess would leave it be  by the powers and thats true cried silver  there aint a thing left here said merry still feeling round among the bones not a copper doit nor a baccybox it dont look natral to me  no by gum it dont agreed silver not natral nor not nice says you great guns messmates but if flint was living this would be a hot spot for you and me six they were and six are we and bones is what they are now  i saw him dead with these here deadlights said morgan billy took me in there he laid with pennypieces on his eyes  deaday sure enough hes dead and gone below said the fellow with the bandage but if ever sperrit walked it would be flints dear heart but he died bad did flint  ay that he did observed another now he raged and now he hollered for the rum and now he sang fifteen men were his only song mates and i tell you true i never rightly liked to hear it since it was main hot and the windy was open and i hear that old song comin out as clear as clearand the deathhaul on the man already  come come said silver stow this talk hes dead and he dont walk that i know leastways he wont walk by day and you may lay to that care killed a cat fetch ahead for the doubloons  we started certainly but in spite of the hot sun and the staring daylight the pirates no longer ran separate and shouting through the wood but kept side by side and spoke with bated breath the terror of the dead buccaneer had fallen on their spirits       chapter xxxii    the treasure huntthe voice among the trees   partly from the damping influence of this alarm partly to rest silver and the sick folk the whole party sat down as soon as they had gained the brow of the ascent  the plateau being somewhat tilted towards the west this spot on which we had paused commanded a wide prospect on either hand before us over the treetops we beheld the cape of the woods fringed with surf behind we not only looked down upon the anchorage and skeleton island but sawclear across the spit and the eastern lowlandsa great field of open sea upon the east sheer above us rose the spyglass here dotted with single pines there black with precipices there was no sound but that of the distant breakers mounting from all round and the chirp of countless insects in the brush not a man not a sail upon the sea the very largeness of the view increased the sense of solitude  silver as he sat took certain bearings with his compass  there are three tall trees said he about in the right line from skeleton island spyglass shoulder i take it means that lower pint there its childsplay to find the stuff now ive half a mind to dine first  i dont feel sharp growled morgan thinkin o flinti think it wereas done me  ah well my son you praise your stars hes dead said silver  he were an ugly devil cried a third pirate with a shudder that blue in the face too  that was how the rum took him added merry blue well i reckon he was blue thats a true word  ever since they had found the skeleton and got upon this train of thought they had spoken lower and lower and they had almost got to whispering by now so that the sound of their talk hardly interrupted the silence of the wood all of a sudden out of the middle of the trees in front of us a thin high trembling voice struck up the wellknown air and words    fifteen men on the dead mans chest       yohoho and a bottle of rum  i never have seen men more dreadfully affected than the pirates the colour went from their six faces like enchantment some leaped to their feet some clawed hold of others morgan grovelled on the ground  its flint by  cried merry  the song had stopped as suddenly as it beganbroken off you would have said in the middle of a note as though some one had laid his hand upon the singers mouth coming so far through the clear sunny atmosphere among the green treetops i thought it had sounded airily and sweetly and the effect on my companions was the stranger  come said silver struggling with his ashen lips to get the word out this wont do stand by to go about this is a rum start and i cant name the voice but its some one skylarkingsome one thats flesh and blood and you may lay to that  his courage had come back as he spoke and some of the colour to his face along with it already the others had begun to lend an ear to this encouragement and were coming a little to themselves when the same voice broke out againnot this time singing but in a faint distant hail that echoed yet fainter among the clefts of the spyglass  darby mgraw it wailedfor that is the word that best describes the sounddarby mgraw darby mgraw again and again and again and then rising a little higher and with an oath that i leave out fetch aft the rum darby  the buccaneers remained rooted to the ground their eyes starting from their heads long after the voice had died away they still stared in silence dreadfully before them  that fixes it gasped one lets go  they was his last words moaned morgan his last words above board  dick had his bible out and was praying volubly he had been well brought up had dick before he came to sea and fell among bad companions  still silver was unconquered i could hear his teeth rattle in his head but he had not yet surrendered  nobody in this here island ever heard of darby he muttered not one but us thats here and then making a great effort shipmates he cried im here to get that stuff and ill not be beat by man nor devil i never was feared of flint in his life and by the powers ill face him dead theres seven hundred thousand pound not a quarter of a mile from here when did ever a gentleman o fortune show his stern to that much dollars for a boosy old seaman with a blue mugand him dead too  but there was no sign of reawakening courage in his followers rather indeed of growing terror at the irreverence of his words  belay there john said merry dont you cross a sperrit  and the rest were all too terrified to reply they would have run away severally had they dared but fear kept them together and kept them close by john as if his daring helped them he on his part had pretty well fought his weakness down  sperrit well maybe he said but theres one thing not clear to me there was an echo now no man ever seen a sperrit with a shadow well then whats he doing with an echo to him i should like to know that aint in natur surely  this argument seemed weak enough to me but you can never tell what will affect the superstitious and to my wonder george merry was greatly relieved  well thats so he said youve a head upon your shoulders john and no mistake bout ship mates this here crew is on a wrong tack i do believe and come to think on it it was like flints voice i grant you but not just so clearaway like it after all it was liker somebody elses voice nowit was liker  by the powers ben gunn roared silver  ay and so it were cried morgan springing on his knees ben gunn it were  it dont make much odds do it now asked dick ben gunns not here in the body any moren flint  but the older hands greeted this remark with scorn  why nobody minds ben gunn cried merry dead or alive nobody minds him  it was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the natural colour had revived in their faces soon they were chatting together with intervals of listening and not long after hearing no further sound they shouldered the tools and set forth again merry walking first with silvers compass to keep them on the right line with skeleton island he had said the truth dead or alive nobody minded ben gunn  dick alone still held his bible and looked around him as he went with fearful glances but he found no sympathy and silver even joked him on his precautions  i told you said hei told you you had spiled your bible if it aint no good to swear by what do you suppose a sperrit would give for it not that and he snapped his big fingers halting a moment on his crutch  but dick was not to be comforted indeed it was soon plain to me that the lad was falling sick hastened by heat exhaustion and the shock of his alarm the fever predicted by doctor livesey was evidently growing swiftly higher  it was fine open walking here upon the summit our way lay a little downhill for as i have said the plateau tilted towards the west the pines great and small grew wide apart and even between the clumps of nutmeg and azalea wide open spaces baked in the hot sunshine striking as we did pretty near northwest across the island we drew on the one hand ever nearer under the shoulders of the spyglass and on the other looked ever wider over that western bay where i had once tossed and trembled in the coracle  the first of the tall trees was reached and by the bearing proved the wrong one so with the second the third rose nearly two hundred feet into the air above a clump of underwood a giant of a vegetable with a red column as big as a cottage and a wide shadow around in which a company could have manoeuvred it was conspicuous far to sea both on the east and west and might have been entered as a sailing mark upon the chart  but it was not its size that now impressed my companions it was the knowledge that seven hundred thousand pounds in gold lay somewhere buried below its spreading shadow the thought of the money as they drew nearer swallowed up their previous terrors their eyes burned in their heads their feet grew speedier and lighter their whole soul was bound up in that fortune that whole lifetime of extravagance and pleasure that lay waiting there for each of them  silver hobbled grunting on his crutch his nostrils stood out and quivered he cursed like a madman when the flies settled on his hot and shiny countenance he plucked furiously at the line that held me to him and from time to time turned his eyes upon me with a deadly look certainly he took no pains to hide his thoughts and certainly i read them like print in the immediate nearness of the gold all else had been forgotten his promise and the doctors warning were both things of the past and i could not doubt that he hoped to seize upon the treasure find and board the hispaniola under cover of night cut every honest throat about that island and sail away as he had at first intended laden with crimes and riches  shaken as i was with these alarms it was hard for me to keep up with the rapid pace of the treasurehunters now and again i stumbled and it was then that silver plucked so roughly at the rope and launched at me his murderous glances dick who had dropped behind us and now brought up the rear was babbling to himself both prayers and curses as his fever kept rising this also added to my wretchedness and to crown all i was haunted by the thought of the tragedy that had once been acted on that plateau when that ungodly buccaneer with the blue facehe who died at savannah singing and shouting for drinkhad there with his own hand cut down his six accomplices this grove that was now so peaceful must then have rung with cries i thought and even with the thought i could believe i heard it ringing still  we were now at the margin of the thicket  huzza mates all together shouted merry and the foremost broke into a run  and suddenly not ten yards farther we beheld them stop a low cry arose silver doubled his pace digging away with the foot of his crutch like one possessed and next moment he and i had come also to a dead halt  before us was a great excavation not very recent for the sides had fallen in and grass had sprouted on the bottom in this were the shaft of a pick broken in two and the boards of several packingcases strewn around on one of these boards i saw branded with a hot iron the name walrusthe name of flints ship  all was clear to probation the cache had been found and rifled the seven hundred thousand pounds were gone       chapter xxxiii    the fall of a chieftain   there never was such an overturn in this world each of these six men was as though he had been struck but with silver the blow passed almost instantly every thought of his soul had been set fullstretch like a racer on that money well he was brought up in a single second dead and he kept his head found his temper and changed his plan before the others had had time to realise the disappointment  jim he whispered take that and stand by for trouble  and he passed me a doublebarrelled pistol  at the same time he began quietly moving northward and in a few steps had put the hollow between us two and the other five then he looked at me and nodded as much as to say here is a narrow corner as indeed i thought it was his looks were now quite friendly and i was so revolted at these constant changes that i could not forbear whispering so youve changed sides again  there was no time left for him to answer in the buccaneers with oaths and cries began to leap one after another into the pit and to dig with their fingers throwing the boards aside as they did so morgan found a piece of gold he held it up with a perfect spout of oaths it was a twoguinea piece and it went from hand to hand among them for a quarter of a minute  two guineas roared merry shaking it at silver thats your seven hundred thousand pounds is it youre the man for bargains aint you youre him that never bungled nothing you woodenheaded lubber  dig away boys said silver with the coolest insolence youll find some pignuts and i shouldnt wonder  pignuts repeated merry in a scream mates do you hear that i tell you now that man there knew it all along look in the face of him and youll see it wrote there  ah merry remarked silver standing for capn again youre a pushing lad to be sure  but this time every one was entirely in merrys favour they began to scramble out of the excavation darting furious glances behind them one thing i observed which looked well for us they all got out upon the opposite side from silver  well there we stood two on one side five on the other the pit between us and nobody screwed up high enough to offer the first blow silver never moved he watched them very upright on his crutch and looked as cool as ever i saw him he was brave and no mistake  at last merry seemed to think a speech might help matters  mates says he theres two of them alone there ones the old cripple that brought us all here and blundered us down to this the others that cub that i mean to have the heart of now mates  he was raising his arm and his voice and plainly meant to lead a charge but just thencrack crack crackthree musketshots flashed out of the thicket merry tumbled headforemost into the excavation the man with the bandage spun round like a teetotum and fell all his length upon his side where he lay dead but still twitching and the other three turned and ran for it with all their might  before you could wink long john had fired two barrels of a pistol into the struggling merry and as the man rolled up his eyes at him in the last agony george said he i reckon i settled you  at the same moment the doctor gray and ben gunn joined us with smoking muskets from among the nutmeg trees  forward cried the doctor double quick my lads we must head em off the boats  and we set off at a great pace sometimes plunging through the bushes to the chest  i tell you but silver was anxious to keep up with us the work that man went through leaping on his crutch till the muscles of his chest were fit to burst was work no sound man ever equalled and so thinks the doctor as it was he was already thirty yards behind us and on the verge of strangling when we reached the brow of the slope  doctor he hailed see there no hurry  sure enough there was no hurry in a more open part of the plateau we could see the three survivors still running in the same direction as they had started right for mizzenmast hill we were already between them and the boats and so we four sat down to breathe while long john mopping his face came slowly up with us  thank ye kindly doctor says he you came in in about the nick i guess for me and hawkinsand so its you ben gunn he added well youre a nice one to be sure  im ben gunn i am replied the maroon wriggling like an eel in his embarrassment and he added after a long pause how do mr silver pretty well i thank ye says you  ben ben murmured silver to think as youve done me  the doctor sent back gray for one of the pickaxes deserted in their flight by the mutineers and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to where the boats were lying related in a few words what had taken place it was a story that profoundly interested silver and ben gunn the halfidiot maroon was the hero from beginning to end  ben in his long lonely wanderings about the island had found the skeletonit was he that had rifled it he had found the treasure he had dug it up it was the haft of his pickaxe that lay broken in the excavation he had carried it on his back in many weary journeys from the foot of a tall pine to a cave he had on the twopointed hill at the northeast angle of the island and there it had lain stored in safety since two months before the arrival of the hispaniola  when the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the attack and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted he had gone to silver given him the chart which was now uselessgiven him the stores for ben gunns cave was well supplied with goats meat salted by himselfgiven anything and everything to get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the twopointed hill there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard upon the money  as for you jim he said it went against my heart but i did what i thought best for those who had stood by their duty and if you were not one of these whose fault was it  that morning finding that i was to be involved in the horrid disappointment he had prepared for the mutineers he had run all the way to the cave and leaving squire to guard the captain had taken gray and the maroon and started making the diagonal across the island to be at hand beside the pine soon however he saw that our party had the start of him and ben gunn being fleet of foot had been despatched in front to do his best alone then it had occurred to him to work upon the superstitions of his former shipmates and he was so far successful that gray and the doctor had come up and were already ambushed before the arrival of the treasurehunters  ah said silver it were fortunate for me that i had hawkins here you would have let old john be cut to bits and never given it a thought doctor  not a thought replied dr livesey cheerily  and by this time we had reached the gigs the doctor with the pickaxe demolished one of them and then we all got aboard the other and set out to go round by sea for north inlet  this was a run of eight or nine miles silver though he was almost killed already with fatigue was set to an oar like the rest of us and we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea soon we passed out of the straits and doubled the southeast corner of the island round which four days ago we had towed the hispaniola  as we passed the twopointed hill we could see the black mouth of ben gunns cave and a figure standing by it leaning on a musket it was the squire and we waved a handkerchief and gave him three cheers in which the voice of silver joined as heartily as any  three miles farther just inside the mouth of north inlet what should we meet but the hispaniola cruising by herself the last flood had lifted her and had there been much wind or a strong tide current as in the southern anchorage we should never have found her more or found her stranded beyond help as it was there was little amiss beyond the wreck of the mainsail another anchor was got ready and dropped in a fathom and a half of water we all pulled round again to rum cove the nearest point for ben gunns treasurehouse and then gray singlehanded returned with the gig to the hispaniola where he was to pass the night on guard  a gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of the cave at the top the squire met us to me he was cordial and kind saying nothing of my escapade either in the way of blame or praise at silvers polite salute he somewhat flushed  john silver he said youre a prodigious villain and impostora monstrous impostor sir i am told i am not to prosecute you well then i will not but the dead men sir hang about your neck like millstones  thank you kindly sir replied long john again saluting  i dare you to thank me cried the squire it is a gross dereliction of my duty stand back  and thereupon we all entered the cave it was a large airy place with a little spring and a pool of clear water overhung with ferns the floor was sand before a big fire lay captain smollett and in a far corner only duskily flickered over by the blaze i beheld great heaps of coin and quadrilaterals built of bars of gold that was flints treasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the lives of seventeen men from the hispaniola how many it had cost in the amassing what blood and sorrow what good ships scuttled on the deep what brave men walking the plank blindfold what shot of cannon what shame and lies and cruelty perhaps no man alive could tell yet there were still three upon that islandsilver and old morgan and ben gunnwho had each taken his share in these crimes as each had hoped in vain to share in the reward  come in jim said the captain youre a good boy in your line jim but i dont think you and mell go to sea again youre too much of the born favourite for meis that you john silver what brings you here man  come back to my dooty sir returned silver  ah said the captain and that was all he said  what a supper i had of it that night with all my friends around me and what a meal it was with ben gunns salted goat and some delicacies and a bottle of old wine from the hispaniola never i am sure were people gayer or happier and there was silver sitting back almost out of the firelight but eating heartily prompt to spring forward when anything was wanted even joining quietly in our laughterthe same bland polite obsequious seaman of the voyage out       chapter xxxiv    and last   the next morning we fell early to work for the transportation of this great mass of gold near a mile by land to the beach and thence three miles by boat to the hispaniola was a considerable task for so small a number of workmen the three fellows still abroad upon the island did not greatly trouble us a single sentry on the shoulder of the hill was sufficient to insure us against any sudden onslaught and we thought besides they had had more than enough of fighting  therefore the work was pushed on briskly gray and ben gunn came and went with the boat while the rest during their absences piled treasure on the beach two of the bars slung in a ropesend made a good load for a grown manone that he was glad to walk slowly with for my part as i was not much use at carrying i was kept busy all day in the cave packing the minted money into breadbags  it was a strange collection like billy boness hoard for the diversity of coinage but so much larger and so much more varied that i think i never had more pleasure than in sorting them english french spanish portuguese georges and louises doubloons and double guineas and moidores and sequins the pictures of all the kings of europe for the last hundred years strange oriental pieces stamped with what looked like wisps of string or bits of spiders web round pieces and square pieces and pieces bored through the middle as if to wear them round your necknearly every variety of money in the world must i think have found a place in that collection and for number i am sure they were like autumn leaves so that my back ached with stooping and my fingers with sorting them out  day after day this work went on by every evening a fortune had been stowed aboard but there was another fortune waiting for the morrow and all this time we heard nothing of the three surviving mutineers  at lasti think it was on the third nightthe doctor and i were strolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks the lowlands of the isle when from out the thick darkness below the wind brought us a noise between shrieking and singing it was only a snatch that reached our ears followed by the former silence  heaven forgive them said the doctor tis the mutineers  all drunk sir struck in the voice of silver from behind us  silver i should say was allowed his entire liberty and in spite of daily rebuffs seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged and friendly dependant indeed it was remarkable how well he bore these slights and with what unwearying politeness he kept on trying to ingratiate himself with all yet i think none treated him better than a dog unless it was ben gunn who was still terribly afraid of his old quartermaster or myself who had really something to thank him for although for that matter i suppose i had reason to think even worse of him than anybody else for i had seen him meditating a fresh treachery upon the plateau accordingly it was pretty gruffly that the doctor answered him  drunk or raving said he  right you were sir replied silver and precious little odds which to you and me  i suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man returned the doctor with a sneer and so my feelings may surprise you master silver but if i were sure they were ravingas i am morally certain one at least of them is down with feveri should leave this camp and at whatever risk to my own carcass take them the assistance of my skill  ask your pardon sir you would be very wrong quoth silver you would lose your precious life and you may lay to that im on your side now hand and glove and i shouldnt wish for to see the party weakened let alone yourself seeing as i know what i owes you but these men down there they couldnt keep their wordno not supposing they wished to and whats more they couldnt believe as you could  no said the doctor youre the man to keep your word we know that  well that was about the last news we had of the three pirates only once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting a council was held and it was decided that we must desert them on the islandto the huge glee i must say of ben gunn and with the strong approval of gray we left a good stock of powder and shot the bulk of the salt goat a few medicines and some other necessaries tools clothing a spare sail a fathom or two of rope and by the particular desire of the doctor a handsome present of tobacco  that was about our last doing on the island before that we had got the treasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the remainder of the goat meat in case of any distress and at last one fine morning we weighed anchor which was about all that we could manage and stood out of north inlet the same colours flying that the captain had flown and fought under at the palisade  the three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for as we soon had proved for coming through the narrows we had to lie very near the southern point and there we saw all three of them kneeling together on a spit of sand with their arms raised in supplication it went to all our hearts i think to leave them in that wretched state but we could not risk another mutiny and to take them home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness the doctor hailed them and told them of the stores we had left and where they were to find them but they continued to call us by name and appeal to us for gods sake to be merciful and not leave them to die in such a place  at last seeing the ship still bore on her course and was now swiftly drawing out of earshot one of themi know not which it wasleapt to his feet with a hoarse cry whipped his musket to his shoulder and sent a shot whistling over silvers head and through the mainsail  after that we kept under cover of the bulwarks and when next i looked out they had disappeared from the spit and the spit itself had almost melted out of sight in the growing distance that was at least the end of that and before noon to my inexpressible joy the highest rock of treasure island had sunk into the blue round of sea  we were so short of men that every one on board had to bear a handonly the captain lying on a mattress in the stern and giving his orders for though greatly recovered he was still in want of quiet we laid her head for the nearest port in spanish america for we could not risk the voyage home without fresh hands and as it was what with baffling winds and a couple of fresh gales we were all worn out before we reached it  it was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beautiful landlocked gulf and were immediately surrounded by shoreboats full of negroes and mexican indians and halfbloods selling fruit and vegetables and offering to dive for bits of money the sight of so many goodhumoured faces especially the blacks the taste of the tropical fruits and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a most charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island and the doctor and the squire taking me along with them went ashore to pass the early part of the night here they met the captain of an english manofwar fell in talk with him went on board his ship and in short had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came alongside the hispaniola  ben gunn was on deck alone and as soon as we came on board he began with wonderful contortions to make us a confession silver was gone the maroon had connived at his escape in a shoreboat some hours ago and he now assured us he had only done so to preserve our lives which would certainly have been forfeit if that man with the one leg had stayed aboard but this was not all the seacook had not gone emptyhanded he had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed one of the sacks of coin worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas to help him on his further wanderings  i think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him  well to make a long story short we got a few hands on board made a good cruise home and the hispaniola reached bristol just as mr blandly was beginning to think of fitting out her consort five men only of those who had sailed returned with her drink and the devil had done for the rest with a vengeance although to be sure we were not quite in so bad a case as that other ship they sang about    with one man of her crew alive    what put to sea with seventyfive  all of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or foolishly according to our natures captain smollett is now retired from the sea gray not only saved his money but being suddenly smit with the desire to rise also studied his profession and he is now mate and part owner of a fine fullrigged ship married besides and the father of a family as for ben gunn he got a thousand pounds which he spent or lost in three weeks or to be more exact in nineteen days for he was back begging on the twentieth then he was given a lodge to keep exactly as he had feared upon the island and he still lives a great favourite though something of a butt with the country boys and a notable singer in church on sundays and saints days  of silver we have heard no more that formidable seafaring man with one leg has at last gone clean out of my life but i daresay he met his old negress and perhaps still lives in comfort with her and captain flint it is to be hoped so i suppose for his chances of comfort in another world are very small  the bar silver and the arms still lie for all that i know where flint buried them and certainly they shall lie there for me oxen and wainropes would not bring me back again to that accursed island and the worst dreams that ever i have are when i hear the surf booming about its coasts or start upright in bed with the sharp voice of captain flint still ringing in my ears pieces of eight pieces of eight       will o the mill       will o the mill    the plain and the stars   the mill where will lived with his adopted parents stood in a falling valley between pinewoods and great mountains above hill after hill soared upwards until they soared out of the depth of the hardiest timber and stood naked against the sky some way up a long grey village lay like a seam or a rag of vapour on a wooded hillside and when the wind was favourable the sound of the church bells would drop down thin and silvery to will below the valley grew ever steeper and steeper and at the same time widened out on either hand and from an eminence beside the mill it was possible to see its whole length and away beyond it over a wide plain where the river turned and shone and moved on from city to city on its voyage towards the sea it chanced that over this valley there lay a pass into a neighbouring kingdom so that quiet and rural as it was the road that ran along beside the river was a high thoroughfare between two splendid and powerful societies all through the summer travellingcarriages came crawling up or went plunging briskly downwards past the mill and as it happened that the other side was very much easier of ascent the path was not much frequented except by people going in one direction and of all the carriages that will saw go by fivesixths were plunging briskly downwards and only onesixth crawling up much more was this the case with footpassengers all the lightfooted tourists all the pedlars laden with strange wares were tending downward like the river that accompanied their path nor was this all for when will was yet a child a disastrous war arose over a great part of the world the newspapers were full of defeats and victories the earth rang with cavalry hoofs and often for days together and for miles around the coil of battle terrified good people from their labours in the field of all this nothing was heard for a long time in the valley but at last one of the commanders pushed an army over the pass by forced marches and for three days horse and foot cannon and tumbril drum and standard kept pouring downward past the mill all day the child stood and watched them on their passage the rhythmical stride the pale unshaven faces tanned about the eyes the discoloured regimentals and the tattered flags filled him with a sense of weariness pity and wonder and all night long after he was in bed he could hear the cannon pounding and the feet trampling and the great armament sweeping onward and downward past the mill no one in the valley ever heard the fate of the expedition for they lay out of the way of gossip in those troublous times but will saw one thing plainly that not a man returned whither had they all gone whither went all the tourists and pedlars with strange wares whither all the brisk barouches with servants in the dicky whither the water of the stream ever coursing downward and ever renewed from above even the wind blew oftener down the valley and carried the dead leaves along with it in the fall it seemed like a great conspiracy of things animate and inanimate they all went downward fleetly and gaily downward and only he it seemed remained behind like a stock upon the wayside it sometimes made him glad when he noticed how the fishes kept their heads up stream they at least stood faithfully by him while all else were posting downward to the unknown world  one evening he asked the miller where the river went  it goes down the valley answered he and turns a power of millssixscore mills they say from here to unterdeckand it none the wearier after all and then it goes out into the lowlands and waters the great corn country and runs through a sight of fine cities so they say where kings live all alone in great palaces with a sentry walking up and down before the door and it goes under bridges with stone men upon them looking down and smiling so curious at the water and living folks leaning their elbows on the wall and looking over too and then it goes on and on and down through marshes and sands until at last it falls into the sea where the ships are that bring parrots and tobacco from the indies ay it has a long trot before it as it goes singing over our weir bless its heart  and what is the sea asked will  the sea cried the miller lord help us all it is the greatest thing god made that is where all the water in the world runs down into a great salt lake there it lies as flat as my hand and as innocentlike as a child but they do say when the wind blows it gets up into watermountains bigger than any of ours and swallows down great ships bigger than our mill and makes such a roaring that you can hear it miles away upon the land there are great fish in it five times bigger than a bull and one old serpent as long as our river and as old as all the world with whiskers like a man and a crown of silver on her head  will thought he had never heard anything like this and he kept on asking question after question about the world that lay away down the river with all its perils and marvels until the old miller became quite interested himself and at last took him by the hand and led him to the hilltop that overlooks the valley and the plain the sun was near setting and hung low down in a cloudless sky everything was defined and glorified in golden light will had never seen so great an expanse of country in his life he stood and gazed with all his eyes he could see the cities and the woods and fields and the bright curves of the river and far away to where the rim of the plain trenched along the shining heavens an overmastering emotion seized upon the boy soul and body his heart beat so thickly that he could not breathe the scene swam before his eyes the sun seemed to wheel round and round and throw off as it turned strange shapes which disappeared with the rapidity of thought and were succeeded by others will covered his face with his hands and burst into a violent fit of tears and the poor miller sadly disappointed and perplexed saw nothing better for it than to take him up in his arms and carry him home in silence  from that day forward will was full of new hopes and longings something kept tugging at his heartstrings the running water carried his desires along with it as he dreamed over its fleeting surface the wind as it ran over innumerable treetops hailed him with encouraging words branches beckoned downward the open road as it shouldered round the angles and went turning and vanishing fast and faster down the valley tortured him with its solicitations he spent long whiles on the eminence looking down the rivershed and abroad on the fat lowlands and watched the clouds that travelled forth upon the sluggish wind and trailed their purple shadows on the plain or he would linger by the wayside and follow the carriages with his eyes as they rattled downward by the river it did not matter what it was everything that went that way were it cloud or carriage bird or brown water in the stream he felt his heart flow out after it in an ecstasy of longing  we are told by men of science that all the ventures of mariners on the sea all that countermarching of tribes and races that confounds old history with its dust and rumour sprang from nothing more abstruse than the laws of supply and demand and a certain natural instinct for cheap rations to any one thinking deeply this will seem a dull and pitiful explanation the tribes that came swarming out of the north and east if they were indeed pressed onward from behind by others were drawn at the same time by the magnetic influence of the south and west the fame of other lands had reached them the name of the eternal city rang in their ears they were not colonists but pilgrims they travelled towards wine and gold and sunshine but their hearts were set on something higher that divine unrest that old stinging trouble of humanity that makes all high achievements and all miserable failure the same that spread wings with icarus the same that sent columbus into the desolate atlantic inspired and supported these barbarians on their perilous march there is one legend which profoundly represents their spirit of how a flying party of these wanderers encountered a very old man shod with iron the old man asked them whither they were going and they answered with one voice to the eternal city he looked upon them gravely i have sought it he said over the most part of the world three such pairs as i now carry on my feet have i worn out upon this pilgrimage and now the fourth is growing slender underneath my steps and all this while i have not found the city and he turned and went his own way alone leaving them astonished  and yet this would scarcely parallel the intensity of wills feeling for the plain if he could only go far enough out there he felt as if his eyesight would be purged and clarified as if his hearing would grow more delicate and his very breath would come and go with luxury he was transplanted and withering where he was he lay in a strange country and was sick for home bit by bit he pieced together broken notions of the world below of the river ever moving and growing until it sailed forth into the majestic ocean of the cities full of brisk and beautiful people playing fountains bands of music and marble palaces and lighted up at night from end to end with artificial stars of gold of the great churches wise universities brave armies and untold money lying stored in vaults of the highflying vice that moved in the sunshine and the stealth and swiftness of midnight murder i have said he was sick as if for home the figure halts he was like some one lying in twilit formless preexistence and stretching out his hands lovingly towards manycoloured manysounding life it was no wonder he was unhappy he would go and tell the fish they were made for their life wished for no more than worms and running water and a hole below a falling bank but he was differently designed full of desires and aspirations itching at the fingers lusting with the eyes whom the whole variegated world could not satisfy with aspects the true life the true bright sunshine lay far out upon the plain and o to see this sunlight once before he died to move with a jocund spirit in a golden land to hear the trained singers and sweet church bells and see the holiday gardens and o fish he would cry if you would only turn your noses down stream you could swim so easily into the fabled waters and see the vast ships passing over your head like clouds and hear the great waterhills making music over you all day long but the fish kept looking patiently in their own direction until will hardly knew whether to laugh or cry  hitherto the traffic on the road had passed by will like something seen in a picture he had perhaps exchanged salutations with a tourist or caught sight of an old gentleman in a travelling cap at a carriage window but for the most part it had been a mere symbol which he contemplated from apart and with something of a superstitious feeling a time came at last when this was to be changed the miller who was a greedy man in his way and never forewent an opportunity of honest profit turned the millhouse into a little wayside inn and several pieces of good fortune falling in opportunely built stables and got the position of postmaster on the road it now became wills duty to wait upon people as they sat to break their fasts in the little arbour at the top of the mill garden and you may be sure that he kept his ears open and learned many new things about the outside world as he brought the omelette or the wine nay he would often get into conversation with single guests and by adroit questions and polite attention not only gratify his own curiosity but win the goodwill of the travellers many complimented the old couple on their servingboy and a professor was eager to take him away with him and have him properly educated in the plain the miller and his wife were mightily astonished and even more pleased they thought it a very good thing that they should have opened their inn you see the old man would remark he has a kind of talent for a publican he never would have made anything else and so life wagged on in the valley with high satisfaction to all concerned but will every carriage that left the inndoor seemed to take a part of him away with it and when people jestingly offered him a lift he could with difficulty command his emotion night after night he would dream that he was awakened by flustered servants and that a splendid equipage waited at the door to carry him down into the plain night after night until the dream which had seemed all jollity to him at first began to take on a colour of gravity and the nocturnal summons and waiting equipage occupied a place in his mind as something to be both feared and hoped for  one day when will was about sixteen a fat young man arrived at sunset to pass the night he was a contentedlooking fellow with a jolly eye and carried a knapsack while dinner was preparing he sat in the arbour to read a book but as soon as he had begun to observe will the book was laid aside he was plainly one of those who prefer living people to people made of ink and paper will on his part although he had not been much interested in the stranger at first sight soon began to take a great deal of pleasure in his talk which was full of good nature and good sense and at last conceived a great respect for his character and wisdom they sat far into the night and about two in the morning will opened his heart to the young man and told him how he longed to leave the valley and what bright hopes he had connected with the cities of the plain the young man whistled and then broke into a smile  my young friend he remarked you are a very curious little fellow to be sure and wish a great many things which you will never get why you would feel quite ashamed if you knew how the little fellows in these fairy cities of yours are all after the same sort of nonsense and keep breaking their hearts to get up into the mountains and let me tell you those who go down into the plains are a very short while there before they wish themselves heartily back again the air is not so light nor so pure nor is the sun any brighter as for the beautiful men and women you would see many of them in rags and many of them deformed with horrible disorders and a city is so hard a place for people who are poor and sensitive that many choose to die by their own hand  you must think me very simple answered will although i have never been out of this valley believe me i have used my eyes i know how one thing lives on another for instance how the fish hangs in the eddy to catch his fellows and the shepherd who makes so pretty a picture carrying home the lamb is only carrying it home for dinner i do not expect to find all things right in your cities that is not what troubles me it might have been that once upon a time but although i live here always i have asked many questions and learned a great deal in these last years and certainly enough to cure me of my old fancies but you would not have me die like a dog and not see all that is to be seen and do all that a man can do let it be good or evil you would not have me spend all my days between this road here and the river and not so much as make a motion to be up and live my lifei would rather die out of hand he cried than linger on as i am doing  thousands of people said the young man live and die like you and are none the less happy  ah said will if there are thousands who would like why should not one of them have my place  it was quite dark there was a hanging lamp in the arbour which lit up the table and the faces of the speakers and along the arch the leaves upon the trellis stood out illuminated against the night sky a pattern of transparent green upon a dusky purple the fat young man rose and taking will by the arm led him out under the open heavens did you ever look at the stars he asked pointing upwards  often and often answered will  and do you know what they are  i have fancied many things  they are worlds like ours said the young man  some of them less many of them a million times greater and some of the least sparkles that you see are not only worlds but whole clusters of worlds turning about each other in the midst of space we do not know what there may be in any of them perhaps the answer to all our difficulties or the cure of all our sufferings and yet we can never reach them not all the skill of the craftiest of men can fit out a ship for the nearest of these our neighbours nor would the life of the most aged suffice for such a journey when a great battle has been lost or a dear friend is dead when we are hipped or in high spirits there they are unweariedly shining overhead we may stand down here a whole army of us together and shout until we break our hearts and not a whisper reaches them we may climb the highest mountain and we are no nearer them all we can do is to stand down here in the garden and take off our hats the starshine lights upon our heads and where mine is a little bald i daresay you can see it glisten in the darkness the mountain and the mouse that is like to be all we shall ever have to do with arcturus or aldebaran can you apply a parable he added laying his hand upon wills shoulder  it is not the same thing as a reason but usually vastly more convincing  will hung his head a little and then raised it once more to heaven the stars seemed to expand and emit a sharper brilliancy and as he kept turning his eyes higher and higher they seemed to increase in multitude under his gaze  i see he said turning to the young man we are in a rattrap  something of that size did you ever see a squirrel turning in a cage and another squirrel sitting philosophically over his nuts i neednt ask you which of them looked more of a fool       the parsons marjory   after some years the old people died both in one winter very carefully tended by their adopted son and very quietly mourned when they were gone people who had heard of his roving fancies supposed he would hasten to sell the property and go down the river to push his fortunes but there was never any sign of such an intention on the part of will on the contrary he had the inn set on a better footing and hired a couple of servants to assist him in carrying it on and there he settled down a kind talkative inscrutable young man six feet three in his stockings with an iron constitution and a friendly voice he soon began to take rank in the district as a bit of an oddity it was not much to be wondered at from the first for he was always full of notions and kept calling the plainest commonsense in question but what most raised the report upon him was the odd circumstance of his courtship with the parsons marjory  the parsons marjory was a lass about nineteen when will would be about thirty well enough looking and much better educated than any other girl in that part of the country as became her parentage she held her head very high and had already refused several offers of marriage with a grand air which had got her hard names among the neighbours for all that she was a good girl and one that would have made any man well contented  will had never seen much of her for although the church and parsonage were only two miles from his own door he was never known to go there but on sundays it chanced however that the parsonage fell into disrepair and had to be dismantled and the parson and his daughter took lodgings for a month or so on very much reduced terms at wills inn now what with the inn and the mill and the old millers savings our friend was a man of substance and besides that he had a name for good temper and shrewdness which make a capital portion in marriage and so it was currently gossiped among their illwishers that the parson and his daughter had not chosen their temporary lodging with their eyes shut will was about the last man in the world to be cajoled or frightened into marriage you had only to look into his eyes limpid and still like pools of water and yet with a sort of clear light that seemed to come from within and you would understand at once that here was one who knew his own mind and would stand to it immovably marjory herself was no weakling by her looks with strong steady eyes and a resolute and quiet bearing it might be a question whether she was not wills match in steadfastness after all or which of them would rule the roast in marriage but marjory had never given it a thought and accompanied her father with the most unshaken innocence and unconcern  the season was still so early that wills customers were few and far between but the lilacs were already flowering and the weather was so mild that the party took dinner under the trellis with the noise of the river in their ears and the woods ringing about them with the songs of birds will soon began to take a particular pleasure in these dinners the parson was rather a dull companion with a habit of dozing at table but nothing rude or cruel ever fell from his lips and as for the parsons daughter she suited her surroundings with the best grace imaginable and whatever she said seemed so pat and pretty that will conceived a great idea of her talents he could see her face as she leaned forward against a background of rising pinewoods her eyes shone peaceably the light lay around her hair like a kerchief something that was hardly a smile rippled her pale cheeks and will could not contain himself from gazing on her in an agreeable dismay she looked even in her quietest moments so complete in herself and so quick with life down to her fingertips and the very skirts of her dress that the remainder of created things became no more than a blot by comparison and if will glanced away from her to her surroundings the trees looked inanimate and senseless the clouds hung in heaven like dead things and even the mountain tops were disenchanted the whole valley could not compare in looks with this one girl  will was always observant in the society of his fellowcreatures but his observation became almost painfully eager in the case of marjory he listened to all she uttered and read her eyes at the same time for the unspoken commentary many kind simple and sincere speeches found an echo in his heart he became conscious of a soul beautifully poised upon itself nothing doubting nothing desiring clothed in peace it was not possible to separate her thoughts from her appearance the turn of her wrist the still sound of her voice the light in her eyes the lines of her body fell in tune with her grave and gentle words like the accompaniment that sustains and harmonises the voice of the singer her influence was one thing not to be divided or discussed only to be felt with gratitude and joy to will her presence recalled something of his childhood and the thought of her took its place in his mind beside that of dawn of running water and of the earliest violets and lilacs it is the property of things seen for the first time or for the first time after long like the flowers in spring to reawaken in us the sharp edge of sense and that impression of mystic strangeness which otherwise passes out of life with the coming of years but the sight of a loved face is what renews a mans character from the fountain upwards  one day after dinner will took a stroll among the firs a grave beatitude possessed him from top to toe and he kept smiling to himself and the landscape as he went the river ran between the steppingstones with a pretty wimple a bird sang loudly in the wood the hilltops looked immeasurably high and as he glanced at them from time to time seemed to contemplate his movements with a beneficent but awful curiosity his way took him to the eminence which overlooked the plain and there he sat down upon a stone and fell into deep and pleasant thought the plain lay abroad with its cities and silver river everything was asleep except a great eddy of birds which kept rising and falling and going round and round in the blue air he repeated marjorys name aloud and the sound of it gratified his ear he shut his eyes and her image sprang up before him quietly luminous and attended with good thoughts the river might run for ever the birds fly higher and higher till they touched the stars he saw it was empty bustle after all for here without stirring a foot waiting patiently in his own narrow valley he also had attained the better sunlight  the next day will made a sort of declaration across the dinnertable while the parson was filling his pipe  miss marjory he said i never knew any one i liked so well as you i am mostly a cold unkindly sort of man not from want of heart but out of strangeness in my way of thinking and people seem far away from me tis as if there were a circle round me which kept every one out but you i can hear the others talking and laughing but you come quite closemaybe this is disagreeable to you he asked  marjory made no answer  speak up girl said the parson  nay now returned will i wouldnt press her parson i feel tonguetied myself who am not used to it and shes a woman and little more than a child when all is said but for my part as far as i can understand what people mean by it i fancy i must be what they call in love i do not wish to be held as committing myself for i may be wrong but that is how i believe things are with me and if miss marjory should feel any otherwise on her part mayhap she would be so kind as shake her head  marjory was silent and gave no sign that she had heard  how is that parson asked will  the girl must speak replied the parson laying down his pipeheres our neighbour who says he loves you madge do you love him ay or no  i think i do said marjory faintly  well then thats all that could be wished cried will heartily and he took her hand across the table and held it a moment in both of his with great satisfaction  you must marry observed the parson replacing his pipe in his mouth  is that the right thing to do think you demanded will  it is indispensable said the parson  very well replied the wooer  two or three days passed away with great delight to will although a bystander might scarce have found it out he continued to take his meals opposite marjory and to talk with her and gaze upon her in her fathers presence but he made no attempt to see her alone nor in any other way changed his conduct towards her from what it had been since the beginning perhaps the girl was a little disappointed and perhaps not unjustly and yet if it had been enough to be always in the thoughts of another person and so pervade and alter his whole life she might have been thoroughly contented for she was never out of wills mind for an instant he sat over the stream and watched the dust of the eddy and the poised fish and straining weeds he wandered out alone into the purple even with all the blackbirds piping round him in the wood he rose early in the morning and saw the sky turn from grey to gold and the light leap upon the hilltops and all the while he kept wondering if he had never seen such things before or how it was that they should look so different now the sound of his own millwheel or of the wind among the trees confounded and charmed his heart the most enchanting thoughts presented themselves unbidden in his mind he was so happy that he could not sleep at night and so restless that he could hardly sit still out of her company and yet it seemed as if he avoided her rather than sought her out  one day as he was coming home from a ramble will found marjory in the garden picking flowers and as he came up with her slackened his pace and continued walking by her side  you like flowers he said  indeed i love them dearly she replied do you  why no said he not so much they are a very small affair when all is done i can fancy people caring for them greatly but not doing as you are just now  how she asked pausing and looking up at him  plucking them said he they are a deal better off where they are and look a deal prettier if you go to that  i wish to have them for my own she answered to carry them near my heart and keep them in my room they tempt me when they grow here they seem to say come and do something with us but once i have cut them and put them by the charm is laid and i can look at them with quite an easy heart  you wish to possess them replied will in order to think no more about them its a bit like killing the goose with the golden eggs its a bit like what i wished to do when i was a boy because i had a fancy for looking out over the plain i wished to go down therewhere i couldnt look out over it any longer was not that fine reasoning dear dear if they only thought of it all the world would do like me and you would let your flowers alone just as i stay up here in the mountains suddenly he broke off sharp by the lord he cried and when she asked him what was wrong he turned the question off and walked away into the house with rather a humorous expression of face  he was silent at table and after the night had fallen and the stars had come out overhead he walked up and down for hours in the courtyard and garden with an uneven pace there was still a light in the window of marjorys room one little oblong patch of orange in a world of dark blue hills and silver starlight wills mind ran a great deal on the window but his thoughts were not very loverlike  there she is in her room he thought and there are the stars overheada blessing upon both both were good influences in his life both soothed and braced him in his profound contentment with the world and what more should he desire with either the fat young man and his counsels were so present to his mind that he threw back his head and putting his hands before his mouth shouted aloud to the populous heavens whether from the position of his head or the sudden strain of the exertion he seemed to see a momentary shock among the stars and a diffusion of frosty light pass from one to another along the sky at the same instant a corner of the blind was lifted and lowered again at once he laughed a loud hoho one and another thought will the stars tremble and the blind goes up why before heaven what a great magician i must be now if i were only a fool should not i be in a pretty way and he went off to bed chuckling to himself if i were only a fool  the next morning pretty early he saw her once more in the garden and sought her out  i have been thinking about getting married he began abruptly and after having turned it all over i have made up my mind its not worth while  she turned upon him for a single moment but his radiant kindly appearance would under the circumstances have disconcerted an angel and she looked down again upon the ground in silence he could see her tremble  i hope you dont mind he went on a little taken aback you ought not i have turned it all over and upon my soul theres nothing in it we should never be one whit nearer than we are just now and if i am a wise man nothing like so happy  it is unnecessary to go round about with me she said i very well remember that you refused to commit yourself and now that i see you were mistaken and in reality have never cared for me i can only feel sad that i have been so far misled  i ask your pardon said will stoutly you do not understand my meaning as to whether i have ever loved you or not i must leave that to others but for one thing my feeling is not changed and for another you may make it your boast that you have made my whole life and character something different from what they were i mean what i say no less i do not think getting married is worth while i would rather you went on living with your father so that i could walk over and see you once or maybe twice a week as people go to church and then we should both be all the happier between whiles thats my notion but ill marry you if you will he added  do you know that you are insulting me she broke out  not i marjory said he if there is anything in a clear conscience not i i offer all my hearts best affection you can take it or want it though i suspect its beyond either your power or mine to change what has once been done and set me fancyfree ill marry you if you like but i tell you again and again its not worth while and we had best stay friends though i am a quiet man i have noticed a heap of things in my life trust in me and take things as i propose or if you dont like that say the word and ill marry you out of hand  there was a considerable pause and will who began to feel uneasy began to grow angry in consequence  it seems you are too proud to say your mind he said believe me thats a pity a clean shrift makes simple living can a man be more downright or honourable to a woman than i have been i have said my say and given you your choice do you want me to marry you or will you take my friendship as i think best or have you had enough of me for good speak out for the dear gods sake you know your father told you a girl should speak her mind in these affairs  she seemed to recover herself at that turned without a word walked rapidly through the garden and disappeared into the house leaving will in some confusion as to the result he walked up and down the garden whistling softly to himself sometimes he stopped and contemplated the sky and hilltops sometimes he went down to the tail of the weir and sat there looking foolishly in the water all this dubiety and perturbation was so foreign to his nature and the life which he had resolutely chosen for himself that he began to regret marjorys arrival after all he thought i was as happy as a man need be i could come down here and watch my fishes all day long if i wanted i was as settled and contented as my old mill  marjory came down to dinner looking very trim and quiet and no sooner were all three at table than she made her father a speech with her eyes fixed upon her plate but showing no other sign of embarrassment or distress  father she began mr will and i have been talking things over we see that we have each made a mistake about our feelings and he has agreed at my request to give up all idea of marriage and be no more than my very good friend as in the past you see there is no shadow of a quarrel and indeed i hope we shall see a great deal of him in the future for his visits will always be welcome in our house of course father you will know best but perhaps we should do better to leave mr wills house for the present i believe after what has passed we should hardly be agreeable inmates for some days  will who had commanded himself with difficulty from the first broke out upon this into an inarticulate noise and raised one hand with an appearance of real dismay as if he were about to interfere and contradict but she checked him at once looking up at him with a swift glance and an angry flush upon her cheek  you will perhaps have the good grace she said to let me explain these matters for myself  will was put entirely out of countenance by her expression and the ring of her voice he held his peace concluding that there were some things about this girl beyond his comprehensionin which he was exactly right  the poor parson was quite crestfallen he tried to prove that this was no more than a true lovers tiff which would pass off before night and when he was dislodged from that position he went on to argue that where there was no quarrel there could be no call for a separation for the good man liked both his entertainment and his host it was curious to see how the girl managed them saying little all the time and that very quietly and yet twisting them round her finger and insensibly leading them wherever she would by feminine tact and generalship it scarcely seemed to have been her doingit seemed as if things had merely so fallen outthat she and her father took their departure that same afternoon in a farmcart and went farther down the valley to wait until their own house was ready for them in another hamlet but will had been observing closely and was well aware of her dexterity and resolution when he found himself alone he had a great many curious matters to turn over in his mind he was very sad and solitary to begin with all the interest had gone out of his life and he might look up at the stars as long as he pleased he somehow failed to find support or consolation and then he was in such a turmoil of spirit about marjory he had been puzzled and irritated at her behaviour and yet he could not keep himself from admiring it he thought he recognised a fine perverse angel in that still soul which he had never hitherto suspected and though he saw it was an influence that would fit but ill with his own life of artificial calm he could not keep himself from ardently desiring to possess it like a man who has lived among shadows and now meets the sun he was both pained and delighted  as the days went forward he passed from one extreme to another now pluming himself on the strength of his determination now despising his timid and silly caution the former was perhaps the true thought of his heart and represented the regular tenor of the mans reflections but the latter burst forth from time to time with an unruly violence and then he would forget all consideration and go up and down his house and garden or walk among the firwoods like one who is beside himself with remorse to equable steadyminded will this state of matters was intolerable and he determined at whatever cost to bring it to an end so one warm summer afternoon he put on his best clothes took a thorn switch in his hand and set out down the valley by the river as soon as he had taken his determination he had regained at a bound his customary peace of heart and he enjoyed the bright weather and the variety of the scene without any admixture of alarm or unpleasant eagerness it was nearly the same to him how the matter turned out if she accepted him he would have to marry her this time which perhaps was all for the best if she refused him he would have done his utmost and might follow his own way in the future with an untroubled conscience he hoped on the whole she would refuse him and then again as he saw the brown roof which sheltered her peeping through some willows at an angle of the stream he was half inclined to reverse the wish and more than halfashamed of himself for this infirmity of purpose  marjory seemed glad to see him and gave him her hand without affectation or delay  i have been thinking about this marriage he began  so have i she answered and i respect you more and more for a very wise man you understood me better than i understood myself and i am now quite certain that things are all for the best as they are  at the same time ventured will  you must be tired she interrupted take a seat and let me fetch you a glass of wine the afternoon is so warm and i wish you not to be displeased with your visit you must come quite often once a week if you can spare the time i am always so glad to see my friends  oh very well thought will to himself it appears i was right after all and he paid a very agreeable visit walked home again in capital spirits and gave himself no further concern about the matter  for nearly three years will and marjory continued on these terms seeing each other once or twice a week without any word of love between them and for all that time i believe will was nearly as happy as a man can be he rather stinted himself the pleasure of seeing her and he would often walk halfway over to the parsonage and then back again as if to whet his appetite indeed there was one corner of the road whence he could see the churchspire wedged into a crevice of the valley between sloping firwoods with a triangular snatch of plain by way of background which he greatly affected as a place to sit and moralise in before returning homewards and the peasants got so much into the habit of finding him there in the twilight that they gave it the name of will o the mills corner  at the end of the three years marjory played him a sad trick by suddenly marrying somebody else will kept his countenance bravely and merely remarked that for as little as he knew of women he had acted very prudently in not marrying her himself three years before she plainly knew very little of her own mind and in spite of a deceptive manner was as fickle and flighty as the rest of them he had to congratulate himself on an escape he said and would take a higher opinion of his own wisdom in consequence but at heart he was reasonably displeased moped a good deal for a month or two and fell away in flesh to the astonishment of his servinglads  it was perhaps a year after this marriage that will was awakened late one night by the sound of a horse galloping on the road followed by precipitate knocking at the inndoor he opened his window and saw a farmservant mounted and holding a led horse by the bridle who told him to make what haste he could and go along with him for marjory was dying and had sent urgently to fetch him to her bedside will was no horseman and made so little speed upon the way that the poor young wife was very near her end before he arrived but they had some minutes talk in private and he was present and wept very bitterly while she breathed her last       death   year after year went away into nothing with great explosions and outcries in the cities on the plain red revolt springing up and being suppressed in blood battle swaying hither and thither patient astronomers in observatory towers picking out and christening new stars plays being performed in lighted theatres people being carried into hospital on stretchers and all the usual turmoil and agitation of mens lives in crowded centres up in wills valley only the winds and seasons made an epoch the fish hung in the swift stream the birds circled overhead the pinetops rustled underneath the stars the tall hills stood over all and will went to and fro minding his wayside inn until the snow began to thicken on his head his heart was young and vigorous and if his pulses kept a sober time they still beat strong and steady in his wrists he carried a ruddy stain on either cheek like a ripe apple he stooped a little but his step was still firm and his sinewy hands were reached out to all men with a friendly pressure his face was covered with those wrinkles which are got in open air and which rightly looked at are no more than a sort of permanent sunburning such wrinkles heighten the stupidity of stupid faces but to a person like will with his clear eyes and smiling mouth only give another charm by testifying to a simple and easy life his talk was full of wise sayings he had a taste for other people and other people had a taste for him when the valley was full of tourists in the season there were merry nights in wills arbour and his views which seemed whimsical to his neighbours were often enough admired by learned people out of towns and colleges indeed he had a very noble old age and grew daily better known so that his fame was heard of in the cities of the plain and young men who had been summer travellers spoke together in cafés of will o the mill and his rough philosophy many and many an invitation you may be sure he had but nothing could tempt him from his upland valley he would shake his head and smile over his tobaccopipe with a deal of meaning you come too late he would answer i am a dead man now i have lived and died already fifty years ago you would have brought my heart into my mouth and now you do not even tempt me but that is the object of long living that man should cease to care about life and again there is only one difference between a long life and a good dinner that in the dinner the sweets come last or once more when i was a boy i was a bit puzzled and hardly knew whether it was myself or the world that was curious and worth looking into now i know it is myself and stick to that  he never showed any symptom of frailty but kept stalwart and firm to the last but they say he grew less talkative towards the end and would listen to other people by the hour in an amused and sympathetic silence only when he did speak it was more to the point and more charged with old experience he drank a bottle of wine gladly above all at sunset on the hilltop or quite late at night under the stars in the arbour the sight of something attractive and unattainable seasoned his enjoyment he would say and he professed he had lived long enough to admire a candle all the more when he could compare it with a planet  one night in his seventysecond year he awoke in bed in such uneasiness of body and mind that he arose and dressed himself and went out to meditate in the arbour it was pitch dark without a star the river was swollen and the wet woods and meadows loaded the air with perfume it had thundered during the day and it promised more thunder for the morrow a murky stifling night for a man of seventytwo whether it was the weather or the wakefulness or some little touch of fever in his old limbs wills mind was besieged by tumultuous and crying memories his boyhood the night with the fat young man the death of his adopted parents the summer days with marjory and many of those small circumstances which seem nothing to another and are yet the very gist of a mans own life to himselfthings seen words heard looks misconstruedarose from their forgotten corners and usurped his attention the dead themselves were with him not merely taking part in this thin show of memory that defiled before his brain but revisiting his bodily senses as they do in profound and vivid dreams the fat young man leaned his elbows on the table opposite marjory came and went with an apronful of flowers between the garden and the arbour he could hear the old parson knocking out his pipe or blowing his resonant nose the tide of his consciousness ebbed and flowed he was sometimes halfasleep and drowned in his recollections of the past and sometimes he was broad awake wondering at himself but about the middle of the night he was startled by the voice of the dead miller calling to him out of the house as he used to do on the arrival of custom the hallucination was so perfect that will sprang from his seat and stood listening for the summons to be repeated and as he listened he became conscious of another noise besides the brawling of the river and the ringing in his feverish ears it was like the stir of horses and the creaking of harness as though a carriage with an impatient team had been brought up upon the road before the courtyard gate at such an hour upon this rough and dangerous pass the supposition was no better than absurd and will dismissed it from his mind and resumed his seat upon the arbour chair and sleep closed over him again like running water he was once again awakened by the dead millers call thinner and more spectral than before and once again he heard the noise of an equipage upon the road and so thrice and four times the same dream or the same fancy presented itself to his senses until at length smiling to himself as when one humours a nervous child he proceeded towards the gate to set his uncertainty at rest  from the arbour to the gate was no great distance and yet it took will some time it seemed as if the dead thickened around him in the court and crossed his path at every step for first he was suddenly surprised by an overpowering sweetness of heliotropes it was as if his garden had been planted with this flower from end to end and the hot damp night had drawn forth all their perfumes in a breath now the heliotrope had been marjorys favourite flower and since her death not one of them had ever been planted in wills ground  i must be going crazy he thought poor marjory and her heliotropes  and with that he raised his eyes towards the window that had once been hers if he had been bewildered before he was now almost terrified for there was a light in the room the window was an orange oblong as of yore and the corner of the blind was lifted and let fall as on the night when he stood and shouted to the stars in his perplexity the illusion only endured an instant but it left him somewhat unmanned rubbing his eyes and staring at the outline of the house and the black night behind it while he thus stood and it seemed as if he must have stood there quite a long time there came a renewal of the noises on the road and he turned in time to meet a stranger who was advancing to meet him across the court there was something like the outline of a great carriage discernible on the road behind the stranger and above that a few black pinetops like so many plumes  master will asked the newcomer in brief military fashion  that same sir answered will can i do anything to serve you  i have heard you much spoken of master will returned the other much spoken of and well and though i have both hands full of business i wish to drink a bottle of wine with you in your arbour before i go i shall introduce myself  will led the way to the trellis and got a lamp lighted and a bottle uncorked he was not altogether unused to such complimentary interviews and hoped little enough from this one being schooled by many disappointments a sort of cloud had settled on his wits and prevented him from remembering the strangeness of the hour he moved like a person in his sleep and it seemed as if the lamp caught fire and the bottle came uncorked with the facility of thought still he had some curiosity about the appearance of his visitor and tried in vain to turn the light into his face either he handled the lamp clumsily or there was a dimness over his eyes but he could make out little more than a shadow at table with him he stared and stared at this shadow as he wiped out the glasses and began to feel cold and strange about the heart the silence weighed upon him for he could hear nothing now not even the river but the drumming of his own arteries in his ears  heres to you said the stranger roughly  here is my service sir replied will sipping his wine which somehow tasted oddly  i understand you are a very positive fellow pursued the stranger  will made answer with a smile of some satisfaction and a little nod  so am i continued the other and it is the delight of my heart to tramp on peoples corns i will have nobody positive but myself not one i have crossed the whims in my time of kings and generals and great artists and what would you say he went on if i had come up here on purpose to cross yours  will had it on his tongue to make a sharp rejoinder but the politeness of an old innkeeper prevailed and he held his peace and made answer with a civil gesture of the hand  i have said the stranger and if i did not hold you in a particular esteem i should make no words about the matter it appears you pride yourself on staying where you are you mean to stick by your inn now i mean you shall come for a turn with me in my barouche and before this bottles empty so you shall  that would be an odd thing to be sure replied will with a chuckle why sir i have grown here like an old oaktree the devil himself could hardly root me up and for all i perceive you are a very entertaining old gentleman i would wager you another bottle you lose your pains with me  the dimness of wills eyesight had been increasing all this while but he was somehow conscious of a sharp and chilling scrutiny which irritated and yet overmastered him  you need not think he broke out suddenly in an explosive febrile manner that startled and alarmed himself that i am a stayathome because i fear anything under god god knows i am tired enough of it all and when the time comes for a longer journey than ever you dream of i reckon i shall find myself prepared  the stranger emptied his glass and pushed it away from him he looked down for a little and then leaning over the table tapped will three times upon the forearm with a single finger the time has come he said solemnly  an ugly thrill spread from the spot he touched the tones of his voice were dull and startling and echoed strangely in wills heart  i beg your pardon he said with some discomposure what do you mean  look at me and you will find your eyesight swim raise your hand it is deadheavy this is your last bottle of wine master will and your last night upon the earth  you are a doctor quavered will  the best that ever was replied the other for i cure both mind and body with the same prescription i take away all pain and i forgive all sins and where my patients have gone wrong in life i smooth out all complications and set them free again upon their feet  i have no need of you said will  a time comes for all men master will replied the doctor when the helm is taken out of their hands for you because you were prudent and quiet it has been long of coming and you have had long to discipline yourself for its reception you have seen what is to be seen about your mill you have sat close all your days like a hare in its form but now that is at an end and added the doctor getting on his feet you must arise and come with me  you are a strange physician said will looking steadfastly upon his guest  i am a natural law he replied and people call me death  why did you not tell me so at first cried will i have been waiting for you these many years give me your hand and welcome  lean upon my arm said the stranger for already your strength abates lean on me as heavily as you need for though i am old i am very strong it is but three steps to my carriage and there all your trouble ends why will he added i have been yearning for you as if you were my own son and of all the men that ever i came for in my long days i have come for you most gladly i am caustic and sometimes offend people at first sight but i am a good friend at heart to such as you  since marjory was taken returned will i declare before god you were the only friend i had to look for  so the pair went arminarm across the courtyard  one of the servants awoke about this time and heard the noise of horses pawing before he dropped asleep again all down the valley that night there was a rushing as of a smooth and steady wind descending towards the plain and when the world rose next morning sure enough will o the mill had gone at last upon his travels       the treasure of franchard       the treasure of franchard       chapter i    by the dying mountebank   they had sent for the doctor from bourron before six about eight some villagers came round for the performance and were told how matters stood it seemed a liberty for a mountebank to fall ill like real people and they made off again in dudgeon by ten madame tentaillon was gravely alarmed and had sent down the street for doctor desprez  the doctor was at work over his manuscripts in one corner of the little diningroom and his wife was asleep over the fire in another when the messenger arrived  sapristi said the doctor you should have sent for me before it was a case for hurry and he followed the messenger as he was in his slippers and skullcap  the inn was not thirty yards away but the messenger did not stop there he went in at one door and out by another into the court and then led the way by a flight of steps beside the stable to the loft where the mountebank lay sick if doctor desprez were to live a thousand years he would never forget his arrival in that room for not only was the scene picturesque but the moment made a date in his existence we reckon our lives i hardly know why from the date of our first sorry appearance in society as if from a first humiliation for no actor can come upon the stage with a worse grace not to go further back which would be judged too curious there are subsequently many moving and decisive accidents in the lives of all which would make as logical a period as this of birth and here for instance doctor desprez a man past forty who had made what is called a failure in life and was moreover married found himself at a new point of departure when he opened the door of the loft above tentaillons stable  it was a large place lighted only by a single candle set upon the floor the mountebank lay on his back upon a pallet a large man with a quixotic nose inflamed with drinking madame tentaillon stooped over him applying a hot water and mustard embrocation to his feet and on a chair close by sat a little fellow of eleven or twelve with his feet dangling these three were the only occupants except the shadows but the shadows were a company in themselves the extent of the room exaggerated them to a gigantic size and from the low position of the candle the light struck upwards and produced deformed foreshortenings the mountebanks profile was enlarged upon the wall in caricature and it was strange to see his nose shorten and lengthen as the flame was blown about by draughts as for madame tentaillon her shadow was no more than a gross hump of shoulders with now and again a hemisphere of head the chairlegs were spindled out as long as stilts and the boy sat perched atop of them like a cloud in the corner of the roof  it was the boy who took the doctors fancy he had a great arched skull the forehead and the hands of a musician and a pair of haunting eyes it was not merely that these eyes were large or steady or the softest ruddy brown there was a look in them besides which thrilled the doctor and made him half uneasy he was sure he had seen such a look before and yet he could not remember how or where it was as if this boy who was quite a stranger to him had the eyes of an old friend or an old enemy and the boy would give him no peace he seemed profoundly indifferent to what was going on or rather abstracted from it in a superior contemplation beating gently with his feet against the bars of the chair and holding his hands folded on his lap but for all that his eyes kept following the doctor about the room with a thoughtful fixity of gaze desprez could not tell whether he was fascinating the boy or the boy was fascinating him he busied himself over the sick man he put questions he felt the pulse he jested he grew a little hot and swore and still whenever he looked round there were the brown eyes waiting for his with the same inquiring melancholy gaze  at last the doctor hit on the solution at a leap he remembered the look now the little fellow although he was as straight as a dart had the eyes that go usually with a crooked back he was not at all deformed and yet a deformed person seemed to be looking at you from below his brows the doctor drew a long breath he was so much relieved to find a theory for he loved theories and to explain away his interest  for all that he despatched the invalid with unusual haste and still kneeling with one knee on the floor turned a little round and looked the boy over at his leisure the boy was not in the least put out but looked placidly back at the doctor  is this your father asked desprez  oh no returned the boy my master  are you fond of him continued the doctor  no sir said the boy  madame tentaillon and desprez exchanged expressive glances  that is bad my man resumed the latter with a shade of sternness every one should be fond of the dying or conceal their sentiments and your master here is dying if i have watched a bird a little while stealing my cherries i have a thought of disappointment when he flies away over my garden wall and i see him steer for the forest and vanish how much more a creature such as this so strong so astute so richly endowed with faculties when i think that in a few hours the speech will be silenced the breath extinct and even the shadow vanished from the wall i who never saw him this lady who knew him only as a guest are touched with some affection  the boy was silent for a little and appeared to be reflecting  you did not know him he replied at last he was a bad man  he is a little pagan said the landlady for that matter they are all the same these mountebanks tumblers artists and what not they have no interior  but the doctor was still scrutinising the little pagan his eyebrows knotted and uplifted  what is your name he asked  jeanmarie said the lad  desprez leaped upon him with one of his sudden flashes of excitement and felt his head all over from an ethnological point of view  celtic celtic he said  celtic cried madame tentaillon who had perhaps confounded the word with hydrocephalous poor lad is it dangerous  that depends returned the doctor grimly and then once more addressing the boy and what do you do for your living jeanmarie he inquired  i tumble was the answer  so tumble repeated desprez probably healthful i hazard the guess madame tentaillon that tumbling is a healthful way of life and have you never done anything else but tumble  before i learned that i used to steal answered jeanmarie gravely  upon my word cried the doctor you are a nice little man for your agemadame when my confrère comes from bourron you will communicate my unfavourable opinion i leave the case in his hands but of course on any alarming symptom above all if there should be a sign of rally do not hesitate to knock me up i am a doctor no longer i thank god but i have been one goodnight madamegood sleep to you jeanmarie       chapter ii    morning talk   doctor desprez always rose early before the smoke arose before the first cart rattled over the bridge to the days labour in the fields he was to be found wandering in his garden now he would pick a bunch of grapes now he would eat a big pear under the trellis now he would draw all sorts of fancies on the path with the end of his cane now he would go down and watch the river running endlessly past the timber landingplace at which he moored his boat there was no time he used to say for making theories like the early morning i rise earlier than any one else in the village he once boasted it is a fair consequence that i know more and wish to do less with my knowledge  the doctor was a connoisseur of sunrises and loved a good theatrical effect to usher in the day he had a theory of dew by which he could predict the weather indeed most things served him to that end the sound of the bells from all the neighbouring villages the smell of the forest the visits and the behaviour of both birds and fishes the look of the plants in his garden the disposition of cloud the colour of the light and last although not least the arsenal of meteorological instruments in a louvreboarded hutch upon the lawn ever since he had settled at gretz he had been growing more and more into the local meteorologist the unpaid champion of the local climate he thought at first there was no place so healthful in the arrondissement by the end of the second year he protested there was none so wholesome in the whole department and for some time before he met jeanmarie he had been prepared to challenge all france and the better part of europe for a rival to his chosen spot  doctor he would saydoctor is a foul word it should not be used to ladies it implies disease i remark it as a flaw in our civilisation that we have not the proper horror of disease now i for my part have washed my hands of it i have renounced my laureation i am no doctor i am only a worshipper of the true goddess hygieia ah believe me it is she who has the cestus and here in this exiguous hamlet has she placed her shrine here she dwells and lavishes her gifts here i walk with her in the early morning and she shows me how strong she has made the peasants how fruitful she has made the fields how the trees grow up tall and comely under her eyes and the fishes in the river become clean and agile at her presencerheumatism he would cry on some malapert interruption oh yes i believe we do have a little rheumatism that could hardly be avoided you know on a river and of course the place stands a little low and the meadows are marshy theres no doubt but my dear sir look at bourron bourron stands high bourron is close to the forest plenty of ozone there you would say well compared with gretz bourron is a perfect shambles  the morning after he had been summoned to the dying mountebank the doctor visited the wharf at the tail of his garden and had a long look at the running water this he called prayer but whether his adorations were addressed to the goddess hygieia or some more orthodox deity never plainly appeared for he had uttered doubtful oracles sometimes declaring that a river was the type of bodily health sometimes extolling it as the great moral preacher continually preaching peace continuity and diligence to mans tormented spirits after he had watched a mile or so of the clear water running by before his eyes seen a fish or two come to the surface with a gleam of silver and sufficiently admired the long shadows of the trees falling half across the river from the opposite bank with patches of moving sunlight in between he strolled once more up the garden and through his house into the street feeling cool and renovated  the sound of his feet upon the causeway began the business of the day for the village was still sound asleep the church tower looked very airy in the sunlight a few birds that turned about it seemed to swim in an atmosphere of more than usual rarity and the doctor walking in long transparent shadows filled his lungs amply and proclaimed himself well contented with the morning  on one of the posts before tentaillons carriage entry he espied a little dark figure perched in a meditative attitude and immediately recognised jeanmarie  aha he said stopping before him humorously with a hand on either knee so we rise early in the morning do we it appears to me that we have all the vices of a philosopher  the boy got to his feet and made a grave salutation  and how is our patient asked desprez  it appeared the patient was about the same  and why do you rise early in the morning he pursued  jeanmarie after a long silence professed that he hardly knew  you hardly know repeated desprez we hardly know anything my man until we try to learn interrogate your consciousness come push me this inquiry home do you like it  yes said the boy slowly yes i like it  and why do you like it continued the doctor we are now pursuing the socratic method why do you like it  it is quiet answered jeanmarie and i have nothing to do and then i feel as if i were good  doctor desprez took a seat on the post at the opposite side he was beginning to take an interest in the talk for the boy plainly thought before he spoke and tried to answer truly it appears you have a taste for feeling good said the doctor now there you puzzle me extremely for i thought you said you were a thief and the two are incompatible  is it very bad to steal asked jeanmarie  such is the general opinion little boy replied the doctor  no but i mean as i stole explained the other for i had no choice i think it is surely right to have bread it must be right to have bread there comes so plain a want of it and then they beat me cruelly if i returned with nothing he added i was not ignorant of right and wrong for before that i had been well taught by a priest who was very kind to me the doctor made a horrible grimace at the word priest but it seemed to me when one had nothing to eat and was beaten it was a different affair i would not have stolen for tartlets i believe but any one would steal for bakers bread  and so i suppose said the doctor with a rising sneer you prayed god to forgive you and explained the case to him at length  why sir asked jeanmarie i do not see  your priest would see however retorted desprez  would he asked the boy troubled for the first time i should have thought god would have known  eh snarled the doctor  i should have thought god would have understood me replied the other you do not i see but then it was god that made me think so was it not  little boy little boy said dr desprez i told you already you had the vices of philosophy if you display the virtues also i must go i am a student of the blessed laws of health an observer of plain and temperate nature in her common walks and i cannot preserve my equanimity in presence of a monster do you understand  no sir said the boy  i will make my meaning clear to you replied the doctor look there at the skybehind the belfry first where it is so light and then up and up turning your chin back right to the top of the dome where it is already as blue as at noon is not that a beautiful colour does it not please the heart we have seen it all our lives until it has grown in with our familiar thoughts now changing his tone suppose that sky to become suddenly of a live and fiery amber like the colour of clear coals and growing scarlet towards the topi do not say it would be any the less beautiful but would you like it as well  i suppose not answered jeanmarie  neither do i like you returned the doctor roughly i hate all odd people and you are the most curious little boy in all the world  jeanmarie seemed to ponder for a while and then he raised his head again and looked over at the doctor with an air of candid inquiry but are not you a very curious gentleman he asked  the doctor threw away his stick bounded on the boy clasped him to his bosom and kissed him on both cheeks admirable admirable imp he cried what a morning what an hour for a theorist of fortytwo no he continued apostrophising heaven i did not know such boys existed i was ignorant they made them so i had doubted of my race and now it is like he added picking up his stick like a lovers meeting i have bruised my favourite staff in that moment of enthusiasm the injury however is not grave he caught the boy looking at him in obvious wonder embarrassment and alarm hullo said he why do you look at me like that egad i believe the boy despises me do you despise me boy  oh no replied jeanmarie seriously only i do not understand  you must excuse me sir returned the doctor with gravity i am still so young oh hang him he added to himself and he took his seat again and observed the boy sardonically he has spoiled the quiet of my morning thought he i shall be nervous all day and have a febricule when i digest let me compose myself and so he dismissed his preoccupations by an effort of the will which he had long practised and let his soul roam abroad in the contemplation of the morning he inhaled the air tasting it critically as a connoisseur tastes a vintage and prolonging the expiration with hygienic gusto he counted the little flecks of cloud along the sky he followed the movements of the birds round the church towermaking long sweeps hanging poised or turning airy somersaults in fancy and beating the wind with imaginary pinions and in this way he regained peace of mind and animal composure conscious of his limbs conscious of the sight of his eyes conscious that the air had a cool taste like a fruit at the top of his throat and at last in complete abstraction he began to sing the doctor had but one airmalbrouck sen vaten guerre even with that he was on terms of mere politeness and his musical exploits were always reserved for moments when he was alone and entirely happy  he was recalled to earth rudely by a pained expression on the boys face what do you think of my singing he inquired stopping in the middle of a note and then after he had waited some little while and received no answer what do you think of my singing he repeated imperiously  i do not like it faltered jeanmarie  oh come cried the doctor possibly you are a performer yourself  i sing better than that replied the boy  the doctor eyed him for some seconds in stupefaction he was aware that he was angry and blushed for himself in consequence which made him angrier if this is how you address your master he said at last with a shrug and a flourish of his arms  i do not speak to him at all returned the boy i do not like him  then you like me snapped doctor desprez with unusual eagerness  i do not know answered jeanmarie  the doctor rose i shall wish you a goodmorning he said you are too much for me perhaps you have blood in your veins perhaps celestial ichor or perhaps you circulate nothing more gross than respirable air but of one thing i am inexpugnably assuredthat you are no human being no boyshaking his stick at himyou are not a human being write write it in your memoryi am not a human beingi have no pretension to be a human beingi am a dive a dream an angel an acrostic an illusionwhat you please but not a human being and so accept my humble salutations and farewell  and with that the doctor made off along the street in some emotion and the boy stood mentally gaping where he left him       chapter iii    the adoption   madame desprez who answered to the christian name of anastasie presented an agreeable type of her sex exceedingly wholesome to look upon a stout brune with cool smooth cheeks steady dark eyes and hands that neither art nor nature could improve she was the sort of person over whom adversity passes like a summer cloud she might in the worst of conjunctions knit her brows into one vertical furrow for a moment but the next it would be gone she had much of the placidity of a contented nun with little of her piety however for anastasie was of a very mundane nature fond of oysters and old wine and somewhat bold pleasantries and devoted to her husband for her own sake rather than for his she was imperturbably goodnatured but had no idea of selfsacrifice to live in that pleasant old house with a green garden behind and bright flowers about the window to eat and drink of the best to gossip with a neighbour for a quarter of an hour never to wear stays or a dress except when she went to fontainebleau shopping to be kept in a continual supply of racy novels and to be married to dr desprez and have no ground of jealousy filled the cup of her nature to the brim those who had known the doctor in bachelor days when he had aired quite as many theories but of a different order attributed his present philosophy to the study of anastasie it was her brute enjoyment that he rationalised and perhaps vainly imitated  madame desprez was an artist in the kitchen and made coffee to a nicety she had a knack of tidiness with which she had infected the doctor everything was in its place everything capable of polish shone gloriously and dust was a thing banished from her empire aline their single servant had no other business in the world but to scour and burnish so doctor desprez lived in his house like a fatted calf warmed and cosseted to his hearts content  the midday meal was excellent there was a ripe melon a fish from the river in a memorable béarnaise sauce a fat fowl in a fricassee and a dish of asparagus followed by some fruit the doctor drank half a bottle plus one glass the wife half a bottle minus the same quantity which was a marital privilege of an excellent côterôtie seven years old then the coffee was brought and a flask of chartreuse for madame for the doctor despised and distrusted such decoctions and then aline left the wedded pair to the pleasures of memory and digestion  it is a very fortunate circumstance my cherished one observed the doctorthis coffee is adorablea very fortunate circumstance upon the wholeanastasie i beseech you go without that poison for today only one day and you will feel the benefit i pledge my reputation  what is this fortunate circumstance my friend inquired anastasie not heeding his protest which was of daily recurrence  that we have no children my beautiful replied the doctor i think of it more and more as the years go on and with more and more gratitude towards the power that dispenses such afflictions your health my darling my studious quiet our little kitchen delicacies how they would all have suffered how they would all have been sacrificed and for what children are the last word of human imperfection health flees before their face they cry my dear they put vexatious questions they demand to be fed to be washed to be educated to have their noses blown and then when the time comes they break our hearts as i break this piece of sugar a pair of professed egoists like you and me should avoid offspring like an infidelity  indeed said she and she laughed now that is like youto take credit for the thing you could not help  my dear returned the doctor solemnly we might have adopted  never cried madame never doctor with my consent if the child were my own flesh and blood i would not say no but to take another persons indiscretion on my shoulders my dear friend i have too much sense  precisely replied the doctor we both had and i am all the better pleased with our wisdom becausebecause he looked at her sharply  because what she asked with a faint premonition of danger  because i have found the right person said the doctor firmly and shall adopt him this afternoon  anastasie looked at him out of a mist you have lost your reason she said and there was a clang in her voice that seemed to threaten trouble  not so my dear he replied i retain its complete exercise to the proof instead of attempting to cloak my inconsistency i have by way of preparing you thrown it into strong relief you will there i think recognise the philosopher who has the ecstasy to call you wife the fact is i have been reckoning all this while without an accident i never thought to find a son of my own now last night i found one do not unnecessarily alarm yourself my dear he is not a drop of blood to me that i know it is his mind darling his mind that calls me father  his mind she repeated with a titter between scorn and hysterics his mind indeed henri is this an idiotic pleasantry or are you mad his mind and what of my mind  truly replied the doctor with a shrug you have your finger on the hitch he will be strikingly antipathetic to my ever beautiful anastasie she will never understand him he will never understand her you married the animal side of my nature dear and it is on the spiritual side that i find my affinity for jeanmarie so much so that to be perfectly frank i stand in some awe of him myself you will easily perceive that i am announcing a calamity for you do not he broke out in tones of real solicitudedo not give way to tears after a meal anastasie you will certainly give yourself a false digestion  anastasie controlled herself you know how willing i am to humour you she said in all reasonable matters but on this point  my dear love interrupted the doctor eager to prevent a refusal who wished to leave paris who made me give up cards and the opera and the boulevard and my social relations and all that was my life before i knew you have i been faithful have i been obedient have i not borne my doom with cheerfulness in all honesty anastasie have i not a right to a stipulation on my side i have and you know it i stipulate my son  anastasie was aware of defeat she struck her colours instantly you will break my heart she sighed  not in the least said he you will feel a trifling inconvenience for a month just as i did when i was first brought to this vile hamlet then your admirable sense and temper will prevail and i see you already as content as ever and making your husband the happiest of men  you know i can refuse you nothing she said with a last flicker of resistance nothing that will make you truly happier but will this are you sure my husband last night you say you found him he may be the worst of humbugs  i think not replied the doctor but do not suppose me so unwary as to adopt him out of hand i am i flatter myself a finished man of the world i have had all possibilities in view my plan is contrived to meet them all i take the lad as stableboy if he pilfer if he grumble if he desire to change i shall see i was mistaken i shall recognise him for no son of mine and send him tramping  you will never do so when the time comes said his wife i know your good heart  she reached out her hand to him with a sigh the doctor smiled as he took it and carried it to his lips he had gained his point with greater ease than he had dared to hope for perhaps the twentieth time he had proved the efficacy of his trusty argument his excalibur the hint of a return to paris six months in the capital for a man of the doctors antecedents and relations implied no less a calamity than total ruin anastasie had saved the remainder of his fortune by keeping him strictly in the country the very name of paris put her in a blue fear and she would have allowed her husband to keep a menagerie in the backgarden let alone adopting a stableboy rather than permit the question of return to be discussed  about four of the afternoon the mountebank rendered up his ghost he had never been conscious since his seizure doctor desprez was present at his last passage and declared the farce over then he took jeanmarie by the shoulder and led him out into the inn garden where there was a convenient bench beside the river here he sat him down and made the boy place himself on his left  jeanmarie he said very gravely this world is exceedingly vast and even france which is only a small corner of it is a great place for a little lad like you unfortunately it is full of eager shouldering people moving on and there are very few bakers shops for so many eaters your master is dead you are not fit to gain a living by yourself you do not wish to steal no your situation then is undesirable it is for the moment critical on the other hand you behold in me a man not old though elderly still enjoying the youth of the heart and the intelligence a man of instruction easily situated in this worlds affairs keeping a good tablea man neither as friend nor host to be despised i offer you your food and clothes and to teach you lessons in the evening which will be infinitely more to the purpose for a lad of your stamp than those of all the priests in europe i propose no wages but if ever you take a thought to leave me the door shall be open and i will give you a hundred francs to start the world upon in return i have an old horse and chaise which you would very speedily learn to clean and keep in order do not hurry yourself to answer and take it or leave it as you judge aright only remember this that i am no sentimentalist or charitable person but a man who lives rigorously to himself and that if i make the proposal it is for my own endsit is because i perceive clearly an advantage to myself and now reflect  i shall be very glad i do not see what else i can do i thank you sir most kindly and i will try to be useful said the boy  thank you said the doctor warmly rising at the same time and wiping his brow for he had suffered agonies while the thing hung in the wind a refusal after the scene at noon would have placed him in a ridiculous light before anastasie how hot and heavy is the evening to be sure i have always had a fancy to be a fish in summer jeanmarie here in the loing beside gretz i should lie under a waterlily and listen to the bells which must sound most delicately down below that would be a lifedo you not think so too  yes said jeanmarie  thank god you have imagination cried the doctor embracing the boy with his usual effusive warmth though it was a proceeding that seemed to disconcert the sufferer almost as much as if he had been an english schoolboy of the same age and now he added i will take you to my wife  madame desprez sat in the diningroom in a cool wrapper all the blinds were down and the tile floor had been recently sprinkled with water her eyes were half shut but she affected to be reading a novel as they entered though she was a bustling woman she enjoyed repose betweenwhiles and had a remarkable appetite for sleep  the doctor went through a solemn form of introduction adding for the benefit of both parties you must try to like each other for my sake  he is very pretty said anastasiewill you kiss me my pretty little fellow  the doctor was furious and dragged her into the passage are you a fool anastasie he said what is all this i hear about the tact of women heaven knows i have not met with it in my experience you address my little philosopher as if he were an infant he must be spoken to with more respect i tell you he must not be kissed and georgyporgyd like an ordinary child  i only did it to please you i am sure replied anastasie but i will try to do better  the doctor apologised for his warmth but i do wish him he continued to feel at home among us and really your conduct was so idiotic my cherished one and so utterly and distantly out of place that a saint might have been pardoned a little vehemence in disapproval do do tryif it is possible for a woman to understand young peoplebut of course it is not and i waste my breath hold your tongue as much as possible at least and observe my conduct narrowly it will serve you for a model  anastasie did as she was bidden and considered the doctors behaviour she observed that he embraced the boy three times in the course of the evening and managed generally to confound and abash the little fellow out of speech and appetite but she had the true womanly heroism in little affairs not only did she refrain from the cheap revenge of exposing the doctors errors to himself but she did her best to remove their illeffect on jeanmarie when desprez went out for his last breath of air before retiring for the night she came over to the boys side and took his hand  you must not be surprised or frightened by my husbands manners she said he is the kindest of men but so clever that he is sometimes difficult to understand you will soon grow used to him and then you will love him for that nobody can help as for me you may be sure i shall try to make you happy and will not bother you at all i think we should be excellent friends you and i i am not clever but i am very goodnatured will you give me a kiss  he held up his face and she took him in her arms and then began to cry the woman had spoken in complaisance but she had warmed to her own words and tenderness followed the doctor entering found them enlaced he concluded that his wife was in fault and he was just beginning in an awful voice anastasie when she looked up at him smiling with an upraised finger and he held his peace wondering while she led the boy to his attic       chapter iv    the education of a philosopher   the installation of the adopted stableboy was thus happily effected and the wheels of life continued to run smoothly in the doctors house jeanmarie did his horse and carriage duty in the morning sometimes helped in the housework sometimes walked abroad with the doctor to drink wisdom from the fountainhead and was introduced at night to the sciences and the dead tongues he retained his singular placidity of mind and manner he was rarely in fault but he made only a very partial progress in his studies and remained much of a stranger in the family  the doctor was a pattern of regularity all forenoon he worked on his great book the comparative pharmacopoeia or historical dictionary of all medicines which as yet consisted principally of slips of paper and pins when finished it was to fill many personable volumes and to combine antiquarian interest with professional utility but the doctor was studious of literary graces and the picturesque an anecdote a touch of manners a moral qualification or a sounding epithet was sure to be preferred before a piece of science a little more and he would have written the comparative pharmacopoeia in verse the article mummia for instance was already complete though the remainder of the work had not progressed beyond the letter a it was exceedingly copious and entertaining written with quaintness and colour exact erudite a literary article but it would hardly have afforded guidance to a practising physician of today the feminine good sense of his wife had led her to point this out with uncompromising sincerity for the dictionary was duly read aloud to her betwixt sleep and waking as it proceeded towards an infinitely distant completion and the doctor was a little sore on the subject of mummies and sometimes resented an allusion with asperity  after the midday meal and a proper period of digestion he walked sometimes alone sometimes accompanied by jeanmarie for madame would have preferred any hardship rather than walk  she was as i have said a very busy person continually occupied about material comforts and ready to drop asleep over a novel the instant she was disengaged this was the less objectionable as she never snored or grew distempered in complexion when she slept on the contrary she looked the very picture of luxurious and appetising ease and woke without a start to the perfect possession of her faculties i am afraid she was greatly an animal but she was a very nice animal to have about in this way she had little to do with jeanmarie but the sympathy which had been established between them on the first night remained unbroken they held occasional conversations mostly on household matters to the extreme disappointment of the doctor they occasionally sallied off together to that temple of debasing superstition the village church madame and he both in their sundays best drove twice a month to fontainebleau and returned laden with purchases and in short although the doctor still continued to regard them as irreconcilably antipathetic their relation was as intimate friendly and confidential as their natures suffered  i fear however that in her heart of hearts madame kindly despised and pitied the boy she had no admiration for his class of virtues she liked a smart polite forward roguish sort of boy cap in hand light of foot meeting the eye she liked volubility charm a little vicethe promise of a second doctor desprez and it was her indefeasible belief that jeanmarie was dull poor dear boy she had said once how sad it is that he should be so stupid she had never repeated that remark for the doctor had raged like a wild bull denouncing the brutal bluntness of her mind bemoaning his own fate to be so unequally mated with an ass and what touched anastasie more nearly menacing the table china by the fury of his gesticulations but she adhered silently to her opinion and when jeanmarie was sitting stolid blank but not unhappy over his unfinished tasks she would snatch her opportunity in the doctors absence go over to him put her arms about his neck lay her cheek to his and communicate her sympathy with his distress do not mind she would say i too am not at all clever and i can assure you that it makes no difference in life  the doctors view was naturally different that gentleman never wearied of the sound of his own voice which was to say the truth agreeable enough to hear he now had a listener who was not so cynically indifferent as anastasie and who sometimes put him on his mettle by the most relevant objections besides was he not educating the boy and education philosophers are agreed is the most philosophical of duties what can be more heavenly to poor mankind than to have ones hobby grow into a duty to the state then indeed do the ways of life become ways of pleasantness never had the doctor seen reason to be more content with his endowments philosophy flowed smoothly from his lips he was so agile a dialectician that he could trace his nonsense when challenged back to some root in sense and prove it to be a sort of flower upon his system he slipped out of antinomies like a fish and left his disciple marvelling at the rabbis depth  moreover deep down in his heart the doctor was disappointed with the illsuccess of his more formal education a boy chosen by so acute an observer for his aptitude and guided along the path of learning by so philosophic an instructor was bound by the nature of the universe to make a more obvious and lasting advance now jeanmarie was slow in all things impenetrable in others and his power of forgetting was fully on a level with his power to learn therefore the doctor cherished his peripatetic lectures to which the boy attended which he generally appeared to enjoy and by which he often profited  many and many were the talks they had together and health and moderation proved the subject of the doctors divagations to these he lovingly returned  i lead you he would say by the green pastures my system my beliefs my medicines are resumed in one phraseto avoid excess blessed nature healthy temperate nature abhors and exterminates excess human law in this matter imitates at a great distance her provisions and we must strive to supplement the efforts of the law yes boy we must be a law to ourselves and for our neighbourslex armataarmed emphatic tyrannous law if you see a crapulous human ruin snuffing dash from him his box the judge though in a way an admission of disease is less offensive to me than either the doctor or the priest above all the doctorthe doctor and the purulent trash and garbage of his pharmacopoeia pure airfrom the neighbourhood of a pinetum for the sake of the turpentineunadulterated wine and the reflections of an unsophisticated spirit in the presence of the works of naturethese my boy are the best medical appliances and the best religious comforts devote yourself to these hark there are the bells of bourron the wind is in the north it will be fair how clear and airy is the sound the nerves are harmonised and quieted the mind attuned to silence and observe how easily and regularly beats the heart your unenlightened doctor would see nothing in these sensations and yet you yourself perceive they are a part of health did you remember your cinchona this morning good cinchona also is a work of nature it is after all only the bark of a tree which we might gather for ourselves if we lived in the locality what a world is this though a professed atheist i delight to bear my testimony to the world look at the gratuitous remedies and pleasures that surround our path the river runs by the garden end our bath our fishpond our natural system of drainage there is a well in the court which sends up sparkling water from the earths very heart clean cool and with a little wine most wholesome the district is notorious for its salubrity rheumatism is the only prevalent complaint and i myself have never had a touch of it i tell youand my opinion is based upon the coldest clearest processes of reasonif i if you desired to leave this home of pleasures it would be the duty it would be the privilege of our best friend to prevent us with a pistol bullet  one beautiful june day they sat upon the hill outside the village the river as blue as heaven shone here and there among the foliage the indefatigable birds turned and flickered about gretz churchtower a healthy wind blew from over the forest and the sound of innumerable thousands of treetops and innumerable millions on millions of green leaves was abroad in the air and filled the ear with something between whispered speech and singing it seemed as if every blade of grass must hide a cigale and the fields rang merrily with their music jingling far and near as with the sleighbells of the fairy queen from their station on the slope the eye embraced a large space of poplared plain upon the one hand the waving hilltops of the forest on the other and gretz itself in the middle a handful of roofs under the bestriding arch of the blue heavens the place seemed dwindled to a toy it seemed incredible that people dwelt and could find room to turn or air to breathe in such a corner of the world the thought came home to the boy perhaps for the first time and he gave it words  how small it looks he sighed  ay replied the doctor small enough now yet it was once a walled city thriving full of furred burgesses and men in armour humming with affairswith tall spires for aught that i know and portly towers along the battlements a thousand chimneys ceased smoking at the curfewbell there were gibbets at the gate as thick as scarecrows in time of war the assault swarmed against it with ladders the arrows fell like leaves the defenders sallied hotly over the drawbridge each side uttered its cry as they plied their weapons do you know that the walls extended as far as the commanderie tradition so reports alas what a long way off is all this confusionnothing left of it but my quiet words spoken in your earand the town itself shrunk to the hamlet underneath us byandby came the english warsyou shall hear more of the english a stupid people who sometimes blundered into goodand gretz was taken sacked and burned it is the history of many towns but gretz never rose again it was never rebuilt its ruins were a quarry to serve the growth of rivals and the stones of gretz are now erect along the streets of nemours it gratifies me that our old house was the first to rise after the calamity when the town had come to an end it inaugurated the hamlet  i too am glad of that said jeanmarie  it should be the temple of the humbler virtues responded the doctor with a savoury gusto perhaps one of the reasons why i love my little hamlet as i do is that we have a similar history she and i have i told you that i was once rich  i do not think so answered jeanmarie i do not think i should have forgotten i am sorry you should have lost your fortune  sorry cried the doctor why i find i have scarce begun your education after all listen to me would you rather live in the old gretz or in the new free from the alarms of war with the green country at the door without noise passports the exactions of the soldiery or the jangle of the curfewbell to send us off to bed by sundown  i suppose i should prefer the new replied the boy  precisely returned the doctor so do i and in the same way i prefer my present moderate fortune to my former wealth golden mediocrity cried the adorable ancients and i subscribe to their enthusiasm have i not good wine good food good air the fields and the forest for my walk a house an admirable wife a boy whom i protest i cherish like a son now if i were still rich i should indubitably make my residence in parisyou know parisparis and paradise are not convertible terms this pleasant noise of the wind streaming among leaves changed into the grinding babel of the street the stupid glare of plaster substituted for this quiet pattern of greens and greys the nerves shattered the digestion falsifiedpicture the fall already you perceive the consequences the mind is stimulated the heart steps to a different measure and the man is himself no longer i have passionately studied myselfthe true business of philosophy i know my character as the musician knows the ventages of his flute should i return to paris i should ruin myself gambling nay i go furtheri should break the heart of my anastasie with infidelities  this was too much for jeanmarie that a place should so transform the most excellent of men transcended his belief paris he protested was even an agreeable place of residence nor when i lived in that city did i feel much difference he pleaded  what cried the doctor did you not steal when you were there  but the boy could never be brought to see that he had done anything wrong when he stole nor indeed did the doctor think he had but that gentleman was never very scrupulous when in want of a retort  and now he concluded do you begin to understand my only friends were those who ruined me gretz has been my academy my sanatorium my heaven of innocent pleasures if millions are offered me i wave them back retro sathanasevil one begone fix your mind on my example despise riches avoid the debasing influence of cities hygienehygiene and mediocrity of fortunethese be your watchwords during life  the doctors system of hygiene strikingly coincided with his tastes and his picture of the perfect life was a faithful description of the one he was leading at the time but it is easy to convince a boy whom you supply with all the facts for the discussion and besides there was one thing admirable in the philosophy and that was the enthusiasm of the philosopher there was never any one more vigorously determined to be pleased and if he was not a great logician and so had no right to convince the intellect he was certainly something of a poet and had a fascination to seduce the heart what he could not achieve in his customary humour of a radiant admiration of himself and his circumstances he sometimes effected in his fits of gloom  boy he would say avoid me today if i were superstitious i should even beg for an interest in your prayers i am in the black fit the evil spirit of king saul the hag of the merchant abudah the personal devil of the mediæval monk is with meis in me tapping on his breast the vices of my nature are now uppermost innocent pleasures woo me in vain i long for paris for my wallowing in the mire see he would continue producing a handful of silver i denude myself i am not to be trusted with the price of a fare take it keep it for me squander it on deleterious candy throw it in the deepest of the riveri will homologate your action save me from that part of myself which i disown if you see me falter do not hesitate if necessary wreck the train i speak of course by a parable any extremity were better than for me to reach paris alive  doubtless the doctor enjoyed these little scenes as a variation in his part they represented the byronic element in the somewhat artificial poetry of his existence but to the boy though he was dimly aware of their theatricality they represented more the doctor made perhaps too little the boy possibly too much of the reality and gravity of these temptations  one day a great light shone for jeanmarie could not riches be used well he asked  in theory yes replied the doctor but it is found in experience that no one does so all the world imagine they will be exceptional when they grow wealthy but possession is debasing new desires spring up and the silly taste for ostentation eats out the heart of pleasure  then you might be better if you had less said the boy  certainly not replied the doctor but his voice quavered as he spoke  why demanded pitiless innocence  doctor desprez saw all the colours of the rainbow in a moment the stable universe appeared to be about capsizing with him because said heaffecting deliberation after an obvious pausebecause i have formed my life for my present income it is not good for men of my years to be violently dissevered from their habits  that was a sharp brush the doctor breathed hard and fell into taciturnity for the afternoon as for the boy he was delighted with the resolution of his doubts even wondered that he had not foreseen the obvious and conclusive answer his faith in the doctor was a stout piece of goods desprez was inclined to be a sheet in the winds eye after dinner especially after rhone wine his favourite weakness he would then remark on the warmth of his feeling for anastasie and with inflamed cheeks and a loose flustered smile debate upon all sorts of topics and be feebly and indiscreetly witty but the adopted stableboy would not permit himself to entertain a doubt that savoured of ingratitude it is quite true that a man may be a second father to you and yet take too much to drink but the best natures are ever slow to accept such truths  the doctor thoroughly possessed his heart but perhaps he exaggerated his influence over his mind certainly jeanmarie adopted some of his masters opinions but i have yet to learn that he ever surrendered one of his own convictions existed in him by divine right they were virgin unwrought the brute metal of decision he could add others indeed but he could not put away neither did he care if they were perfectly agreed among themselves and his spiritual pleasures had nothing to do with turning them over or justifying them in words words were with him a mere accomplishment like dancing when he was by himself his pleasures were almost vegetable he would slip into the woods towards achères and sit in the mouth of a cave among grey birches his soul stared straight out of his eyes he did not move or think sunlight thin shadows moving in the wind the edge of firs against the sky occupied and bound his faculties he was pure unity a spirit wholly abstracted a single mood filled him to which all the objects of sense contributed as the colours of the spectrum merge and disappear in white light  so while the doctor made himself drunk with words the adopted stableboy bemused himself with silence       chapter v    treasure trove   the doctors carriage was a twowheeled gig with a hood a kind of vehicle in much favour among country doctors on how many roads has one not seen it a great way off between the poplarsin how many village streets tied to a gatepost this sort of chariot is affectedparticularly at the trotby a kind of pitching movement to and fro across the axle which well entitles it to the style of a noddy the hood describes a considerable arc against the landscape with a solemnly absurd effect on the contemplative pedestrian to ride in such a carriage cannot be numbered among the things that appertain to glory but i have no doubt it may be useful in liver complaint thence perhaps its wide popularity among physicians  one morning early jeanmarie led forth the doctors noddy opened the gate and mounted to the drivingseat the doctor followed arrayed from top to toe in spotless linen armed with an immense fleshcoloured umbrella and girt with a botanical case on a baldric and the equipage drove off smartly in a breeze of its own provocation they were bound for franchard to collect plants with an eye to the comparative pharmacopoeia  a little rattling on the open roads and they came to the borders of the forest and struck into an unfrequented track the noddy yawed softly over the sand with an accompaniment of snapping twigs there was a great green softly murmuring cloud of congregated foliage overhead in the arcades of the forest the air retained the freshness of the night the athletic bearing of the trees each carrying its leafy mountain pleased the mind like so many statues and the lines of the trunk led the eye admiringly upward to where the extreme leaves sparkled in a patch of azure squirrels leaped in midair it was a proper spot for a devotee of the goddess hygieia  have you been to franchard jeanmarie inquired the doctor i fancy not  never replied the boy  it is a ruin in a gorge continued desprez adopting his expository voice the ruin of a hermitage and chapel history tells us much of franchard how the recluse was often slain by robbers how he lived on a most insufficient diet how he was expected to pass his days in prayer a letter is preserved addressed to one of these solitaries by the superior of his order full of admirable hygienic advice bidding him go from his book to praying and so back again for varietys sake and when he was weary of both to stroll about his garden and observe the honeybees it is to this day my own system you must often have remarked me leaving the pharmacopoeiaoften even in the middle of a phraseto come forth into the sun and air i admire the writer of that letter from my heart he was a man of thought on the most important subjects but indeed had i lived in the middle ages i am heartily glad that i did not i should have been an eremite myselfif i had not been a professed buffoon that is these were the only philosophical lives yet open laughter or prayer sneers we might say and tears until the sun of the positive arose the wise man had to make his choice between these two  i have been a buffoon of course observed jeanmarie  i cannot imagine you to have excelled in your profession said the doctor admiring the boys gravity do you ever laugh  oh yes replied the other i laugh often i am very fond of jokes  singular being said desprez but i divagate i perceive in a thousand ways that i grow old franchard was at length destroyed in the english wars the same that levelled gretz buthere is the pointthe hermits for there were already more than one had foreseen the danger and carefully concealed the sacrificial vessels these vessels were of monstrous value jeanmariemonstrous valuepriceless we may say exquisitely worked of exquisite material and now mark me they have never been found in the reign of louis quatorze some fellows were digging hard by the ruins suddenlytockthe spade hit upon an obstacle imagine the men looking one to another imagine how their hearts bounded how their colour came and went it was a coffer and in franchard the place of buried treasure they tore it open like famished beasts alas it was not the treasure only some priestly robes which at the touch of the eating air fell upon themselves and instantly wasted into dust the perspiration of these good fellows turned cold upon them jeanmarie i will pledge my reputation if there was anything like a cutting wind one or other had a pneumonia for his trouble  i should like to have seen them turning into dust said jeanmarie otherwise i should not have cared so greatly  you have no imagination cried the doctor picture to yourself the scene dwell on the ideaa great treasure lying in the earth for centuries the material for a giddy copious opulent existence not employed dresses and exquisite pictures unseen the swiftest galloping horses not stirring a hoof arrested by a spell women with the beautiful faculty of smiles not smiling cards dice opera singing orchestras castles beautiful parks and gardens big ships with a tower of sailcloth all lying unborn in a coffinand the stupid trees growing overhead in the sunlight year after year the thought drives one frantic  it is only money replied jeanmarie it would do harm  oh come cried desprez that is philosophy it is all very fine but not to the point just now and besides it is not only money as you call it there are works of art in the question the vessels were carved you speak like a child you weary me exceedingly quoting my words out of all logical connection like a parroquet  and at any rate we have nothing to do with it returned the boy submissively  they struck the route ronde at that moment and the sudden change to the rattling causeway combined with the doctors irritation to keep him silent the noddy jigged along the trees went by looking on silently as if they had something on their minds the quadrilateral was passed then came franchard they put up the horse at the little solitary inn and went forth strolling the gorge was dyed deeply with heather the rocks and birches standing luminous in the sun a great humming of bees about the flowers disposed jeanmarie to sleep and he sat down against a clump of heather while the doctor went briskly to and fro with quick turns culling his simples  the boys head had fallen a little forward his eyes were closed his fingers had fallen lax about his knees when a sudden cry called him to his feet it was a strange sound thin and brief it fell dead and silence returned as though it had never been interrupted he had not recognised the doctors voice but as there was no one else in all the valley it was plainly the doctor who had given utterance to the sound he looked right and left and there was desprez standing in a niche between two boulders and looking round on his adopted son with a countenance as white as paper  a viper cried jeanmarie running towards him a viper you are bitten  the doctor came down heavily out of the cleft and advanced in silence to meet the boy whom he took roughly by the shoulder  i have found it he said with a gasp  a plant asked jeanmarie  desprez had a fit of unnatural gaiety which the rocks took up and mimicked a plant he repeated scornfully wellyesa plant and here he added suddenly showing his right hand which he had hitherto concealed behind his backhere is one of the bulbs  jeanmarie saw a dirty platter coated with earth  that said he it is a plate  it is a coach and horses cried the doctor boy he continued growing warmer i plucked away a great pad of moss from between these boulders and disclosed a crevice and when i looked in what do you suppose i saw i saw a house in paris with a court and garden i saw my wife shining with diamonds i saw myself a deputy i saw youwell ii saw your future he concluded rather feebly i have just discovered america he added  but what is it asked the boy  the treasure of franchard cried the doctor and throwing his brown straw hat upon the ground he whooped like an indian and sprang upon jeanmarie whom he suffocated with embraces and bedewed with tears then he flung himself down among the heather and once more laughed until the valley rang  but the boy had now an interest of his own a boys interest no sooner was he released from the doctors accolade than he ran to the boulders sprang into the niche and thrusting his hand into the crevice drew forth one after another encrusted with the earth of ages the flagons candlesticks and patens of the hermitage of franchard a casket came last tightly shut and very heavy  oh what fun he cried  but when he looked back at the doctor who had followed close behind and was silently observing the words died from his lips desprez was once more the colour of ashes his lip worked and trembled a sort of bestial greed possessed him  this is childish he said we lose precious time back to the inn harness the trap and bring it to yon bank run for your life and remembernot one whisper i stay here to watch  jeanmarie did as he was bid though not without surprise the noddy was brought round to the spot indicated and the two gradually transported the treasure from its place of concealment to the boot below the drivingseat once it was all stored the doctor recovered his gaiety  i pay my grateful duties to the genius of this dell he said oh for a live coal a heifer and a jar of country wine i am in the vein for sacrifice for a superb libation well and why not we are at franchard english pale ale is to be hadnot classical indeed but excellent boy we shall drink ale  but i thought it was so unwholesome said jeanmarie and very dear besides  fiddlededee exclaimed the doctor gaily to the inn  and he stepped into the noddy tossing his head with an elastic youthful air the horse was turned and in a few seconds they drew up beside the palings of the inn garden  here said desprezhere near the table so that we may keep an eye upon things  they tied the horse and entered the garden the doctor singing now in fantastic high notes now producing deep reverberations from his chest he took a seat rapped loudly on the table assailed the waiter with witticisms and when the bottle of bass was at length produced far more charged with gas than the most delirious champagne he filled out a long glassful of froth and pushed it over to jeanmarie drink he said drink deep  i would rather not faltered the boy true to his training  what thundered desprez  i am afraid of it said jeanmarie my stomach  take it or leave it interrupted desprez fiercely but understand it once for allthere is nothing so contemptible as a precisian  here was a new lesson the boy sat bemused looking at the glass but not tasting it while the doctor emptied and refilled his own at first with clouded brow but gradually yielding to the sun the heady prickling beverage and his own predisposition to be happy  once in a way he said at last by way of a concession to the boys more rigorous attitude once in a way and at so critical a moment this ale is a nectar for the gods the habit indeed is debasing wine the juice of the grape is the true drink of the frenchman as i have often had occasion to point out and i do not know that i can blame you for refusing this outlandish stimulant you can have some wine and cakes is the bottle empty well we will not be proud we will have pity on your glass  the beer being done the doctor chafed bitterly while jeanmarie finished his cakes i burn to be gone he said looking at his watch good god how slow you eat and yet to eat slowly was his own particular prescription the main secret of longevity  his martyrdom however reached an end at last the pair resumed their places in the buggy and desprez leaning luxuriously back announced his intention of proceeding to fontainebleau  to fontainebleau repeated jeanmarie  my words are always measured said the doctor on  the doctor was driven through the glades of paradise the air the light the shining leaves the very movements of the vehicle seemed to fall in tune with his golden meditations with his head thrown back he dreamed a series of sunny visions ale and pleasure dancing in his veins at last he spoke  i shall telegraph for casimir he said good casimir a fellow of the lower order of intelligence jeanmarie distinctly not creative not poetic and yet he will repay your study his fortune is vast and is entirely due to his own exertions he is the very fellow to help us to dispose of our trinkets find us a suitable house in paris and manage the details of our installation admirable casimir one of my oldest comrades it was on his advice i may add that i invested my little fortune in turkish bonds when we have added these spoils of the mediæval church to our stake in the mahometan empire little boy we shall positively roll among doubloons positively rollbeautiful forest he cried farewell though called to other scenes i will not forget thee thy name is graven in my heart under the influence of prosperity i become dithyrambic jeanmarie such is the impulse of the natural soul such was the constitution of primæval man and iwell i will not refuse the crediti have preserved my youth like a virginity another who should have led the same snoozing countrified existence for these years another had become rusty become stereotype but i i praise my happy constitution retain the spring unbroken fresh opulence and a new sphere of duties find me unabated in ardour and only more mature by knowledge for this prospective change jeanmarieit may probably have shocked you tell me now did it not strike you as an inconsistency confessit is useless to dissembleit pained you  yes said the boy  you see returned the doctor with sublime fatuity i read your thoughts nor am i surprisedyour education is not yet complete the higher duties of men have not been yet presented to you fully a hinttill we have leisuremust suffice now that i am once more in possession of a modest competence now that i have so long prepared myself in silent meditation it becomes my superior duty to proceed to paris my scientific training my undoubted command of language mark me out for the service of my country modesty in such a case would be a snare if sin were a philosophical expression i should call it sinful a man must not deny his manifest abilities for that is to evade his obligations i must be up and doing i must be no skulker in lifes battle  so he rattled on copiously greasing the joint of his inconsistency with words while the boy listened silently his eyes fixed on the horse his mind seething it was all lost eloquence no array of words could unsettle a belief of jeanmaries and he drove into fontainebleau filled with pity horror indignation and despair  in the town jeanmarie was kept a fixture on the drivingseat to guard the treasure while the doctor with a singular slightly tipsy airiness of manner fluttered in and out of cafés where he shook hands with garrison officers and mixed an absinthe with the nicety of old experience in and out of shops from which he returned laden with costly fruits real turtle a magnificent piece of silk for his wife a preposterous cane for himself and a képi of the newest fashion for the boy in and out of the telegraph office whence he despatched his telegram and where three hours later he received an answer promising a visit on the morrow and generally pervaded fontainebleau with the first fine aroma of his divine goodhumour  the sun was very low when they set forth again the shadows of the forest trees extended across the broad white road that led them home the penetrating odour of the evening wood had already arisen like a cloud of incense from that broad field of treetops and even in the streets of the town where the air had been baked all day between white walls it came in whiffs and pulses like a distant music halfway home the last gold flicker vanished from a great oak upon the left and when they came forth beyond the borders of the wood the plain was already sunken in pearly greyness and a great pale moon came swinging skyward through the filmy poplars  the doctor sang the doctor whistled the doctor talked he spoke of the woods and the wars and the deposition of dew he brightened and babbled of paris he soared into cloudy bombast on the glories of the political arena all was to be changed as the day departed it took with it the vestiges of an outworn existence and tomorrows sun was to inaugurate the new enough he cried of this life of maceration his wife still beautiful or he was sadly partial was to be no longer buried she should now shine before society jeanmarie would find the world at his feet the roads open to success wealth honour and posthumous renown and oh by the way said he for gods sake keep your tongue quiet you are of course a very silent fellow it is a quality i gladly recognise in yousilence golden silence but this is a matter of gravity no word must get abroad none but the good casimir is to be trusted we shall probably dispose of the vessels in england  but are they not even ours the boy said almost with a sobit was the only time he had spoken  ours in this sense that they are nobody elses replied the doctor but the state would have some claim if they were stolen for instance we should be unable to demand their restitution we should have no title we should be unable even to communicate with the police such is the monstrous condition of the law2 it is a mere instance of what remains to be done of the injustices that may yet be righted by an ardent active and philosophical deputy  jeanmarie put his faith in madame desprez and as they drove forward down the road from bourron between the rustling poplars he prayed in his teeth and whipped up the horse to an unusual speed surely as soon as they arrived madame would assert her character and bring this waking nightmare to an end  their entrance into gretz was heralded and accompanied by a most furious barking all the dogs in the village seemed to smell the treasure in the noddy but there was no one in the street save three lounging landscapepainters at tentaillons door jeanmarie opened the green gate and led in the horse and carriage and almost at the same moment madame desprez came to the kitchen threshold with a lighted lantern for the moon was not yet high enough to clear the garden walls  close the gates jeanmarie cried the doctor somewhat unsteadily alightinganastasie where is aline  she has gone to montereau to see her parents said madame  all is for the best exclaimed the doctor fervently here quick come near to me i do not wish to speak too loud he continued darling we are wealthy  wealthy repeated the wife  i have found the treasure of franchard replied her husband see here are the firstfruits a pineapple a dress for my everbeautifulit will suit hertrust a husbands trust a lovers taste embrace me darling this grimy episode is over the butterfly unfolds its painted wings tomorrow casimir will come in a week we may be in parishappy at last you shall have diamondsjeanmarie take it out of the boot with religious care and bring it piece by piece into the diningroom we shall have plate at table darling hasten and prepare this turtle it will be a whetit will be an addition to our meagre ordinary i myself will proceed to the cellar we shall have a bottle of that little beaujolais you like and finish with the hermitage there are still three bottles left worthy wine for a worthy occasion  but my husband you put me in a whirl she cried i do not comprehend  the turtle my adored the turtle cried the doctor and he pushed her towards the kitchen lantern and all  jeanmarie stood dumfoundered he had pictured to himself a different scenea more immediate protest and his hope began to dwindle on the spot  the doctor was everywhere a little doubtful on his legs perhaps and now and then taking the wall with his shoulder for it was long since he had tasted absinthe and he was even then reflecting that the absinthe had been a misconception not that he regretted excess on such a glorious day but he made a mental memorandum to beware he must not a second time become the victim of a deleterious habit he had his wine out of the cellar in a twinkling he arranged the sacrificial vessels some on the white tablecloth some on the sideboard still crusted with historic earth he was in and out of the kitchen plying anastasie with vermouth heating her with glimpses of the future estimating their new wealth at ever larger figures and before they sat down to supper the ladys virtue had melted in the fire of his enthusiasm her timidity had disappeared she too had begun to speak disparagingly of the life at gretz and as she took her place and helped the soup her eyes shone with the glitter of prospective diamonds  all through the meal she and the doctor made and unmade fairy plans they bobbed and bowed and pledged each other their faces ran over with smiles their eyes scattered sparkles as they projected the doctors political honours and the ladys drawingroom ovations  but you will not be a red cried anastasie  i am left centre to the core replied the doctor  madame gastein will present uswe shall find ourselves forgotten said the lady  never protested the doctor beauty and talent leave a mark  i have positively forgotten how to dress she sighed  darling you make me blush cried he yours has been a tragic marriage  but your successto see you appreciated honoured your name in all the papers that will be more than pleasureit will be heaven she cried  and once a week said the doctor archly scanning the syllables once a weekone good little game of baccarat  only once a week she questioned threatening him with a finger  i swear it by my political honour cried he  i spoil you she said and gave him her hand  he covered it with kisses  jeanmarie escaped into the night the moon swung high over gretz he went down to the garden end and sat on the jetty the river ran by with eddies of oily silver and a low monotonous song faint veils of mist moved among the poplars on the farther side the reeds were quietly nodding a hundred times already had the boy sat on such a night and watched the streaming river with untroubled fancy and this perhaps was to be the last he was to leave this familiar hamlet this green rustling country this bright and quiet stream he was to pass into the great city his dear lady mistress was to move bedizened in saloons his good garrulous kindhearted master to become a brawling deputy and both be lost for ever to jeanmarie and their better selves he knew his own defects he knew he must sink into less and less consideration in the turmoil of a city life sink more and more from the child into the servant and he began dimly to believe the doctors prophecies of evil he could see a change in both his generous incredulity failed him for this once a child must have perceived that the hermitage had completed what the absinthe had begun if this were the first day what would be the last if necessary wreck the train thought he remembering the doctors parable he looked round on the delightful scene he drank deep of the charmed nightair laden with the scent of hay if necessary wreck the train he repeated and he rose and returned to the house   footnote    2 let it be so for my tale       chapter vi    a criminal investigation in two parts   the next morning there was a most unusual outcry in the doctors house the last thing before going to bed the doctor had locked up some valuables in the diningroom cupboard and behold when he rose again as he did about four oclock the cupboard had been broken open and the valuables in question had disappeared madame and jeanmarie were summoned from their rooms and appeared in hasty toilets they found the doctor raving calling the heavens to witness and avenge his injury pacing the room barefooted with the tails of his nightshirt flirting as he turned  gone he said the things are gone the fortune gone we are paupers once more boy what do you know of this speak up sir speak up do you know of it where are they he had him by the arm shaking him like a bag and the boys words if he had any were jolted forth in inarticulate murmurs the doctor with a revulsion from his own violence set him down again he observed anastasie in tears anastasie he said in quite an altered voice compose yourself command your feelings i would not have you give way to passion like the vulgar thisthis trifling accident must be lived downjeanmarie bring me my smaller medicinechest a gentle laxative is indicated  and he dosed the family all round leading the way himself with a double quantity the wretched anastasie who had never been ill in the whole course of her existence and whose soul recoiled from remedies wept floods of tears as she sipped and shuddered and protested and then was bullied and shouted at until she sipped again as for jeanmarie he took his portion down with stoicism  i have given him a less amount observed the doctor his youth protecting him against emotion and now that we have thus parried any morbid consequences let us reason  i am so cold wailed anastasie  cold cried the doctor i give thanks to god that i am made of fierier material why madam a blow like this would set a frog into a transpiration if you are cold you can retire and by the way you might throw me down my trousers it is chilly for the legs  oh no protested anastasie i will stay with you  nay madam you shall not suffer for your devotion said the doctor i will myself fetch you a shawl and he went upstairs and returned more fully clad and with an armful of wraps for the shivering anastasie and now he resumed to investigate this crime let us proceed by induction anastasie do you know anything that can help us anastasie knew nothing or you jeanmarie  not i replied the boy steadily  good returned the doctor we shall now turn our attention to the material evidences i was born to be a detective i have the eye and the systematic spirit first violence has been employed the door was broken open and it may be observed in passing that the lock was dear indeed at what i paid for it a crow to pluck with master goguelat second here is the instrument employed one of our own tableknives one of our best my dear which seems to indicate no preparation on the part of the gangif gang it was thirdly i observe that nothing has been removed except the franchard dishes and the casket our own silver has been minutely respected this is wily it shows intelligence a knowledge of the code a desire to avoid legal consequences i argue from this fact that the gang numbers persons of respectabilityoutward of course and merely outward as the robbery proves but i argue second that we must have been observed at franchard itself by some occult observer and dogged throughout the day with a skill and patience that i venture to qualify as consummate no ordinary man no occasional criminal would have shown himself capable of this combination we have in our neighbourhood it is far from improbable a retired bandit of the highest order of intelligence  good heaven cried the horrified anastasie henri how can you  my cherished one this is a process of induction said the doctor if any of my steps are unsound correct me you are silent then do not i beseech you be so vulgarly illogical as to revolt from my conclusion we have now arrived he resumed at some idea of the composition of the gangfor i incline to the hypothesis of more than oneand we now leave this room which can disclose no more and turn our attention to the court and garden jeanmarie i trust you are observantly following my various steps this is an excellent piece of education for you come with me to the door no steps on the court it is unfortunate our court should be paved on what small matters hang the destiny of these delicate investigations hey what have we here i have led you to the very spot he said standing grandly backward and indicating the green gate an escalade as you can now see for yourselves has taken place  sure enough the green paint was in several places scratched and broken and one of the panels preserved the print of a nailed shoe the foot had slipped however and it was difficult to estimate the size of the shoe and impossible to distinguish the pattern of the nails  the whole robbery concluded the doctor step by step has been reconstituted inductive science can no further go  it is wonderful said his wife you should indeed have been a detective henri i had no idea of your talents  my dear replied desprez condescendingly a man of scientific imagination combines the lesser faculties he is a detective just as he is a publicist or a general these are but local applications of his special talent but now he continued would you have me go further would you have me lay my finger on the culpritsor rather for i cannot promise quite so much point out to you the very house where they consort it may be a satisfaction at least it is all we are likely to get since we are denied the remedy of law i reach the further stage in this way in order to fill my outline of the robbery i require a man likely to be in the forest idling i require a man of education i require a man superior to considerations of morality the three requisites all centre in tentaillons boarders they are painters therefore they are continually lounging in the forest they are painters therefore they are not unlikely to have some smattering of education lastly because they are painters they are probably immoral and this i prove in two ways first painting is an art which merely addresses the eye it does not in any particular exercise the moral sense and second painting in common with all the other arts implies the dangerous quality of imagination a man of imagination is never moral he outsoars literal demarcations and reviews life under too many shifting lights to rest content with the invidious distinctions of the law  but you always sayat least so i understood yousaid madame that these lads display no imagination whatever  my dear they displayed imagination and of a very fantastic order too returned the doctor when they embraced their beggarly profession besidesand this is an argument exactly suited to your intellectual levelmany of them are english and american where else should we expect to find a thiefand now you had better get your coffee because we have lost a treasure there is no reason for starving for my part i shall break my fast with white wine i feel unaccountably heated and thirsty today i can only attribute it to the shock of the discovery and yet you will bear me out i supported the emotion nobly  the doctor had now talked himself back into an admirable humour and as he sat in the arbour and slowly imbibed a large allowance of white wine and picked a little bread and cheese with no very impetuous appetite if a third of his meditations ran upon the missing treasure the other twothirds were more pleasingly busied in the retrospect of his detective skill  about eleven casimir arrived he had caught an early train to fontainebleau and driven over to save time and now his cab was stabled at tentaillons and he remarked studying his watch that he could spare an hour and a half he was much the man of business decisively spoken given to frowning in an intellectual manner anastasies born brother he did not waste much sentiment on the lady gave her an english family kiss and demanded a meal without delay  you can tell me your story while we eat he observed anything good today stasie  he was promised something good the trio sat down to table in the arbour jeanmarie waiting as well as eating and the doctor recounted what had happened in his richest narrative manner casimir heard it with explosions of laughter  what a streak of luck for you my good brother he observed when the tale was over if you had gone to paris you would have played dickduckdrake with the whole consignment in three months your own would have followed and you would have come to me in a procession like the last time but i give you warningstasie may weep and henri ratiocinateit will not serve you twice your next collapse will be fatal i thought i had told you so stasie hey no sense  the doctor winced and looked furtively at jeanmarie but the boy seemed apathetic  and then again broke out casimir what children you arevicious children my faith how could you tell the value of this trash it might have been worth nothing or next door  pardon me said the doctor you have your usual flow of spirits i perceive but even less than your usual deliberation i am not entirely ignorant of these matters  not entirely ignorant of anything ever i heard of interrupted casimir bowing and raising his glass with a sort of pert politeness  at least resumed the doctor i gave my mind to the subjectthat you may be willing to believeand i estimated that our capital would be doubled and he described the nature of the find  my word of honour said casimir i half believe you but much would depend on the quality of the gold  the quality my dear casimir was and the doctor in default of language kissed his fingertips  i would not take your word for it my good friend retorted the man of business you are a man of very rosy views but this robbery he continuedthis robbery is an odd thing of course i pass over your nonsense about gangs and landscapepainters for me that is a dream who was in the house last night  none but ourselves replied the doctor  and this young gentleman asked casimir jerking a nod in the direction of jeanmarie  he toothe doctor bowed  well and if it is a fair question who is he pursued the brotherinlaw  jeanmarie answered the doctor combines the functions of a son and stableboy he began as the latter but he rose rapidly to the more honourable rank in our affections he is i may say the greatest comfort in our lives  ha said casimir and previous to becoming one of you  jeanmarie has lived a remarkable existence his experience has been eminently formative replied desprez if i had had to choose an education for my son i should have chosen such another beginning life with mountebanks and thieves passing onward to the society and friendship of philosophers he may be said to have skimmed the volume of human life  thieves repeated the brotherinlaw with a meditative air  the doctor could have bitten his tongue out he foresaw what was coming and prepared his mind for a vigorous defence  did you ever steal yourself asked casimir turning suddenly on jeanmarie and for the first time employing a single eyeglass which hung round his neck  yes sir replied the boy with a deep blush  casimir turned to the others with pursed lips and nodded to them meaningly hey said he how is that  jeanmarie is a teller of the truth returned the doctor throwing out his bust  he has never told a lie added madame he is the best of boys  never told a lie has he not reflected casimir strange very strange give me your attention my young friend he continued you knew about this treasure  he helped to bring it home interposed the doctor  desprez i ask you nothing but to hold your tongue returned casimir i mean to question this stableboy of yours and if you are so certain of his innocence you can afford to let him answer for himselfnow sir he resumed pointing his eyeglass straight at jeanmarie you knew it could be stolen with impunity you knew you could not be prosecuted come did you or did you not  i did answered jeanmarie in a miserable whisper he sat there changing colour like a revolving pharos twisting his fingers hysterically swallowing air the picture of guilt  you knew where it was put resumed the inquisitor  yes from jeanmarie  you say you have been a thief before continued casimir now how am i to know that you are not one still i suppose you could climb the green gate  yes still lower from the culprit  well then it was you who stole these things you know it and you dare not deny it look me in the face raise your sneaks eyes and answer  but in place of anything of that sort jeanmarie broke into a dismal howl and fled from the arbour anastasie as she pursued to capture and reassure the victim found time to send one parthian arrowcasimir you are a brute  my brother said desprez with the greatest dignity you take upon yourself a licence  desprez interrupted casimir for heavens sake be a man of the world you telegraph me to leave my business and come down here on yours i come i ask the business you say find me this thief well i find him i say there he is you need not like it but you have no manner of right to take offence  well returned the doctor i grant that i will even thank you for your mistaken zeal but your hypothesis was so extravagantly monstrous  look here interrupted casimir was it you or stasie  certainly not answered the doctor  very well then it was the boy say no more about it said the brotherinlaw and he produced his cigarcase  i will say this much more returned desprez if that boy came and told me so himself i should not believe him and if i did believe him so implicit is my trust i should conclude that he had acted for the best  well well said casimir indulgently have you a light i must be going and by the way i wish you would let me sell your turks for you i always told you it meant smash i tell you so again indeed it was partly that which brought me down you never acknowledge my lettersa most unpardonable habit  my good brother replied the doctor blandly i have never denied your ability in business but i can perceive your limitations  egad my friend i can return the compliment observed the man of business your limitation is to be downright irrational  observe the relative position returned the doctor with a smile it is your attitude to believe through thick and thin in one mans judgmentyour own i follow the same opinion but critically and with open eyes which is the more irrational i leave it to yourself  oh my dear fellow cried casimir stick to your turks stick to your stableboy go to the devil in general in your own way and be done with it but dont ratiocinate with mei cannot bear it and so tata i might as well have stayed away for any good ive done say goodbye from me to stasie and to the sullen hangdog of a stableboy if you insist on it im off  and casimir departed the doctor that night dissected his character before anastasie one thing my beautiful he said he has learned one thing from his lifelong acquaintance with your husband the word ratiocinate it shines in his vocabulary like a jewel in a muckheap and even so he continually misapplies it for you must have observed he uses it as a sort of taunt in the sense of to ergotise implying as it werethe poor dear fellowa vein of sophistry as for his cruelty to jeanmarie it must be forgiven himit is not his nature it is the nature of his life a man who deals with money my dear is a man lost  with jeanmarie the process of reconciliation had been somewhat slow at first he was inconsolable insisted on leaving the family went from paroxysm to paroxysm of tears and it was only after anastasie had been closeted for an hour with him alone that she came forth sought out the doctor and with tears in her eyes acquainted that gentleman with what had passed  at first my husband he would hear of nothing she said imagine if he had left us what would the treasure be to that horrible treasure it has brought all this about at last after he has sobbed his very heart out he agrees to stay on a conditionwe are not to mention this matter this infamous suspicion not even to mention the robbery on that agreement only the poor cruel boy will consent to remain among his friends  but this inhibition said the doctor this embargoit cannot possibly apply to me  to all of us anastasie assured him  my cherished one desprez protested you must have misunderstood it cannot apply to me he would naturally come to me  henri she said it does i swear to you it does  this is a painful a very painful circumstance the doctor said looking a little black i cannot affect anastasie to be anything but justly wounded i feel thisi feel it my wife acutely  i knew you would she said but if you had seen his distress we must make allowances we must sacrifice our feelings  i trust my dear you have never found me averse to sacrifices said the doctor very stiffly  and you will let me go and tell him that you have agreed it will be like your noble nature she cried  so it would he perceivedit would be like his noble nature up jumped his spirits triumphant at the thought go darling he said nobly reassure him the subject is buried morei make an effort i have accustomed my will to these exertionsand it is forgotten  a little after but still with swollen eyes and looking mortally sheepish jeanmarie reappeared and went ostentatiously about his business he was the only unhappy member of the party that sat down that night to supper as for the doctor he was radiant he then sang the requiem of the treasure  this has been on the whole a most amusing episode he said we are not a penny the worsenay we are immensely gainers our philosophy has been exercised some of the turtle is still leftthe most wholesome of delicacies i have my staff anastasie has her new dress jeanmarie is the proud possessor of a fashionable képi besides we had a glass of hermitage last night the glow still suffuses my memory i was growing positively niggardly with that hermitage positively niggardly let me take the hint we had one bottle to celebrate the appearance of our visionary fortune let us have a second to console us for its occultation the third i hereby dedicate to jeanmaries wedding breakfast       chapter vii    the fall of the house of desprez   the doctors house has not yet received the compliment of a description and it is now high time that the omission were supplied for the house is itself an actor in the story and one whose part is nearly at an end two stories in height walls of a warm yellow tiles of an ancient ruddy brown diversified with moss and lichen it stood with one wall to the street in the angle of the doctors property it was roomy draughty and inconvenient the large rafters were here and there engraven with rude marks and patterns the handrail of the stair was carved in countrified arabesque a stout timber pillar which did duty to support the diningroom roof bore mysterious characters on its darker side runes according to the doctor nor did he fail when he ran over the legendary history of the house and its possessors to dwell upon the scandinavian scholar who had left them floors doors and rafters made a great variety of angles every room had a particular inclination the gable had tilted towards the garden after the manner of a leaning tower and one of the former proprietors had buttressed the building from that side with a great strut of wood like the derrick of a crane altogether it had many marks of ruin it was a house for the rats to desert and nothing but its excellent brightnessthe windowglass polished and shining the paint well scoured the brasses radiant the very prop all wreathed about with climbing flowersnothing but its air of a welltended smiling veteran sitting crutch and all in the sunny corner of a garden marked it as a house for comfortable people to inhabit in poor or idle management it would soon have hurried into the blackguard stages of decay as it was the whole family loved it and the doctor was never better inspired than when he narrated its imaginary story and drew the character of its successive masters from the hebrew merchant who had reedified its walls after the sack of the town and past the mysterious engraver of the runes down to the longheaded dirtyhanded boor from whom he had himself acquired it at a ruinous expense as for any alarm about its security the idea had never presented itself what had stood four centuries might well endure a little longer  indeed in this particular winter after the finding and losing of the treasure the desprez had an anxiety of a very different order and one which lay nearer their hearts jeanmarie was plainly not himself he had fits of hectic activity when he made unusual exertions to please spoke more and faster and redoubled in attention to his lessons but these were interrupted by spells of melancholia and brooding silence when the boy was little better than unbearable  silence the doctor moralisedyou see anastasie what comes of silence had the boy properly unbosomed himself the little disappointment about the treasure the little annoyance about casimirs incivility would long ago have been forgotten as it is they prey upon him like a disease he loses flesh his appetite is variable and on the whole impaired i keep him on the strictest regimen i exhibit the most powerful tonics both in vain  dont you think you drug him too much asked madame with an irrepressible shudder  drug cried the doctor i drug anastasie you are mad  time went on and the boys health still slowly declined the doctor blamed the weather which was cold and boisterous he called in his confrère from bourron took a fancy for him magnified his capacity and was pretty soon under treatment himselfit scarcely appeared for what complaint he and jeanmarie had each medicine to take at different periods of the day the doctor used to lie in wait for the exact moment watch in hand there is nothing like regularity he would say fill out the doses and dilate on the virtues of the draught and if the boy seemed none the better the doctor was not at all the worse  gunpowder day the boy was particularly low it was scowling squally weather huge broken companies of cloud sailed swiftly overhead raking gleams of sunlight swept the village and were followed by intervals of darkness and white flying rain at times the wind lifted up its voice and bellowed the trees were all scourging themselves along the meadows the last leaves flying like dust  the doctor between the boy and the weather was in his element he had a theory to prove he sat with his watch out and a barometer in front of him waiting for the squalls and noting their effect upon the human pulse for the true philosopher he remarked delightedly every fact in nature is a toy a letter came to him but as its arrival coincided with the approach of another gust he merely crammed it into his pocket gave the time to jeanmarie and the next moment they were both counting their pulses as if for a wager  at nightfall the wind rose into a tempest it besieged the hamlet apparently from every side as if with batteries of cannon the houses shook and groaned live coals were blown upon the floor the uproar and terror of the night kept people long awake sitting with pallid faces giving ear  it was twelve before the desprez family retired by halfpast one when the storm was already somewhat past its height the doctor was awakened from a troubled slumber and sat up a noise still rang in his ears but whether of this world or the world of dreams he was not certain another clap of wind followed it was accompanied by a sickening movement of the whole house and in the subsequent lull desprez could hear the tiles pouring like a cataract into the loft above his head he plucked anastasie bodily out of bed  run he cried thrusting some wearing apparel into her hands the house is falling to the garden  she did not pause to be twice bidden she was down the stair in an instant she had never before suspected herself of such activity the doctor meanwhile with the speed of a piece of pantomime business and undeterred by broken shins proceeded to rout out jeanmarie tore aline from her virgin slumbers seized her by the hand and tumbled downstairs and into the garden with the girl tumbling behind him still not half awake  the fugitives rendezvoused in the arbour by some common instinct then came a bullseye flash of struggling moonshine which disclosed their four figures standing huddled from the wind in a raffle of flying drapery and not without a considerable need for more at the humiliating spectacle anastasie clutched her nightdress desperately about her and burst loudly into tears the doctor flew to console her but she elbowed him away she suspected everybody of being the general public and thought the darkness was alive with eyes  another gleam and another violent gust arrived together the house was seen to rock on its foundation and just as the light was once more eclipsed a crash which triumphed over the shouting of the wind announced its fall and for a moment the whole garden was alive with skipping tiles and brickbats one such missile grazed the doctors ear another descended on the bare foot of aline who instantly made night hideous with her shrieks  by this time the hamlet was alarmed lights flashed from the windows hails reached the party and the doctor answered nobly contending against aline and the tempest but this prospect of help only awakened anastasie to a more active stage of terror  henri people will be coming she screamed in her husbands ear  i trust so he replied  they cannot i would rather die she wailed  my dear said the doctor reprovingly you are excited i gave you some clothes what have you done with them  oh i dont knowi must have thrown them away where are they she sobbed  desprez groped about in the darkness admirable he remarked my grey velveteen trousers this will exactly meet your necessities  give them to me she cried fiercely but as soon as she had them in her hands her mood appeared to altershe stood silent for a moment and then pressed the garment back upon the doctor give it to aline she saidpoor girl  nonsense said the doctor aline does not know what she is about aline is beside herself with terror and at any rate she is a peasant now i am really concerned at this exposure for a person of your housekeeping habits my solicitude and your fantastic modesty both point to the same remedythe pantaloons he held them ready  it is impossible you do not understand she said with dignity  by this time rescue was at hand it had been found impracticable to enter by the street for the gate was blocked with masonry and the nodding ruin still threatened further avalanches but between the doctors garden and the one on the right hand there was that very picturesque contrivancea common well the door on the desprez side had chanced to be unbolted and now through the arched aperture a mans bearded face and an arm supporting a lantern were introduced into the world of windy darkness where anastasie concealed her woes the light struck here and there among the tossing apple boughs it glinted on the grass but the lantern and the glowing face became the centre of the world anastasie crouched back from the intrusion  this way shouted the man are you all safe  aline still screaming ran to the newcomer and was presently hauled headforemost through the wall  now anastasie come on it is your turn said the husband  i cannot she replied  are we all to die of exposure madame thundered doctor desprez  you can go she cried oh go go away i can stay here i am quite warm  the doctor took her by the shoulders with an oath  stop she screamed i will put them on  she took the detested lendings in her hand once more but her repulsion was stronger than shame never she cried shuddering and flung them far away into the night  next moment the doctor had whirled her to the well the man was there and the lantern anastasie closed her eyes and appeared to herself to be about to die how she was transported through the arch she knew not but once on the other side she was received by the neighbours wife and enveloped in a friendly blanket  beds were made ready for the two women clothes of very various sizes for the doctor and jeanmarie and for the remainder of the night while madame dozed in and out on the borderland of hysterics her husband sat beside the fire and held forth to the admiring neighbours he showed them at length the causes of the accident for years he explained the fall had been impending one sign had followed another the joints had opened the plaster had cracked the old walls bowed inward last not three weeks ago the cellardoor had begun to work with difficulty in its grooves the cellar he said gravely shaking his head over a glass of mulled wine that reminds me of my poor vintages by a manifest providence the hermitage was nearly at an end one bottlei lose but one bottle of that incomparable wine it had been set apart against jeanmaries wedding well i must lay down some more it will be an interest in life i am however a man somewhat advanced in years my great work is now buried in the fall of my humble roof it will never be completedmy name will have been writ in water and yet you find me calmi would say cheerful can your priest do more  by the first glimpse of day the party sallied forth from the fireside into the street the wind had fallen but still charioted a world of troubled clouds the air bit like frost and the party as they stood about the ruins in the rainy twilight of the morning beat upon their breasts and blew into their hands for warmth the house had entirely fallen the walls outward the roof in it was a mere heap of rubbish with here and there a forlorn spear of broken rafter a sentinel was placed over the ruins to protect the property and the party adjourned to tentaillons to break their fast at the doctors expense the bottle circulated somewhat freely and before they left the table it had begun to snow  for three days the snow continued to fall and the ruins covered with tarpaulin and watched by sentries were left undisturbed the desprez meanwhile had taken up their abode at tentaillons madame spent her time in the kitchen concocting little delicacies with the admiring aid of madame tentaillon or sitting by the fire in thoughtful abstraction the fall of the house affected her wonderfully little that blow had been parried by another and in her mind she was continually fighting over again the battle of the trousers had she done right had she done wrong and now she would applaud her determination and anon with a horrid flush of unavailing penitence she would regret the trousers no juncture in her life had so much exercised her judgment in the meantime the doctor had become vastly pleased with his situation two of the summer boarders still lingered behind the rest prisoners for lack of a remittance they were both english but one of them spoke french pretty fluently and was besides a humorous agileminded fellow with whom the doctor could reason by the hour secure of comprehension many were the glasses they emptied many the topics they discussed  anastasie the doctor said on the third morning take an example from your husband from jeanmarie the excitement has done more for the boy than all my tonics he takes his turn as sentry with positive gusto as for me you behold me i have made friends with the egyptians and my pharaoh is i swear it a most agreeable companion you alone are hipped about a housea few dresses what are they in comparison to the pharmacopoeiathe labour of years lying buried below stones and sticks in this depressing hamlet the snow falls i shake it from my cloak imitate me our income will be impaired i grant it since we must rebuild but moderation patience and philosophy will gather about the hearth in the meanwhile the tentaillons are obliging the table with your additions will pass only the wine is execrablewell i shall send for some today my pharaoh will be gratified to drink a decent glass aha and i shall see if he possesses that acme of organisationa palate if he has a palate he is perfect  henri she said shaking her head you are a man you cannot understand my feelings no woman could shake off the memory of so public a humiliation  the doctor could not restrain a titter pardon me darling he said but really to the philosophical intelligence the incident appears so small a trifle you looked extremely well  henri she cried  well well i will say no more he replied though to be sure if you had consented to indueÀ propos he broke off and my trousers they are lying in the snowmy favourite trousers and he dashed in quest of jeanmarie  two hours afterwards the boy returned to the inn with a spade under one arm and a curious sop of clothing under the other  the doctor ruefully took it in his hands they have been he said their tense is past excellent pantaloons you are no more stay something in the pocket and he produced a piece of paper a letter ay now i mind me it was received on the morning of the gale when i was absorbed in delicate investigations it is still legible from poor dear casimir it is as well he chuckled that i have educated him to patience poor casimir and his correspondencehis infinitesimal timorous idiotic correspondence  he had by this time cautiously unfolded the wet letter but as he bent himself to decipher the writing a cloud descended on his brow  bigre he cried with a galvanic start  and then the letter was whipped into the fire and the doctors cap was on his head in the turn of a hand  ten minutes i can catch it if i run he cried it is always late i go to paris i shall telegraph  henri what is wrong cried his wife  ottoman bonds came from the disappearing doctor and anastasie and jeanmarie were left face to face with the wet trousers desprez had gone to paris for the second time in seven years he had gone to paris with a pair of wooden shoes a knitted spencer a black blouse a country nightcap and twenty francs in his pocket the fall of the house was but a secondary marvel the whole world might have fallen and scarce left his family more petrified       chapter viii    the wages of philosophy   on the morning of the next day the doctor a mere spectre of himself was brought back in the custody of casimir they found anastasie and the boy sitting together by the fire and desprez who had exchanged his toilette for a readymade rigout of poor materials waved his hand as he entered and sank speechless on the nearest chair madame turned direct to casimir  what is wrong she cried  well replied casimir what have i told you all along it has come it is a clean shave this time so you may as well bear up and make the best of it house down too eh bad luck upon my soul  are weare weruined she gasped  the doctor stretched out his arms to her ruined he replied you are ruined by your sinister husband  casimir observed the consequent embrace through his eyeglass then he turned to jeanmarie you hear he said they are ruined no more pickings no more house no more fat cutlets it strikes me my friend that you had best be packing the present speculation is about worked out and he nodded to him meaningly  never cried desprez springing up jeanmarie if you prefer to leave me now that i am poor you can go you shall receive your hundred francs if so much remains to me but if you will consent to staythe doctor wept a littlecasimir offers me a placeas clerk he resumed the emoluments are slender but they will be enough for three it is too much already to have lost my fortune must i lose my son  jeanmarie sobbed bitterly but without a word  i dont like boys who cry observed casimir this one is always cryinghere you clear out of this for a little i have business with your master and mistress and these domestic feelings may be settled after i am gone march and he held the door open  jeanmarie slunk out like a detected thief  by twelve they were all at table but jeanmarie  hey said casimir gone you see took the hint at once  i do not i confess said desprez i do not seek to excuse his absence it speaks a want of heart that disappoints me sorely  want of manners corrected casimir heart he never had why desprez for a clever fellow you are the most gullible mortal in creation your ignorance of human nature and human business is beyond belief you are swindled by heathen turks swindled by vagabond children swindled right and left upstairs and downstairs i think it must be your imagination i thank my stars i have none  pardon me replied desprez still humbly but with a return of spirit at sight of a distinction to be drawn pardon me casimir you possess even to an eminent degree the commercial imagination it was the lack of that in meit appears it is my weak pointthat has led to these repeated shocks by the commercial imagination the financier forecasts the destiny of his investments marks the falling house  egad interrupted casimir our friend the stableboy appears to have his share of it  the doctor was silenced and the meal was continued and finished principally to the tune of the brotherinlaws not very consolatory conversation he entirely ignored the two young english painters turning a blind eyeglass to their salutations and continuing his remarks as if he were alone in the bosom of his family and with every second word he ripped another stitch out of the airballoon of desprez vanity by the time coffee was over the poor doctor was as limp as a napkin  let us go and see the ruins said casimir  they strolled forth into the street the fall of the house like the loss of a front tooth had quite transformed the village through the gap the eye commanded a great stretch of open snowy country and the place shrank in comparison it was like a room with an open door the sentinel stood by the green gate looking very red and cold but he had a pleasant word for the doctor and his wealthy kinsman  casimir looked at the mound of ruins he tried the quality of the tarpaulin hm he said i hope the cellar arch has stood if it has my good brother i will give you a good price for the wines  we shall start digging tomorrow said the sentry there is no more fear of snow  my friend returned casimir sententiously you had better wait till you get paid  the doctor winced and began dragging his offensive brotherinlaw towards tentaillons in the house there would be fewer auditors and these already in the secret of his fall  hullo cried casimir there goes the stableboy with his luggage no egad he is taking it into the inn  and sure enough jeanmarie was seen to cross the snowy street and enter tentaillons staggering under a large hamper  the doctor stopped with a sudden wild hope  what can he have he said let us go and see and he hurried on  his luggage to be sure answered casimir he is on the movethanks to the commercial imagination  i have not seen that hamper forfor ever so long remarked the doctor  nor will you see it much longer chuckled casimir unless indeed we interfere and by the way i insist on an examination  you will not require said desprez positively with a sob and casting a moist triumphant glance at casimir he began to run  what the devil is up with him i wonder casimir reflected and then curiosity taking the upper hand he followed the doctors example and took to his heels  the hamper was so heavy and large and jeanmarie himself so little and so weary that it had taken him a great while to bundle it upstairs to the desprez private room and he had just set it down on the floor in front of anastasie when the doctor arrived and was closely followed by the man of business boy and hamper were both in a most sorry plight for the one had passed four months underground in a certain cave on the way to achères and the other had run about five miles as hard as his legs would carry him half that distance under a staggering weight  jeanmarie cried the doctor in a voice that was only too seraphic to be called hysterical is it it is he cried oh my son my son and he sat down upon the hamper and sobbed like a little child  you will not go to paris now said jeanmarie sheepishly  casimir said desprez raising his wet face do you see that boy that angel boy he is the thief he took the treasure from a man unfit to be entrusted with its use he brings it back to me when i am sobered and humbled these casimir are the fruits of my teaching and this moment is the reward of my life  tiens said casimir       end of vol vi                                       printed by cassell and company limited la belle sauvage london ec
