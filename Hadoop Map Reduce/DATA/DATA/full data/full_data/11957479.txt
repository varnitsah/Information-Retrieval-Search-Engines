11957479	the letters  of  hw charles dickens     the letters  of  charles dickens  edited by  his sisterinlaw and his eldest daughter  in two volumes  vol i  1833 to 1856  london  chapman and hall 193

          is lovingly inscribed            by her aunt and sister     preface   we intend this collection of letters to be a supplement to the life of charles dickens by john forster that work perfect and exhaustive as a biography is only incomplete as regards correspondence the scheme of the book having made it impossible to include in its space any letters or hardly any besides those addressed to mr forster as no man ever expressed himself more in his letters than charles dickens we believe that in publishing this careful selection from his general correspondence we shall be supplying a want which has been universally felt  our request for the loan of letters was so promptly and fully responded to that we have been provided with more than sufficient material for our work by arranging the letters in chronological order we find that they very frequently explain themselves and form a narrative of the events of each year our collection dates from 1833 the commencement of charles dickenss literary life just before the starting of the pickwick papers and is carried on up to the day before his death in 1870  we find some difficulty in being quite accurate in the arrangements of letters up to the end of 1839 for he had a careless habit in those days about dating his letters very frequently putting only the day of the week on which he wrote curiously in contrast with the habit of his later life when his dates were always of the very fullest  a blank is made in charles dickenss correspondence with his family by the absence of any letter addressed to his daughter kate mrs perugini to her great regret and to ours in 1873 her furniture and other possessions were stored in the warehouse of the pantechnicon at the time of the great fire there all her property was destroyed and among other things a box of papers which included her letters from her father  it was our intention as well as our desire to have thanked individually every oneboth living friends and representatives of dead onesfor their readiness to give us every possible help to make our work complete but the number of such friends besides correspondents hitherto unknown who have volunteered contributions of letters make it impossible in our space to do otherwise than to express collectively our earnest and heartfelt thanks  a separate word of gratitude however must be given by us to mr wilkie collins for the invaluable help which we have received from his great knowledge and experience in the technical part of our work and for the deep interest which he has shown from the beginning in our undertaking  it is a great pleasure to us to have the name of henry fielding dickens associated with this book to him for the very important assistance he has given in making our index we return our loving thanks  in writing our explanatory notes we have we hope left nothing out which in any way requires explanation from us but we have purposely made them as short as possible our great desire being to give to the public another book from charles dickenss own handsas it were a portrait of himself by himself  those letters which need no explanationand of those we have manywe give without a word from us  in publishing the more private letters we do so with the view of showing him in his homely domestic lifeof showing how in the midst of his own constant and arduous work no household matter was considered too trivial to claim his care and attention he would take as much pains about the hanging of a picture the choosing of furniture the superintending any little improvement in the house as he would about the more serious business of his life thus carrying out to the very letter his favourite motto of what is worth doing at all is worth doing well                                            mamie

1836  narrative   we have been able to procure so few early letters of any general interest that we put these first years together charles dickens was then living as a bachelor in furnivals inn and was engaged as a parliamentary reporter on the morning chronicle the sketches by boz were written during these years published first in the monthly magazine and continued in the evening chronicle he was engaged to be married to catherine hogarth in 1835the marriage took place on the 2nd april 1836 and he continued to live in furnivals inn with his wife for more than a year after their marriage they passed the summer months of that year in a lodging at chalk near gravesend in the neighbourhood associated with all his life from his childhood to his death the two letters which we publish addressed to his wife as miss hogarth have no date but were written in 1835 the first of the two refers to the offer made to him by chapman and hall to edit a monthly periodical the emolument which he calls too tempting to resist to be fourteen pounds a month the bargain was concluded and this was the starting of the pickwick papers the first number was published in march 1836 the second letter to miss hogarth was written after he had completed three numbers of pickwick and the character who is to make a decided hit is jingle  the first letter of this book is addressed to henry austin a friend from his boyhood who afterwards married his second sister letitia it bears no date but must have been written in 1833 or 1834 during the early days of his reporting for the morning chronicle the journey on which he was ordered being for that paper   sidenote mr henry austin                             furnivals inn wednesday night past 12  dear henry  i have just been ordered on a journey the

signature at the close of each letter excepting to the first and last letters of our collection charles dickenss handwriting altered so much during these years of his life that we have thought it advisable to give a facsimile of his autograph to this our first letter and we reproduce in the same way his latest autograph   sidenote miss hogarth                              furnivals inn wednesday evening 1835  my dearest kate  the house is up but i am very sorry to say that i must stay at home i have had a visit from the publishers this morning and the story cannot be any longer delayed it must be done tomorrow as there are more important considerations than the mere payment for the story involved too i must exercise a little selfdenial and set to work  they chapman and hall have made me an offer of fourteen pounds a month to write and edit a new publication they contemplate entirely by myself to be published monthly and each number to contain four woodcuts i am to make my estimate and calculation and to give them a decisive answer on friday morning the work will be no joke but the emolument is too tempting to resist                                       sidenote the same                                                       sunday evening                                       i have at this moment got pickwick and his friends on the rochester coach and they are going on swimmingly in company with a very different character from any i have yet described who i flatter myself will make a decided hit i want to get them from the ball to the inn before i go to bed and i think that will take me until one or two oclock at the earliest the publishers will be here in the morning so you will readily suppose i have no alternative but to stick at my desk                                          1837  narrative   from the commencement of the pickwick papers and of charles dickenss married life dates the commencement of his literary life and his sudden worldwide fame and this year saw the beginning of many of those friendships which he most valued and of which he had most reason to be proud and which friendships were ended only by death  the first letters which we have been able to procure to mr macready and mr harley will be found under this date in january 1837 he was living in furnivals inn where his first child a son was born it was an eventful year to him in many ways he removed from furnivals inn to doughty street in march and here he sustained the first great grief of his life his young sisterinlaw mary hogarth to whom he was devotedly attached died very suddenly at his house on the 7th may in the autumn of this year he took lodgings at broadstairs this was his first visit to that pleasant little wateringplace of which he became very fond and whither he removed for the autumn months with all his household for many years in succession  besides the monthly numbers of pickwick which were going on through this year until november when the last number appeared he had commenced oliver twist which was appearing also monthly in the magazine called bentleys miscellany long before pickwick was completed and during this year he had edited for mr bentley the life of grimaldi the celebrated clown to this book he wrote himself only the preface and altered and rearranged the autobiographical ms which was in mr bentleys possession  the letter to mr harley which bears no date but must have been written either in 1836 or 1837 refers to a farce called the strange gentleman founded on one of the sketches called the great winglebury duel which he wrote expressly for mr harley and which was produced at the st jamess theatre under the management of mr braham the only other piece which he wrote for that theatre was the story of an operetta called the village coquettes the music of which was composed by mr john hullah   sidenote mr j p harley                                 48 doughty street saturday morning  my dear sir  i have considered the terms on which i could afford just now to sell mr braham the acting copyright in london of an entirely new piece for the st jamess theatre and i could not sit down to write one in a single act of about one hour long under a hundred pounds for a new piece in two acts a hundred and fifty pounds would be the sum i should require  i do not know whether with reference to arrangements that were made with any other writers this may or may not appear a large item i state it merely with regard to the value of my own time and writings at this moment and in so doing i assure you i place the remuneration below the mark rather than above it  as you begged me to give you my reply upon this point perhaps you will lay it before mr braham if these terms exceed his inclination or the ability of the theatre there is an end of the matter and no harm done                                       believe me ever faithfully yours   sidenote mr w c macready                                48 doughty

halfpast precisely at which only talfourd forster ainsworth jerdan and the publishers will be present it is to celebrate that is too great a word but i can think of no better the conclusion of my pickwick labours and so i intend before you take that roll upon the grass you spoke of to beg your acceptance of one of the first complete copies of the work i shall be much delighted if you would join us  i know too well the many anxieties that press upon you just now to seek to persuade you to come if you would prefer a nights repose and quiet let me assure you notwithstanding most honestly and heartily that there is no one i should be more happy or gratified to see and that among your brilliant circle of wellwishers and admirers you number none more unaffectedly and faithfully yours than                                          my dear sir yours most truly     1838  narrative   in february of this year charles dickens made an expedition with his friend and the illustrator of most of his books mr hablot k browne phiz to investigate for himself the real facts as to the condition of the yorkshire schools and it may be observed that portions of a letter to his wife dated greta bridge yorkshire which will be found among the following letters were reproduced in nicholas nickleby in the early summer he had a cottage at twickenham park in august and september he was again at broadstairs and in the late autumn he made another bachelor excursionmr browne being again his companionin england which included his first visit to stratfordonavon and kenilworth in february appeared the first number of nicholas nickleby on which work he was engaged all through the year writing each number ready for the following month and never being in advance as was his habit with all his other periodical works until his very latest ones  the first letter which appears under this date from twickenham park is addressed to mr thomas mitton a schoolfellow at one of his earliest schools and afterwards for some years his solicitor the letter contains instructions for his first will the friend of almost his whole life mr john forster being appointed executor to this will as he was to the last to which he was called upon to act only three years before his own death  the letter which we give in this year to mr justice talfourd is unfortunately the only one we have been able to procure to that friend who was however one with whom he was most intimately associated and with whom he maintained a constant correspondence  the letter beginning respected sir was an answer to a little boy master hastings hughes who had written to him as nicholas nickleby approached completion stating his views and wishes as to the rewards and punishments to be bestowed on the various characters in the book the letter was sent to him through the rev thomas barham author of the ingoldsby legends  the two letters to mr macready at the end of this year refer to a farce which charles dickens wrote with an idea that it might be suitable for covent garden theatre then under mr macreadys management   sidenote mrs charles dickens                               greta bridge thursday feb 1st 1838  my dearest kate  i am afraid you will receive this later than i could wish as the mail does not come through this place until two oclock tomorrow morning however i have availed myself of the very first opportunity of writing so the fault is that mails and not this  we reached grantham between nine and ten on thursday night and found everything prepared for our reception in the very best inn i have ever put up at it is odd enough that an old lady who had been outside all day and came in towards dinner time turned out to be the mistress of a yorkshire school returning from the holiday stay in london she was a very queer old lady and showed us a long letter she was carrying to one of the boys from his father containing a severe lecture enforced and aided by many texts of scripture on his refusing to eat boiled meat she was very communicative drank a great deal of brandy and water and towards evening became insensible in which state we left her  yesterday we were up again shortly after seven am came on upon our journey by the glasgow mail which charged us the remarkably low sum of six pounds fare for two places inside we had a very droll male companion until seven oclock in the evening and a most delicious ladysmaid for twenty miles who implored us to keep a sharp lookout at the coachwindows as she expected the carriage was coming to meet her and she was afraid of missing it we had many delightful vauntings of the same kind but in the end it is scarcely necessary to say that the coach did not come but a very dirty girl did  as we came further north the mire grew deeper about eight oclock it began to fall heavily and as we crossed the wild heaths hereabout there was no vestige of a track the mail kept on well however and at eleven we reached a bare place with a house standing alone in the midst of a dreary moor which the guard informed us was greta bridge i was in a perfect agony of apprehension for it was fearfully cold and there were no outward signs of anybody being up in the house but to our great joy we discovered a comfortable room with drawn curtains and a most blazing fire in half an hour they gave us a smoking supper and a bottle of mulled port in which we drank your health and then we retired to a couple of capital bedrooms in each of which there was a rousing fire halfway up the chimney  we have had for breakfast toast cakes a yorkshire pie a piece of beef about the size and much the shape of my portmanteau tea coffee ham and eggs and are now going to look about us having finished our discoveries we start in a postchaise for barnard castle which is only four miles off and there i deliver the letter given me by mittons friend all the schools are round about that place and a dozen old abbeys besides which we shall visit by some means or other tomorrow we shall reach york on saturday i hope and god willing i trust i shall be at home on wednesday morning  i wish you would call on mrs bentley and thank her for the letter you can tell her when i expect to be in york  a thousand loves and kisses to the darling boy whom i see in my minds eye crawling about the floor of this yorkshire inn bless his heart i would give two sovereigns for a kiss remember me too to frederick who i hope is attentive to you  is it not extraordinary that the same dreams which have constantly visited me since poor mary died follow me everywhere after all the change of scene and fatigue i have dreamt of her ever since i left home and no doubt shall till i return i should be sorry to lose such visions for they are very happy ones if it be only the seeing her in ones sleep i would fain believe too sometimes that her spirit may have some influence over them but their perpetual repetition is extraordinary  love to all friends                                   ever my dear kate                                             your affectionate husband   sidenote mr thomas mitton                                       twickenham park tuesday night  dear tom  i sat down this morning and put on paper my testamentary meaning whether it is sufficiently legal or not is another question but i hope it is the rough draft of the clauses which i enclose will be preceded by as much of the fair copy as i send you and followed by the usual clause about the receipts of the trustees being a sufficient discharge i also wish to provide that if all our children should die before twentyone and kate married again half the surplus should go to her and half to my surviving brothers and sisters share and share alike  this will be all except a few lines i wish to add which there will be no occasion to consult you about as they will merely bear reference to a few tokens of remembrance and one or two slight funeral directions and so pray god that you may be gray and forster bald long before you are called upon to act as my executors  i suppose i shall see you at the waterparty on thursday we will then make an appointment for saturday morning and if you think my clauses will do i will complete my copy seal it up and leave it in your hands there are some other papers which you ought to have we must get a box

derived from the receipt of your letter i have heard little of you and seen less for so long a time that your handwriting came like the renewal of some old friendship and gladdened my eyes like the face of some old friend  if i hear from lady holland before you return i shall as in duty bound present myself at her bidding but between you and me and the general post i hope she may not renew her invitation until i can visit her with you as i would much rather avail myself of your personal introduction however whatever her ladyship may do i shall respond to and anyway shall be only too happy to avail myself of what i am sure cannot fail to form a very pleasant and delightful introduction  your kind invitation and reminder of the subject of a pleasant conversation in one of our pleasant rides has thrown a gloom over the brightness of twickenham for here i am chained it is indispensably necessary that oliver twist should be published in three volumes in september next i have only just begun the last one and having the constant drawback of my monthly work shall be sadly harassed to get it finished in time especially as i have several very important scenes important to the story i mean yet to write nothing would give me so much pleasure as to be with you for a week or so i can only imperfectly console myself with the hope that when you see oliver you will like the close of the book and approve my selfdenial in staying here to write it i should like to know your address in scotland when you leave town so that i may send you the earliest copy if it be produced in the vacation which i pray heaven it may  meanwhile believe that though my body is on the banks of the thames half my heart is going the oxford circuit  mrs dickens and charley desire their best remembrances the latter expresses some anxiety not unmixed with apprehension relative to the copyright bill in which he conceives himself interested with hearty wishes that you may have a fine autumn which is all you want being sure of all other means of enjoyment that a man can have                                i am my dear talfourd                                                 ever faithfully yours  psi hope you are able to spare a moment now and then to glance at nicholas nickleby and that you have as yet found no reason to alter the opinion you formed on the appearance of the first number  you know i suppose that they elected me at the athenæum pray thank mr serjeant storks for me   sidenote mrs charles dickens                     lion hotel shrewsbury thursday nov 1st 1838  my dearest love  i received your welcome letter on arriving here last night and am rejoiced to hear that the dear children are so much better i hope that in your next or your next but one i shall learn that they are quite well a thousand kisses to them i wish i could convey them myself  we found a roaring fire an elegant dinner a snug room and capital beds all ready for us at leamington after a very agreeable but very cold ride we started in a postchaise next morning for kenilworth with which we were both enraptured and where i really think we must have lodgings next summer please god that we are in good health and all goes well you cannot conceive how delightful it is to read among the ruins in fine weather would be perfect luxury from here we went on to warwick castle which is an ancient building newly restored and possessing no very great attraction beyond a fine view and some beautiful pictures and thence to stratforduponavon where we sat down in the room where shakespeare was born and left our autographs and read those of other people and so forth  we remained at stratford all night and found to our unspeakable dismay that fathers plan of proceeding by bridgenorth was impracticable as there were no coaches so we were compelled to come here by way of birmingham and wolverhampton starting at eight oclock through a cold wet fog and travelling when the day had cleared up through miles of cinderpaths and blazing furnaces and roaring steamengines and such a mass of dirt gloom and misery as i never before witnessed we got pretty well accommodated here when we arrived at halfpast four and are now going off in a postchaise to llangollenthirty mileswhere we shall remain tonight and where the bangor mail will take us up tomorrow such are our movements up to this point and when i have received your letter at chester i shall write to you again and tell you when i shall be back i can say positively that i shall not exceed the fortnight and i think it very possible that i may return a day or two before it expires  we were at the play last night it was a bespeakthe love chase a ballet with a phenomenon divers songs and a roland for an oliver it is a good theatre but the actors are very funny browne laughed with such indecent heartiness at one point of the entertainment that an old gentleman in the next box suffered the most violent indignation the bespeak party occupied two boxes the ladies were fulldressed and the gentlemen to a man in white gloves with flowers in their buttonholes it amused us mightily and was really as like the miss snevellicci business as it could well be  my side has been very bad since i left home although i have been very careful not to drink much remaining to the full as abstemious as usual and have not eaten any great quantity having no appetite i suffered such an ecstasy of pain all night at stratford that i was half dead yesterday and was obliged last night to take a dose of henbane the effect was most delicious i slept soundly and without feeling the least uneasiness and am a great deal better this morning neither do i find that the henbane has affected my head which from the great effect it had upon meexhilarating me to the most extraordinary degree and yet keeping me sleepyi feared it would if i had not got better i should have turned back to birmingham and come straight home by the railroad as it is i hope i shall make out the trip  god bless you my darling i long to be back with you again and to see the sweet babs                            your faithful and most affectionate husband   sidenote master hastings

cry which being a cowardly thing is just what i should have expected from himwouldnt you  i have carefully done what you told me in your letter about the lamb and the two sheeps for the little boys they have also had some good ale and porter and some wine i am sorry you didnt say what wine you would like them to have i gave them some sherry which they liked very much except one boy who was a little sick and choked a good deal he was rather greedy and thats the truth and i believe it went the wrong way which i say served him right and i hope you will say so too  nicholas had his roast lamb as you said he was to but he could not eat it all and says if you do not mind his doing so he should like to have the rest hashed tomorrow with some greens which he is very fond of and so am i he said he did not like to have his porter hot for he thought it spoilt the flavour so i let him have it cold you should have seen him drink it i thought he never would have left off i also gave him three pounds of money all in sixpences to make it seem more and he said directly that he should give more than half to his mamma and sister and divide the rest with poor smike and i say he is a good fellow for saying so and if anybody says he isnt i am ready to fight him whenever they likethere  fanny squeers shall be attended to depend upon it your drawing of her is very like except that i dont think the hair is quite curly enough the nose is particularly like hers and so are the legs she is a nasty disagreeable thing and i know it will make her very cross when she sees it and what i say is that i hope it may you will say the same i knowat least i think you will  i meant to have written you a long letter but i cannot write very fast when i like the person i am writing to because that makes me

hand it would have been finished by this time but i found myself compelled to set to work first at the nickleby on which i am at present engaged and which i regret to sayafter my close and arduous application last monthi find i cannot write as quickly as usual i must finish it at latest by the 24th a doubtful comfort and the instant i have done so i will apply myself to the farce i am afraid to name any particular day but i pledge myself that you shall have it this month and you may calculate on that promise i send you with this a copy of a farce i wrote for harley when he left drury lane and in which he acted for some seventy nights it is the best thing he does it is barely possible you might like to try it any local or temporary allusions could be easily altered  believe me that i only feel gratified and flattered by your inquiry after the farce and that if i had as much time as i have inclination i would write on and on and on farce after farce and comedy after comedy until i wrote you something that would run you do me justice when you give me credit for good intentions but the extent of my goodwill and strong and warm interest in you personally and your great undertaking you cannot fathom nor express                              believe me my dear macready                                                 ever faithfully yours  psfor heavens sake dont fancy that i hold

was still living in doughty street but he removed at the end of this year to 1 devonshire terrace regents park he hired a cottage at petersham for the summer months and in the autumn took lodgings at broadstairs  the cottage at alphington near exeter mentioned in the letter to mr mitton was hired by charles dickens for his parents  he was at work all through this year on nicholas nickleby  we have now the commencement of his correspondence with mr george cattermole his first letter was written immediately after mr cattermoles marriage with miss elderton a distant connection of charles dickens hence the allusions to cousin which will be found in many of his letters to mr cattermole the bride and bridegroom were passing their honeymoon in the neighbourhood of petersham and the letter refers to a request from them for the loan of some books and also to his having lent them his pony carriage and groom during their stay in this neighbourhood  the first letter in this year to mr macready is in answer to one from him announcing his retirement from the management of covent garden theatre  the portrait by mr maclise mentioned to mr harley was the now wellknown one which appeared as a frontispiece to nicholas nickleby   sidenote mr w c macready                                               doughty street sunday  my dear macready  i will have if you please three dozen of the extraordinary champagne and i am much obliged to you for recollecting me  i ought not to be sorry to hear of your abdication but i am notwithstanding most heartily and sincerely sorry for my own sake and the sake of thousands who may now go and whistle for a theatreat least such a theatre as you gave them and i do now in my heart believe that for a long and dreary time that exquisite delight has passed away if i may jest with my misfortunes and quote the portsmouth critic of mr crummless company i say that as an exquisite embodiment of the poets visions and a realisation of human intellectuality gilding with refulgent light our dreamy moments and laying open a new and magic world before the mental eye the drama is goneperfectly gone  with the same perverse and unaccountable feeling which causes a heartbroken man at a dear friends funeral to see something irresistibly comical in a rednosed or oneeyed undertaker i receive your communication with ghostly facetiousness though on a moments reflection i find better cause for consolation in the hope that relieved from your most trying and painful duties you will now have leisure to return to pursuits more congenial to your mind and to move more easily and pleasantly among your friends in the long catalogue of the latter i believe that there is not one prouder of the name or more grateful for the store of delightful recollections you have enabled him to heap up from boyhood than                                   my dear macready                                               yours always faithfully   sidenote mr

the very first walk and took a cottage at a place called alphington one mile from exeter which contains on the groundfloor a good parlour and kitchen and above a fullsized country drawingroom and three bedrooms in the yard behind coalholes fowlhouses and meatsafes out of number in the kitchen a neat little range in the other rooms good stoves and cupboards and all for twenty pounds a year taxes included there is a good garden at the side well stocked with cabbages beans onions celery and some flowers the stock belonging to the landlady who lives in the adjoining cottage there was some question whether she was not entitled to half the produce but i settled the point by paying five shillings and becoming absolute master of the whole  i do assure you that i am charmed with the place and the beauty of the country round about though i have not seen it under very favourable circumstances for it snowed when i was there this morning and blew bitterly from the east yesterday it is really delightful and when the house is to rights and the furniture all in i shall be quite sorry to leave it i have had some few things secondhand but i take it seventy pounds will be the mark even taking this into consideration i include in that estimate glass and crockery garden tools and such like little things there is a spare bedroom of course that i have furnished too  i am on terms of the closest intimacy with mrs samuell the landlady and her brother and sisterinlaw who have a little farm hard by they are capital specimens of country folks and i really think the old woman herself will be a great comfort to my mother coals are dear just nowtwentysix shillings a ton they found me a boy to go two miles out and back again to order some this morning i was debating in my mind whether i should give him eighteenpence or two shillings when his fee was announcedtwopence  the house is on the high road to plymouth and though in the very heart of devonshire there is as much longstage and posting life as you would find in piccadilly the situation is charming meadows in front an orchard running parallel to the garden hedge richlywooded hills closing in the prospect behind and away to the left before a splendid view of the hill on which exeter is situated the cathedral towers rising up into the sky in the most picturesque manner possible i dont think i ever saw so cheerful or pleasant a spot the drawingroom is nearly if not quite as large as the outer room of my old chambers in furnivals inn the paint and paper are new and the place clean as the utmost excess of snowy cleanliness can be  you would laugh if you could see me powdering away with the upholsterer and endeavouring to bring about all sorts of impracticable reductions and wonderful arrangements he has by him two secondhand carpets the important ceremony of trying the same comes off at three this afternoon i am perpetually going backwards and forwards it is two miles from here so i have plenty of exercise which so occupies me and prevents my being lonely that i stopped at home to read last night and shall tonight although the theatre is open charles kean has been the star for the last two evenings he was stopping in this house and went away this morning i have got his sittingroom now which is smaller and more comfortable than the one i had before  you will have heard perhaps that i wrote to my mother to come down tomorrow there are so many things she can make comfortable at a much less expense than i could that i thought it best if i had not i could not have returned on monday which i now hope to do and to be in town at halfpast eight  will you tell my father that if he could devise any means of bringing him down i think it would be a great thing for him to have dash if it be only to keep down the trampers and beggars the cheque i send you below                                       sidenote mr george cattermole                            elm cottage petersham wednesday

there he shall not be long for i shall be visiting my other home on saturday morning and will bring him bodily down and forward him the moment he arrives  not having many of my books here i dont find any among them which i think more suitable to your purpose than a carpetbagful sent herewith containing the italian and german novelists convenient as being easily taken up and laid down again and i suppose you wont read long at a sitting leigh hunts indicator and companion which have the same merit hoods own complete a legend of montrose and kenilworth which i have just been reading with greater delight than ever and so i suppose everybody else must be equally interested in i have goldsmith swift fielding smollett and the british essayists handy and i need not say that you have them on hand too if you like  you know all i would say from my heart and soul on the auspicious event of yesterday but you dont know what i could say about the delightful recollections i have of your good ladys charming looks and bearing upon which i discoursed most eloquently here last evening and at considerable length as i am crippled in this respect however by the suspicion that possibly she may be looking over your shoulder while you read this note i would lay a moderate wager that you have looked round twice or thrice already i shall content myself with saying that i am ever heartily my dear

please it can never give us anything but delight to see you and it is better to look forward to such a pleasure than to look back upon it as the last gratification is enjoyable all our lives and the first for a few short stages in the journey  i feel more true and cordial pleasure than i can express to you in the request you have made anything which can serve to commemorate our friendship and to keep the recollection of it alive among our children is believe me and ever will be most deeply prized by me i accept the office with hearty and fervent satisfaction and to render this pleasant bond between us the more complete i must solicit you to become godfather to the last and final branch of a genteel small family of three which i am told may be looked for in that auspicious month when lord mayors are born and guys prevail this i look upon as a bargain between us and i have shaken hands with you in spirit upon it family topics remind me of mr kenwigs as the weather is wet and he is about

think it will it has me i am going to send it back to herwhen i come to elstree will be time enough and meantime if you bestow a couple of hours upon it you will not think them thrown away  its a large parcel and i must keep it here till somebody goes up to town and can book it by the coach i warrant it large as it looks readable in two hours and i very much want to know what you think of the first act and especially the opening which seems to me quite famous the metre is very odd and rough but now and then theres a wildness in it which helps the thing very much and altogether it has left

last number of nickleby and to the book a duplicate of the leaf which i now send you believe me that there will be no leaf in the volume which will afford me in times to come more true pleasure and gratification than that in which i have written your name as foremost among those of the friends whom i love and honour believe me there will be no one line in it conveying a more honest truth or a more sincere feeling than that which describes its dedication to you as a slight token of my admiration and regard  so let me tell the world by this frail record that i was a friend of yours and

which speaks to his heart although it does not find its way there through his ears i readily undertook the task and send it herewith  i urged him to call upon you with me and proffer it boldly but he

clock in which the story of the old curiosity shop subsequently appeared nearly all these letters to mr george cattermole refer to the illustrations for this story  the one dated march 9th alludes to short papers written for master humphreys clock prior to the commencement of the old curiosity shop  we have in this year charles dickenss first letter to mr daniel maclise this and one other being unfortunately the only letters we have been able to obtain addressed to this muchloved friend and most intimate companion   sidenote mr george cattermole                                   1 devonshire

the first number doeson saturday the 28th of march and as it has to be sent to america and germany and must therefore be considerably in advance it is now in hand i having in fact begun it on saturday last instead of being published in monthly parts at a shilling each only it will be published in weekly parts at threepence and monthly parts at a shilling my object being to baffle the imitators and make it as novel as possible the plan is a new onei mean the plan of the fictionand it will comprehend a great variety of tales the title is master humphreys clock  now among other improvements i have turned my attention to the illustrations meaning to have woodcuts dropped into the text and no separate plates i want to know whether you would object to make me a little sketch for a woodcutin indianink would be quite sufficientabout the size of the enclosed scrap the subject an old quaint room with antique elizabethan furniture and in the chimneycorner an extraordinary old clockthe clock belonging to master humphrey in fact and no figures this i should drop into the text at the head of my opening page  i want to know besidesas chapman and hall are my partners in the matter there need be no delicacy about my asking or your answering the questionwhat would be your charge for such a thing and whether if the work answers our expectations you would like to repeat the joke at regular intervals and if so on what terms i should tell you that i intend to ask maclise to join me likewise and that the copying the drawing on wood and the cutting will be done in firstrate style we are justified by past experience in supposing that the sale would be enormous and the popularity very great and when i explain to you the notes i have in my head i think you will see that it opens a vast number of very good subjects  i want to talk the matter over with you and wish you would fix your own time and placeeither here or at your house or at the athenæum though this would be the best place because i have my papers about me if you would take a chop with me for instance on tuesday or wednesday i could tell you more in two minutes than in twenty letters albeit i have endeavoured to make this as businesslike and stupid as need be  of course all these tremendous arrangements are as yet a profound secret or there would be fifty humphreys in the field so write me a line like a worthy gentleman and convey my best remembrances to your worthy lady                              believe me always my dear cattermole                                                      faithfully yours

if browne should suggest anything for the future which may enable him to do you justice in copying on which point he is very anxious i will communicate it to you it has occurred to me that perhaps you will like to see his copy on the block before it is cut and i have therefore told chapman and hall to forward it to you  in future i will take care that you have the number to choose your subject from i ought to have done so perhaps in this case but i was very anxious that you should do the room  perhaps the shortest plan will be for me to send you as enclosed regularly but if you prefer keeping account with the publishers they will be happy to enter upon it when where and how you please                                                faithfully yours always   sidenote mr george cattermole

make a slight alteration in their disposal by virtue of which the story about john podgers will stand over for some little time and that short tale will occupy its place which you have already by you and which treats of the assassination of a young gentleman under circumstances of peculiar aggravation i shall be greatly obliged to you if you will turn your attention to this last morsel as the feature of no 3 and still more if you can stretch a point with regard to time which is of the last importance just now and make a subject out of it rather than find one in it i would neither have made this alteration nor have troubled you about it but for weighty and cogent reasons which i feel very strongly and into the composition of which caprice or fastidiousness has no part  i should tell you perhaps with reference to chapman and hall that they will never trouble you as they never trouble me but when there is real and pressing occasion and that their representations in this respect unlike those of most men of business are to be relied upon  i cannot tell you how admirably i think master humphreys room comes out or what glowing accounts i hear of the second design you have done i had not the faintest anticipation of anything so goodtaking into account the material and the despatch                with best regards at home                                believe me dear cattermole

be strips of holly and berries and such free green things window overgrown with ivy the little boy who had that talk with her about angels may be by the bedside if you like it so but i think it will be quieter and more peaceful if she is quite alone i want it to express the most beautiful repose and tranquillity and to have something of a happy look if death can   2  the child has been buried inside the church and the old man who cannot be made to understand that she is dead repairs to the grave and sits there all day long waiting for her arrival to begin another journey his staff and knapsack her little bonnet and basket etc lie beside him shell come tomorrow he says when it gets dark and goes sorrowfully home i think an hourglass running out would help the notion perhaps her little things upon his knee or in his hand  i am breaking my heart over this story and cannot bear to finish it  love to missis                                               ever and always heartily     1841  narrative   in the summer of this year charles dickens made accompanied by mrs dickens his first visit to scotland and was received in edinburgh with the greatest enthusiasm  he was at broadstairs with his family for the autumn and at the close of the year he went to windsor for change of air after a serious illness  on the 17th january the old curiosity shop was finished in the following week the first number of his story of barnaby rudge appeared in master humphreys clock and the last number of this story was written at windsor in november of this year  we have the first letters to his dear and valued friends the rev william harness and mr harrison ainsworth also his first letter to mr monckton milnes now lord houghton  of the letter to mr john tomlin we would only remark that it was published in an american magazine edited by mr e a poe in the year 1842  the new first rate first letter to mr harrison ainsworth must we think be an allusion to the outside cover of bentleys miscellany which first appeared in this year and of which mr ainsworth was editor  the two letters to mr lovejoy are in answer to a requisition from the people of reading that he would represent them in parliament  the letter to mr george cattermole 26th june refers to a dinner given to charles dickens by the people of edinburgh on his first visit to that city  the poor overs mentioned in the letter to mr macready of 24th august was a carpenter dying of consumption to whom dr elliotson had shown extraordinary kindness when poor overs was dying wrote charles dickens to mr forster he suddenly asked for a pen and ink and some paper and made up a little parcel for me which it was his last conscious act to direct she his wife told me this and gave it me i opened it last night it was a copy of his little book in which he had written my name with his devotion i thought it simple and affecting of the poor fellow  the saloon alluded to in our last letter of this year was an institution at drury lane theatre during mr macreadys management the original purpose for which this saloon was established having become perverted and degraded charles dickens had it much at heart to remodel and improve it hence this letter to mr macready   sidenote rev william harness                 devonshire terrace saturday morning jan 2nd 1841  my dear harness  i should have been very glad to join your pleasant party but all next week i shall be laid up with a broken heart for i must occupy myself in finishing the curiosity shop and it is such a painful task to me that i must concentrate myself upon it tooth and nail and go out nowhere until it is done  i have delayed answering your kind note in a vague hope of being heartwhole again by the seventh the present state of my work however christmas not being a very favourable season for making progress in such doings assures me that this cannot be and that i must heroically deny myself the pleasure you offer                                        always believe me                                                      faithfully yours   sidenote mr george cattermole                        devonshire terrace thursday jan 14th 1841  my dear cattermole  i cannot tell you how much obliged i am to you for altering the child or how much i hope that my wish in that respect didnt go greatly against the grain  i saw the old inn this morning words cannot say how good it is i cant bear the thought of its being cut and should like to frame and glaze it in statu quo for ever and ever  will you do a little tailpiece for the curiosity storyonly one figure if you likegiving some notion of the etherealised spirit of the child something like those little figures in the frontispiece if you will and can despatch it at once you will make me happy  i am for the time being nearly dead with work and grief for the loss of my child                                      always my dear george

for no 2 of barnaby but found they had sent it to browne  the first subject of no 3 i will either send to you on saturday or at latest on sunday morning i have also directed chapman and hall to send you proofs of what has gone before for reference if you need it  i want to know whether you feel ravens in general and would fancy barnabys raven in particular barnaby being an idiot my notion is to have him always in company with a pet raven who is immeasurably more knowing than himself to this end i have been studying my bird and think i could make a very queer character of him should you like the subject when this raven makes his first appearance                                                       faithfully always   sidenote mr george cattermole                devonshire terrace saturday evening jan 30th 1841  my dear george  i send you the first four slips of no 48 containing the description of the locksmiths house which i think will make a good subject and one you will like if you put the prentice in it show nothing more than his paper cap because he will be an important character in the story and you will need to know more about him as he is minutely described i may as well say that he is very short should you wish to put the locksmith in you will find him described in no 2 of barnaby which i told chapman and hall to send you browne has done him in one little thing but so very slightly that you will not require to see his sketch i think  now i must know what you think about the raven my buck i otherwise am in this fix i have given browne no subject for this number and time is flying if you would like to have the ravens first appearance and dont object to having both subjects so be it i shall be delighted if otherwise i must feed that hero forthwith  i cannot close this hasty note my dear fellow without saying that i have deeply felt your hearty and most invaluable cooperation in the beautiful illustrations you have made for the last story that i look at them with a pleasure i cannot describe to you in words and that it is impossible for me to say how sensible i am of your earnest and friendly aid believe me that this is the very first time any designs for what i have written have touched and moved me and caused me to feel that they expressed the idea i had in my mind  i am most sincerely and affectionately grateful to you and am full of pleasure and delight                              believe me my dear cattermole                                                 always heartily yours   sidenote mr john tomlin               1

addressed to me if you had entertained a presentiment that it would afford me sincere pleasure and delight to hear from a warmhearted and admiring reader of my books in the backwoods of america you would not have been far wrong  i thank you cordially and heartily both for your letter and its kind and courteous terms to think that i have awakened a fellowfeeling and sympathy with the creatures of many thoughtful hours among the vast solitudes in which you dwell is a source of the purest delight and pride to me and believe me that your expressions of affectionate remembrance and approval sounding from the green forests on the banks of the mississippi sink deeper into my heart and gratify it more than all the honorary distinctions that all the courts in europe could confer  it is such things as these that make one hope one does not live in vain and that are the highest reward of an authors life to be numbered among the household gods of ones distant countrymen and associated with their homes and quiet pleasures to be told that in each nook and corner of the worlds great mass there lives one wellwisher who holds communion with one in the spirit is a worthy fame indeed and one which i would not barter for a mine of wealth  that i may be happy enough to cheer some of your leisure hours for a very long time to come and to hold a place in your pleasant thoughts is the earnest wish of boz  and with all good wishes for yourself and with a sincere reciprocation of all your kindly feeling                                            i am dear sir

binder must have his way i put the best face on the matter and gave him his i will bring it together with the pickwick to your housewarming with me  the old royal george went down in consequence of having too much weight on one side i trust the new first rate wont be heavy anywhere there seems to me to be too much whisker for a shilling but thats a matter of taste

much obliged and flattered by the receipt of your letter which i should have answered immediately on its arrival but for my absence from home at the moment  my principles and inclinations would lead me to aspire to the distinction you invite me to seek if there were any reasonable chance of success and i hope i should do no discredit to such an honour if i won and wore it but i am bound to add and i have no hesitation in saying plainly that i cannot afford the expense of a contested election if i could i would act on your suggestion instantly i am not the less indebted to you and the friends to whom the thought occurred for your good opinion and approval i beg you to understand that i am restrained solely and much against my will by the consideration i have mentioned and thank both you and them most warmly                                                       yours faithfully   sidenote the same                                  devonshire terrace june 10th 1841  dear sir  i am favoured with your note of yesterdays date and lose no time in replying to it  the sum you mention though small i am aware in the abstract is greater than i could afford for such a purpose as the mere sitting in the house and attending to my duties if i were a member would oblige me to make many pecuniary sacrifices consequent upon the very nature of my pursuits  the course you suggest did occur to me when i received your first letter and i have very little doubt indeed that the government would support meperhaps to the whole extent but i cannot satisfy myself that to enter parliament under such circumstances would enable me to pursue that honourable independence without which i could neither preserve my own respect nor that of my constituents i confess therefore it may be from not having considered the points sufficiently or in the right light that i cannot bring myself to propound the subject to any member of the administration whom i know i am truly obliged to you nevertheless and am                                                 dear sir                                                      faithfully yours   sidenote mr george cattermole

them with none of the maypole customers at his back  its in your way and youll do it a hundred times better than i can suggest it to you i know

send you the ms of very early in the week as the best opportunities of illustration are all coming off now and we are in the thick of the story  the rioters went sir from john willets bar where you saw them to such good purpose straight to the warren which house they plundered sacked burned pulled down as much of as they could and greatly damaged and destroyed they are supposed to have left it about half an hour it is night and the ruins are here and there flaming and smoking i wantif you understandto show one of the turrets laid openthe turret where the alarmbell is mentioned in no 1 and among the ruins at some height if possible mr haredale just clutching our friend the mysterious file who is passing over them like a spirit solomon daisy if you can introduce him looking on from the ground below  please to observe that the m f wears a large cloak and a slouched hat this is important because browne will have him in the same number and he has not changed his dress meanwhile mr haredale is supposed to have come down here on horseback pellmell to be excited to the last degree i think it will make a queer picturesque thing in your hands i have told chapman and hall that you may like to have a block of a peculiar shape for it one of them will be with you almost as soon as you receive this  we are very anxious to know that our cousin is out of her trouble and you free from your anxiety mind you write when it comes off and when she is quite comfortable come down here for a day or two like a bachelor as you will be it will do you a world of good think of that

frontispiece for our first volume to come upon the lefthand side of the book as you open it and to face a plain printed title my idea is some scene from the curiosity shop in a pretty border or scrollwork or architectural device it matters not what so that it be pretty the scene even might be a fanciful thing partaking of the character of the story but not reproducing any particular passage in it if you thought that better for the effect  i ask you to think of this because although the volume is not published until the end of september there is no time to lose we wish to have it engraved with great care and worked very skilfully and this cannot be done unless we get it on the stocks soon  they will give you every opportunity of correction alteration revision and all other ations and isions connected with the fine arts                                           always believe me                                                      faithfully yours   sidenote mr george cattermole

remarkable postchaise dolly varden and emma haredale and bore them away with all possible rapidity one of their company driving and the rest running beside the chaise climbing up behind sitting on the top lighting the way with their torches etc etc if you can express the women inside without showing themas by a fluttering veil a delicate arm or so forth appearing at the halfclosed windowso much the better mr tappertit stands on the steps which are partly down and hanging on to the window with one hand and extending the other with great majesty addresses a few words of encouragement to the driver and attendants hugh sits upon the bar in front the driver sitting postilionwise and turns round to look through the window behind him at the little doves within the gentlemen behind are also anxious to catch a glimpse of the ladies one of those who are running at the side may be gently rebuked for his curiosity by the cudgel of hugh so they cut away sir as fast as they can

thoroughly deserves such kindness  what a good fellow elliotson is he kept him in his room a whole hour and has gone into his case as if he were prince albert laying down all manner of elaborate projects and determining to leave his friend wood in town when he himself goes away on purpose to attend to him then he writes me four sides of paper about the man and says he cant go back to his old work for that requires muscular exertion and muscular exertion he mustnt make what are we to do with him he says heres five pounds for the present  i declare before god that i could almost bear the joness for five years out of the pleasure i feel in knowing such things and when i think that every dirty speck upon the fair face of the almightys creation who writes in a filthy beastly newspaper every rottenhearted pander who has been beaten kicked and rolled in the kennel yet struts it in the editorial we once a week every vagabond that an honest mans gorge must rise at every live emetic in that noxious drugshop the press can have his fling at such men and call them knaves and fools and thieves i grow so vicious that with bearing hard upon my pen i break the nib down and with keeping my teeth set make my jaws ache  i have put myself out of sorts for the day and shall go and walk unless the direction of this sets me up again on second thoughts i think it will

humphreys clock as stopped his chair by the fireside empty his crutch against the wall his slippers on the cold hearth his hat upon the chairback the mss of barnaby and the curiosity shop heaped upon

birthday and to be as merry as i wish you to be always but as i am going within a very few days afterwards a very long distance from home and shall not see any of my children for six long months i have made up my mind to pass all that week at home for their sakes just as you would like your papa and mamma to spend all the time they possibly could spare with you if they were about to make a dreary voyage to america which is what i am going to do myself  but although i cannot come to see you on that day you may be sure i shall not forget that it is your birthday and that i shall drink your health and many happy returns in a glass of wine filled as full as it will hold and i shall dine at halfpast five myself so that we may both be drinking our wine at the same time and i shall tell my mary for i have got a daughter of that name but she is a very small one as yet to drink your health too and we shall try and make believe that you are here or that we are in russell square which is the best thing we can do i think under the circumstances  you are growing up so fast that by the time i come home again i expect you will be almost a woman and in a very few years we shall be saying to each other dont you remember what the birthdays used to be in russell square and how strange it seems and how quickly time passes and all that sort of thing you know but i shall always be very glad to be asked on your birthday and to come if you will let me and to send my love to you and to wish that you may live to be very old and very happy which i do now with all my heart

you will be glad to know what it wants  first the refreshments are preposterously dear a glass of wine is a shilling and it ought to be sixpence  secondly they were served out by the wrong sort of peopletwo most uncomfortable drabs of women and a dirty man with his hat on  thirdly there ought to be a boxkeeper to ring a bell or give some other notice of the commencement of the overture to the afterpiece the promenaders were in a perpetual fret and worry to get back again  and fourthly and most important of allif the plan is ever to succeedyou must have some notice up to the effect that as it is now a place of resort for ladies gentlemen are requested not to lounge there in their hats and greatcoats no ladies will go there though the conveniences should be ten thousand times greater while the sort of swells who have been used to kick their heels there do so in the old sort of way i saw this expressed last night more strongly than i can tell you  hearty congratulations on the brilliant triumph i have always expected one as you know but nobody could have imagined the reality                                  always my dear macready                                                  affectionately yours     1842  narrative   in january of this year charles dickens went with his wife to america the house in devonshire terrace being let for the term of their absence six months and the four children left in a furnished house in osnaburgh street regents park under the care of mr and mrs macready they returned from america in july and in august went to broadstairs for the autumn months as usual and in october charles dickens made an expedition to cornwall with mr forster mr maclise and mr stanfield for his companions  during his stay at broadstairs he was engaged in writing his american notes which book was published in october at the end of the year he had written the first number of martin chuzzlewit which appeared in january 1843  an extract from a letter addressed to messrs chapman and hall before his departure for america is given as a testimony of the estimation in which charles dickens held the firm with whom he was connected for so many years  his letters to mr h p smith for many years actuary of the eagle insurance office are a combination of business and friendship mr smith gives us as an explanation of a note to him dated 14th july that he alluded to the stamp of the office upon the cheque which was as he described it almost a work of arta truculentlooking eagle seated on a rock and scattering rays over the whole sheet  of letters written by charles dickens in america we have been able to obtain very few one to dr f h deane cincinnati complying with his request to write him an epitaph for the tombstone of his little child has been kindly copied for us from an album by mrs fields of boston therefore it is not directly received but as we have no doubt of its authenticity we give it here and there is one to mr halleck the american poet  at the close of the voyage to america a very bad and dangerous one a meeting of the passengers with lord mulgrave in the chair took place and a piece of plate and thanks were voted to the captain of the britannia captain hewett the vote of thanks being drawn up by charles dickens is given here we have letters in this year to mr thomas hood miss pardoe mrs trollope and mr w p frith the lastnamed artistthen a very young manhad made great success with several charming pictures of dolly varden one of these was bought by charles dickens who ordered a companion picture of kate nickleby from the young painter whose acquaintance he made at the same time and the two letters to mr frith have reference to the purchase of the one picture and the commission for the other  the letter to mr cattermole is an acknowledgment also of a completed commission of two watercolour drawings from the subjects of two of mr cattermoles illustrations to the old curiosity shop  a note to mr macready at the close of this year refers to the first representation of mr westland marstons play the patricians daughter charles dickens took great interest in the production of this work at drury lane it was to a certain extent an experiment of the effect of a tragedy of modern times and in modern dress and the prologue which charles dickens wrote and which we give was intended to show that there need be no incongruity between plain clothes of this century and high tragedy the play was quite successful   sidenote messrs chapman and hall                                       having disposed of the business part of this letter i should not feel at ease on leaving england if i did not tell you once more with my whole heart that your conduct to me on this and all other occasions has been honourable manly and generous and that i have felt it a solemn duty in the event of any accident happening to me while i am away to place this testimony upon record it forms part of a will i have made for the security of my children for i wish them to know it when they are capable of understanding your worth and my appreciation of it                                   always believe me

i will fulfil the adage and make it a merry one  we came down in great comfort our luggage is now aboard anything so utterly and monstrously absurd as the size of our cabin no gentleman of england who lives at home at ease can for a moment imagine neither of the portmanteaus would go into it there  these cunard packets are not very big you know actually but the quantity of sleepingberths makes them much smaller so that the saloon is not nearly as large as in one of the ramsgate boats the ladies cabin is so close to ours that i could knock the door open without getting off something they call my bed but which i believe to be a muffin beaten flat this is a great comfort for it is an excellent room the only good one in the ship and if there be only one other lady besides kate as the stewardess thinks i hope i shall be able to sit there very often  they talk of seventy passengers but i cant think there will be so many they talk besides which is even more to the purpose of a very fine passage having had a noble one this time last year god send it so we are in the best spirits and full of hope i was dashed for a moment when i saw our cabin but i got over that directly and laughed so much at its ludicrous proportions that you might have heard me all over the ship  god bless you write to me by the first opportunity i will do the like to you and always believe me                                           your old and faithful friend     narrative   at a meeting of the passengers on board the britannia steamship travelling from liverpool to boston held in the saloon of that vessel on friday the 21st january 1842 it was moved and seconded          that the earl of mulgrave do take the chair  the motion having been carried unanimously the earl of mulgrave took the chair accordingly  it was also moved and seconded and carried unanimously          that charles dickens esq be appointed         secretary and treasurer to the meeting  the three following resolutions were then proposed and carried nem con          first that gratefully recognising the         blessing of divine providence by which we are         brought nearly to the termination of our         voyage we have great pleasure in expressing         our high appreciation of captain hewetts         nautical skill and of his indefatigable         attention to the management and safe conduct of         the ship during a more than ordinarily         tempestuous passage          secondly that a subscription be opened for         the purchase of a piece of silver plate and         that captain hewett be respectfully requested         to accept it as a sincere expression of the         sentiments embodied in the foregoing         resolution          thirdly that a committee be appointed to         carry these resolutions into effect and that         the committee be composed of the following         gentlemen charles dickens esq e dunbar         esq and solomon hopkins esq  the committee having withdrawn and conferred with captain hewett returned and informed the meeting that captain hewett desired to attend and express his thanks which he did  the amount of the subscription was reported at fifty pounds and the list was closed it was then agreed that the following inscription should be placed upon the testimonial to captain hewett                                 this piece of plate                                  was presented to                                captain john hewett                             of the britannia steamship          by the passengers on board that vessel in a voyage from liverpool         to boston in the month of january 1842          as a slight acknowledgment of his great ability and skill         under circumstances of much difficulty and danger         and as a feeble token of their lasting gratitude  thanks were then voted to the chairman and to the secretary and the meeting separated   sidenote mr thomas mitton                            tremont house boston january 31st 1842  my dear mitton  i am so exhausted with the life i am obliged to lead here that i have had time to write but one letter which is at all deserving of the name as giving any account of our movements forster has it in trust to tell you all its news and he has also some newspapers which i had an opportunity of sending him in which you will find further particulars of our progress  we had a dreadful passage the worst the officers all concur in saying that they have ever known we were eighteen days coming experienced a dreadful storm which swept away our paddleboxes and stove our lifeboats and ran aground besides near halifax among rocks and breakers where we lay at anchor all night after we left the english channel we had only one fine day and we had the additional discomfort of being eightysix passengers i was ill five days kate six though indeed she had a swelled face and suffered the utmost terror all the way  i can give you no conception of my welcome here there never was a king or emperor upon the earth so cheered and followed by crowds and entertained in public at splendid balls and dinners and waited on by public bodies and deputations of all kinds i have had one from the far westa journey of two thousand miles if i go out in a carriage the crowd surround it and escort me home if i go to the theatre the whole house crowded to the roof rises as one man and the timbers ring again you cannot imagine what it is i have five great public dinners on hand at this moment and invitations from every town and village and city in the states  there is a great deal afloat here in the way of subjects for description i keep my eyes open pretty wide and hope to have done so to some purpose by the time i come home  when you write to me againi say again hoping that your first letter will be soon upon its way heredirect to me to the care of david colden esq new york he will forward all communications by the quickest conveyance and will be perfectly acquainted with all my movements                                            always your faithful friend   sidenote mr fitzgreene halleck                                   carlton

alone but the doctor says that if i talk to man woman or child this evening i shall be dumb tomorrow                            believe me with true regard                                                faithfully your friend   sidenote mr w c macready                                          baltimore march 22nd 1842  my dear friend  i beg your pardon but you were speaking of rash leaps at hasty conclusions are you quite sure you designed that remark for me have you not in the hurry of correspondence slipped a paragraph into my letter which belongs of right to somebody else when did you ever find me leap at wrong conclusions i pause for a reply  pray sir did you ever find me admiring mr  on the contrary did you never hear of my protesting through good better and best report that he was not an open or a candid man and would one day beyond all doubt displease you by not being so i pause again for a reply  are you quite sure mr macreadyand i address myself to you with the sternness of a man in the pitare you quite sure sir that you do not view america through the pleasant mirage which often surrounds a thing that has been but not a thing that is are you quite sure that when you were here you relished it as well as you do now when you look back upon it the early spring birds mr macready do sing in the groves that you were very often not over well pleased with many of the new countrys social aspects are the birds to be trusted again i pause for a reply  my dear macready i desire to be so honest and just to those who have so enthusiastically and earnestly welcomed me that i burned the last letter i wrote to youeven to you to whom i would speak as to myselfrather than let it come with anything that might seem like an illconsidered word of disappointment i preferred that you should think me neglectful if you could imagine anything so wild rather than i should do wrong in this respect still it is of no use i am disappointed this is not the republic i came to see this is not the republic of my imagination i infinitely prefer a liberal monarchyeven with its sickening accompaniments of court circularsto such a government as this the more i think of its youth and strength the poorer and more trifling in a thousand aspects it appears in my eyes in everything of which it has made a boastexcepting its education of the people and its care for poor childrenit sinks immeasurably below the level i had placed it upon and england even england bad and faulty as the old land is and miserable as millions of her people are rises in the comparison  you live here macready as i have sometimes heard you imagining you loving you with all my heart and soul and knowing what your disposition really is i would not condemn you to a years residence on this side of the atlantic for any money freedom of opinion where is it i see a press more mean and paltry and silly and disgraceful than any country i ever knew if that is its standard here it is but i speak of bancroft and am advised to be silent on that subject for he is a black sheepa democrat i speak of bryant and am entreated to be more careful for the same reason i speak of international copyright and am implored not to ruin myself outright i speak of miss martineau and all partiesslave upholders and abolitionists whigs tyler whigs and democrats shower down upon me a perfect cataract of abuse but what has she done surely she praised america enough yes but she told us of some of our faults and americans cant bear to be told of their faults dont split on that rock mr dickens dont write about america we are so very suspicious  freedom of opinion macready if i had been born here and had written my books in this country producing them with no stamp of approval from any other land it is my solemn belief that i should have lived and died poor unnoticed and a black sheep to boot i never was more convinced of anything than i am of that  the people are affectionate generous openhearted hospitable enthusiastic goodhumoured polite to women frank and candid to all strangers anxious to oblige far less prejudiced than they have been described to be frequently polished and refined very seldom rude or disagreeable i have made a great many friends here even in public conveyances whom i have been truly sorry to part from in the towns i have formed perfect attachments i have seen none of that greediness and indecorousness on which travellers have laid so much emphasis i have returned frankness with frankness met questions not intended to be rude with answers meant to be satisfactory and have not spoken to one man woman or child of any degree who has not grown positively affectionate before we parted in the respects of not being left alone and of being horribly disgusted by tobacco chewing and tobacco spittle i have suffered considerably the sight of slavery in virginia the hatred of british feeling upon the subject and the miserable hints of the impotent indignation of the south have pained me very much on the last head of course i have felt nothing but a mingled pity and amusement on the other sheer distress but however much i like the ingredients of this great dish i cannot but come back to the point upon which i started and say that the dish itself goes against the grain with me and that i dont like it  you know that i am truly a liberal i believe i have as little pride as most men and i am conscious of not the smallest annoyance from being hail fellow well met with everybody i have not had greater pleasure in the company of any set of men among the thousands i have received i hold a regular levée every day you know which is duly heralded and proclaimed in the newspapers than in that of the carmen of hertford who presented themselves in a body in their blue frocks among a crowd of welldressed ladies and gentlemen and bade me welcome through their spokesman they had all read my books and all perfectly understood them it is not these things i have in my mind when i say that the man who comes to this country a radical and goes home again with his opinions unchanged must be a radical on reason sympathy and reflection and one who has so well considered the subject that he has no chance of wavering  we have been to boston worcester hertford new haven new york philadelphia baltimore washington fredericksburgh richmond and back to washington again the premature heat of the weather it was eighty yesterday in the shade and clays advicehow you would like clayhave made us determine not to go to charleston but having got to richmond i think i should have turned back under any circumstances we remain at baltimore for two days of which this is one then we go to harrisburgh then by the canal boat and the railroad over the alleghany mountains to pittsburgh then down the ohio to cincinnati then to louisville and then to st louis i have been invited to a public entertainment in every town i have entered and have refused them but i have excepted st louis as the farthest point of my travels my friends there have passed some resolutions which forster has and will show you from st louis we cross to chicago traversing immense prairies thence by the lakes and detroit to buffalo and so to niagara a run into canada follows of course and thenlet me write the blessed word in capitalswe turn towards home  kate has written to mrs macready and it is useless for me to thank you my dearest friend or her for your care of our dear children which is our constant theme of discourse forster has gladdened our hearts with his account of the triumph of acis and galatea and i am anxiously looking for news of the tragedy forrest breakfasted with us at richmond last saturdayhe was acting there and i invited himand he spoke very gratefully and very like a man of your kindness to him when he was in london  david colden is as good a fellow as ever lived and i am deeply in love with his wife indeed we have received the greatest and most earnest and zealous kindness from the whole family and quite love them all do you remember one greenhow whom you invited to pass some days with you at the hotel on the kaatskill mountains he is translator to the state office at washington has a very pretty wife and a little girl of five years old we dined with them and had a very pleasant day the president invited me to dinner but i couldnt stay for it i had a private audience however and we attended the public drawingroom besides  now dont you rush at the quick conclusion that i have rushed at a quick conclusion pray be upon your guard if you can by any process estimate the extent of my affectionate regard for you and the rush i shall make when i reach london to take you by your true right hand i dont object but let me entreat you to be very careful how you come down upon the sharpsighted individual who pens these words which you seem to me to have done in what willmott would call one of mr macreadys rushes as my pen is getting past its work i have taken a new one to say that                                 i am ever my dear macready                                                  your faithful friend   sidenote mr thomas mitton                           baltimore united states march 22nd 1842  my dear friend  we have been as far south as richmond in virginia where they grow and manufacture tobacco and where the labour is all performed by slaves but the season in those latitudes is so intensely and prematurely hot that it was considered a matter of doubtful expediency to go on to charleston for this unexpected reason and because the country between richmond and charleston is but a desolate swamp the whole way and because slavery is anything but a cheerful thing to live amidst i have altered my route by the advice of mr clay the great political leader in this country and have returned here previous to diving into the far west we start for that part of the countrywhich includes mountain travelling and lake travelling and prairie travellingthe day after tomorrow at eight oclock in the morning and shall be in the west and from there going northward again until the 30th of april or 1st of may when we shall halt for a week at niagara before going further into canada we have taken our passage home god bless the word in the george washington packetship from new york she sails on the 7th of june  i have departed from my resolution not to accept any more public entertainments they have been proposed in every town i have visitedin favour of the people of st louis my utmost western point that town is on the borders of the indian territory a trifling distance from this placeonly two thousand miles at my second haltingplace i shall be able to write to fix the day i suppose it will be somewhere about the 12th of april think of my going so far towards the setting sun to dinner  in every town where we stay though it be only for a day we hold a regular levée or drawingroom where i shake hands on an average with five or six hundred people who pass on from me to kate and are shaken again by her maclises picture of our darlings stands upon a table or sideboard the while and my travelling secretary assisted very often by a committee belonging to the place presents the people in due form think of two hours of this every day and the people coming in by hundreds all fresh and piping hot and full of questions when we are literally exhausted and can hardly stand i really do believe that if i had not a lady with me i should have been obliged to leave the country and go back to england but for her they never would leave me alone by day or night and as it is a slave comes to me now and then in the middle of the night with a letter and waits at the bedroom door for an answer  it was so hot at richmond that we could scarcely breathe and the peach and other fruit trees were in full blossom it was so cold at washington next day that we were shivering but even in the same town you might often wear nothing but a shirt and trousers in the morning and two greatcoats at night the thermometer very frequently taking a little trip of thirty degrees between sunrise and sunset  they do lay it on at the hotels in such style they charge by the day so that whether one dines out or dines at home makes no manner of difference tother day i wrote to order our rooms at philadelphia to be ready on a certain day and was detained a week longer than i expected in new york the philadelphia landlord not only charged me half rent for the rooms during the whole of that time but board for myself and kate and anne during the whole time too though we were actually boarding at the same expense during the same time in new york what do you say to that if i remonstrated the whole virtue of the newspapers would be aroused directly  we were at the presidents drawingroom while we were in washington i had a private audience besides and was asked to dinner but couldnt stay  partiespartiespartiesof course every day and night but its not all parties i go into the prisons the policeoffices the watchhouses the hospitals the workhouses i was out half the night in new york

and a hard life it is but i am careful to drink hardly anything and not to smoke at all i have recourse to my medicinechest whenever i feel at all bilious and am thank god thoroughly well  when i next write to you i shall have begun i hope to turn my face homeward i have a great store of oddity and whimsicality and am going now into the oddest and most characteristic part of this most queer country  always direct to the care of david colden esq 28 laight street hudson square new york i received your caledonia letter with the greatest joy  kate sends her best remembrances

affection to reconcile itself                         to death in any          shape and most of all perhaps at first in this          his parents can even now believe that it will be a consolation                  to them throughout their lives              and when they shall have grown old and gray                 always to think of him as a child in heaven          and jesus called a little

appear to be when it reaches you i shall carry it on with me to montreal and despatch it from there by the steamer which goes to halifax to meet the cunard boat at that place with canadian letters and passengers before i finally close it i will add a short postscript so that it will contain the latest intelligence  we have had a blessed interval of quiet in this beautiful place of which as you may suppose we stood greatly in need not only by reason of our hard travelling for a long time but on account of the incessant persecutions of the people by land and water on stage coach railway car and steamer which exceeds anything you can picture to yourself by the utmost stretch of your imagination so far we have had this hotel nearly to ourselves it is a large square house standing on a bold height with overhanging eaves like a swiss cottage and a wide handsome gallery outside every story these colonnades make it look so very light that it has exactly the appearance of a house built with a pack of cards and i live in bodily terror lest any man should venture to step out of a little observatory on the roof and crush the whole structure with one stamp of his foot  our sittingroom which is large and low like a nursery is on the second floor and is so close to the falls that the windows are always wet and dim with spray two bedrooms open out of itone our own one annes the secretary slumbers near at hand but without these sacred precincts from the three chambers or any part of them you can see the falls rolling and tumbling and roaring and leaping all day long with bright rainbows making fiery arches down a hundred feet below us when the sun is on them they shine and glow like molten gold when the day is gloomy the water falls like snow or sometimes it seems to crumble away like the face of a great chalk cliff or sometimes again to roll along the front of the rock like white smoke but it all seems gay or gloomy dark or light by sun or moon from the bottom of both falls there is always rising up a solemn ghostly cloud which hides the boiling cauldron from human sight and makes it in its mystery a hundred times more grand than if you could see all the secrets that lie hidden in its tremendous depth one fall is as close to us as york gate is to no 1 devonshire terrace the other the great horseshoe fall may be perhaps about half as far off as creedys3 one circumstance in connection with them is in all the accounts greatly exaggeratedi mean the noise last night was perfectly still kate and i could just hear them at the quiet time of sunset a mile off whereas believing the statements i had heard i began putting my ear to the ground like a savage or a bandit in a ballet thirty miles off when we were coming here from buffalo  i was delighted to receive your famous letter and to read your account of our darlings whom we long to see with an intensity it is impossible to shadow forth ever so faintly i do believe though i say it as shouldnt that they are good unsboth to look at and to go i roared out this morning as soon as i was awake next month which we have been longing to be able to say ever since we have been here i really do not know how we shall ever knock at the door when that slowest of all impossibly slow hackneycoaches shall pull upat home  i am glad you exult in the fight i have had about the copyright if you knew how they tried to stop me you would have a still greater interest in it the greatest men in england have sent me out through forster a very manly and becoming and spirited memorial and address backing me in all i have done i have despatched it to boston for publication and am coolly prepared for the storm it will raise but my best rod is in pickle  is it not a horrible thing that scoundrel booksellers should grow rich here from publishing books the authors of which do not reap one farthing from their issue by scores of thousands and that every vile blackguard and detestable newspaper so filthy and bestial that no honest man would admit one into his house for a scullery doormat should be able to publish those same writings side by side cheek by jowl with the coarsest and most obscene companions with which they must become connected in course of time in peoples minds is it tolerable that besides being robbed and rifled an author should be forced to appear in any form in any vulgar dress in any atrocious company that he should have no choice of his audience no control over his own distorted text and that he should be compelled to jostle out of the course the best men in this country who only ask to live by writing i vow before high heaven that my blood so boils at these enormities that when i speak about them i seem to grow twenty feet high and to swell out in proportion robbers that ye are i think to myself when i get upon my legs here goes  the places we have lodged in the roads we have gone over the company we have been among the tobaccospittle we have wallowed in the strange customs we have complied with the packingcases in which we have travelled the woods swamps rivers prairies lakes and mountains we have crossed are all subjects for legends and tales at home quires reams wouldnt hold them i dont think anne has so much as seen an american tree she never looks at a prospect by any chance or displays the smallest emotion at any sight whatever she objects to niagara

set you right on one point in reference to the american robbers which perhaps you do not quite understand  the existing law allows them to reprint any english book without any communication whatever with the author or anybody else my books have all been reprinted on these agreeable terms  but sometimes when expectation is awakened there about a book before its publication one firm of pirates will pay a trifle to procure early proofs of it and get so much the start of the rest as they can obtain by the time necessarily consumed in printing it directly it is printed it is common property and may be reprinted a thousand times my circular only referred to such bargains as these  i should add that i have no hope of the states doing justice in this dishonest respect and therefore do not expect to overtake these fellows but we may cry stop thief nevertheless especially as they wince and smart under it                                                faithfully yours always   sidenote mr h p smith

impossible for me to cash it i have therefore ordered it to be framed and glazed  i am really grateful to you for the interest you take in my proceedings next time i come into the city i will show you my introductory chapter to the american book it may seem to prepare the reader for a much greater amount of slaughter than he will meet with but it is honest and true therefore my hand does not shake

my notes which has given me true pleasure and gratification  as i never scrupled to say in america so i can have no delicacy in saying to you that allowing for the change you worked in many social features of american society and for the time that has passed since you wrote of the country i am convinced that there is no writer who has so well and accurately i need not add so entertainingly described it in many of its aspects as you have done and this renders your praise the more valuable to me i do not recollect ever to have heard or seen the charge of exaggeration made against a feeble performance though in its feebleness it may have been most untrue it seems to me essentially natural and quite inevitable that common observers should accuse an uncommon one of this fault and i have no doubt that you were long ago of this opinion very much to your own comfort  mrs dickens begs me to thank you for your kind remembrance of her and to convey to you her best regards always believe me

it would have done you good if you could have seen and heard him you cant think how moved he was by the old man in the church or how pleased i was to have chosen it before he saw the drawings  you are such a queer fellow and hold yourself so much aloof that i am afraid to say half i would say touching my grateful admiration so you shall imagine the rest i enclose a note from kate to which i hope

 1843  narrative   we have unfortunately very few letters of interest in this year but we are able to give the commencement of charles dickenss correspondence with his beloved friends mr douglas jerrold and mr clarkson stanfield with lord morpeth afterwards lord carlisle for whom he always entertained the highest regard and with mr charles babbage  he was at work upon martin chuzzlewit until the end of the year when he also wrote and published the first of his christmas storiesthe christmas carol  he was much distressed by the sad fate of mr elton a respected actor who was lost in the wreck of the pegasus and was very eager and earnest in his endeavours to raise a fund on behalf of mr eltons children  we are sorry to be unable to give any explanation as to the nature of the cockspur street society mentioned in this first letter to mr charles babbage but we publish it notwithstanding considering it to be one of general interest  the little history of england was never finishednot that is to say the one alluded to in the letter to mr jerrold  mr david dickson kindly furnishes us with an explanation of the letter dated 10th may it was he says in answer to a letter from me pointing out that the shepherd in pickwick was apparently reflecting on the scriptural doctrine of the new birth  the beginning of the letter to mr jerrold 15th june is as will be readily understood an imaginary cast of a purely imaginary play a portion of this letter has already been published in mr blanchard jerrolds life of his father it originated in a proposal of mr webstersthe manager of the haymarket theatreto give five hundred pounds for a prize comedy by an english author  the opera referred to in the letter to mr r h horne was called the village coquettes and the farce was the strange gentleman already alluded to by us in connection with a letter to mr harley   sidenote mr charles babbage                                 devonshire terrace april 27th 1843  my dear sir  i write to you confidentially in answer to your note of last night and the tenor of mine will tell you why  you may suppose from seeing my name in the printed letter you have received that i am favourable to the proposed society i am decidedly opposed to it i went there on the day i was in the chair after much solicitation and being put into it opened the proceedings by telling the meeting that i approved of the design in theory but in practice considered it hopeless i may tell youi did not tell themthat the nature of the meeting and the character and position of many of the men attending it cried failure trumpettongued in my ears to quote an expression from tennyson i may say that if it were the best society in the world the grossness of some natures in it would have weight to drag it down  in the wisdom of all you urge in the notes you have sent me taking them as statements of theory i entirely concur but in practice i feel sure that the present publishing system cannot be overset until authors are different men the first step to be taken is to move as a body in the question of copyright enforce the existing laws and try to obtain better for that purpose i hold that the authors and publishers must unite as the wealth business habits and interest of that latter class are of great importance to such an end the longmans and murray have been with me proposing such an association that i shall support but having seen the cockspur street society i am as well convinced of its invincible hopelessness as if i saw it written by a celestial penman in the book of fate                                        my dear sir                                               always faithfully yours   sidenote mr douglas jerrold                                    devonshire terrace may 3rd 1843  my dear jerrold  let me thank you most cordially for your books not only for their own sakes and i have read them with perfect delight but also for this hearty and most welcome mark of your recollection of the friendship we have established in which light i know i may regard and prize them  i am greatly pleased with your opening paper in the illuminated it is very wise and capital written with the finest end of that iron pen of yours witty much needed and full of truth i vow to god that i think the parrots of society are more intolerable and mischievous than its birds of prey if ever i destroy myself it will be in the bitterness of hearing those infernal and damnably good old times extolled once in a fit of madness after having been to a public dinner which took place just as this ministry came in i wrote the parody i send you enclosed for fonblanque there is nothing in it but wrath but thats wholesome so i send it you  i am writing a little history of england for my boy which i will send you when it is printed for him though your boys are too old to profit by it it is curious that i have tried to impress upon him writing i daresay at the same moment with you the exact spirit of your paper for i dont know what i should do if he were to get hold of any conservative or high church notions and the best way of guarding against any such horrible result is i take it to wring the parrots necks in his very cradle  oh heaven if you could have been with me at a hospital dinner last monday there were men there who made such speeches and expressed such sentiments as any moderately intelligent dustman would have blushed through his cindery bloom to have thought of sleek slobbering bowpaunched overfed apoplectic snorting cattle and the auditory leaping up in their delight i never saw such an illustration of the power of purse or felt so degraded and debased by its contemplation since i have had eyes and ears the absurdity of the thing was too horrible to laugh at it was perfectly overwhelming but if i could have partaken it with anybody who would have felt it as you would have done it would have had quite another aspect or would at least like a classic mask oh d that word have had one funny side to relieve its dismal features  supposing fifty families were to emigrate into the wilds of north americayours mine and fortyeight otherspicked for their concurrence of opinion on all important subjects and for their resolution to found a colony of commonsense how soon would that devil cant present itself among them in one shape or other the day they landed do you say or the day after  that is a great mistake almost the only one i know in the arabian nights when the princess restores people to their original beauty by sprinkling them with the golden water it is quite clear that she must have made monsters of them by such a christening as that                                    my dear jerrold

reply to your letter that you do not understand the intention i daresay the fault is mine of that passage in the pickwick papers which has given you offence the design of the shepherd and of this and every other allusion to him is to show how sacred things are degraded vulgarised and rendered absurd when persons who are utterly incompetent to teach the commonest things take upon themselves to expound such mysteries and how in making mere cant phrases of divine words these persons miss the spirit in which they had their origin i have seen a great deal of this sort of thing in many parts of england and i never knew it lead to charity or good deeds  whether the great creator of the world and the creature of his hands moulded in his own image be quite so opposite in character as you believe is a question which it would profit us little to discuss i like the frankness and candour of your letter and thank you for it that every man who seeks heaven must be born again in good thoughts of his maker i sincerely believe that it is expedient for every hound to say so in a certain snuffling form of words to which he attaches no good meaning i do not believe i take it there is no difference between us                                                       faithfully yours   sidenote mr douglas jerrold                                  devonshire terrace june 13th 1843  my

narrative   in the summer of this year the house in devonshire terrace was let and charles dickens started with his family for italy going first to a villa at albaro near genoa for a few months and afterwards to the palazzo pescheire genoa towards the end of this year he made excursions to the many places of interest in this country and was joined at milan by his wife and sisterinlaw previous to his own departure alone on a business visit to england he had written his christmas story the chimes and was anxious to take it himself to england and to read it to some of his most intimate friends there  mr macready went to america and returned in the autumn and towards the end of the year he paid a professional visit to paris  charles dickenss letter to his wife 26th february treats of a visit to liverpool where he went to take the chair on the opening of the mechanics institution and to make a speech on education the fanny alluded to was his sister mrs burnett the britannia the ship in which he and mrs dickens made their outward trip to america the mrs bean the stewardess and hewett the captain of that same vessel  the letter to mr charles knight was in acknowledgment of the receipt of a prospectus entitled book clubs for all readers the attempt which fortunately proved completely successful was to establish a cheap book club the scheme was that a number of families should combine together each contributing about three halfpennies a week which contribution would enable them by exchanging the volumes among them to have sufficient reading to last the year the publications which were to be made as cheap as possible could be purchased by families at the end of the year on consideration of their putting by an extra penny a week for that purpose charles dickens who always had the comfort and happiness of the workingclasses greatly at heart was much interested in this scheme of mr charles knights and highly approved of it charles dickens and this new correspondent became subsequently true and fast friends  martin chuzzlewit was dramatised in the early autumn of this year at the lyceum theatre which was then under the management of mr and mrs robert keeley charles dickens superintended some rehearsals but had left england before the play was acted in public  the man roche alluded to in his letter to mr maclise was the french courier engaged to go with the family to italy he remained as servant there and was with charles dickens through all his foreign travels his many excellent qualities endeared him to the whole family and his master never lost sight of this faithful servant until poor roches untimely death in 1849  the rev edward tagart was a celebrated unitarian minister and a very highly esteemed and valued friend  the chickenstalker letter to mrs dickens november 8th is an instance of the eccentric names he was constantly giving to his children and these names he frequently made use of in his books  in this year we have our first letter to mr afterwards sir edwin landseer for whom charles dickens had the highest admiration and personal regard   sidenote mr w c macready                                devonshire terrace january 3rd 1844  my very dear macready  you know all the news and you know i love you so i no more know why i write than i do why i come round after the play to shake hands with you in your dressingroom i say come as if you were at this present moment the lessee of drury lane and had  with a long face on one hand  elaborately explaining that everything in creation is a jointstock company on the other the inimitable b by the fire in conversation with  welladay i see it all and smell that extraordinary compound of odd scents peculiar to a theatre which bursts upon me when i swing open the little door in the hall accompanies me as i meet perspiring supers in the narrow passage goes with me up the two steps crosses the stage winds round the third entrance ps as i wind and escorts me safely into your presence where i find you unwinding something slowly round and round your chest which is so long that no man can see the end of it  oh that you had been at clarence terrace on ninas birthday good god how we missed you talked of you drank your health and wondered what you were doing perhaps you are falkland enough i swear i suspect you of it to feel rather sorejust a little bit you know the merest trifle in the worldon hearing that mrs macready looked brilliant blooming young and handsome and that she danced a country dance with the writer hereof acres to your falkland in a thorough spirit of becoming good humour and enjoyment now you dont like to be told that nor do you quite like to hear that forster and i conjured bravely that a plumpudding was produced from an empty saucepan held over a blazing fire kindled in stanfields hat without damage to the lining that a box of bran was changed into a live guineapig which ran between my godchilds feet and was the cause of such a shrill uproar and clapping of hands that you might have heard it and i daresay did in america that three halfcrowns being taken from major burns and put into a tumblerglass before his eyes did then and there give jingling answers to the questions asked of them by me and knew where you were and what you were doing to the unspeakable admiration of the whole assembly neither do you quite like to be told that we are going to do it again next saturday with the addition of demoniacal dresses from the masquerade shop nor that mrs macready for her gallant bearing always and her best sort of best affection is the best creature i know never mind no man shall gag me and those are my opinions  my dear macready the lecturing proposition is not to be thought of i have not the slightest doubt or hesitation in giving you my most strenuous and decided advice against it looking only to its effect at home i am immovable in my conviction that the impression it would produce would be one of failure and a reduction of yourself to the level of those who do the like here to us who know the boston names and honour them and who know boston and like it boston is what i would have the whole united states to be the boston requisition would be a valuable document of which you and your friends might be proud but those names are perfectly unknown to the public here and would produce not the least effect the only thing known to the public here is that they ask when i say they i mean the people everybody to lecture it is one of the things i have ridiculed in chuzzlewit lecture you and you fall into the roll of lardners vandenhoffs eltons knowleses buckinghams you are off your pedestal have flung away your glass slipper and changed your triumphal coach into a seedy old pumpkin i am quite sure of it and cannot express my strong conviction in language of sufficient force  puffridden why to be sure they are the nation is a miserable sindbad and its boasted press the loathsome foul old man upon his back and yet they will tell you and proclaim to the four winds for repetition here that they dont need their ignorant and brutal papers as if the papers could exist if they didnt need them let any two of these vagabonds in any town you go to take it into their heads to make you an object of attack or to direct the general attention elsewhere and what avail those wonderful images of passion which you have been all your life perfecting  i have sent you to the charge of our trusty and wellbeloved colden a little book i published on the 17th of december and which has been a most prodigious successthe greatest i think i have ever achieved it pleases me to think that it will bring you home for an hour or two and i long to hear you have read it on some quiet morning do they allow you to be quiet bytheway some of our most fashionable people sir denounced me awfully for liking to be alone sometimes  now that we have turned christmas i feel as if your face were directed homewards macready the downhill part of the road is before us now and we shall travel on to midsummer at a dashing pace and please heaven i will be at liverpool when you come steaming up the mersey with that red funnel smoking out unutterable things and your heart much fuller than your trunks though something lighter if i be not the first englishman to shake hands with you on english ground the man who gets before me will be a brisk and active fellow and even then need put his best leg foremost so i warn forster to keep in the rear or hell be blown  if you shall have any leisure to project and put on paper the outline of a scheme for opening any theatre on your return upon a certain list subscribed and on certain understandings with the actors it strikes me that it would be wise to break ground while you are still away of course i need not say that i will see anybody or do anythingeven to the calling together of the actorsif you should ever deem it desirable my opinion is that our respected and valued friend mr  will stagger through another season if he dont rot first i understand he is in a partial state of decomposition at this minute he was very ill but got better how is it that  always do get better and strong hearts are so easy to die  kate sends her tender love so does georgy so does charlie so does mamey so does katey so does walter so does the other one who is to be born next week look homeward always as we look abroad to you god bless you my dear macready                                          ever your affectionate friend   sidenote mr laman blanchard

carol but i must thank you because you have filled my heart up to the brim and it is running over  you meant to give me great pleasure my dear fellow and you have done it the tone of your elegant and fervent praise has touched me in the tenderest place i cannot write about it and as to talking of it i could no more do that than a dumb man i have derived inexpressible gratification from what i know was a labour of love on your part and i can never forget it  when i think it likely that i may meet you perhaps at ainsworths on friday i shall slip a carol into my pocket and ask you to put it among your books for my sake you will never like it the less for having made it the means of so much happiness to me                             always my dear blanchard

sail again before may in the saloon we had some champagne and biscuits and hewett had set out upon the table a block of boston ice weighing fifty pounds scott of the caledonia lunched with usa very nice fellow he saw macready play macbeth in boston and gave me a tremendous account of the effect poor burroughs of the george washington died on board on his last passage home his little wife was with him  hewett dines with us today and i have procured him admission tonight i am very sorry indeed and so was he that you didnt see the old ship it was the strangest thing in the world to go on

in the evening he this deponent took the chair at a large assembly of the mechanics institution at liverpool and that having been received with tremendous and enthusiastic plaudits he this deponent did immediately dash into a vigorous brilliant humorous pathetic eloquent fervid and impassioned speech that the said speech was enlivened by thirteen hundred persons with frequent vehement uproarious and deafening cheers and to the best of this deponents knowledge and belief he this deponent did speak up like a man and did to the best of his knowledge and belief considerably distinguish himself that after the proceedings of the opening were over and a vote of thanks was proposed to this deponent he this deponent did again distinguish himself and that the cheering at that time accompanied with clapping of hands and stamping of feet was in this deponents case thundering and awful and this deponent further saith that his whiteandblack or magpie waistcoat did create a strong sensation and that during the hours of promenading this deponent heard from persons surrounding him such exclamations as what is it is it a waistcoat no its a shirtand the likeall of which this deponent believes to have been complimentary and gratifying but this deponent further saith that he is now going to supper and wishes he may have an appetite to eat it

whom she is devoted they ease her mind by informing her that these sounds are only organs by they i mean the gossips and attendants by organs i mean instrumental boxes with barrels in them which are commonly played by foreigners under the windows of people of sedentary pursuits on a speculation of being bribed to leave the street mrs harris being of a confiding nature believed in this pious fraud and was fully satisfied that his owls was organs                                                       faithfully yours   sidenote mr robert keeley                 9 osnaburgh terrace monday evening

held in reference to the principle of adapting novels for the stage give you a prologue to chuzzlewit but believe me to be quite sincere in saying that if i felt i could reasonably do such a thing for anyone i would do it for you  i start for italy on monday next but if you have the piece on the stage and rehearse on friday i will gladly come down at any time you may appoint on that morning and go through it with you all if you be not in a sufficiently forward state to render this proposal convenient to you or likely to assist your preparations do not take the trouble to answer this note  i presume mrs keeley will do ruth pinch if so i feel secure about her and of mrs gamp i am certain but a queer sensation begins in my legs and comes upward to my forehead when i think of tom                                                faithfully yours always   sidenote mr daniel maclise                 villa di bagnarello albaro monday july 22nd 1844  my very dear mac  i address you with something of the lofty spirit of an exilea banished commonera sort of anglopole i dont exactly know what i have done for my country in coming away from it but i feel it is somethingsomething greatsomething virtuous and heroic lofty emotions rise within me when i see the sun set on the blue mediterranean i am the limpet on the rock my fathers name is turner and my boots are green  apropos of blue in a certain picture called the serenade you painted a sky if you ever have occasion to paint the mediterranean let it be exactly of that colour it lies before me now as deeply and intensely blue but no such colour is above me nothing like it in the south of franceat avignon at aix at marseillesi saw deep blue skies not so deep thoughoh lord no and also in america but the sky above me is familiar to my sight is it heresy to say that i have seen its twinbrother shining through the window of jack strawsthat down in devonshire i have seen a better sky i daresay it is but like a great many other heresies it is true  but such greengreengreenas flutters in the vineyard down below the windows that i never saw nor yet such lilac and such purple as float between me and the distant hills nor yetin anythingpicture book or verbal boredomsuch awful solemn impenetrable blue as is that same sea it has such an absorbing silent deep profound effect that i cant help thinking it suggested the idea of styx it looks as if a draught of itonly so much as you could scoop up on the beach in the hollow of your handwould wash out everything else and make a great blue blank of your intellect  when the sun sets clearly then by heaven it is majestic from any one of eleven windows here or from a terrace overgrown with grapes you may behold the broad sea villas houses mountains forts strewn with rose leavesstrewn with thornsstifled in thorns dyed through and through and through for a moment no more the sun is impatient and fierce like everything else in these parts and goes down headlong run to fetch your hatand its night wink at the right time of black nightand its morning everything is in extremes there is an insect here i forget its name and fletcher and roche are both out that chirps all day there is one outside the window now the chirp is very loud something like a brobdingnagian grasshopper the creature is born to chirpto progress in chirpingto chirp louder louder loudertill it gives one tremendous chirp and bursts itself that is its life and death everything is in a concatenation accordingly the day gets brighter brighter brighter till its night the summer gets hotter hotter hotter till it bursts the fruit gets riper riper riper till it tumbles down and rots  ask me a question or two about frescowill you be so good all the houses are painted in fresco hereaboutthe outside walls i mean the fronts and backs and sidesand all the colour has run into damp and green seediness and the very design has struggled away into the component atoms of the plaster sometimes but not often i can make out a virgin with a mildewed glory round her head holding nothing in an indiscernible lap with invisible arms and occasionally the leg or arms of a cherub but it is very melancholy and dim there are two old frescopainted vases outside my own gateone on either handwhich are so faint that i never saw them till last night and only then because i was looking over the wall after a lizard who had come upon me while i was smoking a cigar above and crawled over one of these embellishments to his retreat there is a church herethe church of the annunciationwhich they are now by they i mean certain noble families restoring at a vast expense as a work of piety it is a large church with a great many little chapels in it and a very high dome every inch of this edifice is painted and every design is set in a great gold frame or border elaborately wrought you can imagine nothing so splendid it is worth coming the whole distance to see but every sort of splendour is in perpetual enactment through the means of these churches gorgeous processions in the streets illuminations of windows on festa nights lighting up of lamps and clustering of flowers before the shrines of saints all manner of show and display the doors of the churches stand wide open and in this hot weather great red curtains flutter and wave in their palaces and if you go and sit in one of these to get out of the sun you see the queerest figures kneeling against pillars and the strangest people passing in and out and vast streams of women in veils they dont wear bonnets with great fans in their hands coming and going that you are never tired of looking on except in the churches you would suppose the city at this time of year to be deserted the people keep so close within doors indeed it is next to impossible to go out into the heat i have only been into genoa twice myself we are deliciously cool here by comparison being high and having the sea breeze there is always some shade in the vineyard too and underneath the rocks on the seashore so if i choose to saunter i can do it easily even in the hot time of the day i am as lazy however asas you are and do little but eat and drink and read  as i am going to transmit regular accounts of all sightseeings and journeyings to forster who will show them to you i will not bore you with descriptions however i hardly think you allow enough for the great brightness and brilliancy of colour which is commonly achieved on the continent in that same fresco painting i saw someby a french artist and his pupilin progress at the cathedral at avignon which was as bright and airy as anything can benothing dull or dead about it and i have observed quite fierce and glaring colours elsewhere  we have a piano now there was none in the house and have fallen into a pretty settled easy track we breakfast about halfpast nine or ten dine about four and go to bed about eleven we are much courted by the visiting people of course and i very much resort to my old habit of bolting from callers and leaving their reception to kate green figs i have already learnt to like green almonds we have them at dessert every day are the most delicious fruit in the world and green lemons combined with some rare hollands that is to be got here make prodigious punch i assure you you ought to come over mac but i dont expect you though i am sure it would be a very good move for you i have not the smallest doubt of that fletcher has made a sketch of the house and will copy it in penandink for transmission to you in my next letter i shall look out for a place in genoa between this and the winter time in the meantime the people who come out here breathe delightedly as if they had got into another climate landing in the city you would hardly suppose it possible that there could be such an air within two miles  write to me as often as you can like a dear good fellow and rely upon the punctuality of my correspondence losing you and forster is like losing my arms and legs and dull and lame i am without you but at broadstairs next year please god when it is all over i shall be very glad to have laid up such a store of recollections and improvement  i dont know what to do with timber he is as illadapted to the climate at this time of year as a suit of fur i have had him made a lion dog but the fleas flock in such crowds into the hair he has left that they drive him nearly frantic and renders it absolutely necessary that he should be kept by himself of all the miserable hideous little frights you ever saw you never beheld such a devil apropos as we were crossing the seine within two stages of paris roche suddenly said to me sitting by me on the box the littel dog ave got a great lip i was thinking of things remote and very different and couldnt comprehend why any peculiarity in this feature on the part of the dog should excite a man so much as i was musing upon it my ears were attracted by shouts of helo hola hi hi hi le voilà regardez and the like and looking down among the oxenwe were in the centre of a numerous drovei saw him timber lying in the road curled upyou know his waylike a lobster only not so stiff yelping dismally in the pain of his lip from the roof of the carriage and between the aching of his bones his horror of the oxen and his dread of me who he evidently took to be the immediate agent in and cause of the damage singing out to an extent which i believe to be perfectly unprecedented while every frenchman and french boy within sight roared for company he wasnt hurt  kate and georgina send their best loves and the children add theirs katey in particular desires to be commended to mr teese she has a sore throat from sitting in constant draughts i suppose but with that exception we are all quite well ever believe me my dear mac                                               your affectionate friend   sidenote rev edward tagart                         albaro near genoa friday august 9th 1844  my dear sir  i find that if i wait to write you a long letter which has been the cause of my procrastination in fulfilling my part of our agreement i am likely to wait some time longer and as i am very anxious to hear from you not the less so because if i hear of you through my brother who usually sees you once a week in my absence i take pen in hand and stop a messenger who is going to genoa for my main object being to qualify myself for the receipt of a letter from you i dont see why a tenline qualification is not as good as one of a hundred lines  you told me it was possible that you and mrs tagart might wander into these latitudes in the autumn i wish you would carry out that infant intention to the utmost it would afford us the truest delight and pleasure to receive you if you come in october you will find us in the palazzo peschiere in genoa which is surrounded by a delicious garden and is a most charming habitation in all respects if you come in september you will find us less splendidly lodged but on the margin of the sea and in the midst of vineyards the climate is delightful even now the heat being not at all oppressive except in the actual city which is what the americans would call considerable fiery in the middle of the day but the seabreezes out here are refreshing and cool every day and the bathing in the early morning is something more agreeable than you can easily imagine the orange trees of the peschiere shall give you their most fragrant salutations if you come to us at that time and we have a dozen spare beds in that house that i know of to say nothing of some vast chambers here and there with ancient iron chests in them where mrs tagart might enact ginevra to perfection and never be found out to prevent which i will engage to watch her closely if she will only come and see us  the flies are incredibly numerous just now the unsightly blot a little higher up was occasioned by a very fine one who fell into the inkstand and came out unexpectedly on the nib of my pen we are all quite well thank heaven and had a very interesting journey here of which as well as of this place i will not write a word lest i should take the edge off those agreeable conversations with which we will beguile our walks  pray tell me about the presentation of the plate and whether  was very slow or trotted at all and if so when he is an excellent creature and i respect him very much so i dont mind smiling when i think of him as he appeared when addressing you and pointing to the plate with his head a little on one side and one of his eyes turned up languidly  also let me know exactly how you are travelling and when and all about it that i may meet you with open arms on the threshold of the city if happily you bend your steps this way you had better address me poste restante genoa as the albaro postman gets drunk and when he has lost letters and is sober sheds tearswhich is affecting but hardly satisfactory  kate and her sister send their best regards to yourself and mrs and miss tagart and all your family i heartily join them in all kind remembrances and good wishes as the messenger has just looked in at the door and shedding on me a balmy gale of onions has protested against being detained any longer i will only say which is not at all necessary that i am ever                                                       faithfully yours  psthere is a little to see here in the church way i assure you   sidenote mr clarkson stanfield                            albaro saturday night august 24th 1844  my

your sports my humble friends         farewell          all hurrah hurrah exit admiral          voice behind suppose the dance mr         stanfield are you all ready go then  my dear stanfield i wish you would come this way and see me in that palazzo peschiere was ever man so welcome as i would make you what a truly gentlemanly action it would be to bring mrs stanfield and the baby and how kate and her sister would wave pockethandkerchiefs from the wharf in joyful welcome ah what a glorious proceeding  do you know this place of course you do i wont bore you with anything about it for i know forster reads my letters to you but what a place it is the views from the hills here and the immense variety of prospects of the sea are as striking i think as such scenery can be above all the approach to genoa by sea from marseilles constitutes a picture which you ought to paint for nobody else can ever do it william you made that bridge at avignon better than it is beautiful as it undoubtedly is you made it fifty times better and if i were morrison or one of that school bless the dear fellows one and all i wouldnt stand it but would insist on having another picture gratis to atone for the imposition  the night is like a seaside night in england towards the end of september they say it is the prelude to clear weather but the wind is roaring now and the sea is raving and the rain is driving down as if they had all set in for a real hearty picnic and each had brought its own relations to the general festivity i dont know whether you are acquainted with the coastguard and men in these parts they are extremely civil fellows of a very amiable manner and appearance but the most innocent men in matters you would suppose them to be well acquainted with in virtue of their office that i ever encountered one of them asked me only yesterday if it would take a year to get to england in a ship which i thought for a coastguardman was rather a tidy question it would take a long time to catch a ship going there if he were on board a pursuing cutter though i think he would scarcely do it in twelve months indeed  so you were at astleys tother night now mr stickney sir what can i come for to go for to do for to bring for to fetch for to carry for you sir he he he oh i say sir well sir miss woolford knows me sir she laughed at me i see him run away after this not on his feet but on his knees and the calves of his legs alternately and that smell of sawdusty horses which was never in any other place in the world salutes my nose with painful distinctness what do you think of my suddenly finding myself a swimmer but i have really made the discovery and skim about a little blue bay just below the town here like a fish in high spirits i hope to preserve my bathingdress for your inspection and approval or possibly to enrich your collection of italian costumes on my return do you recollect yarnold in masaniello i fear that i unintentionally dress at him before plunging into the sea i enhanced the likeness very much last friday morning by singing a barcarole on the rocks i was a trifle too fleshcoloured the stage knowing no medium between bright salmon and dirty yellow but apart from that defect not badly made up by any means when you write to me my dear stanny as i hope you will soon address poste restante genoa i remain out here until the end of september and send in for my letters daily there is a postman for this place but he gets drunk and loses the letters after which he calls to say so and to fall upon his knees about three weeks ago i caught him at a wineshop near here playing bowls in the garden it was then about five oclock in the afternoon and he had been airing a newspaper addressed to me since nine oclock in the morning  kate and georgina unite with me in most cordial remembrances to mrs and miss stanfield and to all the children they particularise all sorts of messages but i tell them that they had better write themselves if they want to send any though i dont know that this writing would end in the safe deliverance of the commodities after all for when i began this letter i meant to give utterance to all kinds of heartiness my dear stanfield and i come to the end of it without having said anything more than that i amwhich is new to youunder every circumstance and everywhere                                          your most affectionate friend   sidenote mr w c macready                         palazzo peschiere genoa october 14th 1844  my very dear macready  my whole heart is with you at home i have not yet felt so far off as i do now when i think of you there and cannot fold you in my arms this is only a shake of the hand i couldnt say much to you if i were home to greet you nor can i write much when i think of you safe and sound and happy after all your wanderings  my dear fellow god bless you twenty thousand times happiness and joy be with you i hope to see you soon if i should be so unfortunate as to miss you in london i will fall upon you with a swoop of love in paris kate says all kind things in the language and means more than are in the dictionary capacity of all the descendants of all the stonemasons that worked at babel again and again and again my own true friend god bless you                                              ever yours affectionately   sidenote mr douglas jerrold                          cremona saturday night october 16th 1844  my dear jerrold  as half a loaf is better than no bread so i hope that half a sheet of paper may be better than none at all coming from one who is anxious to live in your memory and friendship i should have redeemed the pledge i gave you in this regard long since but occupation at one time and absence from pen and ink at another have prevented me  forster has told you or will tell you that i very much wish you to hear my little christmas book and i hope you will meet me at his bidding in lincolns inn fields i have tried to strike a blow upon that part of the brass countenance of wicked cant when such a compliment is sorely needed at this time and i trust that the result of my training is at least the exhibition of a strong desire to make it a staggerer if you should think at the end of the four rounds there are no more that the said cant in the language of bells life comes up piping i shall be very much the better for it  i am now on my way to milan and from thence after a day or twos rest i mean to come to england by the grandest alpine pass that the snow may leave open you know this place as famous of yore for fiddles i dont see any here now but there is a whole street of coppersmiths not far from this inn and they throb so dably and fitfully that i thought i had a palpitation of the heart after dinner just now and seldom was more relieved than when i found the noise to be none of mine  i was rather shocked yesterday i am not strong in geographical details to find that romeo was only banished twentyfive miles that is the distance between mantua and verona the latter is a quaint old place with great houses in it that are now solitary and shut upexactly the place it ought to be the former has a great many apothecaries in it at this moment who could play that part to the life for of all the stagnant ponds i ever beheld it is the greenest and weediest i went to see the old palace of the capulets which is still distinguished by their cognizance a hat carved in stone on the courtyard wall it is a miserable inn the court was full of crazy coaches carts geese and pigs and was ankledeep in mud and dung the garden is walled off and built out there was nothing to connect it with its old inhabitants and a very unsentimental lady at the kitchen door the montagues used to live some two or three miles off in the country it does not appear quite clear whether they ever inhabited verona itself but there is a village bearing their name to this day and traditions of the quarrels between the two families are still as nearly alive as anything can be in such a drowsy neighbourhood  it was very hearty and good of you jerrold to make that affectionate mention of the carol in punch and i assure you it was not lost on the distant object of your manly regard but touched him as you wished and meant it should i wish we had not lost so much time in improving our personal knowledge of each other but i have so steadily read you and so selfishly gratified myself in always expressing the admiration with which your gallant truths inspired me that i must not call it time lost either  you rather entertained a notion once of coming to see me at genoa i shall return straight on the 9th of december limiting my stay in town to one week now couldnt you come back with me the journey that way is very cheap costing little more than twelve pounds and i am sure the gratification to you would be high i am lodged in quite a wonderful place and would put you in a painted room as big as a church and much more comfortable there are pens and ink upon the premises orange trees gardens battledores and shuttlecocks rousing woodfires for evenings and a welcome worth having  come letter from a gentleman in italy to bradbury and evans in london letter from a gentleman in a country gone to sleep to a gentleman in a country that would go to sleep too and never wake again if some people had their way you can work in genoa the house is used to it it is exactly a weeks post have that portmanteau looked to and when we meet say i am coming  i have never in my life been so struck by any place as by venice it is the wonder of the world dreamy beautiful inconsistent impossible wicked shadowy dable old place i entered it by night and the sensation of that night and the bright morning that followed is a part of me for the rest of my existence and oh god the cells below the water underneath the bridge of sighs the nook where the monk came at midnight to confess the political offender the bench where he was strangled the deadly little vault in which they tied him in a sack and the stealthy crouching little door through which they hurried him into a boat and bore him away to sink him where no fisherman dare cast his netall shown by torches that blink and wink as if they were ashamed to look upon the gloomy theatre of sad horrors past and gone as they are these things stir a mans blood like a great wrong or passion of the instant and with these in their minds and with a museum there having a chamber full of such frightful instruments of torture as the devil in a brain fever could scarcely invent there are hundreds of parrots who will declaim to you in speech and print by the hour together on the degeneracy of the times in which a railroad is building across the water at venice instead of going down on their knees the drivellers and thanking heaven that they live in a time when iron makes roads instead of prison bars and engines for driving screws into the skulls of innocent men before god i could almost turn bloodyminded and shoot the parrots of our island with as little compunction as robinson crusoe shot the parrots in his  i have not been in bed these ten days after five in the morning and have been travelling many hours every day if this be the cause of my inflicting a very stupid and sleepy letter on you my dear jerrold i hope it will be a kind of signal at the same time of my wish to hail you lovingly even from this sleepy and unpromising state and believe me as i am                                         always your friend and admirer   sidenote mr thomas mitton                            peschiere genoa tuesday nov 5th 1844  my dear mitton  the cause of my not having written to you is too obvious to need any explanation i have worn myself to death in the month i have been at work none of my usual reliefs have been at hand i have not been able to divest myself of the storyhave suffered very much in my sleep in consequenceand am so shaken by such work in this trying climate that i am as nervous as a man who is dying of drink and as haggard as a murderer  i believe i have written a tremendous book and knocked the carol out of the field it will make a great uproar i have no doubt  i leave here tomorrow for venice and many other places and i shall certainly come to london to see my proofs coming by new ground all the way cutting through the snow in the valleys of switzerland and plunging through the mountains in the dead of winter i would accept your hearty offer with right goodwill but my visit being one of business and consultation i see impediments in the way and insurmountable reasons for not doing so therefore i shall go to an hotel in covent garden where they know me very well and with the landlord of which i have already communicated my orders are not upon a mighty scale extending no further than a good bedroom and a cold showerbath  bradbury and evans are going at it dingdong and are wild with excitement all news on that subject and on every other i must defer till i see you that will be immediately after i arrive of course most likely on monday 2nd december  kate and her sister who send their best regards and all the children are as well as possible the house is perfect the servants are as quiet and wellbehaved as at home which very rarely happens here and roche is my right hand there never was such a fellow  we have now got carpets downburn fires at nightdraw the curtains and are quite wintry we have a box at the opera which is close by for nothing and sit there when we please as in our own drawingroom there have been three fine days in four weeks on every other the water has been falling down in one continual sheet and it has been thundering and lightening every day and night  my hand shakes in that feverish and horrible manner that i can hardly hold a pen and i have so bad a cold that i cant see                                    in haste to save the

was the brave cs remark last night at midnight and he had reason we left genoa as you know soon after five on the evening of my departure and in company with the lady whom you saw and the dog whom i dont think you did see travelled all night at the rate of four miles an hour over bad roads without the least refreshment until daybreak when the brave and myself escaped into a miserable caffé while they were changing horses and got a cup of that drink hot that same day a few hours afterwards between ten and eleven we came to i hope the ddest inn in the world where in a vast chamber rendered still more desolate by the presence of a most offensive specimen of what disraeli calls the mosaic arab who had a beautiful girl with him i regaled upon a breakfast almost as cold and damp and cheerless as myself then in another coach much smaller than a small fly i was packed up with an old padre a young jesuit a provincial avvocato a private gentleman with a very red nose and a very wet brown umbrella and the brave c and i went on again at the same pace through the mud and rain until four in the afternoon when there was a place in the coupé two indeed which i took holding that select compartment in company with a very ugly but very agreeable tuscan gent who said gia instead of si and rung some other changes in this changing language but with whom i got on very well being extremely conversational we were bound as you know perhaps for piacenza but it was discovered that we couldnt get to piacenza and about ten oclock at night we halted at a place called stradella where the inn was a series of queer galleries open to the night with a great courtyard full of waggons and horses and velociferi and what not in the centre it was bitter cold and very wet and we all walked into a bare room mine with two immensely broad beds on two deal diningtables a third great empty table the usual washingstand tripod with a slopbasin on it and two chairs and then we walked up and down for threequarters of an hour or so while dinner or supper or whatever it was was getting ready this was set forth by way of variety in the old priests bedroom which had two more immensely broad beds on two more deal diningtables in it the first dish was a cabbage boiled in a great quantity of rice and hot water the whole flavoured with cheese i was so cold that i thought it comfortable and so hungry that a bit of cabbage when i found such a thing floating my way charmed me after that we had a dish of very little pieces of pork fried with pigs kidneys after that a fowl after that something very red and stringy which i think was veal and after that two tiny little newbornbabylooking turkeys very red and very swollen fruit of course to wind up and garlic in one shape or another in every course i made three jokes at supper to the immense delight of the company and retired early the brave brought in a bush or two and made a fire and after that a glass of screeching hot brandy and water that bottle of his being full of brandy i drank it at my leisure undressed before the fire and went into one of the beds the brave reappeared about an hour afterwards and went into the other previously tying a pockethandkerchief round and round his head in a strange fashion and giving utterance to the sentiment with which this letter begins at five this morning we resumed our journey still through mud and rain and at about eleven arrived at piacenza where we fellowpassengers took leave of one another in the most affectionate manner as there was no coach on till six at night and as it was a very grim despondent sort of place and as i had had enough of diligences for one while i posted forward here in the strangest carriages ever beheld which we changed when we changed horses we arrived here before six the hotel is quite french i have dined very well in my own room on the second floor and it has two beds in it screened off from the room by drapery i only use one tonight and that is already made  i purpose posting on to bologna if i can arrange it at twelve tomorrow seeing the sights here first  it is dull work this travelling alone my only comfort is in motion i look forward with a sort of shudder to sunday when i shall have a day to myself in bologna and i think i must deliver my letters in venice in sheer desperation never did anybody want a companion after dinner so much as i do  there has been music on the landing outside my door tonight two violins and a violoncello one of the violins played a solo and the others struck in as an orchestra does now and then very well then he came in with a small tin platter bella musica said i bellissima musica signore mi piace moltissimo sono felice signoro said he i gave him a franc o moltissimo generoso tanto generoso signore  it was a joke to laugh at when i was learning but i swear unless i could stagger on zoppawise with the people i verily believe i should have turned back this morning  in all other respects i think the entire change has done me undoubted service already i am free of the book and am redfaced and feel marvellously disposed to sleep  so for all the straggling qualities of this straggling letter want of sleep must be responsible give my best love to georgy and my paternal blessing to          mamey         katey         charley         wally         and         chickenstalker  psget

dearest kate  for the first time since i left you i am sitting in a room of my own hiring with a fire and a bed in it and i am happy to say that i have the best and fullest intentions of sleeping in the bed having arrived here at halfpast four this afternoon without any cessation of travelling night or day since i parted from mr bairrs cheap firewood  the alps appeared in sight very soon after we left milanby eight or nine oclock in the morning and the brave c was so far wrong in his calculations that we began the ascent of the simplon that same night while you were travelling as i would i were towards the peschiere most favourable state of circumstances for journeying up that tremendous pass the brightest moon i ever saw all night and daybreak on the summit the glory of which making great wastes of snow a rosy red exceeds all telling we sledged through the snow on the summit for two hours or so the weather was perfectly fair and bright and there was neither difficulty nor dangerexcept the danger that there always must be in such a place of a horse stumbling on the brink of an immeasurable precipice in which case no piece of the unfortunate traveller would be left large enough to tell his story in dumb show you may imagine something of the rugged grandeur of such a scene as this great passage of these great mountains and indeed glencoe well sprinkled with snow would be very like the ascent but the top itself so wild and bleak and lonely is a thing by itself and not to be likened to any other sight the cold was piercing the north wind high and boisterous and when it came driving in our faces bringing a sharp shower of little points of snow and piercing it into our very blood it really was what it is often said to be cuttingwith a very sharp edge too there are houses of refuge herebleak solitary placesfor travellers overtaken by the snow to hurry to as an escape from death and one great house called the hospital kept by monks where wayfarers get supper and bed for nothing we saw some coming out and pursuing their journey if all monks devoted themselves to such uses i should have little fault to find with them  the cold in switzerland since has been something quite indescribable my eyes are tingling tonight as one may suppose cymbals to tingle when they have been lustily played it is positive pain to me to write the great organ which i was to have had pleasure in hearing dont play on a sunday at which the brave is inconsolable but the town is picturesque and quaint and worth seeing and this inn with a german bedstead in it about the size and shape of a babys linenbasket is perfectly clean and comfortable butter is so cheap hereabouts that they bring you a great mass like the squab of a sofa for tea and of honey which is most delicious they set before you a proportionate allowance we start tomorrow morning at six for strasburg and from that town or the next haltingplace on the rhine i will report progress if it be only in halfadozen words  i am anxious to hear that you reached genoa quite comfortably and shall look forward with impatience to that letter which you are to indite with so much care and pains next monday my best love to georgy and to charley and mamey and katey and wally and chickenstalker i have treated myself to a new travellingcap tonight my old one being too thin and it is rather a prodigious affair i flatter myself  swiss towns and mountains and the lake of geneva and the famous suspension bridge at this place and a great many other objects with a very low thermometer conspicuous among them are dancing up

all the wednesday and all the thursday in paris one night to see you act my old delight when you little thought of such a being in existence and one night to read to you and mrs macready if that scamp of lincolns inn fields has not anticipated me my little christmas book in which i have endeavoured to plant an indignant righthander on the eye of certain wicked cant that makes my blood boil which i hope will not only cloud that eye with black and blue but many a gentle one with crystal of the finest sort god forgive me but i think there are good things in the little story  i took it for granted you were as your american friends say in full blast here and meant to have sent a card into your dressingroom with mr g s hancock muggridge united states upon it but paris looks coldly on me without your eye in its head and not being able to shake your hand i shake my own head dolefully which is but poor satisfaction  my love to mrs macready i will swear to the death that it is truly hers for her

dearest kate  with an intolerable pen and no ink i am going to write a few lines to you to report progress  i got to strasburg on monday night intending to go down the rhine but the weather being foggy and the season quite over they could not insure me getting on for certain beyond mayence or our not being detained by unpropitious weather therefore i resolved the malle poste being full to take the diligence hither next day in the afternoon i arrived here at halfpast five tonight after fifty hours of it in a french coach i was so beastly dirty when i got to this house that i had quite lost all sense of my identity and if anybody had said are you charles dickens i should have unblushingly answered no i never heard of him a good wash and a good dress and a good dinner have revived me however and i can report of this house concerning which the brave was so anxious when we were here before that it is the best i ever was in my little apartment consisting of three rooms and other conveniences is a perfect curiosity of completeness you never saw such a charming little babyhouse it is infinitely smaller than those first rooms we had at meurices but for elegance compactness comfort and quietude exceeds anything i ever met with at an inn  the moment i arrived here i enquired of course after macready they said the english theatre had not begun yet that they thought he was at meurices where they knew some members of the company to be i instantly despatched the porter with a note to say that if he were there i would come round and hug him as soon as i was clean they referred the porter to the hôtel brighton he came back and told me that the answer there was m macreadys rooms were engaged but he had not arrived he was expected tonight if we meet tonight i will add a postscript wouldnt it be odd if we met upon the road between this and boulogne tomorrow  i mean as a recompense for my late sufferings to get a hackneycarriage if i can and post that journey starting from here at eight tomorrow morning getting to boulogne sufficiently early next morning to cross at once and dining with forster that same dayto wit saturday i have notions of taking you with me on my next journey if you would like to go and arranging for georgy to come to us by steamerunder the protection of the english captain for instanceto naples there i would top and cap all our walks by taking her up to the crater of vesuvius with me but this is dependent on her ability to be perfectly happy for a fortnight or so in our stately palace with the children and such foreign aid as the simpsons for i love her too dearly to think of any project which would involve her being uncomfortable for that space of time  you can think this over and talk it over and i will join you in doing so please god when i return to our italian bowers which i shall be heartily glad to do  they tell us that the landlord of this house going to london some week or so ago was detained at boulogne two days by a high sea in which the packet could not put out so i hope there is the greater chance of no such bedevilment happening to me  paris is better than ever oh dear how grand it was when i came through it in that caravan tonight i hope we shall be very hearty here and able to say with wally hant it plassant  love to charley mamey katey wally and chickenstalker the lastnamed i take it for granted is

letter of this morning do not regard this as my answer to it it is merely to say that i have been at bradbury and evanss all day and have barely time to write more than that i will write tomorrow i arrived about seven on saturday evening and rushed into the arms of mac and forster both of them send their best love to you and georgy with a heartiness not to be described  the little book is now as far as i am concerned all ready one cut of doyles and one of leechs i found so unlike my ideas that i had them both to breakfast with me this morning and with that winning manner which you know of got them with the highest good humour to do both afresh they are now hard at it stanfields readiness delight wonder at my being pleased with what he has done is delicious macs frontispiece is charming the book is quite splendid the expenses will be very great i have no doubt  anybody who has heard it has been moved in the most extraordinary manner forster read it for dramatic purposes to abeckett he cried so much and so painfully that forster didnt know whether to go on or stop and he called next day to say that any expression of his feeling was beyond his power but that he believed it and felt it to bei wont say what  as the reading comes off tomorrow night i had better not despatch my letters to you until wednesdays post i must close to save this heartily tired i am and i dine at gore

play of blackeyed susan     1845  narrative   at the beginning of this year charles dickens was still living at the palazzo peschiere genoa with his family in february he went with his wife to rome for the carnival leaving his sisterinlaw and children at genoa miss hogarth joining them later on at naples they all returned to rome for the holy week and then went to florence and so back to genoa he continued his residence at genoa until june of this year when he returned to england by switzerland and belgium the party being met at brussels by mr forster mr maclise and mr douglas jerrold and arriving at home at the end of june the autumn months until the 1st october were again spent at broadstairs and in this september was the first amateur play at miss kellys theatre in dean street under the management of charles dickens with messrs jerrold mark lemon john leech gilbert abeckett leigh frank stone forster and others as his fellowactors the play selected was ben jonsons every man in his humour in which charles dickens acted captain bobadil the first performance was a private one merely as an entertainment for the actors and their friends but its success speedily led to a repetition of the same performance and afterwards to many other performances for public and charitable objects every man in his humour was shortly after repeated at the same little theatre for a useful charity which needed help and later in the year beaumont and fletchers play of the elder brother was given by the same company at the same place for the benefit of miss kelly there was a farce played after the comedy on each occasionnot always the same onein which charles dickens and mark lemon were the principal actors  the letters which we have for this year refer with very few exceptions to these theatricals and therefore need no explanation  he was at work at the end of this year on another christmas book the cricket on the hearth and was also much occupied with the project of the daily news paper of which he undertook the editorship at its starting which took place in the beginning of the following year 1846   sidenote miss hogarth                                    rome tuesday february

letter for i am as badly off in this place as in americabeset by visitors at all times and seasons and forced to dine out every day i have found however an excellent man for mean englishman who has lived here many years and is well acquainted with the people whom he doctored in the bad time of the cholera when the priests and everybody else fled in terror  under his auspices i have got to understand the low life of naples among the fishermen and idlers almost as well as i understand the do do of my own country always excepting the language which is very peculiar and extremely difficult and would require a years constant practice at least it is no more like italian than english is to welsh and as they dont say half of what they mean but make a wink or a kick stand for a whole sentence its a marvel to me how they comprehend each other at rome they speak beautiful italian i am pretty strong at that i believe but they are worse here than in genoa which i had previously thought impossible  it is a fine place but nothing like so beautiful as people make it out to be the famous bay is to my thinking as a piece of scenery immeasurably inferior to the bay of genoa which is the most lovely thing i have ever seen the city in like manner will bear no comparison with genoa but there is none in italy that will except venice as to houses there is no palace like the peschiere for architecture situation gardens or rooms it is a great triumph to me too to find how cheap it is at rome the english people live in dirty little fourth fifth and sixth floors with not one room as large as your own drawingroom and pay commonly seven or eight pounds a week  i was a week in rome on my way here and saw the carnival which is perfectly delirious and a great scene for a description all the ancient part of rome is wonderful and impressive in the extreme far beyond the possibility of exaggeration as to the modern part it might be anywhere or anythingparis nice boulogne calais or one of a thousand other places  the weather is so atrocious rain snow wind darkness hail and cold that i cant get over into sicily but i dont care very much about it as i have planned out ten days of excursion into the neighbouring country one thing of coursethe ascent of vesuvius herculaneum and pompeii the two cities which were covered by its melted ashes and dug out in the first instance accidentally are more full of interest and wonder than it is possible to imagine i have heard of some ancient tombs quite unknown to travellers dug in the bowels of the earth and extending for some miles underground they are near a place called viterbo on the way from rome to florence i shall lay in a small stock of torches etc and explore them when i leave rome i return there on the 1st of march and shall stay there nearly a month  saturday february 22ndsince i left off as above i have been away on an excursion of three days yesterday evening at four oclock we began a small party of six the ascent of mount vesuvius with six saddlehorses an armed soldier for a guard and twentytwo guides the latter rendered necessary by the severity of the weather which is greater than has been known for twenty years and has covered the precipitous part of the mountain with deep snow the surface of which is glazed with one smooth sheet of ice from the top of the cone to the bottom by starting at that hour i intended to get the sunset about halfway up and night at the top where the fire is raging it was an inexpressibly lovely night without a cloud and when the day was quite gone the moon within a few hours of the full came proudly up showing the sea and the bay of naples and the whole country in such majesty as no words can express we rode to the beginning of the snow and then dismounted catherine and georgina were put into two litters just chairs with poles like those in use in england on the 5th of november and a fat englishman who was of the party was hoisted into a third borne by eight men i was accommodated with a tough stick and we began to plough our way up the ascent was as steep as this line very nearly perpendicular we were all tumbling at every stop and looking up and seeing the people in advance tumbling over ones very head and looking down and seeing hundreds of feet of smooth ice below was i must confess anything but agreeable however i knew there was little chance of another clear night before i leave this and gave the word to get up somehow or other so on we went winding a little now and then or we should not have got on at all by prodigious exertions we passed the region of snow and came into that of firedesolate and awful you may well suppose it was like working ones way through a dry waterfall with every mass of stone burnt and charred into enormous cinders and smoke and sulphur bursting out of every chink and crevice so that it was difficult to breathe high before us bursting out of a hill at the top of the mountain shaped like this hw a the fire was pouring out reddening the night with flames blackening it with smoke and spotting it with redhot stones and cinders that fell down again in showers at every step everybody fell now into a hot chink now into a bed of ashes now over a mass of cindered iron and the confusion in the darkness for the smoke obscured the moon in this part and the quarrelling and shouting and roaring of the guides and the waiting every now and then for somebody who was not to be found and was supposed to have stumbled into some pit or other made such a scene of it as i can give you no idea of my ladies were now on foot of course but we dragged them on as well as we could they were thorough game and didnt make the least complaint until we got to the foot of that topmost hill i have drawn so beautifully here we all stopped but the head guide an english gentleman of the name of le groswho has been here many years and has been up the mountain a hundred timesand your humble servant resolved like jackasses to climb that hill to the brink and look down into the crater itself you may form some notion of what is going on inside it when i tell you that it is a hundred feet higher than it was six weeks ago the sensation of struggling up it choked with the fire and smoke and feeling at every step as if the crust of ground between ones feet and the gulf of fire would crumble in and swallow one up which is the real danger i shall remember for some little time i think but we did it we looked down into the flaming bowels of the mountain and came back again alight in halfadozen places and burnt from head to foot you never saw such devils and i never saw anything so awful and terrible  roche had been tearing his hair like a madman and crying that we should all three be killed which made the rest of the company very comfortable as you may suppose but we had some wine in a basket and all swallowed a little of that and a great deal of sulphur before we began to descend the usual way after the fiery part is pastyou will understand that to be all the flat top of the mountain in the centre of which again rises the little hill i have drawnis to slide down the ashes which slipping from under you make a gradually increasing ledge under your feet and prevent your going too fast but when we came to this steep place last night we found nothing there but one smooth solid sheet of ice the only way to get down was for the guides to make a chain holding by each others hands and beat a narrow track in it into the snow below with their sticks my two unfortunate ladies were taken out of their litters again with halfadozen men hanging on to each to prevent their falling forward and we began to descend this way it was like a tremendous dream it was impossible to stand and the only way to prevent oneself from going sheer down the precipice every time one fell was to drive ones stick into one of the holes the guides had made and hold on by that nobody could pick one up or stop one or render one the least assistance now conceive my horror when this mr le gros i have mentioned being on one side of georgina and i on the other suddenly staggers away from the narrow path on to the smooth ice gives us a jerk lets go and plunges headforemost down the smooth ice into the black night five hundred feet below almost at the same instant a man far behind carrying a light basket on his head with some of our spare cloaks in it misses his footing and rolls down in another place and after him rolling over and over like a black bundle goes a boy shrieking as nobody but an italian can shriek until the breath is tumbled out of him  the englishman is in bed today terribly bruised but without any broken bones he was insensible at first and a mere heap of rags but we got him before the fire in a little hermitage there is halfway down and he so far recovered as to be able to take some supper which was waiting for us there the boy was brought in with his head tied up in a bloody cloth about half an hour after the rest of us were assembled and the man who had had the basket was not found when we left the mountain at midnight what became of the cloaks mine was among them i know as little my ladies clothes were so torn off their backs that they would not have been decent if there could have been any thought of such things at such a time and when we got down to the guides house we found a french surgeon one of another party who had been up before us lying on a bed in a stable with god knows what horrible breakage about him but suffering acutely and looking like death a pretty unusual trip for a pleasure expedition i think  i am rather stiff today but am quite unhurt except a slight scrape on my right hand my clothes are burnt to pieces my ladies are the wonder of naples and everybody is openmouthed  address me as usual all letters are forwarded the children well and happy best regards                                                        ever

the 20th as that day of the week is usually their business dinner day and i was not quite sure that it could be conveniently altered  jerrold now assures me that it can for such a purpose and that it shall and therefore consider the play as being arranged to come off on saturday the 20th of next month  i dont know whether i told you that we have changed the farce and now we are to act two oclock in the morning as performed by the inimitable b at montreal  in reference to bruce castle school i think the question set at rest most probably by the fact of there being no vacancy it is always full until christmas when howitts two boys and jerrolds one go in and fill it up again but after going carefully through the school a question would arise in my mind whether the systema perfectly admirable one the only recognition of education as a broad system of moral and intellectual philosophy that i have ever seen in practicedo not require so much preparation and progress in the mind of the boy as that he shall have come there younger and less advanced than willy or at all events without that very different sort of school experience which he must have acquired at brighton i have no warrant for this doubt beyond a vague uneasiness suggesting a suspicion of its great probability on such slight ground i would not hint it to anyone but you who i know will give it its due weight and no more and no less  i have the paper setting forth the nature of the higher classical studies and the books they read it is the usual course and includes the great books in greek and latin they have a miscellaneous library under the management of the boys themselves of some five or six thousand volumes and every means of study and recreation and every inducement to selfreliance and selfexertion that can easily be imagined as there is no room just now you can turn it over in your mind again and if you would like to see the place yourself when you return to town i shall be delighted to go

orchestra etc etc the affair is strictly private the admission will be by cards of invitation every man will have from thirty to thirtyfive nobody can ask any person without the knowledge and sanction of the rest my objection being final and the expense to each exclusive of the dress which every man finds for himself will not exceed two guineas forster plays and stone plays and i play and some of

remembrance almost immediately after my return from abroad  i need not say how much i should value another little sketch from your extraordinary hand in this years small volume to which mac again does the frontispiece but i cannot hear of it and will not have it though the gratification of such aid to me is really beyond all expression unless you will so far consent to make it a matter of business as to receive without asking any questions a cheque in return from the publishers do not misunderstand methough i am not afraid there is much danger of your doing so for between us misunderstanding is i hope not easy i know perfectly well that nothing can pay you for the devotion of any portion of your time to such a use of your art i know perfectly well that no terms would induce you to go out of your way in such a regard for perhaps anybody else i cannot nor do i desire to vanquish the friendly obligation which help from you imposes on me but i am not the sole proprietor of those little books and it would be monstrous in you if you were to dream of putting a scratch into a second one without some shadowy reference to the other partners ten thousand times more monstrous in me if any consideration on earth could induce me to permit it which nothing will or shall  so see what it comes to if you will do me a favour on my terms it will be more acceptable to me my dear stanfield than i can possibly tell you if you will not be so generous you deprive me of the satisfaction of receiving it at your hands and shut me out from that possibility altogether what a stonyhearted ruffian you

dickens gave up the editorship of and finally all connection with the daily news and went again abroad with his family the house in devonshire terrace being let for twelve months he made his summer residence at lausanne taking a villa rosemont there from may till november here he wrote the battle of life and the first number of dombey and son in november he removed to paris where he took a house in the rue de courcelles for the winter and where he lived and was at work upon dombey until march 1847 among the english residents that summer at lausanne he made many friendships in proof of which he dedicated the christmas book written there to his english friends in lausanne the especially intimate friendships which he formed were with m de cerjat who was always a resident of lausanne with his family mr haldimand whose name is identified with the place and with the hon richard and mrs watson of rockingham castle he maintained a constant correspondence with them and to mr and mrs watson he afterwards dedicated his own favourite of all his books david copperfield m de cerjat from the time of charles dickens leaving lausanne began a custom which he kept up almost without an interval to the time of his own death of writing him a long letter every christmas to which he returned answers which will be given in this and the following years  in this year we have the commencement of his association and correspondence with mr w h wills their connection began in the short term of his editorship of the daily news when he at once fully appreciated mr willss invaluable business qualities and when some time later he started his own periodical household words he thought himself very fortunate in being able to secure mr willss cooperation as editor of that journal and afterwards of all the year round with which household words was incorporated they worked together on terms of the most perfect mutual understanding confidence and affectionate regard until mr willss health made it necessary for him to retire from the work in 1868 besides his first notes to mr wills in this year we have our first letters to his dear friends the rev james white walter savage landor and miss

address stating that you answered her letter as you did because if i were the wealthiest nobleman in england i could not keep pace with onetwentieth part of the demands upon me and because you saw no internal evidence in her application to induce you to single it out for any especial notice that the tone of this letter renders you exceedingly glad you did so and that you decline from me holding any correspondence with her something to that effect after what flourish your nature will                                                faithfully yours always   sidenote rev james white

such a writer as you that i have just now read your tragedy the earl of gowrie with a delight which i should in vain endeavour to express to you considered with reference to its story or its characters or its noble poetry i honestly regard it as a work of most remarkable genius it has impressed me powerfully and enduringly i am proud to have received it from your hand and if i have to tell you what complete possession it has taken of methat is if i could tell youi do believe you would be glad to know it                                                always faithfully yours   sidenote mr w h wills                  devonshire terrace monday morning march 2nd 1846  my dear mr wills  i really dont know what to say about the new brunswicker the idea will obtrude itself on my mind that he had no business to come here on such an expedition and that it is a piece of the wild conceit for which his countrymen are so remarkable and that i can hardly afford to be steward to such adventurers on the other hand your description of him pleases me then that purse which i could never keep shut in my life makes mouths at me saying see how empty i am then i fill it and it looks very rich indeed  i think the best way is to say that if you think you can do him any permanent good with five pounds that is get him home again i will give you the money but i should be very much indisposed to give it him merely to linger on here about town for a little time and then be hard up again  as to employment i do in my soul believe that if i were lord chancellor of england i should have been aground long ago for the patronage of a messengers place  say all that is civil for me to the proprietor of the illustrated london news who really seems to be very liberal other engagements

4th 1846  my dear mr wills  i assure you i am very truly and unaffectedly sensible of your earnest friendliness and in proof of my feeling its worth i shall unhesitatingly trouble you sometimes in the fullest reliance on your meaning what you say the letter from nelson square is a very manly and touching one but i am more helpless in such a case as that than in any other having really fewer means of helping such a gentleman to employment than i have of firing off the guns in the tower such appeals come to me here in scores upon scores  the letter from little white lion street does not impress me favourably it is not written in a simple or truthful manner i am afraid and is not a good reference moreover i think it probable that the writer may have deserted some pursuit for which he is qualified for vague and laborious strivings which he has no pretensions to make however i will certainly act on your impression of him whatever it may be and if you could explain to the gentleman in nelson square that i am not evading his request but that i do not know of anything to which i can recommend him it would be a great relief to me  i trust this new printer is a tartar and i hope to god he will so proclaim and assert his tartar breeding as to excommunicate  from the chapel over which he presides  tell powell with my regards that he neednt deal with the american notices of the cricket i never read one word of their abuse and i should think it base to read their praises it is something to know that one is righted so soon and knowing that i can afford to know no more

night i enquired of the servant in attendance whether the bearer of this letter was of my vast establishment to which he replied yezzir then said i tell him not to wait  maclise was with me it was then halfpast seven we had been walking and were splashed to the eyes we debated upon the possibility of getting to russell square in reasonable timedecided that it would be in the worst taste to appear when the performance would be half overand very reluctantly decided not to come you may suppose how dirty and dismal we were when we went to the thames tunnel of all places in the world instead  when i came home here at midnight i found another letter from you i left off in this place to press it dutifully to my lips then my mind misgave me that you must have sent to the athenæum at the apparent rudeness of my reply my face as hadji baba says was turned upside down and fifty donkeys sat upon my fathers graveor would have done so but for his not being dead yet  therefore i send this humble explanationprotesting however which i do most solemnly against being invited under such untoward circumstances and claiming as your old friend and no less old admirer to be instantly invited to

mightily when i first saw him in the illuminated and i have stowed him away in the lefthand breast pocket of my travelling coat that we may hold pleasant converse together on the rhine you see what confidence i have in him  i wish you would seriously consider the expediency and feasibility of coming to lausanne in the summer or early autumn i must be at work myself during a certain part of every day almost and you could do twice as much there as here it is a wonderful place to seeand what sort of welcome you would find i will say nothing about for i have vanity enough to believe that you would be willing to feel yourself as much at home in my household as in any mans  do think it over i could send you the minutest particular of the journey it is really all railroad and steamboat and

show you mine and if i could recollect the passage in virginius i would paraphrase it and say does it seem to tremble boy is it a loving autograph does it beam with friendship and affection all of which i say as i write withoh heavensuch a splendid imitation of you and finally give you one of those grasps and shakes with which i have seen you make the young icilius stagger again  here i am running away from a bad headache as tristram shandy ran away from death and lodging for a week in the hôtel de lÉcu de genève wherein there is a large mirror shattered by a cannonball in the late revolution a revolution whatever its merits achieved by free spirits nobly generous and moderate even in the first transports of victory elevated by a splendid popular education and bent on freedom from all tyrants whether their crowns be shaven or golden the newspapers may tell you what they please i believe there is no country on earth but switzerland in which a violent change could have been effected in the christian spirit shown in this place or in the same proud independent gallant style not one halfpennyworth of property was lost stolen or strayed not one atom of party malice survived the smoke of the last gun nothing is expressed in the government addresses to the citizens but a regard for the general happiness and injunctions to forget all animosities which they are practically obeying at every turn though the late government of whose spirit i had some previous knowledge did load the guns with such material as should occasion gangrene in the wounds and though the wounded do die consequently every day in the hospital of sores that in themselves were nothing  you a mountaineer you examine i have seen you do it the point of your young sons bâton de montagne before he went up into the snow and you talk of coming to lausanne in march why lord love your heart william tell times are changed since you lived at altorf there is not a mountain pass open until june the snow is closing in on all the panorama already i was at the great st bernard two months ago and it was bitter cold and frosty then do you think i could let you hazard your life by going up any pass worth

macready to hear from yourself as i had previously heard from forster that you are so well pleased with dombey which is evidently a great success and a great hit thank god i felt that mrs brown was strong but i was not at all afraid of giving as heavy a blow as i could to a piece of hot iron that lay ready at my hand for that is my principle always and i hope to come down with some heavier sledgehammers than that  i know the lady of whom you write  left there only yesterday the story may arise only in her manner which is extraordinarily free and careless he was visiting her here when i was here last three weeks ago i knew her in italy it is not her fault if scandal ever leaves her alone for such a braver of all conventionalities never wore petticoats but i should be sorry to hear

more precious and delightful to me than the hope that i shall be remembered of an evening in the coming winter time at one or two friends i could mention near the lake of geneva it runs with a spring

more to that if you only knew it i have been writing a little christmas book besides expressly for you and if you dont like it i shall go to the font of marylebone church as soon as i conveniently can

are a thorn in the sides of european despots and a good wholesome people to live near jesuitridden kings on the brighter side of the mountains my hat shall ever be ready to be thrown up and my glove ever ready to be thrown down for switzerland if you were the man i took you for when i took you as a godfather for better and for worse you would come to paris and amaze the weak walls of the house i havent found yet with that steady snore of yours which i once heard piercing the door of your bedroom in devonshire terrace reverberating along the bellwire in the hall so getting outside into the

you may not fail to write me a line before you come to paris on your way towards england letting me know on what day we are to expect you to dinner  we arrived here quite happily and well i dont mean here but at the hôtel brighton in paris on friday evening between six and seven oclock the agonies of househunting were frightfully severe it was one paroxysm for four mortal days i am proud to express my belief that we are lodged at last in the most preposterous house in the world the like of it cannot and so far as my knowledge goes does not exist in any other part of the globe the bedrooms are like operaboxes the diningrooms staircases and passages quite inexplicable the diningroom is a sort of cavern painted ceiling and all to represent a grove with unaccountable bits of lookingglass sticking in among the branches of the trees there is a gleam of reason in the drawingroom but it is approached through a series of small chambers like the joints in a telescope which are hung with inscrutable drapery the maddest man in bedlam having the materials given him would be likely to devise such a suite supposing his case to be hopeless and quite incurable  pray tell mrs watson with my best regards that the dance of the two sisters in the little christmas book is being done as an illustration by maclise and that stanfield is doing the battleground and the outside of the nutmeg grater inn maclise is also drawing some smaller subjects for the little story and they write me that they hope it will be very pretty and they think that i shall like it i shall have been in london before i see you probably and i hope the book itself will then be on its road to lausanne to speak for itself and to speak a word for me too i have never left so many friendly and cheerful recollections in any place and to represent me in my absence its tone should be very eloquent and affectionate indeed  well if i dont turn up again next summer it shall not be my fault in the meanwhile i shall often and often look that way with my minds eye and hear the sweet clear belllike voice of  with the ear of my imagination in the event of there being any changebut it is not

bernard  i have not seen lord normanby yet i have not seen anything up to this time but houses and lodgings there seems to be immense excitement here on the subject of  however and a perfectly stupendous sensation getting up i saw the king the other day coming into paris his carriage was surrounded by guards on horseback and he sat very far back in it i thought and drove at a great pace it was strange to see the préfet of police on horseback some hundreds of yards in advance looking to the right and left as he rode like a man who suspected every twig in every tree in the long avenue  the english relations look anything but promising though i understand that the count st aulaire is to remain in london notwithstanding the newspaper alarms to the contrary if there be anything like the sensation in england about  that there is here there will be a bitter resentment indeed the democratic society of paris have announced this morning their intention of printing and circulating fifty thousand copies of an appeal in every european language it is a base business beyond question and comes at an ill time  mrs dickens and her sister desire their best regards to be sent to you and their best loves to mrs watson in which i join as nearly as i may believe me with great truth                                                   very sincerely yours  psmrs dickens is going to write to

out of your view on that disconsolate monday when you so kindly took horse and rode forth to say goodbye we went on in a very dull and drowsy manner i can assure you i could have borne a world of punch in the rumble and been none the worse for it there was an uncommonly cool inn that night and quite a monstrous establishment at auxonne the next night full of flatulent passages and banging doors the next night we passed at montbard where there is one of the very best little inns in all france the next at sens and so we got here the roads were bad but not very for french roads there was no deficiency of horses anywhere and after pontarlier the weather was really not too cold for comfort they weighed our plate at the frontier customhouse spoon by spoon and fork by fork and we lingered about there in a thick fog and a hard frost for three long hours and a half during which the officials committed all manner of absurdities and got into all sorts of disputes with my brave courier this was the only misery we encounteredexcept leaving lausanne and that was enough to last us and did last us all the way here we are living on it now i felt myself much as i should think the murderer felt on that fair morning when with his grayhaired victim those unconscious gray hairs soon to be bedabbled with blood he went so far towards heaven as the top of that mountain of st bernard without one touch of remorse a weight is on my breast the only difference between me and the murderer is that his weight was guilt and mine is regret  i havent a word of news to tell you i shouldnt write at all if i were not the vainest man in the world impelled by a belief that you will be glad to hear from me even though you hear no more than that i have nothing to say dombey is doing wonders it went up after the publication of the second number over the thirty thousand this is such a very large sale so early in the story that i begin to think it will beat all the rest keeley and his wife are making great preparations for producing the christmas story and i have made them as an old stage manager carry out one or two expensive notions of mine about scenery and so forthin particular a sudden change from the inside of the doctors house in the midst of the ball to the orchard in the snowwhich ought to tell very well but actors are so bad in general and the best are spread over so many theatres that the cast is black despair and moody madness there is no one to be got for marion but a certain miss  i am afraida pupil of miss kellys who acted in the private theatricals i got up a year ago macready took her afterwards to play virginia to his virginius but she made nothing of it great as the chance was i have promised to show her what i mean as near as i can and if you will look into the english opera house on the morning of the 17th 18th or 19th of next month between the hours of eleven and four you will find me in a very hot and dusty condition playing all the parts of the piece to the immense diversion of all the actors actresses sceneshifters carpenters musicians chorus people tailors dressmakers scenepainters and general ragamuffins of the theatre  moore the poet is very illi fear dying the last time i saw him was immediately before i left london and i thought him sadly changed and tamed but not much more so than such a man might be under the heavy hand of time i believe he suffered severe grief in the death of a son some time ago the first man i met in paris was  who took hold of me as i was getting into a coach at the door of the hotel he hadnt a button on his shirt but i dont think he ever has and you might have sown what boys call mustard and cress in the dust on his coat i have not seen lord normanby yet as we have only just got a house the queerest house in europe to lay our heads in but there seems reason to fear that the growing dissensions between england and france and the irritation of the french king may lead to the withdrawal of the minister on each side of the channel  have you cut down any more trees played any more rubbers propounded any more teasers to the players at the game of yes and no how is the old horse how is the gray mare how is crab to whom my respectful compliments have you tried the punch yet if yes did it succeed if no why not is mrs cerjat as happy and as well as i would have her and all your house ditto ditto does haldimand play whist with any science yet ha ha ha the idea of his saying i hadnt any and are those damaskcheeked virgins the miss  still sleeping on dewy rose leaves near the english church  remember me to all your house and most of all to its other head with all the regard and earnestness that a numble individual as they always call it in the house of commons who once travelled with her in a car over a smooth country may charge you with i have added two lines to the little christmas book that i hope both you and she may not dislike haldimand will tell you what they are kate and georgy send their kindest loves and kate is going to write next week believe me always my dear cerjat full of cordial and hearty recollections of this past summer and autumn and your part in my part of them

death by this confounded dramatization of the christmas book they were in a state so horrible at keeleys yesterday as perhaps forster told you when he wrote that i was obliged to engage to read the book to them this morning it struck me that mrs leigh murray miss daly and vining seemed to understand it best certainly miss daly knew best what she was about yesterday at eight tonight we have a rehearsal with scenery and band and everything but dresses i see no possibility of escaping from it before one or two oclock in the morning and i was at the theatre all day yesterday unless i had come to london i do not think there would have been much hope of the version being more than just tolerated even that doubtful all the actors bad all the business frightfully behindhand the very words of the book confused in the copying into the densest and most insufferable nonsense i must exempt however from the general slackness both the keeleys i hope they will be very good i have never seen anything of its kind better than the manner in which they played the little supper scene between clemency and britain yesterday it was quite perfect even to me  the small manager forster talfourd stanny and mac dine with me at the piazza today before the rehearsal i have already one or two uncommonly good stories of mac i reserve them for narration i have also a dreadful cold which i would not reserve if i could help it i can hardly hold up my head and fight through from hour to hour but had serious thoughts just now of walking off to bed  christmas book published todaytwentythree thousand copies already gone brownes plates for next dombey much better than usual  i have seen nobody yet of course but i sent roche up to your mother this morning to say i am in town and will come shortly there is a great thaw here today and it is raining hard i hope you have the advantage if it be one which i am not sure of of a similar change in paris of course i start again on thursday we are expecting roche and i a letter from the malle poste people to whom we have applied for places the journey here was long and coldtwentyfour hours from paris to boulogne passage not very bad and made in

post in order that you may hear what i hear of the going of the play tonight think of my being there on saturday with a really frightful cold and working harder than ever i did at the amateur plays until two in the morning there was no supper to be got either here or anywhere else after coming out and i was as hungry and thirsty as need be the scenery and dresses are very good indeed and they have spent money on it liberally the great change from the ballroom to the snowy night is most effective and both the departure and the return will tell i think strongly on an audience i have made them very quick and excited in the passionate scenes and so have infused some appearance of life into those parts of the play but i cant make a marion and miss  is awfully bad she is a mere nothing all through i put mr leigh murray into such a state by making him tear about that the perspiration ran streaming down his face they have a great let i believe every place in the house is taken roche is going  tuesday morningthe play went as well as i can make outi hoped to have had stannys report of it but he is illwith great effect there was immense enthusiasm at its close and great uproar and shouting for me forster will go on wednesday and write you his account of it i saw the keeleys on the stage at eleven oclock or so and they were in prodigious spirits and delight   sidenote mr john

months knowledge i have asked him the same question and advised him to keep his eye on both of them as time rolls on  we had a cold journey here from boulogne but the roads were not very bad the malle poste however now takes the trains at amiens we missed it by ten minutes and had to wait three hoursfrom twelve oclock until three in which interval i drank brandy and water and slept like a top it is delightful travelling for its speed that malle poste and really for its comfort too but on this occasion it was not remarkable for the lastnamed quality the director of the post at boulogne told me a lamentable story of his son at paris being ill and implored me to bring him on the brave doubted the representations altogether but i couldnt find it in my heart to say no so we brought the director bodkinwise and being a large man in a great number of greatcoats he crushed us dismally until we got to the railroad for two passengers and it never carries more it is capital for three excruciating  write to  what you have said to me you need write no more he is full of vicious fancies and wrong suspicions even of hardwick and i would rather he heard it from you than from me whom he is not likely to love much in his heart i doubt it may be but a rusty instrument for want of use the ish heart  my most important present news is that i am going to take a jorum of hot rum and egg in bed immediately and to cover myself up with all the blankets in the house love from all i have a sensation in my head as if it were on edge it is still very cold here but the snow had disappeared on my return both here and on the road except within ten miles or so of boulogne                                                    ever affectionately  footnote  6 the battle of life     1847  narrative   at the beginning of the year charles dickens was still living in parisrue de courcelles his stay was cut shorter than he intended it to have been by the illness from scarlet fever of his eldest son who was at school in london consequent upon this he and his wife went to london at the end of february taking up their abode at the victoria hotel euston square the devonshire terrace house being still occupied by its tenant sir james duke and the sick boy under the care of his grandmother mrs hogarth in albany street the children with their aunt remained in paris until a temporary house had been taken for the family in chester place regents park and roche was then sent back to take all home in chester place another son was bornsydney smith haldimandhis godfathers being mr haldimand of lausanne and mr h p smith of the eagle life assurance office he was christened at the same time as a daughter of mr macreadys and the letters to mr smith have reference to the postponement of the christening on mr smiths account in may charles dickens had lodgings in brighton for some weeks for the recovery of mrs dickenss health going there first with his wife and sisterinlaw and the eldest boynow recovered from his feverand being joined at the latter part of the time by his two little daughters to whom there are some letters among those which follow here he removed earlier than usual this summer to broadstairs which remained his headquarters until october with intervals of absence for amateur theatrical tours which mr forster calls splendid strolling in which he was usually accompanied by his wife and sisterinlaw several new recruits had been added to the theatrical company from among distinguished literary men and artists and it now included besides those previously named mr george cruikshank mr george henry lewes and mr augustus egg the supreme management and arrangement of everything being always left to charles dickens every man in his humour and farces were again played at manchester and liverpool for the benefit of mr leigh hunt and the dramatic author mr john poole  by the end of the broadstairs holiday the house in devonshire terrace was vacant and the family returned to it in october all this year charles dickens had been at work upon the monthly numbers of dombey and son in spite of these many interruptions he began at broadstairs a christmas book but he found that the engrossing interest of his novel approaching completion made it impossible for him to finish the other work in time so he decided to let this christmas pass without a story and postponed the publication of the haunted man until the following year  at the close of the year he went to leeds to take the chair at a meeting of the mechanics institute and on the 28th december he presided at the opening of the glasgow athenæum he and his wife being the guests of the historianthen mr sheriff afterwards sir archibald alison from a letter to his sisterinlaw written from edinburgh it will be seen that mrs dickens was prevented by sudden illness from being present at the demonstration at the end of that letter there is another illustration of the odd names he was in the habit of giving to his children the last of the three the hoshen peck being a corruption of ocean spectrea name which had afterwards a sad significance as the boy sydney smith became a sailor and died and was buried at sea two years after his fathers death  the letters in this year need very little explanation in the first letter to mrs watson he alludes to a sketch which she had made from the battle of life and had sent to charles dickens as a remembrance when her husband paid a short visit to paris in this winter  and there are two letters to miss marguerite power the niece of the countess of blessingtona lady for whom he had then and until her death a most affectionate friendship and respect for the sake of her own admirable qualities and in remembrance of her delightful association with gore house where he was a frequent visitor for lady blessington he had a high admiration and great regard and she was one of his earliest appreciators and alfred comte dorsay was also a muchloved friend his own marchioness alluded to in the second letter to miss power was the younger and very charming sister of his correspondent  we much regret having been unable to procure any letters addressed to mr egg his intimacy with him began first in the plays of this year but he became almost immediately one of the friends for whom he had an especial affection and mr egg was a regular visitor at his house and at his seaside places of resort for many years after this date  the letter to mr william sandys has reference to an intention which charles dickens had entertained of laying the scene of a story in cornwall mr sandys himself a cornishman having proposed to send him some books to help him as to the dialect   sidenote the hon mrs watson                        paris 48 rue de courcelles jan 25th 1847  my dear mrs watson  i cannot allow your wandering lord to return to youri suppose arms is not improperarms then without thanking you in halfadozen words for your letter and assuring you that i had great interest and pleasure in its receipt and that i say amen to all you say of our happy past and hopeful future there is a picture of lausannest bernardthe tavern by the little lake between lausanne and vevay which is kept by that drunken dog whom haldimand believes to be so soberand of many other such scenes within doors and withoutthat rises up to my mind very often and in the quiet pleasure of its aspect rather daunts me as compared with the reality of a stirring life but please god we will have some more pleasant days and go up some more mountains somewhere and laugh together at somebody and form the same delightful little circle again somehow  i quite agree with you about the illustrations to the little christmas book i was delighted with yours your good lord beforementioned will inform you that it hangs up over my chair in the drawingroom here and when you come to england after i have seen you again in lausanne i will show it you in my little study at home quietly thanking you on the bookcase then we will go and see some of turners recent pictures and decide that question to haldimands utmost confusion  you will find watson looking wonderfully well i think when he was first here on his way to england he took an extraordinary bath in which he was rubbed all over with chemical compounds and had everything done to him that could be invented for seven francs it may be the influence of this treatment that i see in his face but i think its the prospect of coming back to elysée all i can say is that when i come that way and find myself among those friends again i expect to be perfectly lovelya kind of glorious apollo radiant and shining with joy  kate and her sister send all kinds of love in this hasty packet and i am always my dear mrs watson                                                       faithfully yours   sidenote rev edward tagart              paris 48 rue de courcelles st honorÉ                                           thursday jan 28th 1847  my dear sir  before you read any more i wish you would take those tablets out of your drawer in which you have put a black mark against my name and erase it neatly i dont deserve it on my word i dont though appearances are against me i unwillingly confess  i had gone to geneva to recover from an uncommon depression of spirits consequent on too much sitting over dombey and the little christmas book when i received your letter as i was going out walking one sunshiny windy day i read it on the banks of the rhone where it runs very blue and swift between two high green hills with ranges of snowy mountains filling up the distance its cordial and unaffected tone gave me the greatest pleasuredid me a world of goodset me up for the afternoon and gave me an evenings subject of discourse for i talked to them that is kate and georgy about those bright mornings at the peschiere until bedtime and threatened to write you such a letter next day as wouldi dont exactly know what it was to do but it was to be a great letter expressive of all kinds of pleasant things and perhaps the most genial letter that ever was written  from that hour to this i have again and again and again said ill write tomorrow and here i am today full of penitencereally sorry and ashamed and with no excuse but my writinglife which makes me get up and go out when my morning work is done and look at pen and ink no more until i begin again  besides which i have been seeing pariswandering into hospitals prisons deadhouses operas theatres concertrooms burialgrounds palaces and wineshops in my unoccupied fortnight of each month every description of gaudy and ghastly sight has been passing before me in a rapid panorama before that i had to come here from switzerland over frosty mountains in dense fogs and through towns with walls and drawbridges and without population or anything else in particular but soldiers and mud i took a flight to london for four days and went and came back over one sheet of snow sea excepted and i wish that had been snow too then forster who is here now and begs me to send his kindest regards came to see paris for himself and in showing it to him away i was borne again like an enchanted rider in short i have had no rest in my play and on monday i am going to work again a fortnight hence the play will begin once more a fortnight after that the work will follow round and so the letters that i care for go unwritten  do you care for french news i hope not because i dont know any there is a melodrama called the french revolution now playing at the cirque in the first act of which there is the most tremendous representation of a people that can well be imagined there are wonderful battles and so forth in the piece but there is a power and massiveness in the mob which is positively awful at another theatre clarissa harlowe is still the rage there are some things in it rather calculated to astonish the ghost of richardson but clarissa is very admirably played and dies better than the original to my thinking but richardson is no great favourite of mine and never seems to me to take his topboots off whatever he does several pieces are in course of representation involving rare portraits of the english in one a servant called tom bob who wears a particularly english waistcoat trimmed with gold lace and concealing his ankles does very good things indeed in another a prime minister of england who has ruined himself by railway speculations hits off some of our national characteristics very happily frequently making incidental mention of vishmingster regeenstreet and other places with which you are well acquainted sir fakson is one of the characters in another playenglish to the core and i saw a lord mayor of london at one of the small theatres the other night looking uncommonly well in a stagecoachmans waistcoat the order of the garter and a very lowcrowned broadbrimmed hat not unlike a dustman  i was at geneva at the time of the revolution the moderation and mildness of the successful party were beyond all praise their appeals to the people of all partiesprinted and pasted on the wallshave no parallel that i know of in history for their real good sterling christianity and tendency to promote the happiness of mankind my sympathy is strongly with the swiss radicals they know what catholicity is they see in some of their own valleys the poverty ignorance misery and bigotry it always brings in its train wherever it is triumphant and they would root it out of their childrens way at any price i fear the end of the struggle will be that some catholic power will step in to crush the dangerously welleducated republics very dangerous to such neighbours but there is a spirit in the people or i very much mistake them that will trouble the jesuits there many years and shake their altar steps for them  this is a poor return i look down and see the end of the paper for your letter but in its cordial spirit of reciprocal friendship it is not so bad a one if you could read it as i do and it eases my mind and discharges my conscience we are coming home please god at the end of march kate and georgy send their best regards to you and their loves to mrs and miss tagart and the children our children wish to live too in your childrens remembrance you will be glad i know to hear that dombey is doing wonders and that the christmas book shot far ahead of its predecessors i hope you will like the last chapter of no 5 if you can spare me a scrap of your handwriting in token of forgiveness do if not ill come and beg your pardon on the 31st of march                                   ever believe me                                             cordially and truly

absent with a short interval in next month until october your account of the cornishmen gave me great pleasure and if i were not sunk in engagements so far that the crown of my head is invisible to my nearest friends i should have asked you to make me known to them the new dialogue i will ask you byandby to let me see i have for the present abandoned the idea of sinking a shaft in cornwall  i have sent your shakesperian extracts to collier it is a great comfort to my thinking that so little is known concerning the poet it is a fine mystery and i tremble every day lest something should come out

you very sincerely for your kind note and for the little book i read the latter on my way down here with the greatest pleasure it is a charming story gracefully told and very gracefully and worthily translated i have not been better pleased with a book for a long time  i cannot say i take very kindly to the illustrations they are a long way behind the tale to my thinking the artist understands it very well i dare say but does not express his understanding of it in the least degree to any sense of mine  ah rosherville that fated rosherville when shall we see it perhaps in one of those intervals when i am up to town from here and suddenly appear at gore house somebody will propose an excursion there next day if anybody does somebody else will be ready to go so this deponent maketh oath and saith  i am looking out upon a dark gray sea with a keen northeast wind blowing it in shore it is more like late autumn than midsummer and there is a howling in the air as if the latter were in a very hopeless state indeed the very banshee of midsummer is rattling the windows drearily while i write there are no visitors in the place but children and they my own included have all got the hoopingcough and go about the beach choking incessantly a miserable wanderer lectured in a library last night about astronomy but being in utter solitude he snuffed out the transparent planets he had brought with him in a box and fled in disgust a white mouse and a little tinkling box of music that stops at come in the melody of the buffalo gals and cant play out tonight are the only amusements left  i beg from my solitude to send my love to lady blessington and your sister and count dorsay i think of taming spiders as baron trenck did there is one in my cell with a speckled body and

come to town tomorrow week for the liverpool and manchester plays i shall have kate and georgy with me moreover i shall be continually going out and coming in at unholy hours item the timid will come at impossible seasons to go over their parts with the manager item two jews with musty sacks of dresses will be constantly coming backwards and forwards item sounds as of groans will be heard while the inimitable boz is getting his wordswhich happens all day item forster will incessantly deliver an address by bulwer item one hundred letters per diem will arrive from manchester and liverpool and five actresses in very limp bonnets with extraordinary veils attached to them will be always calling protected by five mothers  no no my actuary some congenial tavern is the fitting scene for these things if i dont get into devonshire terrace whereof i have some spark of hope eagles couldnt look the sun in the face and have such enormities going on in their nests  i am for the time that obscene

falling into parenthesis within parenthesis like lord broughamyet will i joyfully come up to london on friday to dine at your house and meet the dane whose books i honour and whoseto make the sentiment complete i want something that would sound like bones i love but i cant get anything that unites reason with beauty you who have genius and beauty in your own person will supply the gap in

but i cant fall to work without saying in so many words that i feel all words insufficient to tell you what i think of you after a night like last night the multitudes of new tokens by which i know you for a great man the swelling within me of my love for you the pride i have in you the majestic reflection i see in you of all the passions and affections that make up our mystery throw me into a strange kind of transport that has no expression but in a mute sense of an attachment which in truth and fervency is worthy of its subject  what is this to say nothing god knows and yet i cannot leave it unsaid                                              ever affectionately yours  psi never saw you more gallant and free than in the gallant and free scenes last night it was perfectly captivating to

in a very splendid house near glasgow and were perfectly comfortable the meeting was the most stupendous thing as to numbers and the most beautiful as to colours and decorations i ever saw the inimitable did wonders his grace elegance and eloquence enchanted all beholders kate didnt go having been taken ill on the railroad between here and glasgow  it has been snowing sleeting thawing and freezing sometimes by turns and sometimes all together since the night before last lord jeffreys household are in town here not at craigcrook and jogging on in a cosy oldfashioned comfortable sort of way we have some idea of going to york on sunday passing that night at alfreds and coming home on monday but of this kate will advise you when she writes which she will do tomorrow after i shall have seen the list of railway trains  she sends her best love she is a little poorly still but nothing to speak of she is frightfully anxious that her not having been to the great demonstration should be kept a secret but i say that like murder it will out and that to hope to veil such a tremendous disgrace from the general intelligence is out of the question in one of the glasgow papers she is elaborately described i rather think miss alison who is seventeen was taken for her and sat for the portrait  best love from both of us to charley mamey katey wally chickenstalker skittles and the hoshen peck last and not least to you we talked of you at the macreadys party on monday night i hope  came out lively also that  was truly amiable finally that  took everybody to their carriages and

narrative   in march of this year charles dickens went with his wife for two or three weeks to brighton accompanied by mrs macready who was in delicate health and we give a letter to mr macready from brighton early in the year dombey and son was finished and he was again busy with an amateur play with the same associates and some new adherents the proceeds being at first intended to go towards the curatorship of shakespeares house which post was to be given to mr sheridan knowles the endowment was abandoned upon the town and council of stratfordonavon taking charge of the house the large sum realised by the performances being handed over to mr sheridan knowles the play selected was the merry wives of windsor the farce love law and physic there were two performances at the haymarket in april at one of which her majesty and the prince consort were present and in july there were performances at manchester liverpool birmingham edinburgh and glasgow some ladies accompanied the strollers on this theatrical provincial tour and mrs dickens and her sister were of the party many of the following letters bear reference to these plays  in this summer his eldest sister fanny mrs burnett died and there are sorrowful allusions to her illness in several of the letters  the autumn months were again spent at broadstairs where he wrote the haunted man which was illustrated by mr frank stone mr leech and others at the end of the year and at the end of his work he took another short holiday at brighton with his wife and sisterinlaw and the letters to mr stone on the subject of his illustrations to the haunted man are written from brighton the first letters which we have to mr mark lemon come here we regret to have been unable to procure any letters addressed to mr leech with whom as with mr lemon charles dickens was very intimately associated for many years  also we have the beginning of his correspondence with mr charles kent he wrote an unusual thing for him to do to the editor of the sun newspaper begging him to thank the writer of a particularly sympathetic and earnest review of dombey and son which appeared in the sun at the close of the book mr charles kent replied in his proper person and from that time dates a close friendship and constant correspondence  with the letter to mr forster we give as a note a letter which baron taüchnitz published in his edition of mr forsters life of oliver goldsmith  mr peter cunningham as an important member of the shakespeares house committee managed the untheatrical part of this amateur provincial tour and was always pleasantly connected with the plays  the book alluded to in the last letter for this year to be dedicated to charles dickenss daughters by mr mark lemon was called the enchanted doll   sidenote

that i doubt the present or future existence of any government in england strong enough to convert the people to your incometax principles but i do not the less appreciate the ability with which you advocate them nor am i the less gratified by any mark of your remembrance                                                faithfully yours always   sidenote mr w c macready

better already and i really have very great hopes that she will come back in a condition so blooming as to necessitate the presentation of a piece of plate to the undersigned trainer  you mean to come down on sunday and on sunday week if you dont i shall immediately take the victoria and start mr  of the theatre royal haymarket as a smashing tragedian pray dont impose upon me this cruel necessity  i think lamartine so far one of the best fellows in the world and i have lively hopes of that great people establishing a noble republic our court had best be careful not to overdo it in respect of sympathy with exroyalty and exnobility those are not times for such displays as it strikes me the people in some of our great towns would be apt to express pretty plainly  however well talk of all this on these sundays and mr  shall not be raised to the pinnacle of fame                                  ever affectionately yours                                                      my dear

                         april 18th 1848  dear sir  pray let me repeat to you personally what i expressed in my former note and allow me to assure you as an illustration of my sincerity that i have never addressed a similar communication to anybody except on one occasion                                                       faithfully yours   sidenote mr john forster                       devonshire terrace saturday april 22nd 1848  my dear forster7  i finished goldsmith yesterday after dinner having read it from the first page to the last with the greatest care and attention  as a picture of the time i really think it impossible to give it too much praise it seems to me to be the very essence of all about the time that i have ever seen in biography or fiction presented in most wise and humane lights and in a thousand new and just aspects i have never liked johnson half so well nobodys contempt for boswell ought to be capable of increase but i have never seen him in my minds eye half so plainly the introduction of him is quite a masterpiece i should point to that if i didnt know the author as being done by somebody with a remarkably vivid conception of what he narrated and a most admirable and fanciful power of communicating it to another all about reynolds is charming and the first account of the literary club and of beauclerc as excellent a piece of description as ever i read in my life but to read the book is to be in the time it lives again in as fresh and lively a manner as if it were presented on an impossibly good stage by the very best actors that ever lived or by the real actors come out of their graves on purpose  and as to goldsmith himself and his life and the tracing of it out in his own writings and the manful and dignified assertion of him without any sobs whines or convulsions of any sort it is throughout a noble achievement of which apart from any private and personal affection for you i think and really believe i should feel proud as one who had no indifferent perception of these books of histo the best of my remembrancewhen little more than a child i was a little afraid in the beginning when he committed those very discouraging imprudences that you were going to champion him somewhat indiscriminately but i very soon got over that fear and found reason in every page to admire the sense calmness and moderation with which you make the love and admiration of the reader cluster about him from his youth and strengthen with his strengthand weakness too which is better still  i dont quite agree with you in two small respects first i question very much whether it would have been a good thing for every great man to have had his boswell inasmuch as i think that two boswells or three at most would have made great men extraordinarily false and would have set them on always playing a part and would have made distinguished people about them for ever restless and distrustful i can imagine a succession of boswells bringing about a tremendous state of falsehood in society and playing the very devil with confidence and friendship secondly i cannot help objecting to that practice begun i think or greatly enlarged by hunt of italicising lines and words and whole passages in extracts without some very special reason indeed it does appear to be a kind of assertion of the editor over the readeralmost over the author himselfwhich grates upon me the author might almost as well do it himself to my thinking as a disagreeable thing and it is such a strong contrast to the modest quiet tranquil beauty of the deserted village for instance that i would almost as soon hear the town crier speak the lines the practice always reminds me of a man seeing a beautiful view and not thinking how beautiful it is half so much as what he shall say about it  in that picture at the close of the third book a most beautiful one of goldsmith sitting looking out of window at the temple trees you speak of the grayeyed rooks are you sure they are grayeyed the ravens eye is a deep lustrous black and so i suspect is the rooks except when the light shines full into it  i have reserved for a closing wordthough i dont mean to be eloquent about it being far too much in earnestthe admirable manner in which the case of the literary man is stated throughout this book it is splendid i dont believe that any book was ever written or anything ever done or said half so conducive to the dignity and honour of literature as the life and adventures of oliver goldsmith by j f of the inner temple the gratitude of every man who is content to rest his station and claims quietly on literature and to make no feint of living by anything else is your due for evermore i have often said here and there when you have been at work upon the book that i was sure it would be and i shall insist on that debt being due to you though there will be no need for insisting about it as long as i have any tediousness and obstinacy to bestow on anybody lastly i never will hear the biography compared with boswells except under vigorous protest for i do say that it is mere folly to put into opposite scales a book however amusing and curious written by an unconscious coxcomb like that and one which surveys and grandly understands the characters of all the illustrious company that move in it  my dear forster i cannot sufficiently say how proud i am of what you have done or how sensible i am of being so tenderly connected with it when i look over this note i feel as if i had said no part of what i think and yet if i were to write another i should say no more for i cant get it out i desire no better for my fame when my personal dustiness shall be past the control of my love of order than such a biographer and such a critic and again i say most solemnly that literature in england has never had and probably never will have such a champion as you are in right of this book                                                    ever

now i have lived in hope that kate and i might be able to run down to see you and yours for a day before our design for enforcing the government to make knowles the first custodian of the shakespeare house should come off but i am so perpetually engaged in drilling the forces that i see no hope of making a pleasant expedition to the isle of wight until about the twentieth then i shall hope to do so for one day but of this i will advise you further in due course  my doubts about the house you speak of are twofold first i could not leave town so soon as may having affairs to arrange for a sick sister and secondly i fear bonchurch is not sufficiently bracing for my chickens who thrive best in breezy and cool places this has set me thinking sometimes of the yorkshire coast sometimes of dover i would not have the house at bonchurch reserved for me therefore but if it should be empty we will go and look at it in a body i reserve the more serious part of my letter until the last my dear white because it comes from the bottom of my heart none of your friends have thought and spoken oftener of you and mrs white than we have these many weeks past i should have written to you but was timid of intruding on your sorrow what you say and the manner in which you tell me i am connected with it in your recollection of your dear child now among the angels of god gives me courage to approach your griefto say what sympathy we have felt with it and how we have not been unimaginative of these deep sources of consolation to which you have had recourse the traveller who journeyed in fancy from this world to the next was struck to the heart to find the child he had lost many years before building him a tower in heaven our blessed christian hopes do not shut out the belief of love and remembrance still enduring there but irradiate it and make it sacred who should know that better than you or who more deeply feel the touching truths and comfort of that story in the older book where when the bereaved mother is asked is it well with the child she answers it is well  god be with you kate and her sister desire their kindest love to yourself and mrs white in which i heartily join                              being ever my dear white                                              your affectionate friend   sidenote mr w c macready                        devonshire terrace

having a farewell benefit before going to america and whether you would like to have it at the haymarket and also as to its being preceded by a short engagement there i dont know what your feelings may be on this latter head but thinking it well that you may know how the land lies in these seas send you this the rather excuse elizabethan phrase but you know how indispensable it is to me under

come into a box upstairs and look down on the humbled bobadil since then i have had the kindest of notes from you since then the finest of venison and yet i have not seen the rockingham flowers and they are withering i daresay  but we have acted at manchester liverpool birmingham edinburgh and glasgow and the business of all thisand graver and heavier daily occupation in going to see a dying sister at hornseyhas so worried me that i have hardly had an hour far less a week i shall never be quite happy in a theatrical point of view until you have seen me play in an english version of the french piece lhomme blasé which fairly turned the head of glasgow last thursday night as ever was neither shall i be quite happy in a social point of view until i have been to rockingham again when the first event will come about heaven knows the latter will happen about the end of the november fogs and wet weather for am i not going to broadstairs now to walk about on the seashore why dont you bring your rosy children there and think what is to be done for christmas an idea occurs to me all at once i must come down and read you that book before its published shall it be a bargain were you all in switzerland i dont believe i ever was it is such a dream now i wonder sometimes whether i ever disputed with a haldimand whether i ever drank mulled wine on the top of the great st bernard or was jovial at the bottom with company that have stolen into my affection whether i ever was merry and happy in that valley on the lake of geneva or saw you one evening when i didnt know you walking down among the green trees outside elysée arminarm with a gentleman in a white hat i am quite clear that there is no foundation for these visions but i should like to go somewhere too and try it all over again i dont know how it is but the ideal world in which my lot is cast has an odd effect on the real one and makes it chiefly precious for such remembrances i get quite melancholy over them sometimes especially when as now those great piledup semicircles of bright faces at which i have lately been lookingall laughing earnest and intenthave faded away like dead people they seem a ghostly moral of everything in life to me  kate sends her best love in which georgy would as heartily unite i know but that she is already gone to broadstairs with the children we think of following on

she must have a little cap on there is something coming in the last part about her having had a dead child which makes it yet more desirable than the existing text does that she should have that

the little tetterbys the very spirit of morning gladness innocence hope love domesticity etc etc etc etc  i would limit the illustration to her and the children which will make a fitness between it

brighton are performing two counts in a melodrama i was quite addleheaded for the time being and think an amateur or so would revive me no tone i dont in the abstract approve of brighton i couldnt pass an autumn here but it is a gay place for a week or so and when one laughs and cries and suffers the agitation that some men experience over their books its a bright change to look out of window

the third part where there are some things i describe for effects sake and as a matter of art which must be said on the stage redlaw is in a new condition of mind which fact must be shot pointblank at the audience i suppose as from the deadly level of a gun by anybody who knew how to play milly i think it might be made very good its effect is very pleasant upon me i have also given mr and mrs

permit the letter to be prefixed to a reprint not designed for circulation in england where i could understand his reluctance to sanction its publication its varied illustration of the subject of the book and its striking passages of personal feeling and character led me also to request that i might be allowed to present it in facsimile  mr forster complied and i am most happy to be thus enabled

wanted to say to you how good i thought those papers in blackwoodhow excellent their purpose and how delicately and charmingly worked out their subtle and delightful humour and their grasp of the whole question were something more pleasant to me than i can possibly express  how comes this lumbering inimitable to say this on this sunday night of all nights in the year you naturally ask now hear the inimitables honest avowal i make so bold because i heard that morning service better read this morning than ever i have heard it read in my life and becausefor the soul of mei cannot separate the two things or help identifying the wise and genial man out of church with the earnest and unaffected man in it midsummer madness perhaps but a madness i hope that will hold us true friends for many and many a year to come the madness is over as soon as you have burned this letter see the history of the gunpowder plot but let us be friends much longer for these reasons and many included in them

are favourable to its retention in extreme cases would unite in any temperate effort to abolish the evils of public executions and that the consequences of public executions are disgraceful and horrible he has taken the course with which miss joll is acquainted as the most hopeful and as one undoubtedly calculated to benefit society at large   sidenote the hon mrs watson          devonshire

morning with a pleasure my eloquence is unable to express and your modesty unable to conceive it is so delightful to be remembered at this time of the year in your house where we have been so happy and in dear old lausanne that we always hope to see again that i cant help pushing away the first page of copperfield no 10 now staring at me with what i may literally call a blank aspect and plunging energetically into this reply  what a strange coincidence that is about blunderstone house of all the odd things i have ever heard and their name is legion i think it is the oddest i went down into that part of the country on the 7th of january last year when i was meditating the story and chose blunderstone for the sound of its name i had previously observed much of what you say about the poor girls in all you suggest with so much feeling about their return to virtue being cruelly cut off i concur with a sore heart i have been turning it over in my mind for some time and hope in the history of little emly who must fallthere is no hope for her to put it before the thoughts of people in a new and pathetic way and perhaps to do some good you will be glad to hear i know that copperfield is a great success i think it is better liked than any of my other books  we had a most delightful time at watsons for both of them we have preserved and strengthened a real affection and were the gayest of the gay there was a miss boyle staying in the house who is an excellent amateur actress and she and i got up some scenes from the school for scandal and from nickleby with immense success we played in the old hall with the audience filled up and running over with servants the entertainments concluded with feats of legerdemain for the performance of which i have a pretty good apparatus collected at divers times and in divers places and we then fell to country dances of a most frantic description and danced all night we often spoke of you and mrs cerjat and of haldimand and wished you were all there watson and i have some fifty times registered a vow like oconnell to come to lausanne together and have even settled in what month and week something or other has always interposed to prevent us but i hope please god most certainly to see it again when my labourscopperfieldian shall have terminated  you have no idea what that hanging of the mannings really was the conduct of the people was so indescribably frightful that i felt for some time afterwards almost as if i were living in a city of devils i feel at this hour as if i never could go near the place again my letters have made a great todo and led to a great agitation of the subject but i have not a confident belief in any change being made mainly because the total abolitionists are utterly reckless and dishonest generally speaking and would play the deuce with any such proposition in parliament unless it were strongly supported by the government which it would certainly not be the whig motto in office being laissez aller i think peel might do it if he came in two points have occurred to me as being a good commentary to the objections to my idea the first is that a most terrific uproar was made when the hanging processions were abolished and the ceremony shrunk from tyburn to the prison door the second is that at this very time under the british government in new south wales executions take place within the prison walls with decidedly improved results i am waiting to explode this fact on the first man of mark who gives me the opportunity  unlike you we have had no marriages or giving in marriage here we might have had but a certain young lady whom you know is hard to please the children are all well thank god charley is going to eton the week after next and has passed a firstrate examination kate is quite well and unites with me and georgina in love to you and mrs cerjat and haldimand whom i would give a good deal tell him to have several hours contradiction of at his own table good heavens how obstinate we would both be i see him leaning back in his chair with his right forefinger out and saying good god in reply to some proposition of mine and then laughing  all in a moment a feeling comes over me as if you and i have been still talking smoking cigars outside the inn at martigny the piano sounding inside and lady mary taylour singing i look into my garden which is covered with snow rather dolefully but take heart again and look brightly forward to another expedition to the great st bernard when mrs cerjat and i shall laugh as i fancy i have never laughed since in one of those onesided cars and when we shall again learn from haldimand in a little dingy cabaret at lunchtime how to secure a door in travelling do you remember by balancing a chair against it on its two hindlegs  i do hope that we may all come together again once more while there is a head of hair left among us and in this hope remain my dear cerjat                                                   your faithful friend     1850  narrative   in the spring charles dickens took a short holiday again with his wife and sisterinlaw at brighton from whence he wrote to mr wills on household words business the first number of this journal appeared on the 30th march  this autumn he succeeded for the first time in getting possession of the fort house broadstairs on which he had always set his affections he was hard at work on the closing numbers of david copperfield during all the summer and autumn the family moved to broadstairs in july but as a third daughter was born in august they were not joined by mrs dickens until the end of september david copperfield was finished in october  the beginning of his correspondence with mrs gaskell is in his asking her to contribute to household words which she did from the first number and very frequently afterwards both to household words and all the year round  the letter to mr david roberts ra is one thanking him for a remembrance of his mr robertss travels in the easta picture of a simoom in the desert which was one of charles dickenss most highly prized possessions  a letter to mr sheridan knowles contains allusions which we have no means of explaining but we publish it as it is characteristic and addressed to a literary celebrity its being inscribed to daddy knowles illustrates a habit of charles dickensas does a letter later in this year to mr stone beginning my dear pof giving nicknames to the friends with whom he was on the most affectionate and intimate terms mr stoneespecially included in this categorywas the subject of many such names pump or pumpion being one by which he was frequently addresseda joke as goodhumouredly and gladly received as it was kindly and pleasantly intended  there were no public amateur theatricals this year but in november the greater part of the amateur company played for three nights at knebworth park as the guests of sir edward bulwer lytton afterwards lord lytton who entertained all his county neighbours to witness the performances the play was every man in his humour and farces varied each night  this year we have our first letter to miss mary boyle a cousin of mrs watson well known as an amateur actress and an accomplished lady miss boyle was to have acted with the amateur company at knebworth but was prevented by domestic affliction early in the following year there was a private play at rockingham castle when miss boyle acted with charles dickens the play being used up in which mrs dickens also acted and the farce animal magnetism in which miss boyle and miss hogarth played the letters to mrs watson in this year refer chiefly to the preparations for the play in her house  the accident mentioned in the letter addressed to mr henry bicknell soninlaw of mr david roberts ra and a muchesteemed friend of charles dickens was an accident which happened to mrs dickens while rehearsing at a theatre she fell through a trapdoor spraining her ankle so badly as to be incapacitated from taking her part in the theatricals at knebworth   sidenote mr david roberts ra                                devonshire terrace january 3rd 1850  my dear roberts  i am more obliged

on his way with it to call on you by the road i enclose a note from mrs dickens which i hope will impress you into a country dance with which we hope to dismiss christmas merrily

gentleman who has been the occasion of our recent correspondence i cannot sufficiently admire the dignity of his conduct and i really feel indebted to you for giving me the gratification of observing it  as to that cross note which rightly considered was nothing of the sort if ever you refer to it again ill doi dont exactly know what but something perfectly desperate and ferocious if i have ever thought of it it has only been to remember with delight how soon we came to a better understanding and how heartily we confirmed it with a most expressive shake of the hand one evening down in that

literary vows of temperance or abstinence may be but as i do honestly know that there is no living english writer whose aid i would desire to enlist in preference to the authoress of mary barton a book that most profoundly affected and impressed me i venture to ask you whether you can give me any hope that you will write a short tale or any number of tales for the projected pages  no writers name will be used neither my own nor any other every paper will be published without any signature and all will seem to express the general mind and purpose of the journal which is the raising up of those that are down and the general improvement of our social condition i should set a value on your help which your modesty can hardly imagine and i am perfectly sure that the least result of your reflection or observation in respect of the life around you would attract attention and do good  of course i regard your time as valuable and consider it so when i ask you if you could devote any of it to this purpose  if you could and would prefer to speak to me on the subject i should be very glad indeed to come to manchester for a few hours and explain anything you might wish to know my unaffected and great admiration of your book makes me very earnest in all relating to you forgive my troubling you for this reason and believe me ever

and ally had run away instead of running after them we came into the garden shut the gate and crouched down on the ground presently we heard them come back and say to each other with some alarm why the gates shut and theyre all gone ally began in a dismayed way to cry out but the phenomenon shouting open the gate sent an enormous stone flying into the garden among our heads by way of alarming the establishment i thought it a wonderful piece of character showing great readiness of resource he would have fired a perfect battery of stones or very likely have broken the pantry window i think if we hadnt let him in  they are all in great force and send their loves they are all much excited with the expectation of receiving you on friday and would start me off to fetch you now if i would go

histrionic duties and hold enormous correspondence with miss boyle between whom and myself the most portentous packets are continually passing i send you a piece we purpose playing last at rockingham which my company played in london scotland manchester liverpool and i dont know where else it is one of the most ridiculous things ever done we purpose as i have said playing it last why do i send it to you because there is an excellent part played in my troupe by george cruikshank for your brother in itjeffrey with a black patch on his eye and a lame leg he would be charmingnoble if he is come home give him my love and tell him so if he is not come home do me that favour when he does come and add that i have a wig for him belonging to the part which i have an idea of sending to the exposition of 51 as a triumph of human ingenuity  i am the doctor miss boyle lisette georgy the other little woman we have nearly arranged our bill for rockingham we shall want one more reasonably good actor besides your brother and miss boyles to play the marquis in this piece do you know a being endowed by nature with the requisite qualities  there are some things in the next copperfield that i think better than any that have gone before after i have been believing such things with all my heart and soul two results always ensue first i cant write plainly to the eye secondly i cant write sensibly to the mind so copperfield is to blame and i am not for this wandering note and if you like it youll forgive me with my affectionate remembrances to watson

forget the sad cause of your absence  bulwer was here yesterday and if i were to tell you how earnestly he and all the other friends whom you dont know have looked forward to the projected association with you and in what a friendly spirit they all express their disappointment you would be quite moved by it i think pray dont give yourself the least uneasiness on account of the blank in our arrangements i did not write to you yesterday in the hope that i might be able to tell you today that i had replaced you in however poor a way i cannot do that yet but i am busily making out some means of filling the parts before we rehearse tomorrow night and i trust to be able to do so in some outoftheway manner  mrs dickens and bridget send you their kindest remembrances they are bitterly disappointed at not seeing you today but we all hope for a better time                                        dear miss boyle                                               faithfully yours always

pleasure i should have made this reply to your last note sooner but that i have been waiting to send you copperfield in a new waistcoat his tailor is so slow that it has not yet appeared but when the resplendent garment comes home it shall be forwarded  i have not your note at hand but i think you said any time after christmas at all events and whatever you said we will conclude a treaty on any terms you may propose and if it should include any of charleys holidays perhaps you would allow us to put a brass collar round his neck and chain him up in the stable  kate and georgina who has covered herself with glory join me in best remembrances and regards to watson and you and all the house i have stupendous proposals to make concerning switzerland in the spring  i promised bulwer to make enquiry of you about miss watson whom he once knew and greatly wished to hear of he associated her but was not clear how with lady palmer                                       my dear mrs watson

such a thing believe me i would do it at your request but i dont and if you could see the ramparts of letters from similar institutions with which my desk bristles every now and then you would feel that nothing lies between total abstinence in this regard and utter bewilderment and lecturation  mrs dickens and her sister unite with me in kind regards to you and mrs bicknell the consequences of the accident are fast fading i am happy to say we all hope to hear shortly that mrs bicknell has recovered that other little accident which as you and i know will occasionally happen in wellregulated

        wednesday dec 4th 1850  my dear landor  i have been a strange thing for me so very unwell since sunday that i have hardly been able to hold up my heada bilious attack i believe and a very miserable sort of business this my dear friend is the reason why i have not sooner written to you in reference to your noble letter which i read in the examiner and for whichas it exalts mei cannot cannot thank you in words  we had been following up the blow in kinkels9 favour and i was growing sanguine in the hope of getting him out having enlisted strong and active sympathy in his behalf when the news came of his escape since then we have heard nothing of him i rather incline to the opinion that the damnable powers that be connived at his escape but know nothing whether he be retaken or whether he appear as i am not without hope he may in the streets of london i shall be a party to no step whatever without consulting you and if any scrap of intelligence concerning him shall reach me it shall be yours immediately  horne wrote the article i shall see him here tonight and know how he will feel your sympathy and support but i do not wait to see him before writing lest you should think me slow to feel your generosity we said at home when we read your letter that it was like the opening of your whole munificent and bare heart                                   ever most affectionately yours                                                        my dear landor    sidenote the hon mrs watson          symbol right hand        this is no 2                   devonshire terrace monday morning dec 9th 1850  my dear mrs watson  your note to me of saturday has crossed mine to you i find if you open both of mine together please to observe this is no 2  you may rely on mr tuckers doing his work thoroughly well and charging a fair price it is not possible for him to say aforehand in such a case what it will cost i imagine as he will have to adapt his work to the place nathans stage knowledge may be stated in the following figures 00000000000 therefore i think you had best refer mr tucker to me and i will apply all needful screws and tortures to him  i have thought of one or two very ingenious hem little contrivances for adapting the difficulties of used up to the small stage they will require to be so exactly explained to your carpenter though very easy little things in themselves that i think i had better before christmas send my servant down for an hourhe is quite an old stager nowto show him precisely what i mean it is not a days work but it would be extremely difficult to explain in writing i developed these wonderful ideas to the master carpenter at one of the theatres and he shook his head with an intensely mournful air and said ah sir its a universal observation in the profession sir that it was a great loss to the public when you took to writing books which i thought complimentary to copperfield                                                  ever faithfully yours   sidenote the same                        devonshire terrace saturday dec 14th 1850  my dear mrs watson  i shall be delighted to come on the seventh instead of the eighth we consider it an engagement over and above the pleasure of a quiet day with you i think i can greatly facilitate the preparations thats the way you see in which we cheat ourselves into making duties of pleasures by being at rockingham a day earlier so thats settled  i was quite certain when that child of israel mentioned those dimensions that he must be wrong for which woodenheadedness the child shall be taken to task on monday morning when i am going to look at his preparations by appointment about the door dont you observe that the scenery not being made expressly for the room it may be impossible to use it as you propose there is a scene before that wall and unless the door in the scene supposing there to be one which i am not sure of should come exactly into the place of the door of the room the door of the room might as well be in africa if it could be used it would still require to be backed excuse professional technicality by another scene in the passage and if it be rather in the side of the bottom of the room as i seem to remember it it would be shut out of sight or partially by the side scenes do you comprehend these stage managerial sagacities that piece of additional room in so small a stage would be of immense service if we could avail ourselves of it if we cant i have another means i think of discovering leech saville and coldstream at table i am constantly turning over in my mind the capacities of the place and hope by one means or other to make something more than the best of it as to the fireplace you will never be able to use that the heat of the lamp will be very great and ventilation will be the thing wanted thirteen feet and a half of depth diminished by stage fittings and furniture is a small space i think the doorway could be used in the last scene with the castle steps and platform for the staircase running straight through it toward the hall nous verrons i will write again about my visit of inspection probably on monday  will you let them know that messrs nathan of titchborne street haymarket will dress them please and that i will engage for their doing it thoroughly well also that mr wilson theatrical hairdresser strand near st clements churchyard will come down with wigs etc to make up everybody that he has a list of the pieces from me and that he will be glad to measure the heads and consult the tastes of all concerned if they will give him the opportunity beforehand i should like to see sir adonis leech and the hon t saville if i can for they ought to be wonderfully made up and to be as unlike themselves as possible and to contrast well with each other and with me i rather grudge caro sposo coming into the company i should like him so much to see the play if we do it all well together it ought to be so very pleasant i never saw a great mass of people so charmed with a little story as when we acted it at the glasgow theatre but i have no other reason for faltering when i take him to my arms i feel that he is the man for the part10 i see him with a blue bag a flaxen wig and green spectacles i know what it will be i foresee how all that sessional experience will come out i reconcile myself to it in spite of the selfish consideration of wanting him elsewhere and while i have a heavy sense of a light being snuffed out in the audience perceive a new luminary shining on the stage  your brother11 would make a capital tiger too very short tight surtout doeskins bright topboots white cravat bouquet in buttonhole close wigvery good very good it clearly must be so the thing is done i told you we were opening a tremendous correspondence when we first began to write on such a long subject but do let me tell you once and for all that i am in the business heart and soul and that you cannot trouble me respecting it and that i wouldnt willingly or knowingly leave the minutest detail unprovided for it cannot possibly be a success if the smallest peppercorn of arrangement be omitted and a success it must be i couldnt go into such a thing or help to bring you poorly out of it for any earthly consideration talking of forgetting isnt it odd i doubt if i could forget words i had learned so long as i wanted them but the moment the necessity goes they go i know my place and everybodys place in this identical piece of used up perfectly and could put every little object on its own square inches of room exactly where it ought to be but i have no more recollection of my words now i took the book up yesterday than if i had only seen the play as one of the audience at a theatre perhaps not so much with cordial remembrances                                      ever dear mrs watson                                                      faithfully yours   sidenote the hon mrs watson

down and returning the same day the train for my money appears to be the halfpast six am horrible initials and to that invention for promoting early rising i design to commit myself  i am shocked if i also made the mistake of confounding those two and too similar names12 but i think mr stafford had better do the marquis i am glad to find that we agree but we always do  i have closely overhauled the little theatre and the carpenter and painter the whole has been entirely repainted i mean the proscenium and scenery for this especial purpose and is extremely pretty i dont think the scale considered that anything better could be done it is very elegant i have brought the child to this for the hire of the theatre fifteen pounds the carriage to be extra the childs fares and expenses which will be very moderate to be extra the stage carpenters wages to be extraseven shillings a day i dont think when you see the things that you will consider this too much it is as good as the queens little theatre at windsor raised stage excepted i have had an extraction made which will enable us to use the door i am at present breaking my mans heart by teaching him how to imitate the sounds of the smashing of the windows and the breaking of the balcony in used up in the event of his death from grief i have promised to do something for his mother thinking it possible that you might not see the enclosed until next month and hoping that it is seasonable for christmas i send it being with cordial regards and all seasonable good wishes                                    ever dear mrs watson

sunday when i last saw you i went straight to lord johns with the letter you read he was out of town and i left it with my card  on the following wednesday i received a note from him saying that he did not bear in mind exactly what i had told him of you before and asking me to tell it again i immediately replied of course and gave him an exact description of you and your condition and your way of life in paris and everything else a perfect diorama in little with you pervading it today i got a letter from him announcing that you have a pension of a hundred a year of which i heartily wish you joy  he says i am happy to say that the queen has approved of a pension of one hundred pounds a year to mr poole  the queen in her gracious answer informs me that she meant to have mentioned mr poole to me and that she had wished to place him in the charter house but found the society there was not such as he could associate with  be so good as to inform mr poole that directions are given for his pension which will date from the end of june last  i have lost no time in answering this but you must brace up your energies to write him a short note too and another for the queen  if you are in paris shall i ascertain what authority i shall need from you to receive the halfyear which i suppose will be shortly due i can receive it as usual  with all good wishes and congratulations seasonable

was not played after all by mr watson but by mr now sir william boxall ra a very old and intimate friend of mr and mrs watson and of charles dickens  11 this part finally was played by charles dickens junior  12 mr stafford and mr stopford who both acted in the plays at rockingham     1851  narrative   in february this year charles dickens made a short bachelor excursion with mr leech and the hon spencer lyttelton to paris from whence we give a letter to his wife she was at this time in very bad health and the little infant dora had a serious illness during the winter the child rallied for the time but mrs dickens continued so ill that she was advised to try the airand waterof malvern and early in march she and her sister were established in lodgings there the children being left in london and charles dickens dividing his time between devonshire terrace and malvern he was busily occupied before this time in superintending the arrangements for mr macreadys last appearance on the stage at drury lane and for a great dinner which was given to mr macready after it on the 1st march at which the chair was taken by sir edward bulwer lytton with him charles dickens was then engaged in maturing a scheme which had been projected at the time of the amateur play at knebworth of a guild of literature and art which was to found a provident fund for literary men and artists and to start which a series of dramatic performances by the amateur company was proposed sir e b lytton wrote a comedy not so bad as we seem for the purpose to be played in london and the provinces and the duke of devonshire turned one of the splendid rooms in devonshire house into a theatre for the first occasion of its performance it was played early in may before her majesty and the prince consort and a large audience later in the season there were several representations of the comedy with a farce mr nightingales diary written by charles dickens for himself and mr mark lemon in the hanover square rooms  but in the interval between the macready banquet and the play at devonshire house charles dickens underwent great family trouble and sorrow his father whose health had been declining for some time became seriously ill and charles dickens was summoned from malvern to attend upon him mr john dickens died on the 31st march on the 14th april charles dickens had gone from malvern to preside at the annual dinner of the general theatrical fund and found his children all well at devonshire terrace he was playing with his baby dora before he went to the dinner soon after he left the house the child died suddenly in her nurses arms the sad news was communicated to the father after his duties at the dinner were over the next day mr forster went to malvern to break the news to mrs dickens and she and her sister returned with him to london and the malvern lodgings were given up but mrs dickens being still out of health and london being more than usually full this being the year of the great exhibition charles dickens decided to let the town house again for a few months and engaged the fort house broadstairs from the beginning of may until november this which was his longest sojourn at broadstairs was also the last as the following summer he changed his seaside resort and never returned to that pretty little wateringplace although he always retained an affectionate interest in it  the lease of the devonshire terrace house was to expire this year it was now too small for his family so he could not renew it although he left it with regret from the beginning of the year he had been in negotiation for a house in tavistock square in which his friend mr frank stone had lived for some years many letters which follow are on the subject of this house and the improvements charles dickens made in it his brotherinlaw henry austinhimself an architectsuperintended the works at tavistock house as he did afterwards those at gads hilland there are many characteristic letters to mr austin while these works were in progress in the autumn as a letter written in august to mr stone will show an exchange of houses was mademr stone removing with his family to devonshire terrace until his own new house was readywhile the alterations in tavistock house went on and charles dickens removed into it from broadstairs in november  his eldest son was now an eton boy he had been one of the party and had played a small part in the play at rockingham castle in the christmas holidays and his fathers letters to mrs watson at the beginning of this year have reference to this play  this year he wrote and published the haunted man which he had found himself unable to finish for the previous christmas it was the last of the christmas books he abandoned them in favour of a christmas number

produced at the adelphi theatre under the management of mr benjamin webster charles dickens read the book himself at tavistock house to a party of actors and actresses  at the end of the year he wrote the first number of bleak house although it was not published until march of the following year with the close attention and the hard work he gave from the time of its starting to his weekly periodical he found it to be most desirable now in beginning a new monthly serial that he should be ready with some numbers in advance before the appearance of the first number  a provincial tour for the guild took place at the end of the year a letter to his wife from clifton in november gives a notion of the general success and enthusiasm with which the plays were attended the new hardman to whom he alludes as taking that part in sir e b lyttons comedy in the place of mr forster was mr john tenniel who was a new addition and a very valuable and pleasant one to the company mr topham the delightful watercolour painter mr dudley costello and mr wilkie collins were also new recruits to the company of splendid strollers about this time a letter to mr wills asking him to take a part in the comedy is given here he never did act with the company but he complied with charles dickenss desire that he should be in the scheme by giving it all sorts of assistance and almost invariably being

as eternally walking up and down the platform at rugby in a high chill wind with no apparent hope of a trainas i left him and somehow i always think of rockingham after coming away as if i belonged to

miss boyle  i have devoted a couple of hours this evening to going very carefully over your paper which i had read before and to endeavouring to bring it closer and to lighten it and to give it that sort of compactness which a habit of composition and of disciplining ones thoughts like a regiment and of studying the art of putting each soldier into his right place may have gradually taught me to think necessary i hope when you see it in print you will not be alarmed by my use of the pruningknife i have tried to exercise it with the utmost delicacy and discretion and to suggest to you especially towards the end how this sort of writing regard being had to the size of the journal in which it appears requires to be compressed and is made pleasanter by compression this all reads very solemnly but only because i want you to read it i mean the article with as loving an eye as i have truly tried to touch it with a loving and gentle hand i propose to call it my mahogany friend the other name is too long and i think not attractive until i go to the office tomorrow and see what is actually in hand i am not certain of the number in which it will appear but georgy shall write on monday and tell you we are always a fortnight in advance of the public or the mechanical work could not be done i think there are many things in it that are very pretty the katie part is particularly well done if i dont say more it is because i have a heavy sense in all cases of the responsibility of encouraging anyone to enter on that thorny track where the prizes are so few and the blanks so many where  but i wont write you a sermon with the fire going out and the first shadows of a new story hovering in a ghostly way about me as they usually begin to do when i have finished an old one i am in danger of doing the heavy business and becoming a heavy guardian or something of that sort instead of the light and airy joe  so goodnight and believe that you may always trust me and never find a grim expression towards you in any that i wear                                                             ever yours   sidenote mr david roberts ra

convinced that the audience would not receive it under these exciting circumstances as it ought to be received if i had to read it i would on no account undertake to do so at that period in a great room crowded with a dense company i have an instinctive assurance that it would fail being with bulwer this morning i communicated your wish to him and he immediately felt as i do i could enter into

followers as it has ever boasted as i improved myself and was improved by favouring circumstances in mind and fortune i only became the more earnest if it were possible in my study of you no light

try to tell you what i feltof regret for its being past for ever and of joy in the thought that you could have taken your leave of me but in gods own timei should only blot this paper with some drops that would certainly not be of ink and give very faint expression to very strong emotions  what is all this in writing it is only some sort of relief to my full heart and shows very little of it to

night but it yielded little but generalities  however i thought of something for tonight that i think will make a splendid paper i have an idea that it might be connected with the gas paper making gas a great agent in an effective police and made one of the articles this is it a night in a stationhouse if you would go down to our friend mr yardley at scotland yard and get a letter or order to the acting chief authority at that stationhouse in bow street to enable us to hear the charges observe the internal economy of the stationhouse all night go round to the cells with the visiting policeman etc i would stay there say from twelve tonight to four or five in the morning we might have a nightcap a fire and some tea at the office hard by if you could conveniently borrow an hour or two from the night we could both go if not i would go alone it would make a wonderful good paper at a most appropriate time when the back slums of london are going to be invaded by all sorts of strangers  you neednt exactly say that i was going in propriâ unless it were necessary and of course you wouldnt say that i propose tonight because i am so worn by the sad arrangements in which i am engaged and by what led to them that i cannot take my natural rest but tomorrow night we go to the gasworks i might not be so disposed for this stationhouse observation as i shall be tonight for a long time and i see a most singular and admirable chance for us in the descriptive way not to be lost  therefore if you will arrange the thing before i come down at four this afternoon any of the scotland yard people will do it i should think if our friend by any accident should not be there i will go into it  if they should recommend any other stationhouse as better for the purpose or would think it better for us to go to more than one under the guidance of some trustworthy man of course we will pay any man and do as they recommend but i think one topping stationhouse would be best

good heap of money for the guild the comedy has been very much improved in many respects since you read it the scene to which you refer is certainly one of the most telling in the play and there is a farce to be produced on tuesday next wherein a distinguished amateur will sustain a variety of assumptionparts and in particular samuel weller and mrs gamp of which i say no more i am pining for broadstairs where the children are at present i lurk from the sun during the best part of the day in a villainous compound of darkness canvas sawdust general dust stale gas involving a vague smell of pepper and disenchanted properties but i hope to get down on wednesday or thursday  ah you country gentlemen who live at home at ease how little do you think of us among the london fleas but they tell me you are coming in for dorsetshire you must be very careful when you come to town to attend to your parliamentary duties never to ask your way of people in the streets they will misdirect you for what the vulgar call a lark meaning in this connection a jest at your expense always go into some respectable shop or apply to a policeman you will know him by his being dressed in blue with very dull silver buttons and by the top of his hat being made of stickingplaster you may perhaps see in some odd place an intelligentlooking man with a curious little wooden table before him and three thimbles on it he will want you to bet but dont do it he really desires to cheat you and dont buy at auctions where the best plated goods are being knocked down for next to nothing these too are delusions if you wish to go to the play to see real good acting though a little more subdued than perfect tragedy should be i would recommend you to see  at the theatre royal drury lane anybody will show it to you it is near the strand and you may know it by seeing no company whatever at any of the doors cab fares are eightpence a mile a mile london measure is half a dorsetshire mile recollect porter is twopence per pint what is called stout is fourpence the zoological gardens are in the regents park and the price of admission is one shilling of the streets i would recommend you to see regent street and the quadrant bond street piccadilly oxford street and cheapside i think these will please you after a time though the tumult and bustle will at first bewilder you if i can serve you in any way pray command me and with my best regards to your happy family so remote from this babel                             believe me my dear friend                                             ever

here with his wife but no one else and we can give you a bed that may be surpassed with a welcome that certainly cannot be  the general character of broadstairs as to size and accommodation was happily expressed by miss eden when she wrote to the duke of devonshire as he told me saying how grateful she felt to a certain sailor who asked leave to see her garden for not plucking it bodily up and sticking it in his buttonhole  as we think of putting mignonetteboxes outside the windows for the younger children to sleep in byandby i am afraid we should give your servant the cramp if we hardily undertook to lodge him but in case you should decide to bring one he is easily disposable hard by  dont come by the boat it is rather tedious and both departs and arrives at inconvenient hours

and pretending to suppose that under any circumstances i could fail to read with interest anything you wrote to me that i have more than half a mind to inflict a regular letter upon you if i were not the gentlest of men i should do it  poor dear haldimand i have thought of him so often that kind of decay is so inexpressibly affecting and piteous to me that i have no words to express my compassion and sorrow when i was at abbotsford i saw in a vile glass case the last clothes scott wore among them an old white hat which seemed to be tumbled and bent and broken by the uneasy purposeless wandering hither and thither of his heavy head it so embodied lockharts pathetic description of him when he tried to write and laid down his pen and cried that it associated itself in my mind with broken powers and mental weakness from that hour i fancy haldimand in such another going listlessly about that beautiful place and remembering the happy hours we have passed with him and his goodness and truth i think what a dream we live in until it seems for the moment the saddest dream that ever was dreamed pray tell us if you hear more of him we really loved him  to go to the opposite side of life let me tell you that a week or so ago i took charley and three of his schoolfellows down the river gipsying i secured the services of charleys godfather an old friend of mine and a noble fellow with boys and went down to slough accompanied by two immense hampers from fortnum and mason on i believe the wettest morning ever seen out of the tropics  it cleared before we got to slough but the boys who had got up at four we being due at eleven had horrible misgivings that we might not come in consequence of which we saw them looking into the carriages before us all face they seemed to have no bodies whatever but to be all face their countenances lengthened to that surprising extent when they saw us the faces shut up as if they were upon strong springs and their waistcoats developed themselves in the usual places when the first hamper came out of the luggagevan i was conscious of their dancing behind the guard when the second came out with bottles in it they all stood wildly on one leg we then got a couple of flys to drive to the boathouse i put them in the first but they couldnt sit still a moment and were perpetually flying up and down like the toy figures in the sham snuffboxes in this order we went on to tom browns the tailors where they all dressed in aquatic costume and then to the boathouse where they all cried in shrill chorus for mahoganya gentleman so called by reason of his sunburnt complexion a waterman by profession he was likewise called during the day hog and hogany and seemed to be unconscious of any proper name whatsoever we embarked the sun shining now in a galley with a striped awning which i had ordered for the purpose and all rowing hard went down the river we dined in a field what i suffered for fear those boys should get drunk the struggles i underwent in a contest of feeling between hospitality and prudence must ever remain untold i feel even now old with the anxiety of that tremendous hour they were very good however the speech of one became thick and his eyes too like lobsters to be comfortable but only temporarily he recovered and i suppose outlived the salad he took i have heard nothing to the contrary and i imagine i should have been implicated on the inquest if there had been one we had tea and rashers of bacon at a publichouse and came home the last five or six miles in a prodigious thunderstorm this was the great success of the day which they certainly enjoyed more than anything else the dinner had been great and mahogany had informed them after a bottle of light champagne that he never would come up the river with ginger company any more but the getting so completely wet through was the culminating part of the entertainment you never in your life saw such objects as they were and their perfect unconsciousness that it was at all advisable to go home and change or that there was anything to prevent their standing at the station two mortal hours to see me off was wonderful as to getting them to their dames with any sort of sense that they were damp i abandoned the idea i thought it a success when they went down the street as civilly as if they were just up and newly dressed though they really looked as if you could have rubbed them to rags with a touch like saturated curlpaper  i am sorry you have not been able to see our play which i suppose you wont now for i take it you are not going on monday the 21st our last night in town it is worth seeing not for the getting up which modesty forbids me to approve but for the little bijou it is in the scenery dresses and appointments they are such as never can be got together again because such men as stanfield roberts grieve haghe egg and others never can be again combined in such a work everything has been done at its best from all sorts of authorities and it is really very beautiful to look at  i find i am used up by the exhibition i dont say there is nothing in ittheres too much i have only been twice so many things bewildered me i have a natural horror of sights and the fusion of so many sights in one has not decreased it i am not sure that i have seen anything but the fountain and perhaps the amazon it is a dreadful thing to be obliged to be false but when anyone says have you seen  i say yes because if i dont i know hell explain it and i cant bear that  took all the school one day the school was composed of a hundred infants who got among the horses legs in crossing to the main entrance from the kensington gate and came reeling out from between the wheels of coaches undisturbed in mind they were clinging to horses i am told all over the park  when they were collected and added up by the frantic monitors they were all right they were then regaled with cake etc and went tottering and staring all over the place the greater part wetting their forefingers and drawing a wavy pattern on every accessible object one infant strayed he was not missed ninety and nine were taken home supposed to be the whole collection but this particular infant went to hammersmith he was found by the police at night going round and round the turnpike which he still supposed to be a part of the exhibition he had the same opinion of the police also of hammersmith workhouse where he passed the night when his mother came for him in the morning he asked when it would be over it was a great exhibition he said but he thought it long  as i begin to have a foreboding that you will think the same of this act of vengeance of mine this present letter i shall make an end of it with my heartiest and most loving remembrances to watson i should have liked him of all things to have been in the eton expedition tell him and to have heard a song bythebye i have forgotten that sung in the thunderstorm solos by charley chorus by the friends describing the career of a booby who was plucked at college every verse ending          i dont care a fig what the people may think         but what will the governor say  which was shouted with a deferential jollity towards myself as a governor who had that day done a creditable action and proved himself worthy of all confidence             with

understands that you would come to me yesterdaypassing his life as he does amidst every possible phase of such negotiationsi think it hardly worth while to wait for the receipt of his coming letter if you will take the trouble to call on him in the morning and offer the £1450 i shall be very much obliged to you if you will receive from me full power to conclude the purchase subject of course to my solicitors approval of the lease pray do i give you carte blanche to £1500 but i think the £1450 ought to win the day  i dont make any apologies for thrusting this honour upon you knowing what a

look carefully at all the earlier part where the use of the past tense instead of the present a little hurts the picturesque effect i understand each phase of the thing to be always a thing present before the minds eyea shadow passing before it whatever is done must be doing is it not so for example if i did the shadow of robinson crusoe i should not say he was a boy at hull when his father lectured him about going to sea and so forth but he is a boy at hull there he is in that particular shadow eternally a boy at hull his life to me is a series of shadows but there is no was in the case if i choose to go to his manhood i can these shadows dont change as realities do no phase of his existence passes away if i choose to bring it to this unsubstantial and delightful life the only death of which to me is my death and thus he is immortal to unnumbered thousands if i am right will you look at the proof through the first third or half of the papers and see whether the factor comes before us in that way if not it is merely the alteration of the verb here and there that is requisite  you say you are coming down to look for a place next week now jerrold says he is coming on

arising out of your note also presents itself to the brains of my other half  supposing you should find on looking onward a possibility of your being houseless at michaelmas what do you say to using devonshire terrace as a temporary encampment it will not be in its usual order but we would take care that there should be as much useful furniture of all sorts there as to render it unnecessary for you to move a stick if you should think this a convenience then i should propose to you to pile your furniture in the middle of the rooms at tavistock house and go out to devonshire terrace two or three weeks before michaelmas to enable my workmen to commence their operations this might be to our mutual convenience and therefore i suggest it certainly the sooner i can begin on tavistock house the better and possibly your going into devonshire terrace might relieve you from a difficulty that would otherwise be perplexing  i make this suggestion i need not say to you solely on the chance of its being useful to both of us if it were merely convenient to me you know i shouldnt dream of it such an arrangement while it would cost you nothing would perhaps enable you to get your new house into order comfortably and do exactly the same thing for me                                                    ever affectionately  psi anticipated your suggestion some weeks ago when i found i couldnt build a stable i said i ought to have permission to take the piece of ground into my garden which was conceded loaden writes me this morning that he thinks he can get permission to build a

1851  my dear henry  on the day of our departure i thought we were goingbackwardat a most triumphant pace but yesterday we rather recovered the painters still mislaid their brushes every five minutes and chiefly whistled in the intervals and the carpenters especially the pantechnicon continued to look sideways with one eye down pieces of wood as if they were absorbed in the contemplation of the perspective of the thames tunnel and had entirely relinquished the vanities of this transitory world but still there was an improvement and it is confirmed today white lime is to be seen in kitchens the bathroom is gradually resolving itself from an abstract idea into a factyouthful extremely youthful but a fact the drawingroom encourages no hope whatever nor the study staircase painted irish labourers howling in the schoolroom but i dont know why i see nothing gardener vigorously lopping the trees and really letting in the light and air foreman sweettempered but uneasy inimitable hovering gloomily through the premises all day with an idea that a little more work is done when he flits batlike through the rooms than when there is no one looking on catherine all over paint mister mccann encountering inimitable in doorways fades obsequiously into areas and there encounters him again and swoons with confusion several reams of blank paper constantly spread on the drawingroom walls and sliced off again which looks like insanity two men still clinking at the new stairrails i think they must be learning a tune i cannot make out any other object in their proceedings  since writing the above i have been up there again and found the young paperhanger putting on his slippers and looking hard at the walls of the servants room at the top of the house as if he meant to paper it one of these days may heaven prosper his intentions  when do you come back i hope soon                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote mrs charles dickens

methodical businesslike and energetic state i shall come home by the express on saturday morning and shall hope to be at home between eleven and twelve  we had a noble night last night the room which is the largest but one in england was crammed in every part the effect of from thirteen to fourteen hundred people all well dressed and all seated in one unbroken chamber except that the floor rose high towards the end of the hall was most splendid and we never played to a better audience the enthusiasm was prodigious the place delightful for speaking in no end of gas another hall for a dressingroom an immense stage and every possible convenience we were all thoroughly pleased i think with the whole thing and it was a very great and striking success tomorrownight having the new hardman i am going to try the play with all kinds of cuts taking out among other things some halfdozen printed pages of willss coffee house  we are very pleasant and cheerful they are all going to matthew davenport hills to lunch this morning and to see some woods about six or seven miles off i prefer being quiet and shall go out at my leisure and call on elliot we are very well lodged and boarded and living high up on the downs are quite out of the filth of bristol  i saw old landor at bath who has bronchitis when he was last in town kenyon drove him about by god half the morning under

delighted with it that i put it first in the number not hearing of any objection to my proposed alteration by return of post and the number is now made up and in the printers hands i cannot possibly take the tale outit has departed from me  i am truly concerned for this but i hope you will not blame me for what i have done in perfect good faith any recollection of me from your pen cannot as i think you know be otherwise than truly gratifying to me but with my name on every page of household words there would beor at least i should feelan impropriety in so mentioning myself i was particular in changing the author to make it hoods poems in the most important placei mean where the captain is killedand i hope and trust that the substitution will not be any serious drawback to the paper in any eyes but yours i would do anything rather than cause you a minutes vexation arising out of what has given me so much pleasure and i sincerely beseech you to think better of it and not to fancy that any shade has been thrown on your charming writing by                                           the unfortunate but innocent  psi write at a gallop not to lose another post   sidenote mrs gaskell

should call your paper delightful and touched in the tenderest and most delicate manner being what you are i confine myself to the observation that i have called it a love affair at cranford and sent

cunningham  about the three papers  1st with mr plowman of oxford wills will communicate  2nd now returned i have seen in nearly the same form before the list of names is overwhelming  3rd i am not at all earnest in the savage matter firstly because i think so tremendous a vagabond never could have obtained an honest living in any station of existence or at any period of time and secondly because i think it of the highest importance that such an association as our guild should not appear to resent upon society the faults of individuals who were flagrantly impracticable  at its best it is liable to that suspicion as all such efforts have been on the part of many jealous persons to whom it must look for aid and any stop that in the least encourages it is one of a fatal kind  i do not think myself but this is merely an individual opinion that savage was a man of genius or that anything of his writing would have attracted much notice but for the bastards reference to his mother for these reasons combined i should not be inclined to add my subscription of two guineas to yours unless the inscription were altered as i have altered it in pencil but in that case i should be very glad to respond to your suggestion and to snuff out all my smaller disinclination                                                  faithfully yours ever  footnote  13 mr charles knight was writing a series of papers in household words called shadows     1852  narrative   in the summer of this year charles dickens hired a house at dover for three months whither he went with his family at the end of this time he sent his children and servants back to tavistock house and crossed over to boulogne with his wife and sisterinlaw to inspect that town and its neighbourhood with a view of making it his summer quarters in the following year many amateur performances were given in the provinces in aid of the fund for the guild of literature and art charles dickens as usual taking the whole management on his own shoulders  in march the first number of bleak house appeared and he was at work on this book all through the year as well as being constantly occupied with his editorship of household words  we have in the letters for this year charles dickenss first to lord john russell afterwards the earl russell a friend whom he held in the highest estimation and to whom he was always grateful for many personal kindnesses we have also his first letter to mr wilkie collins with whom he became most intimately associated in literary work the affectionate friendship he had for him the high value in which he held him as a brotherartist are constantly expressed in charles dickenss own letters to mr collins and in his letters to other friends  those gallant men in the letter to mr j crofton croker had reference to an antiquarian club called the noviomagians who were about to give a dinner in honour of sir edward belcher and captain kellett the officers in command of the arctic exploring expedition to which charles dickens was also invited mr crofton croker was the president of this club and to denote his office it was customary to put on a cocked hat after dinner  the lost character he writes of in a letter to mrs watson refers to two different decipherings of his handwriting this sort of study being in fashion then and he and his friends at rockingham castle deriving much amusement from it  the letter dated july 9th was in answer to an anonymous correspondent who wrote to him as follows i venture to trespass on your attention with one serious query touching a sentence in the last number of bleak house do the supporters of christian missions to the heathen really deserve the attack that is conveyed in the sentence about jo seated in his anguish on the doorstep of the society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts the allusion is severe but is it just are such boys as jo neglected what are ragged schools town missions and many of those societies i regret to see sneered at in the last number of household words  the duke of middlesex in the letter we have here to mr charles knight was the name of the character played by mr f stone in sir e b lyttons comedy of not so bad as we seem  our last letter in this year to mr g linnæus banks was in acknowledgment of one from him on the subject of a proposed public dinner to charles dickens to be given by the people of birmingham when they were also to present him with a salver and a diamond ring the dinner was given in the following year and the ring and salver the latter an artistic specimen of birmingham ware were duly presented by mr banks who acted as honorary secretary in the names of the subscribers at the rooms of the birmingham fine arts association mr banks and the artist mr j c walker were the originators of this demonstration   sidenote mr w c macready                                  tavistock house january 31st 1852  my dear macready  if the taxes on knowledge mean the stamp duty the paper duty and the advertisement duty they seem to me to be unnecessarily confounded and unfairly too  i have already declined to sign a petition for the removal of the stamp duty on newspapers i think the reduced duty is some protection to the public against the rash and hasty launching of blackguard newspapers i think the newspapers are made extremely accessible to the poor man at present and that he would not derive the least benefit from the abolition of the stamp it is not at all clear to me supposing he wants the times a penny cheaper that he would get it a penny cheaper if the tax were taken off if he supposes he would get in competition two or three new journals as good to choose from he is mistaken not knowing the immense resources and the gradually perfective machinery necessary to the production of such a journal it appears to me to be a fair tax enough very little in the way of individuals not embarrassing to the public in its mode of being levied and requiring some small consideration and pauses from the american kind of newspaper projectors further a committee has reported in favour of the repeal and the subject may be held to need no present launching  the repeal of the paper duty would benefit the producers of periodicals immensely it would make a very large difference to me in the case of such a journal as household words but the gain to the public would be very small it would not make the difference of enabling me for example to reduce the price of household words by its fractional effect upon a copy or to increase the quantity of matter i might in putting the difference into my pocket improve the quality of the paper a little but not one man in a thousand would notice it it might though i am not sure even of this remove the difficulties in the way of a deserving periodical with a small sale charles knight holds that it would but the case on the whole appeared to me so slight when i went to downing street with a deputation on the subject that i said in addressing the chancellor of the exchequer i could not honestly maintain it for a moment as against the soap duty or any other pressing on the mass of the poor  the advertisement duty has this preposterous anomaly that a footman in want of a place pays as much in the way of tax for the expression of his want as professor holloway pays for the whole list of his miraculous cures  but i think at this time especially there is so much to be considered in the necessity the country will be under of having money and the necessity of justice it is always under to consider the physical and moral wants of the poor mans home as to justify a man in saying i must wait a little all taxes are more or less objectionable and so no doubt are these but we must have some and i have not made up my mind that all these things that are mixed up together are taxes on knowledge in reality  kate and georgy unite with me in kindest and heartiest love to dear mrs macready we are always with you in spirit and always talking about you i am obliged to conclude very hastily being beset today with business engagements saw the lecture and was delighted thought the idea admirable again loves upon loves to dear mrs macready and to miss macready also and kate and all the house i saw  play o heaven macbeth the other night in three hours and fifty minutes which is quick

lansdowne on wednesday and can only drink to them in the spirit which i have often done when they have been farther off  i hope you will find occasion to put on your cocked hat that they may see how terrific and imposing a foreandafter can be made on shore                                                faithfully yours always   sidenote the hon mrs watson                                     tavistock house april 6th 1852  my dear mrs watson  my lost character was one of those awful documents occasionally to be met with which will be everywhere it glared upon me from every drawer i had fell out of books lurked under keys hid in empty inkstands got into portfolios frightened me by inscrutably passing into locked despatchboxes and was not one character but a thousand this was when i didnt want it i look for it this morning and it is nowhere probably will never be beheld again  but it was very unlike this one and there is no doubt that when these ventures come out good it is only by lucky chance and coincidence she never mentioned my love of order before and it is so remarkable being almost a disorder that she ought to have fainted with surprise when my handwriting was first revealed to her  i was very sorry to leave rockingham the other day and came away in quite a melancholy state the birmingham people were very active and the shrewsbury gentry quite transcendent i hope we shall have a very successful and dazzling trip it is delightful to me to think of your coming to birmingham and bythebye if you will tell me in the previous week what hotel accommodation you want mr wills will look to it with the greatest pleasure  your bookseller ought to be cashiered i suppose he as rogers calls everybodys husband went out hunting with the idea of diverting his mind from

hamlet because they didnt know the airs tom taylor said that you had published the airs in your shakespeare i said that if it were so i knew you would be happy to place them at the germans service if you have got them and will send them to me i will write to devrient who knows no english a french explanation and reminder of the circumstance and will tell him that you responded like a man and ai

very earnestly and am proud to be held in your remembrance                        believe me always yours faithfully and obliged   sidenote anonymous correspondent                    tavistock house tavistock square july 9th 1852  sir  i have received your letter of yesterdays date and shall content myself with a brief reply  there was a long time during which benevolent societies were spending immense sums on missions abroad when there was no such thing as a ragged school in england or any kind of associated endeavour to penetrate to those horrible domestic depths in which such schools are now to be found and where they were to my most certain knowledge neither placed nor discovered by the society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts  if you think the balance between the home mission and the foreign mission justly held in the present time i do not i abstain from drawing the strange comparison that might be drawn between the sums even now expended in endeavours to remove the darkest ignorance and degradation from our very doors because i have some respect for mistakes that may be founded in a sincere wish to do good but i present a general suggestion of the stillexisting anomaly in such a paragraph as that which offends you in the hope of inducing some people to reflect on this matter and to adjust the balance more correctly i am decidedly of opinion that the two works the home and the foreign are not conducted with an equal hand and that the home claim is by far the stronger and the more pressing of the two  indeed i have very grave doubts whether a great commercial country holding communication with all parts of the world can better christianise the benighted portions of it than by the bestowal of its wealth and energy on the making of good christians at home and on the utter removal of neglected and untaught childhood from its streets before it wanders elsewhere for if it steadily persist in this work working downward to the lowest the travellers of all grades whom it sends abroad will be good exemplary practical missionaries instead of undoers of what the best professed missionaries can do  these are my opinions founded i believe on some knowledge of facts and some observation if i could be scared out of them let me add in all good humour by such easilyimpressed words as antichristian or irreligious i should think that i deserved them in their real signification  i have referred in vain to page 312 of household words for the sneer to which you call my attention nor have i i assure you the least idea where else it is to be found                                       i am sir your faithful servant   sidenote miss mary boyle                          10 camden crescent dover july 22nd 1852  my dear mary  this is indeed a noble letter the description of the family is quite amazing i must return it myself to say that i have appreciated it  i am going to do used up at manchester on the 2nd of september o think of that with another mary how can i ever say dear joe if you like the voice may fully frame the falsehood but the heartthe heart mr wurzelwill have no part in it  my dear mary you do scant justice to dover it is not quite a place to my taste being too bandy i mean musical no reference to its legs and infinitely too genteel but the sea is very fine and the walks are quite remarkable there are two ways of going to folkestone both lovely and striking in the highest degree and there are heights and downs and country roads and i dont know what everywhere  to let you into a secret i am not quite sure that i ever did like or ever shall like anything quite so well as copperfield but i foresee i think some very good things in bleak house i shouldnt wonder if they were the identical things that disraeli sees looming in the distance i behold them in the months ahead and weep  watson seemed when i saw him last to be holding on as by a sheetanchor to theatricals at christmas then o rapture but be still my fluttering heart  this is one of what i call my wandering days before i fall to work i seem to be always looking at such times for something i have not found in life but may possibly come to a few thousands of years hence in some other part of some other system god knows at all events i wont put your pastoral little pipe out of tune by talking about it ill go and look for it on the canterbury road among the hopgardens and orchards                                          ever faithfully your friend                                                                   joe   sidenote

dear watson was dead when the paragraph in the paper appeared he was buried in his own church yesterday last sunday three weeks the day before he went abroad he dined with us and was quite well and happy she has come home is at rockingham with the children and does not weakly desert his grave but sets up her rest by it from the first he had been wandering in his mind a little before his death but recovered consciousness and fell asleep she says quite gently and peacefully in her arms  i loved him very much and god knows he deserved it                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote the earl of carlisle                 10 camden crescent dover thursday aug 5th 1852  my dear lord carlisle  peared to me as uncle tom would say until within these last few days that i should be able to write to you joyfully accepting your saturdays invitation after newcastle in behalf of all whom it concerned but the sunderland people rushed into the field to propose our acting there on that saturday the only possible night and as it is the concluding guild expedition and the guild has a paramount claim on us i have been obliged to knock my own inclinations on the head cut the throat of my own wishes and bind the company hand and foot to the sunderland lieges i dont mean to tell them now of your invitation until we shall have got out of that country there might be rebellion we are staying here for the autumn  is there any hope of your repeating your visit to these coasts                                                  ever faithfully yours   sidenote the

full wellno one better i thinkhow your love for him and your trust in god and your love for your children will have come to the help of such a nature as yours and whispered better things than any friendship can however faithful and affectionate  we held him so close in our heartsall of us hereand have been so happy with him and so used to say how good he was and what a gentle generous noble spirit he had and how he shone out among commoner men as something so real and genuine and full of every kind of worthiness that it has often brought the tears into my eyes to talk of him we have been so accustomed to do this when we looked forward to years of unchanged intercourse that now when everything but truth goes down into the dust those recollections which make the sword so sharp pour balm into the wound and if it be a consolation to us to know the virtues of his character and the reasons that we had for loving him o how much greater is your comfort who were so devoted to him and were the happiness of his life  we have thought of you every day and every hour we think of you now in the dear old house and know how right it is for his dear childrens sake that you should have bravely set up your rest in the place consecrated by their fathers memory and within the same summer shadows that fall upon his grave we try to look on through a few years and to see the children brightening it and george a comfort and a pride and an honour to you and although it is hard to think of what we have lost we know how something of it will be restored by your example and endeavours and the blessing that will descend upon them we know how the time will come when some reflection of that cordial unaffected most affectionate presence which we can never forget and never would forget if we couldsuch is gods great mercywill shine out of your boys eyes upon you his best friend and his last consoler and fill the void there is now  may god who has received into his rest through this affliction as good a man as ever i can know and love and mourn for on this earth be good to you dear friends through these coming years may all those compassionate and hopeful lessons of the great teacher who shed divine tears for the dead bring their full comfort to you i have no fear of that my confidence is certainty  i cannot write what i wish i had so many things to say i seem to have said none it is so with the remembrances we send i cannot put them into words  if you should ever set up a record in the little church i would try to word it myself and god knows out of the fulness of my heart if you should think it well                  my dear friend                         yours with the truest affection and sympathy   sidenote mr w c macready                     hÔtel des bains

at dover a few days after it was written but i thought it best not to write to you until you were at home again among your dear children  its tidings were not unexpected to us had been anticipated in many conversations often thought of under many circumstances but the shock was scarcely lessened by this preparation the many happy days we have passed together came crowding back all the old cheerful times arose before us and the remembrance of what we had loved so dearly and seen under so many aspectsall natural and delightful and affectionate and ever to be cherishedwas how pathetic and touching you know best  but my dear dear macready this is not the first time you have felt that the recollection of great love and happiness associated with the dead soothes while it wounds and while i can imagine that the blank beside you may grow wider every day for many days to come i knowi thinkthat from its depths such comfort will arise as only comes to great hearts like yours when they can think upon their trials with a steady trust in god  my dear friend i have known her so well have been so happy in her regard have been so lighthearted with her have interchanged so many tender remembrances of you with her when you were far away and have seen her ever so simply and truly anxious to be worthy of you that i cannot write as i would and as i know i ought as i would press your hand in your distress i let this note go from me i understand your grief i deeply feel the reason that there is for it yet in that very feeling find a softening consolation that must spring up a hundredthousandfold for you may heaven prosper it in your breast and the spirits that have gone before from the regions of mercy to which they have been called smooth the path you have to tread alone children are left you your good sister god bless her is by your side you have devoted friends and more reasons than most men to be selfreliant and stedfast something is gone that never in this world can be replaced but much is left and it is a part of her life her death her immortality  catherine and georgina who are with me here send you their overflowing love and sympathy we hope that in a little while and for a little while at least you will come among us who have known the happiness of being in this bond with you and will not exclude us from participation in your past and future

oct 12th 1852  my dear wills                              h w  i have thought of the christmas number but not very successfully because i have been and still am constantly occupied with bleak house i purpose returning home either on sunday or monday as my work permits and we will immediately thereafter dine at the office and talk it over so that you may get all the men to their work  the fault of s poem besides its intrinsic meanness as a composition is that it goes too glibly with the comfortable ideas of which we have had a great deal too much in england since the continental commotions that a man is to sit down and make himself domestic and meek no matter what is done to him it wants a stronger appeal to rulers in general to let men do this fairly by governing them well as it stands it is at about the tractmark dairymans daughter etc of political morality and dont think that it is necessary to write down to any part of our audience i always hold that to be as great a mistake as can be made  i wish you would mention to thomas that i think the paper on hops extremely well done he has quite caught the idea we want and caught it in the best way in pursuing the bridge subject i think it would be advisable to look up the thames police i have a misty notion of some capital papers coming out of it will you see to this branch of the tree among the other branches                                   myself  to chapman i will write my impression is that i shall not subscribe to the hood monument as i am not at all favourable to such posthumous honours

in after dinner since my letter was written and posted i have gone over it  i am grievously depressed by it it is so exceedingly bad if you have anything else to put first dont put s paper first there is nothing better for a beginning in the number as it stands but this is very bad it is a mistake to think of it as a first article the article itself is in the main a mistake firstly the subject requires the greatest discretion and nicety of touch and secondly it is all wrong and selfcontradictory nobody can for a moment suppose that sporting amusements are the sports of the people the whole gist of the best part of the description is to show that they are the amusements of a peculiar and limited class the greater part of them are at a miserable discount horseracing excepted which has been already sufficiently done in h w and there is no reason for running amuck at them at all i have endeavoured to remove much of my objection and i think have done so but both in purpose and in any general address it is as wide of a first article as anything can well be it would do best in the opening of the number  about sunday in paris there is no kind of doubt take it out such a thing as that crucifixion unless it were done in a masterly manner we have no business to stagger families with besides the name is a comprehensive one and should include a quantity of fine matter lord bless me what i could write under that head  strengthen the number pray by anything good you may have it is a very dreary business as it stands  the proofs want a thorough revision  in haste going to bed

which you did me the favour to address to me i believefor it has no datesome days ago  i have the greatest tenderness for the memory of hood as i had for himself but i am not very favourable to posthumous memorials in the monument way and i should exceedingly regret to see any such appeal as you contemplate made public remembering another public appeal that was made and responded to after hoods death i think that i best discharge my duty to my deceased friend and best consult the respect and love with which i remember him by declining to join in any such public endeavours as that which you in all generosity and singleness of purpose i am sure advance i shall have a melancholy gratification in privately assisting to place a simple and plain record over the remains of a great writer that should be as modest as he was himself but i regard any other monument in connection with his mortal restingplace as a mistake                                       i am sir your faithful servant

will one of the stories  i propose to give the number some fireside name and to make it consist entirely of short stories supposed to be told by a family sitting round the fire i dont care about their referring to christmas at all nor do i design to connect them together otherwise than by their names as          the grandfathers story         the fathers story         the daughters story         the schoolboys story         the childs story         the guests story         the old nurses story  the grandfather might very well be old enough to have lived in the days of the highwaymen do you feel disposed from fact fancy or both to do a good winterhearth story of a highwayman if you do i embrace you per post and throw up a cap i have purchased for the purpose into midair  think of it and

november 22nd 1852  my dear mrs watson  having just now finished my work for the time being i turn in here in the course of a rainy walk to have the gratification of writing a few lines to you if my occupations with this same right hand were less numerous you would soon be tired of me i should write to you so often  you asked catherine a question about bleak house its circulation is half as large again as copperfield i have just now come to the point i have been patiently working up to in the writing and i hope it will suggest to you a pretty and affecting thing in the matter of uncle toms cabin i partly though not entirely agree with mr james no doubt a much lower art will serve for the handling of such a subject in fiction than for a launch on the sea of imagination without such a powerful bark but there are many points in the book very admirably done there is a certain st clair a new orleans gentleman who seems to me to be conceived with great power and originality if he had not a grecian outline of face which i began to be a little tired of in my earliest infancy i should think him unexceptionable he has a sister too a maiden lady from new england in whose person the besetting weaknesses and prejudices of the abolitionists themselves on the subject of the blacks are set forth in the liveliest and truest colours and with the greatest boldness  i have written for household words of this next publicationday an article on the state funeral14 showing why i consider it altogether a mistake to be temperately but firmly objected to which i daresay will make a good many of the admirers of such things highly indignant it may have right and reason on its side however none the less  charley and i had a great talk at dover about his going into the army when i thought it right to set before him fairly and faithfully the objections to that career no less than its advantages the result was that he asked in a very manly way for time to consider so i appointed to go down to eton on a certain day at the beginning of this month and resume the subject we resumed it accordingly at the white hart at windsor and he came to the conclusion that he would rather be a merchant and try to establish some good house of business where he might find a path perhaps for his younger brothers and stay at home and make himself the head of that long small procession i was very much pleased with him indeed he showed a fine sense and a fine feeling in the whole matter we have arranged therefore that he shall leave eton at christmas and go to germany after the holidays to become well acquainted with that language now most essential in such a walk of life as he will probably tread  and i think this is the whole of my news we are always talking of you at home mary boyle dined with us a little while ago you look out i imagine on a waste of water when i came from windsor i thought i must have made a mistake and got into a boat in the dark instead of a railwaycarriage catherine and georgina send their kindest loves i am ever with the best and truest wishes of my heart my dear mrs watson                                          your most affectionate friend    sidenote rev james white                 office of household words monday nov 22nd 1852  my dear white  first and foremost there is no doubt whatever of your story suiting household words it is a very good story indeed and would be serviceable at any time i am not quite so clear of its suiting the christmas number for this reason you know what the spirit of the christmas number is when i suggested the stories being about a highwayman i got hold of that idea as being an adventurous one including various kinds of wrong expressing a state of society no longer existing among us and pleasant to hear therefore from an old man now your highwayman not being a real highwayman after all the kind of suitable christmas interest i meant to awaken in the story is not in it do you understand for an ordinary number it is quite unobjectionable if you should think of any other idea narratable by an old man which you think would strike the chord of the season and if you should find time to work it out during the short remainder of this month i should be greatly pleased to have it in any case this story goes straightway into type  what tremendous weather it is our best loves to all at home i have just bought thirty bottles of the most stunning port on earth which ellis of the star and garter richmond wrote to me of  i think you will find some good going in the next bleak house i write

serious to me i wish between this and dinner you would send john to see if he can hire a gun with a few caps some powder and a few charges of small shot if you duly commission him with a card he can

childs story as well as of the poor relations i assure you you have given me the liveliest and heartiest pleasure by what you say of it  i dont claim for my ending of the nurses story that it would have made it a bit better all i can urge in its behalf is that it is what i should have done myself but there is no doubt of the story being admirable as it stands and there is some doubt i think whether forster would have found anything wrong in it if he had not known of my hammering over the proofs in making up the number with all the three endings before me                    with kindest

collins  if i did not know that you are likely to have a forbearing remembrance of my occupation i should be full of remorse for not having sooner thanked you for basil  not to play the sage or the critic neither of which parts i hope is at all in my line but to say what is the friendly truth i may assure you that i have read the book with very great interest and with a very thorough conviction that you have a call to this same art of fiction i think the probabilities here and there require a little more respect than you are disposed to show them and i have no doubt that the prefatory letter would have been better away on the ground that a book of all things should speak for and explain itself but the story contains admirable writing and many clear evidences of a very delicate discrimination of character it is delightful to find throughout that you have taken great pains with it besides and have gone at it with a perfect knowledge of the jolterheadedness of the conceited idiots who suppose that volumes are to be tossed off like pancakes and that any writing can be done without the utmost application the greatest patience and the steadiest energy of which the writer is capable  for all these reasons i have made basils acquaintance with great gratification and entertain a high respect for him and i hope that i shall become intimate with many worthy descendants of his who are yet in the limbo of creatures waiting to be born                                                always faithfully yours  psi am open to any proposal to go anywhere any day or days this week

footnote  14 the great duke of wellingtons funeral     1853  narrative   in this year charles dickens was still writing bleak house and went to brighton for a short time in the spring in may he had an attack of illness a return of an old trouble of an inflammatory pain in the side which was short but very severe while it lasted immediately on his recovery early in june a departure from london for the summer was resolved upon he had decided upon trying boulogne this year for his holiday sojourn and as soon as he was strong enough to travel he his wife and sisterinlaw went there in advance of the family taking up their quarters at the hôtel des bains to find a house which was speedily done the pretty little villa des moulineaux and its excellent landlord at once took his fancy and in that house and in another on the same ground also belonging to m beaucourt he passed three very happy summers and he became as much attached to our french watering place as to our english one having written a sketch of broadstairs under that name in household words he did the same of boulogne under the former title  during the summer besides his other work he was employed in dictating the childs history of england which he published in household words and which was the only book he ever wrote by dictation but as at broadstairs and other seaside homes he had always plenty of relaxation and enjoyment in the visits of his friends in september he finished bleak house and in october he started with mr wilkie collins and mr egg from boulogne on an excursion through parts of switzerland and italy his wife and family going home at the same time and he himself returning to tavistock house early in december his eldest son charles had left eton some time before this and had gone for the completion of his education to leipsic he was to leave germany at the end of the year therefore it was arranged that he should meet the travellers in paris on their homeward journey and they all returned together  just before christmas he went to birmingham in fulfilment of an offer which he had made at the dinner given to him at birmingham on the 6th of january of which he writes to mr macready in the first letter that follows here to give two readings from his own books for the benefit of the new midland institute they were his first public readings he read the christmas carol on one evening and the cricket on the hearth on the next before enormous audiences the success was so great and the sum of money realised for the institute so large that he consented to give a second reading of the christmas carol remaining another night in birmingham for the purpose on the condition that seats were reserved at prices within their means for the working men and to his great satisfaction they formed a large proportion and were among the most enthusiastic and appreciative of his audience he was accompanied by his wife and sisterinlaw and on this occasion a breakfast was given to him after his last reading at which a silver flowerbasket duly inscribed was very gracefully presented to mrs charles dickens  the letters in this year require little explanation those to his wife and sisterinlaw and mr wills give a little history of his italian journey at naples he found his excellent friend sir james emerson tennent with his wife and daughter with whom he joined company in the ascent of vesuvius  the two letters to m regnier the distinguished actor of the théâtre françaiswith whom charles dickens had formed a sincere friendship during his first residence in parison the subject of a projected benefit to miss kelly need no further explanation  mr john delane editor of the times and always a highlyesteemed friend of charles dickens had given him an introduction to a school at boulogne kept by two english gentlemen one a clergyman and the other a former eton master the rev w bewsher and mr gibson he had at various times four boys at this school and very frequently afterwards he expressed his gratitude to mr delane for having given him the introduction which turned out so satisfactory in every respect  the letter of grateful acknowledgment from mr poole and charles dickens to lord russell was for the pension for which the old dramatic author was indebted to that nobleman and which enabled him to live comfortably until the end of his life  a note to mr marcus stone was sent with a copy of the childs history of england the sketch referred to was one of jo in bleak house which showed great feeling and artistic promise since fully fulfilled by the young painter but very remarkable in a boy so young as he was at that time the letter to mr stanfield in seafaring language is a specimen of a playful way in which he frequently addressed that dear friend   sidenote mr w h wills         a curiosity from him no date no signaturew h h  my dear wills  i have not a shadow of a doubt about miss martineaus story it is certain to tell i think it

friday night jan 14th 1853  my dearest macready  i have been much affected by the receipt of your kindest and best of letters for i know out of the midst of what anxieties it comes to me and i appreciate such remembrance from my heart you and yours are always with us however it is no new thing for you to have a part in any scene of my life it very rarely happens that a day passes without our thoughts and conversation travelling to sherborne we are so much there that i cannot tell you how plainly i see you as i write  i know you would have been full of sympathy and approval if you had been present at birmingham and that you would have concurred in the tone i tried to take about the eternal duties of the arts to the people i took the liberty of putting the court and that kind of thing out of the question and recognising nothing but the arts and the people the more we see of life and its brevity and the world and its varieties the more we know that no exercise of our abilities in any art but the addressing of it to the great ocean of humanity in which we are drops and not to byeponds very stagnant here and there ever can or ever will lay the foundations of an endurable retrospect is it not so you should have as much practical information on this subject now my dear friend as any man  my dearest macready i cannot forbear this closing word i still look forward to our meeting as we used to do in the happy times we have known together so far as your old hopefulness and energy are concerned and i think i never in my life have been more glad to receive a sign than i have been to hail that which i find in your handwriting  some of your old friends at birmingham are full of interest and enquiry kate and georgina send their dearest loves to you and to miss macready and to all the children i am ever and no matter where i amand quite as much in a crowd as alonemy dearest macready                             your affectionate and most attached friend   sidenote mrs

deal of good by pursuing it in household words i thoroughly agree in all you say in your note have similar reasons for giving it some anxious consideration and shall be greatly interested in it pray decide to do it send the papers as you write them to me meanwhile i will think of a name for them and bring it to bear upon yours if i think yours improvable i am sure you may rely on being widely understood and sympathised with  forget that i called those two women my dear friends why if i told you a fiftieth part of what i have thought about them you would write me the most suspicious of notes refusing to receive the fiftieth part of that so i dont write particularly as you laid your injunctions on me concerning ruth in revenge i will now mention one word that i wish you would take out whenever you reprint that book she would neveri am ready to make affidavit before any authority in the landhave called her seducer sir when they were living at that hotel in wales a girl

tavistock house monday may 9th 1853  my dear regnier  i meant to have spoken to you last night about a matter in which i hope you can assist me but i forgot it i think i must have been quite bouleversé by your supposing as you pretended to do when you went away that it was not a great pleasure and delight to me to see you act  there is a certain miss kelly now sixtytwo years old who was once one of the very best of english actresses in the greater and better days of the english theatre she has much need of a benefit and i am exerting myself to arrange one for her on about the 9th of june if possible at the st jamess theatre the first piece will be an entertainment of her own and she will act in the last between these two and at the best time of the night it would be a great attraction to the public and a great proof of friendship to me if you would act if we could manage through your influence and with your assistance to present a little french vaudeville such as le bon homme jadis it would make the night a grand success  mitchells permission i suppose would be required that i will undertake to apply for if you will tell me that you are willing to help us and that you could answer for the other necessary actors in the little french piece whatever the piece might be that you would choose for the purpose pray write me a short note in answer on this point  i ought to tell you that the benefit will be under distinguished patronage the duke of devonshire the duke of leinster the duke of beaufort etc etc are members of the committee with me and i have no doubt that the audience will be of the élite  i have asked mr chapman to come to me tomorrow to arrange for the hiring of the theatre mr harley a favourite english comedian whom you may know is our secretary and if i could assure the committee tomorrow afternoon of your cooperation i am sure they would be overjoyed                                                    votre tout dévoué   sidenote

picked up in the most extraordinary manner and i believe you would never suppose to look at me that i had had that week or barely an hour of it if there should be any occasion for our meeting in the meantime a run over here would do you no harm and we should be delighted to see you at any time if you suppose this place to be in a street you are much mistaken it is in the country though not more than ten minutes walk from the postoffice and is the best dollshouse of many rooms in the prettiest french grounds in the most charming situation i have ever seen the best place i have ever lived in abroad except at genoa you can scarcely imagine the beauty of the air in this richlywooded hillside as to comforts in the house there are all sorts of things beginning with no end of the coldest water and running through the most beautiful flowers down to english footbaths and a parisian liqueurstand your parcel frantic enclosures and all arrived quite safely last night this will leave by steamer

thursday june 23rd 1853  my dear pumpion  i take the earliest opportunity after finishing my numberahemto write you a line and to report myself thank god brown well robust vigorous open to fight any man in england of my weight and growing a moustache any person of undoubted pluck in want of a customer may hear of me at the bar of bleak house where my money is down  i think there is an abundance of places here that would suit you well enough and georgina is ready to launch on voyages of discovery and observation with you but it is necessary that you should consider for how long a time you want it as the folks here let much more advantageously for the tenant when they know the termdont like to let without it seems to me that the best thing you can do is to get a paper of the south eastern tidal trains fix your day for coming over here in five hours when you will pay through to boulogne at london bridge let me know the day and come and see how you like the place i like it better than ever we can give you a bed two to spare at a pinch three and show you a garden and a view or so the town is not so cheap as places farther off but you get a great deal for your money and by far the best wine at tenpence a bottle that i have ever drank anywhere i really desire no better  i may mention for your guidance for i count upon your coming to overhaul the general aspect of things that you have nothing on earth to do with your luggage when it is once in the boat until after you have walked ashore that you will be filtered with the rest of the passengers through a hideous whitewashed quarantinelooking customhouse where a stern man of a military aspect will demand your passport that you will have nothing of the sort but will produce your card with this addition restant à boulogne chez m charles dickens château des moulineaux that you will then be passed out at a little door like one of the illstarred prisoners on the bloody september night into a yelling and shrieking crowd cleaving the air with the names of the different hotels exactly seven thousand six hundred and fiftyfour in number and that your heart will be on the point of sinking with dread then you will find yourself in the arms of the sparkler of albion all unite in kindest regards                                                    ever affectionately  psi thought you might like to see the flourish again

cruikshanks editing half playfully and half seriously i mean to protest most strongly against alteration for any purpose of the beautiful little stories which are so tenderly and humanly useful to us in these times when the world is too much with us early and late and then to rewrite cinderella according to total abstinence peace society and bloomer principles and expressly for their propagation  i shall want his book of hop o my thumb forster noticed it in the last examiner and the most simple and popular version of cinderella you can get me i shall not be able to do it until after finishing

transmission here of the parcel which contained your letter caused me to come into the receipt of it a whole week after its date i immediately wrote to miss coutts who has written to you and i hope some good may come of it i know it will not be her fault if none does i was very much concerned to read your account of poor mrs warner and to read her own plain and unaffected account of herself pray assure her of my cordial sympathy and remembrance and of my earnest desire to do anything in my power to help to put her mind at ease  we are living in a beautiful little country place here where i have been hard at work ever since i came and am now after an interval of a weeks rest going to work again to finish bleak house kate and georgina send their kindest loves to you and miss macready and all the rest they look forward i assure you to their sherborne visit when ia mere forlorn wanderershall be roaming over the alps into italy i saw the midsummer nights dream of the opéra comique done here very well last night the way in which a poet named willyim shay kes peer gets drunk in company with sir john foll stayffe fights with a noble night lor latimeer who is in love with a maidofhonour you may have read of in history called mees oleevia and promises not to do so any more on observing symptoms of love for him in the queen of england is very remarkable queen elizabeth too in the profound and impenetrable disguise of a black velvet mask two inches deep by three broad following him into taverns and worse places and enquiring of persons of doubtful reputation for the sublime williams was inexpressibly ridiculous and yet the nonsense was done with a sense quite admirable  i have been very much struck by the book you sent me it is one of the wisest the manliest and most serviceable i ever read i am reading it again with the greatest pleasure and admiration                            ever most affectionately yours

lettermost welcome and full of interest to mewhen i was hard at work finishing bleak house we are always talking of you and i had said but the day before that one of the first things i would do on my release would be to write to you to finish the topic of bleak house at once i will only add that i like the conclusion very much and think it very pretty indeed the story has taken extraordinarily especially during the last five or six months when its purpose has been gradually working itself out it has retained its immense circulation from the first beating dear old copperfield by a round ten thousand or more i have never had so many readers we had a little reading of the final double number here the night before last and it made a great impression i assure you  we are all extremely well and like boulogne very much indeed i laid down the rule before we came that we would know nobody here and we do know nobody here we evaded callers as politely as we could and gradually came to be understood and left to ourselves it is a fine bracing air a beautiful open country and an admirable mixture of town and country we live on a green hillside out of the town but are in the town on foot in ten minutes things are tolerably cheap and exceedingly good the people very cheerful goodlooking and obliging the houses very clean the distance to london short and easily traversed i think if you came to know the place which i never did myself until last october often as i have been through it you could be but in one mind about it  charley is still at leipzig i shall take him up somewhere on the rhine to bring him home for christmas as i come back on my own little tour he has been in the hartz mountains on a walking tour and has written a journal thereof which he has sent home in portions it has cost about as much in postage as would have bought a pair of ponies  i contemplate starting from here on monday the 10th of october catherine georgina and the rest of them will then go home i shall go first by paris and geneva to lausanne for it has a separate place in my memory if the autumn should be very fine just possible after such a summer i shall then go by chamonix and martigny over the simplon to milan thence to genoa leghorn pisa and naples thence i hope to sicily back by bologna florence rome verona mantua etc to venice and home by germany arriving in good time for christmas day three nights in christmas week i have promised to read in the town hall at birmingham for the benefit of a new and admirable institution for working men projected there the friday will be the last night and i shall read the carol to two thousand working people stipulating that they shall have that night entirely to themselves  it just occurs to me that i mean to engage for the two months odd a travelling servant i have not yet got one if you should happen to be interested in any good foreigner well acquainted with the countries and the languages who would like such a master how delighted i should be to like him  ever since i have been here i have been very hard at work often getting up at daybreak to write through many hours i have never had the least return of illness thank god though i was so altered in a week when i came here that i doubt if you would have known me i am redder and browner than ever at the present writing with the addition of a rather formidable and fierce moustache lowestoft i know by walking over there from yarmouth when i went down on an exploring expedition previous to copperfield it is a fine place i saw the name blunderstone on a directionpost between it and yarmouth and took it from the said directionpost for the book we imagined the captains ecstasies when we saw the birth of his child in the papers in some of the descriptions of chesney wold i have taken many bits chiefly about trees and shadows from observations made at rockingham i wonder whether you have ever thought so i shall hope to hear from you again soon and shall not fail to write again before i go away there seems to be nothing but i in this letter but i know my dear friend that you will be more interested in that letter in the present connection than in any other i could take from the alphabet  catherine and georgina send their kindest loves and more messages than this little sheet would hold if i were to give you a hint of what we feel at the sight of your handwriting and at the receipt of a word from yourself about yourself and the dear boys and the precious little girls i should begin to be sorrowful which is rather the tendency of my mind at the close of another long book i heard from cerjat two or three days since goff bythebye lived in this house two years                  ever my dear mrs watson

told wills when i left home that i was quite pained to see the end of your excellent bowl of punch altered i was unaffectedly touched and gratified by the heartiness of the original and saw no earthly celestial or subterranean objection to its remaining as it did not so unmistakably apply to me as to necessitate the observance of my usual precaution in the case of such references by any means  thirdly if you ever have a holiday that you dont know what to do with do come and pass a little time here we live in a charming garden in a very pleasant country and should be delighted to receive you excellent light wines on the premises french cookery millions of roses two cows for milk punch vegetables cut for the pot and handed in at the kitchen window five summerhouses fifteen fountains with no water in em and thirtyseven clocks keeping as i conceive australian time having no reference whatever to the hours on this side of the globe  i know my dear cunningham that the british nation can ill afford to lose you and that when the audit office mice are away the cats of that great public establishment will play but pray consider that the bow may be sometimes bent too long and that everarduous application even in patriotic service is to be avoided no one can more highly estimate your devotion to the best interests of britain than i but i wish to see it tempered with a wise consideration for your own amusement recreation and pastime all work and no play may make peter a dull boy as well as jack and if i may claim the privilege of friendship to remonstrate i would say that you do not take enough time for your meals dinner for instance you habitually neglect believe me this rustic repose will do you good winkles also are to be obtained in these parts and it is well remarked by poor richard that a bird in the handbook is worth two in the bush                                                   ever cordially yours   sidenote mr walter savage landor

name with such generous mention on such a noble place in your great book i believe he has told you already that i wrote to him from boulogne not knowing what to do as i had not received the precious volume and feared you might have some plan of sending it to me with which my premature writing would interfere  you know how heartily and inexpressibly i prize what you have written to me or you never would have selected me for such a distinction i could never thank you enough my dear landor and i will not thank you in words any more believe me i receive the dedication like a great dignity the worth of which i hope i thoroughly know the queen could give me none in exchange that i wouldnt laughingly snap my fingers at  we are staying at boulogne until the 10th of october when i go into italy until christmas and the rest come home  kate and georgina would send you their best loves if they were here and would never leave off talking about it if i went back and told them i had written to you

again though i have great misgivings that he will lose his eldest boy before he can be got to india  mrs dickens and her sister are proud of your message and beg their kind regards to be forwarded in return my other half being particularly comforted and encouraged by your account of mr gibson in this charge i am to include mrs delane who i hope will make an exchange of remembrances and give me hers for mine  i never saw anything so ridiculous as this place at present they expected the emperor ten or twelve days ago and put up all manner of triumphal arches made of evergreens which look like tealeaves now and will take a withered and weird appearance hardly to be foreseen long before the twentyfifth when the visit is vaguely expected to come off in addition to these faded garlands all over the leading streets there are painted eagles hoisted over gateways and sprawling across a hundred ways which have been washed out by the rain and are now being blistered by the sun until they look horribly ludicrous and a number of our benighted compatriots who came over to see a perfect blaze of fêtes go wandering among these shrivelled preparations and staring at ten thousand flagpoles without any flags upon them with a kind of indignant curiosity and personal injury quite irresistible with many thanks                                                  very faithfully yours   sidenote mr w h wills                                   boulogne sunday sept 18th 1853  my dear wills                                courier  edward kaub will bring this he turned up yesterday accounting for his delay by waiting for a written recommendation and having at the last moment as a foreigner not being an englishman a passport to get i quite agree with you as to his appearance and manner and have engaged him it strikes me that it would be an excellent beginning if you would deliver him a neat and appropriate address telling him what in your conscience you can find to tell of me favourably as a master and particularly impressing upon him readiness and punctuality on his part as the great things to be observed i think it would have a much better effect than anything i could say in this stage if said from yourself but i shall be much obliged to you if you will act upon this hint forthwith                              w h wills  no letter having arrived from the popular author of the larboard fin15 by this mornings post i rather think one must be on the way in the pocket of gordons son if kaub calls for this before young scotland arrives you will understand if i do not herein refer to an unreceived letter but i shall leave this open until kaub comes for it                                                        ever faithfully   sidenote the lord john russell                   villa des moulineaux boulogne                                         wednesday sept 21st 1853  my dear lord  your note having been forwarded to me here i cannot forbear thanking you with all my heart for your great kindness mr forster had previously sent me a copy of your letter to him together with the expression of the high and lasting gratification he had in your handsome response i know he feels it most sincerely  i became the prey of a perfect spasm of sensitive twinges when i found that the close of bleak house had not penetrated to the wilds of the north when your letter left those parts i was so very much interested in it myself when i wrote it here last month that i have a fond sort of faith in its interesting its readers but for the hope that you may have got it by this time i should refuse comfort that supports me  the book has been a wonderful success its audience enormous  i fear there is not much chance of my being able to execute any little commission for lady john anywhere in italy but i am going across the alps leaving here on the tenth of next month and returning home to london for christmas day and should indeed be happy if i could do her any dwarf service  you will be interested i think to hear that poole lives happily on his pension and lives within it he is quite incapable of any mental exertion and what he would have done without it i cannot imagine i send it to him at paris every quarter it is something even amid the estimation in which you are held which is but a foreshadowing of what shall be byandby as the people advance to be so gratefully remembered as he with the best reason remembers you forgive my saying this but the manner of that transaction no less than the matter is always fresh in my memory in association with your name and i cannot help it                              my dear lord                                     yours very faithfully and obliged   sidenote the hon mrs watson                                boulogne wednesday sept 21st 1853  my dear mrs watson  the courier was unfortunately engaged he offered to recommend another but i had several applicants and begged mr wills to hold a grand review at the household words office and select the man who is to bring me down as his victim i am extremely sorry the man you recommend was not to be had i should have been so delighted to take him  i am finishing the childs history and clearing the way through household words in general before i go on my trip i forget whether i told you that mr egg the painter and mr collins are going with me the other day i was in town in case you should not have heard of the condition of that deserted village i think it worth mentioning all the streets of any note were unpaved mountains high and all the omnibuses were sliding down alleys and looking into the upper windows of small houses at eleven oclock one morning i was positively alone in bond street i went to one of my tailors and he was at brighton a smuttyfaced woman among some gorgeous regimentals half finished had not the least idea when he would be back i went to another of my tailors and he was in an upper room with open windows and surrounded by mignonette boxes playing the piano in the bosom of his family i went to my hosiers and two of the least presentable of the young men of that elegant establishment were playing at draughts in the back shop likewise i beheld a porterpot hastily concealed under a turkish dressinggown of a golden pattern i then went wandering about to look for some ingenious portmanteau and near the corner of st jamess street saw a solitary being sitting in a trunkshop absorbed in a book which on a close inspection i found to be bleak house i thought this looked well and went in and he really was more interested in seeing me when he knew who i was than any face i had seen in any house every house i knew being occupied by painters including my own i went to the athenæum that same night to get my dinner and it was shut up for repairs i went home late and had forgotten the key and was locked out  preparations were made here about six weeks ago to receive the emperor who is not come yet meanwhile our countrymen deluded in the first excitement go about staring at these arrangements with a personal injury upon them which is most ridiculous and they will persist in speaking an unknown tongue to the french people who will speak english to them  kate and georgina send their kindest loves we are all quite well going to drop two small boys here at school with a former eton tutor highly recommended to me charley was heard of a day or two ago he says his professor is very shortsighted always in green spectacles always drinking weak beer always smoking a pipe and always at work the last qualification seems to appear to charley the most astonishing one                          ever my dear mrs watson                                             most affectionately yours   sidenote miss hogarth                   hotel de la villa milan tuesday oct 25th 1853  my dear georgy  i have walked to that extent in switzerland walked over the simplon on sunday as an addition to the other feats that one pair of the new strong shoes has gone to be mended this morning and the other is in but a poor way the snow having played the mischief with them  on the swiss side of the simplon we slept at the beastliest little town in the wildest kind of house where some fifty cats tumbled into the corridor outside our bedrooms all at once in the middle of the nightwhether through the roof or not i dont know for it was dark when we got upand made such a horrible and terrific noise that we started out of our beds in a panic i strongly objected to opening the door lest they should get into the room and tear at us but edward opened his and laid about him until he dispersed them at domo dossola we had three immense bedrooms eggs bed twelve feet wide and a sala of imperceptible extent in the dim light of two candles and a wood fire but were very well and very cheaply entertained here we are as you know housed in the greatest comfort  we continue to get on very well together we really do admirably i lose no opportunity of inculcating the lesson that it is of no use to be out of temper in travelling and it is very seldom wanted for any of us egg is an excellent fellow and full of good qualities i am sure a generous and staunch man at heart and a good and honourable nature  i shall send catherine from genoa a list of the places where letters will find me i shall hope to hear from you too and shall be very glad indeed to do so no more at present                                               ever most affectionately   sidenote miss hogarth                     croce di malta genoa saturday oct 29th 1853  my dearest georgy  we had thirtyone hours consecutively on the road between this and milan and arrived here in a rather damaged condition we live at the top of this immense house overlooking the port and sea pleasantly and airily enough though it is no joke to get so high and though the apartment is rather vast and faded  the old walks are pretty much the same as ever except that they have built behind the peschiere on the san bartolomeo hill and changed the whole town towards san pietro darena where we seldom went the bisagno looks just the same strong just now and with very little water in it vicoli stink exactly as they used to and are fragrant with the same old flavour of very rotten cheese kept in very hot blankets the mezzaro pervades them as before the old jesuit college in the strada nuova is under the present government the hôtel de ville and a very splendid caffé with a terrace garden has arisen between it and palavicinis old palace another new and handsome caffé has been built in the piazza carlo felice between the old caffé of the bei arti where fletcher stopped for the bouquets in the green times when we went to the s party and the strada carlo felice the old beastly gate and guardhouse on the albaro road are still in their dear old beastly state and the whole of that road is just as it was the man without legs is still in the strada nuova but the beggars in general are all cleared off and our old onearmed belisario made a sudden evaporation a year or two ago i am going to the peschiere today the puppets are here and the opera is open but only with a buffo company and without a buffet we went to the scala where they did an opera of verdis called il trovatore and a poor enough ballet the whole performance miserable indeed i wish you were here to take some of the old walks it is quite strange to walk about alone goodbye my dear georgy pray tell me how kate is i rather fancy from her letter though i scarcely know why that she is not quite as well as she was at boulogne i was charmed with your account of the plornishghenter and everything and everybody else kiss them all for me                                         ever most affectionately yours   sidenote miss hogarth                        hÔtel des Étrangers naples                                        friday night nov 4th 1853  my dearest georgy  instead of embarking on monday at genoa we were delayed in consequence of the boats being a day later when there are thirtyone days in the month until tuesday going aboard that morning at halfpast nine we found the steamer more than full of passengers from marseilles and in a state of confusion not to be described we could get no places at the table got our dinners how we could on deck had no berths or sleeping accommodation of any kind and had paid heavy firstclass fares to add to this we got to leghorn too late to steam away again that night getting the ships papers examined firstas the authorities said so not being favourable to the new express english ship english officeredand we lay off the lighthouse all night long the scene on board beggars description ladies on the tables gentlemen under the tables and ladies and gentlemen lying indiscriminately on the open deck arrayed like spoons on a sideboard no mattresses no blankets nothing towards midnight attempts were made by means of an awning and flags to make this latter scene remotely approach an australian encampment and we three lay together on the bare planks covered with overcoats we were all gradually dozing off when a perfectly tropical rain fell and in a moment drowned the whole ship the rest of the night was passed upon the stairs with an immense jumble of men and women when anybody came up for any purpose we all fell down and when anybody came down we all fell up again still the goodhumour in the english part of the passengers was quite extraordinary there were excellent officers aboard and the first mate lent me his cabin to wash in in the morning which i afterwards lent to egg and collins then we and the emerson tennents who were aboard and the captain the doctor and the second officer went off on a jaunt together to pisa as the ship was to lie at leghorn all day  the captain was a capital fellow but i led him facetiously such a life all day that i got almost everything altered at night emerson tennent with the greatest kindness turned his son out of his state room who indeed volunteered to go in the most amiable manner and i got a good bed there the storeroom down by the hold was opened for egg and collins and they slept with the moist sugar the cheese in cut the spices the cruets the apples and pearsin a perfect chandlers shop in company with what the s would call a hold gentwho had been so horribly wet through overnight that his condition frightened the authoritiesa cat and the stewardwho dozed in an armchair and all night long fell headforemost once in every five minutes on egg who slept on the counter or dresser last night i had the stewards own cabin opening on deck all to myself it had been previously occupied by some desolate lady who went ashore at civita vecchia there was little or no sea thank heaven all the trip but the rain was heavier than any i have ever seen and the lightning very constant and vivid we were with the crew some two hundred people with boats at the utmost stretch for one hundred perhaps i could not help thinking what would happen if we met with any accident the crew being chiefly maltese and evidently fellows who would cut off alone in the largest boat on the least alarm the speed it being the crack express ship for the india mail very high also the running through all the narrow rocky channels thank god however here we are though the more sensible and experienced part of the passengers agreed with me this morning that it was not a thing to try often we had an excellent table after the first day the best wines and so forth and the captain and i swore eternal friendship ditto the first officer and the majority of the passengers we got into the bay about seven this morning but could not land until noon we towed from civita vecchia the entire greek navy i believe consisting of a little brigofwar with great guns fitted as a steamer but disabled by having burst the bottom of her boiler in her first run she was just big enough to carry the captain and a crew of six or so but the captain was so covered with buttons and gold that there never would have been room for him on board to put these valuables away if he hadnt worn them which he consequently did all night  whenever anything was wanted to be done as slackening the towrope or anything of that sort our officers roared at this miserable potentate in violent english through a speakingtrumpet of which he couldnt have understood a word under the most favourable circumstances so he did all the wrong things first and the right things always last the absence of any knowledge of anything not english on the part of the officers and stewards was most ridiculous i met an italian gentleman on the cabin steps yesterday morning vainly endeavouring to explain that he wanted a cup of tea for his sick wife and when we were coming out of the harbour at genoa and it was necessary to order away that boat of music you remember the chief officer called aft for the purpose as knowing something of italian delivered himself in this explicit and clear manner to the principal performer now signora if you dont sheer off youll be run down so you had better trice up that guitar of yours and put about  we get on as well as possible and it is extremely pleasant and interesting and i feel that the change is doing me great and real service after a long continuous strain upon the mind but i am pleased to think that we are at our farthest point and i look forward with joy to coming home again to my old room and the old walks and all the old pleasant things  i wish i had arranged or could have done sofor it would not have been easyto find some letters here it is a blank to stay for five days in a place without any  i dont think edward knows fifty italian words but much more french is spoken in italy now than when we were here and he stumbles along somehow  i am afraid this is a dull letter for i am very tired you must take the will for the deed my dear and good night                                               ever most affectionately   sidenote miss hogarth                                  rome sunday night nov 13th 1853  my dearest georgy  we arrived here yesterday afternoon at between three and four on sending to the postoffice this morning i received your pleasant little letter and one from miss coutts who is still at paris but to my amazement there was none from catherine you mention her writing and i cannot but suppose that your two letters must have been posted together however i received none from her and i have all manner of doubts respecting the plainness of its direction they will not produce the letters here as at genoa but persist in looking them out at the postoffice for you i shall send again tomorrow and every day until friday when we leave here if i find no letter from her tomorrow i shall write to her nevertheless by that post which brings this so that you may both hear from me together  one night at naples edward came in openmouthed to the table dhôte where we were dining with the tennents to announce the marchese garofalo i at first thought it must be the little parrotmarquess who was once your escort from genoa but i found him to be a man married to an englishwoman whom we used to meet at ridgways he was very glad to see me and i afterwards met him at dinner at mr lowthers our chargé daffaires mr lowther was at the rockingham play and is a very agreeable fellow we had an exceedingly pleasant dinner of eight preparatory to which i was near having the ridiculous adventure of not being able to find the house and coming back dinnerless i went in an open carriage from the hotel in all state and the coachman to my surprise pulled up at the end of the chiaja behold the house says he of il signor larthoorat the same time pointing with his whip into the seventh heaven where the early stars were shining but the signor larthoor returns the inimitable darling lives at pausilippo it is true says the coachman still pointing to the evening star but he lives high up the salita sant antonio where no carriage ever yet ascended and that is the house evening star as aforesaid and one must go on foot behold the salita sant antonio i went up it a mile and a half i should think i got into the strangest places among the wildest neapolitanskitchens washingplaces archways stables vineyardswas baited by dogs answered in profoundly unintelligible neapolitan from behind lonely locked doors in cracked female voices quaking with fear could hear of no such englishman or any englishman byandby i came upon a polentashop in the clouds where an old frenchman with an umbrella like a faded tropical leaf it had not rained for six weeks was staring at nothing at all with a snuffbox in his hand to him i appealed concerning the signor larthoor sir said he with the sweetest politeness can you speak french sir said i a little sir said he i presume the signor loothereyou will observe that he changed the name according to the custom of his countryis an englishman i admitted that he was the victim of circumstances and had that misfortune sir said he one word more has he a servant with a wooden leg great heaven sir said i how do i know i should think not but it is possible it is always said the frenchman possible almost all the things of the world are always possible sir said iyou may imagine my condition and dismal sense of my own absurdity by this timethat is true he then took an immense pinch of snuff wiped the dust off his umbrella led me to an arch commanding a wonderful view of the bay of naples and pointed deep into the earth from which i had mounted below there near the lamp one finds an englishman with a servant with a wooden leg it is always possible that he is the signor loothere i had been asked at six and it was now getting on for seven i went down again in a state of perspiration and misery not to be described and without the faintest hope of finding the place but as i was going down to the lamp i saw the strangest staircase up a dark corner with a man in a whitewaistcoat evidently hired standing on the top of it fuming i dashed in at a venture found it was the place made the most of the whole story and was indescribably popular the best of it was that as nobody ever did find the place he had put a servant at the bottom of the salita to wait for an english gentleman the servant as he presently pleaded deceived by the moustache had allowed the english gentleman to pass unchallenged  the night before we left naples we were at the san carlo where with the verdi rage of our old genoa time they were again doing the trovatore it seemed rubbish on the whole to me but was very fairly done i think la tenco the prima donna will soon be a great hit in london she is a very remarkable singer and a fine actress to the best of my judgment on such premises there seems to be no opera here at present there was a festa in st peters today and the pope passed to the cathedral in state we were all there  we leave here please god on friday morning and post to florence in three days and a half we came here by vetturino upon the whole the roadside inns are greatly improved since our time halfpast three and halfpast four have been however our usual times of rising on the road  i was in my old place at the coliseum this morning and it was as grand as ever with that exception the ruined part of romethe real original romelooks smaller than my remembrance made it it is the only place on which i have yet found that effect we are in the old hotel  you are going to bonchurch i suppose will be there perhaps when this letter reaches you i shall be pleased to think of you as at home again and making the commodious family mansion look natural and homelike i dont like to think of my room without anybody to peep into it now and then here is a world of travelling arrangements for me to settle and here are collins and egg looking sideways at me with an occasional imploring glance as beseeching me to settle it so i leave off goodnight                            ever my dearest georgy

tennent  as i never made a good bargain in my lifeexcept once when on going abroad i let my house on excellent terms to an admirable tenant who never paid anythingi sent edward into the casa dies yesterday morning while i invested the premises from the outside and carefully surveyed them it is a very clean large brightlooking house at the corner of the via gregoriana not exactly in a part of rome i should pick out for living in and on what i should be disposed to call the wrong side of the street however this is not to the purpose signor dies has no idea of letting an apartment for a short timescouted the idea of a monthsignified that he could not be brought to the contemplation of two monthswas by no means clear that he could come down to the consideration of three this of course settled the business speedily  this hotel is no longer kept by the melloni i spoke of but is even better kept than in his time and is a very admirable house i have engaged a small apartment for you to be ready on thursday afternoon at two piastres and a halftwoandahalf per daysittingroom and three bedrooms one doublebedded and two not if you would like to change to ours which is a very good one on friday morning you can of course do so as our diningroom is large and there is no table dhôte here i will order dinner in it for our united parties at six on thursday you will be able to decide how to arrange for the remainder of your stay after being here and looking about youtwo really necessary considerations in rome  pray make my kind regards to lady tennent and miss tennent and your good son who became homeless for my sake mr egg and mr collins desire to be also remembered  it has been beautiful weather since we left naples until today when it rains in a very dogged sullen downcast and determined manner we have been speculating at breakfast on the possibility of its raining in a similar manner at naples and of your wandering about the hotel refusing consolation  i grieve to report the orvieto considerably damaged by the general vine failure but still far from despicable montefiascone the est wine you know is to be had here and we have had one bottle in the very finest condition and one in a secondrate state  the coliseum in its magnificent old decay is as grand as ever and with the electric telegraph darting through one of its ruined arches like a sunbeam and piercing direct through its cruel old heart is even grander                               believe me always very faithfully yours   sidenote mrs charles dickens                                        rome monday nov 14th 1853  my dearest catherine  as i have mentioned in my letter to georgy written last night but posted with this i received her letter without yours to my unbounded astonishment this morning on sending again to the postoffice i at last got yours and most welcome it is with all its contents  i found layard at naples who went up vesuvius with us and was very merry and agreeable he is travelling with lord and lady somers and lord somers being laid up with an attack of malaria fever layard had a day to spare craven who was lord normanbys secretary of legation in paris now lives at naples and is married to a french lady he is very hospitable and hearty and seemed to have vague ideas that something might be done in a pretty little private theatre he has in his house he told me of fanny kemble and the sartoriss being here i have also heard of thackerays being herei dont know how truly lockhart is here and i fear very ill i mean to go and see him  we are living in the old hotel which is not now kept by meloni who has retired i dont know whether you recollect an apartment at the top of the house to which we once ran up with poor roche to see the horses start in the race at the carnival time that is ours in which i at present write we have a large back diningroom a handsome front drawingroom looking into the piazza del popolo and three front bedrooms all on a floor the whole costs us about four shillings a day each the hotel is better kept than ever there is a little kitchen to each apartment where the dinner is kept hot there is no house comparable to it in paris and it is better than mivarts we start for florence post on friday morning and i am bargaining for a carriage to take us on to venice  edward is an excellent servant and always cheerful and ready for his work he knows no italian except the names of a few things but french is far more widely known here now than in our time neither is he an experienced courier as to roads and so forth but he picks up all that i want to know here and there somehow or other i am perfectly pleased with him and would rather have him than an older hand poor dear roche comes back to my mind though often  i have written to engage the courier from turin into france from tuesday the 6th december this will bring us home some two days after the tenth probably i wrote to charley from naples giving him his choice of meeting me at lyons in paris or at boulogne i gave him full instructions what to do if he arrived before me and he will write to me at turin saying where i shall find him i shall be a day or so later than i supposed as the nearest calculation i could make when i wrote to him but his waiting for me at an hotel will not matter  we have had delightful weather with one days exception until today when it rained very heavily and suddenly egg and collins have gone to the vatican and i am going to try whether i can hit out anything for the christmas number give my love to forster and tell him i wont write to him until i hear from him  i have not come across any english whom i know except layard and the emerson tennents who will be here on thursday from civita vecchia and are to dine with us the losses up to this point have been two pairs of shoes one mine and one eggs collinss snuffbox and eggs dressinggown  we observe the managerial punctuality in all our arrangements and have not had any difference whatever  i have been reserving this side all through my letter in the conviction that i had something else to tell you if i had i cannot remember what it is i introduced myself to salvatore at vesuvius and reminded him of the night when poor le gros fell down the mountains he was full of interest directly remembered the very hole put on his goldbanded cap and went up with us himself he did not know that le gros was dead and was very sorry to hear it he asked after the ladies and hoped they were very happy to which i answered very the cone is completely changed since our visit is not at all recognisable as the same place and there is no fire from the mountain though there is a great deal of smoke its last demonstration was in 1850  i shall be glad to think of your all being at home again as i suppose you will be soon after the receipt of this will you see to the invitations for christmas day and write to lætitia i shall be very happy to be at home again myself and to embrace you for of course i miss you very much though i feel that i could not have done a better thing to clear my mind and freshen it up again than make this expedition if i find charley much ahead of me i shall start on through a night or so to meet him and leave the others to catch us up i look upon the journey as almost closed at turin my best love to mamey and katey and sydney and harry and the darling plornishghenter we often talk about them and both my companions do so with interest they always send all sorts of messages to you which i never deliver god bless you take care of yourself                                               ever most affectionately   sidenote mr w h wills                            rome thursday afternoon nov 17th 1853  my dear wills  just as i wrote the last words of the enclosed little story for the christmas number just now edward brought in your letter also one from forster tell him which i have not yet opened i will write againand write to himfrom florence i am delighted to have news of you  the enclosed little paper for the christmas number is in a character that nobody else is likely to hit and which is pretty sure to be considered pleasant let forster have the ms with the proof and i know he will correct it to the minutest point i have a notion of another little story also for the christmas number if i can do it at venice i will and send it straight on but it is not easy to work under these circumstances in travelling we generally get up about three and in resting we are perpetually roaming about in all manner of places not to mention my being laid hold of by all manner of people  keep household words imaginative is the solemn and continual conductorial injunction delighted to hear of mrs gaskells contributions  yes by all manner of means to lady holland will you ask her whether she has sydney smiths letters to me which i placed at mrs smiths request either in mrs smiths own hands or in mrs austins i cannot remember which but i think the latter  in making up the christmas number dont consider my paper or papers with any reference saving to where they will fall best i have no liking in the case for any particular place  all perfectly well companion moustaches particularly eggs dismal in the extreme kindest regards to mrs wills                                                        ever faithfully   sidenote mr w h wills                                    florence monday nov 21st 1853                                 h w  my dear wills  i sent you by post from rome on wednesday last a little story for the christmas number called the schoolboys story i have an idea of another short one to be called nobodys story which i hope to be able to do at venice and to send you straight home before this month is out i trust you have received the first safely  edward continues to do extremely well he is always early and late what you have seen him he is a very steady fellow a little too bashful for a courier even settles prices of everything now as soon as we come into an hotel and improves fast his knowledge of italian is painfully defective and in the midst of a howling crowd at a posthouse or railway station this deficiency perfectly stuns him i was obliged last night to get out of the carriage and pluck him from a crowd of porters who were putting our baggage into wrong conveyancesby cursing and ordering about in all directions i should think about ten substantives the names of ten common objects form his whole italian stock it matters very little at the hotels where a great deal of french is spoken now but on the road if none of his party knew italian it would be a very serious inconvenience indeed  will you write to ryland if you have not heard from him and ask him what the birmingham readingnights are really to be for it is ridiculous enough that i positively dont know cant a saturday night in a truck district or a sunday morning among the ironworkers a fine subject be knocked out in the course of the same visit  if you should see any managing man you know in the oriental and peninsular company i wish you would very gravely mention to him from me that if they are not careful what they are about with their steamship valetta between marseilles and naples they will suddenly find that they will receive a blow one fine day in the times which it will be a very hard matter for them ever to recover when i sailed in her from genoa there had been taken on board with no caution in most cases from the agent or hint of discomfort at least forty people of both sexes for whom there was no room whatever i am a pretty old traveller as you know but i never saw anything like the manner in which pretty women were compelled to lie among the men in the great cabin and on the bare decks the good humour was beyond all praise but the natural indignation very great and i was repeatedly urged to stand up for the public in household words and to write a plain description of the facts to the times if i had done either and merely mentioned that all these people paid heavy firstclass fares i will answer for it that they would have been beaten off the station in a couple of months i did neither because i was the best of friends with the captain and all the officers and never saw such a fine set of men so admirable in the discharge of their duty and so zealous to do their best by everybody it is impossible to praise them too highly but there is a strong desire at all the ports along the coast to throw impediments in the way of the english service and to favour the french and italian boats in those boats which i know very well great care is taken of the passengers and the accommodation is very good if the peninsula and oriental add to all this the risk of such an exposure as they are certain to get if they go on so in the times they are dead sure to get a blow from the public which will make them stagger again i say nothing of the number of the passengers and the room in the ships boats though the frightful consideration the contrast presented must have been in more minds than mine i speak only of the taking people for whom there is no sort of accommodation as the most decided swindle and the coolest i ever did with my eyes behold          kindest regards from fellowtravellers                                 ever my dear wills faithfully yours   sidenote miss hogarth                                  venice friday november 25th 1853  my dearest georgy  we found an english carriage from padua at florence and hired it to bring it back again we travelled post with four horses all the way from padua to this place there is a railroad and travelled all night we left florence at halfpast six in the morning and got to padua at eleven next dayyesterday the cold at night was most intense i dont think i have ever felt it colder but our carriage was very comfortable and we had some wine and some rum to keep us warm we came by bologna where we had tea and ferrara you may imagine the delays in the night when i tell you that each of our passports after receiving six visés at florence received in the course of the one night nine more every one of which was written and sealed somebody being slowly knocked out of bed to do it every time it really was excruciating  landor had sent me a letter to his son and on the day before we left florence i thought i would go out to fiesoli and leave it so i got a little onehorse open carriage and drove off alone we were within half a mile of the villa landoro and were driving down a very narrow lane like one of those at albaro when i saw an elderly lady coming towards us very well dressed in silk of the queens blue and walking freshly and briskly against the wind at a good round pace it was a bright cloudless very cold day and i thought she walked with great spirit as if she enjoyed it i also thought perhaps that was having him in my mind that her ruddy face was shaped like landors all of a sudden the coachman pulls up and looks enquiringly at me whats the matter says i ecco la signora landoro says he for the love of heaven dont stop says i i dont know her i am only going to the house to leave a lettergo on meanwhile she still coming on looked at me and i looked at her and we were both a good deal confused and so went our several ways altogether i think it was as disconcerting a meeting as i ever took part in and as odd a one under any other circumstances i should have introduced myself but the separation made the circumstances so peculiar that i didnt like  the plornishghenter is evidently the greatest noblest finest cleverest brightest and most brilliant of boys your account of him is most delightful and i hope to find another letter from you somewhere on the road making me informed of his demeanour on your return on which occasion as on every other i have no doubt he will have distinguished himself as an irresistibly attracting captivating mayroontigroonter give him a good many kisses for me i quite agree with syd as to his ideas of paying attention to the old gentleman its not bad but deficient in originality the usual deficiency of an inferior intellect with so great a model before him i am very curious to see whether the plorn remembers me on my reappearance  i meant to have gone to work this morning and to have tried a second little story for the christmas number of household words but my letters have most pleasantly put me out and i defer all such wise efforts until tomorrow egg and collins are out in a gondola with a servitore di piazza  you will find this but a stupid letter but i really have no news we go to the opera whenever there is one see sights eat and drink sleep in a natural manner two or three nights and move on again edward was a little crushed at padua yesterday he had been extraordinarily cold all night in the rumble and had got out our clothes to dress and i think must have been projecting a five or six hours sleep when i announced that he was to come on here in an hour and a half to get the rooms and order dinner he fell into a sudden despondency of the profoundest kind but was quite restored when we arrived here between eight and nine we found him waiting at the custom house with a gondola in his usual brisk condition  it is extraordinary how few english we see with the exception of a gentlemanly young fellow in a consumption i am afraid married to the tiniest little girl in a brown straw hat and travelling with his sister and her sister and a consumptive single lady travelling with a maid and a scotch terrier christened trotty veck we have scarcely seen any and have certainly spoken to none since we left switzerland these were aboard the valetta where the captain and i indulged in all manner of insane suppositions concerning the straw hatthe little matron we called her by which name she soon became known all over the ship the day we entered rome and the moment we entered it there was the little matron alone with antiquityand murrayon the wall the very first church i entered there was the little matron on the last afternoon when i went alone to st peters there was the little matron and her party the best of it is that i was extremely intimate with them invited them to tavistock house when they come home in the spring and have not the faintest idea of their name  there was no table dhôte at rome or at florence but there is one here and we dine at it today so perhaps we may stumble upon somebody i have heard from charley this morning who appoints wisely paris as our place of meeting i had a letter from coote at florence informing me that his volume of household songs was ready and requesting permission to dedicate it to me which of course i gave  i am beginning to think of the birmingham readings i suppose you wont object to be taken to hear them this is the last place at which we shall make a stay of more than one day we shall stay at parma one and at turin one supposing de la rue to have been successful in taking places with the courier into france for the day on which we want them he was to write to bankers at turin to do it and then we shall come hard and fast home i feel almost there already and shall be delighted to close the pleasant trip and get back to my own piccola cameraif being english you understand what that is my best love and kisses to mamey katey sydney harry and the noble plorn last not least to yourself and many of them i will not wait over tomorrow tell kate for her letter but will write then whether or no                              ever my dearest georgy                                             most affectionately yours   sidenote mr marcus stone                                 tavistock house december 19th 1853  my dear marcus  you made an excellent sketch from a book of mine which i have received and have preserved with great pleasure will you accept from me in remembrance of it this little book i believe it to be true though it may be sometimes not as genteel as history has a habit of being                                                       faithfully yours  footnote  15 meaning mr w h wills himself     1854  narrative   the summer of this year was also spent at boulogne m beaucourt being again the landlord but the house though still on the same property stood on the top of the hill above the moulineaux and was called the villa du camp de droite  in the early part of the year charles dickens paid several visits to the english provinces giving readings from his books at many of the large manufacturing towns and always for some good and charitable purpose  he was still at work upon hard times which was finished during the summer and was constantly occupied with household words many of our letters for this year are to the contributors to this journal the last is an unusually interesting one he had for some time past been much charmed with the writings of a certain miss berwick who he knew to be a contributor under a feigned name when at last the lady confided her real name and he discovered in the young poetess the daughter of his dear friends mr16 and mrs procter the new sensation caused him intense surprise and the greatest pleasure and delight miss adelaide procter was from this time a frequent contributor to household words more especially to the christmas numbers  there are really very few letters in this year requiring any explanation from usmany explaining themselves and many having allusion to incidents in the past year which have been duly noted by us for 1853  the portrait mentioned in the letter to mr collins for which he was sitting to mr e m ward ra was to be one of a series of oil sketches of the then celebrated literary men of the day in their studies we believe this portrait to be now in the possession of mrs ward  in explanation of the letter to mr john saunders on the subject of the production of the latters play called loves martyrdom we will give the dramatists own words          having printed for private circulation a play         entitled loves martyrdom and for which i         desired to obtain the independent judgment of         some of our most eminent literary men before         seeking the ordeal of the stage i sent a copy         to mr dickens and the letter in question is         his acknowledgment                                               he immediately took steps for the introduction         of the play to the theatre at first he         arranged with mr phelps of sadlers wells         but subsequently with that gentlemans         consent removed it to the haymarket there it         was played with miss helen faucit in the         character of margaret miss swanborough who         shortly after married and left the stage as         julia mr barry sullivan as franklyn and mr         howe as laneham          as far as the play itself was concerned it         was received on all sides as a genuine dramatic         and poetic success achieved however as an         eminent critic came to my box to say through         greater difficulties than he had ever before         seen a dramatic work pass through the time has         not come for me to speak freely of these but i         may point to two of them the first being the         inadequate rehearsals which caused mr dickens         to tell me on the stage four or five days only         before the first performance that the play was         not then in as good a state as it would have         been in at paris three weeks earlier the other         was the breakdown of the performer of a most         important secondary part a collapse so         absolute that he was changed by the management         before the second representation of the piece  this illluck of the beginning pursued the play to its close          the haymarket theatre was at the time in the         very lowest state of prostration through the         crimean war the habitual frequenters were         lovers of comedy and enjoyers of farce and         burlesque and there was neither the money nor         the faith to call to the theatre by the usual         methods vigorously and discriminatingly         pursued the multitudes that i believed could         have been so called to a better and more         romantic class of comedy          even under these and other similarly         depressing circumstances the nightly receipts         were about £60 the expenses being £80 and on         the lastan authorsnight there was an         excellent and enthusiastic house yielding to         the best of my recollection about £140 but         certainly between £120 and £140 and with that         nightthe sixth or sevenththe experiment         ended   sidenote mr walter savage landor                                   tavistock house january 7th 1854  my dear landor  i heartily assure you that to have your name coupled with anything i have done is an honour and a pleasure to me i cannot say that i am sorry that you should have thought it necessary to write to me for it is always delightful to me to see your hand and to know though i want no outward and visible sign as an assurance of the fact that you are ever the same generous earnest gallant man  catherine and georgina send their kind loves so does walter landor who came home from school with high judicial commendation and a prize into the bargain                             ever my dear landor affectionately yours   sidenote the hon mrs watson                          tavistock house friday january 13th 1854  my dear mrs watson  on the very day after i sent the christmas number to rockingham i heard of your being at brighton i should have sent another there but that i had a misgiving i might seem to be making too much of it for when i thought of the probability of the rockingham copy going on to brighton and pictured to myself the advent of two of those very large envelopes at once at junction house at breakfast time a sort of comic modesty overcame me i was heartily pleased with the birmingham audience which was a very fine one i never saw nor do i suppose anybody ever did such an interesting sight as the working peoples night there were two thousand five hundred of them there and a more delicately observant audience it is impossible to imagine they lost nothing misinterpreted nothing followed everything closely laughed and cried with most delightful earnestness and animated me to that extent that i felt as if we were all bodily going up into the clouds together it is an enormous place for the purpose but i had considered all that carefully and i believe made the most distant person hear as well as if i had been reading in my own room i was a little doubtful before i began on the first night whether it was quite practicable to conceal the requisite effort but i soon had the satisfaction of finding that it was and that we were all going on together in the first page as easily to all appearance as if we had been sitting round the fire  i am obliged to go out on monday at five and to dine out but i will be at home at any time before that hour that you may appoint you say you are only going to stay one night in town but if you could stay two and would dine with us alone on tuesday that is the plan that we should all like best let me have one word from you by post on monday morning few things that i saw when i was away took my fancy so much as the electric telegraph piercing like a sunbeam right through the cruel old heart of the coliseum at rome and on the summit of the alps among the eternal ice and snow there it was still with its posts sustained against the sweeping mountain winds by clusters of great beamsto say nothing of its being at the bottom of the sea as we crossed the channel with kindest loves                               ever my dear mrs watson

himself upon the mercy of the court he humbly represents that his usual hour for getting up in the course of his travels was three oclock in the morning and his usual hour for going to bed nine or ten the next night that the places in which he chiefly deviated from these rules of hardship were rome and venice and that at those cities of fame he shut himself up in solitude and wrote christmas papers for the incomparable publication known as household words that his correspondence at all times arising out of the business of the said household words alone was very heavy that his offence though undoubtedly committed was unavoidable and that a nominal punishment will meet the justice of the case  we had only three bad days out of the whole time after naples which was very hot we had very cold clear bright weather when we got to chamounix we found the greater part of the inns shut up and the people gone no visitors whatsoever and plenty of snow these were the very best circumstances under which to see the place and we stayed a couple of days at the hôtel de londres hastily refurbished for our entertainment and climbed through the snow to the mer de glace and thoroughly enjoyed it then we went in mule procession i walking to the old hotel at martigny where collins was ill and i suppose i bored egg to death by talking all the evening about the time when you and i were there together naples a place always painful to me in the intense degradation of the people seems to have only three classes of inhabitants left in itpriests soldiers standing army one hundred thousand strong and spies of macaroni we ate very considerable quantities everywhere also for the benefit of italy we took our share of every description of wine at naples i found layard the nineveh traveller who is a friend of mine and an admirable fellow so we fraternised and went up vesuvius together and ate more macaroni and drank more wine at rome the day after our arrival they were making a saint at st peters on which occasion i was surprised to find what an immense number of pounds of wax candles it takes to make the regular genuine article from turin to paris over the mont cenis we made only one journey the rhone being frozen and foggy was not to be navigated so we posted from lyons to chalons and everybody else was doing the like and there were no horses to be got and we were stranded at midnight in amazing little cabarets with nothing worth mentioning to eat in them except the iron stove which was rusty and the billiardtable which was musty we left turin on a tuesday evening and arrived in paris on a friday evening where i found my son charley hotor i should rather say coldfrom germany with his arms and legs so grown out of his coat and trousers that i was ashamed of him and was reduced to the necessity of taking him under cover of night to a readymade establishment in the palais royal where they put him into balloonwaisted pantaloons and increased my confusion leaving calais on the evening of sunday the 10th of december fact of distinguished authors being aboard was telegraphed to dover thereupon authorities of dover railway detained train to london for distinguished authors arrival rather to the exasperation of british public d a arrived at home between ten and eleven that night thank god and found all well and happy  i think you see the times and if so you will have seen a very graceful and good account of the birmingham readings it was the most remarkable thing that england could produce i think in the way of a vast intelligent assemblage and the success was most wonderful and prodigiousperfectly overwhelming and astounding altogether they wound up by giving my wife a piece of plate having given me one before and when you come to dine here may it be soon it shall be duly displayed in the centre of the table  tell mrs cerjat to whom my love and all our loves that i have highly excited them at home here by giving them an account in detail of all your

her way back into northamptonshire tomorrow  the sad affair of the preston strike remains unsettled and i hear on strong authority that if that were settled the manchester people are prepared to strike next provisions very dear but the people very temperate and quiet in general so ends this jumble which looks like the index to a chapter in a book i find when i read it over

thinking you the owner of a cold heart i am more than three parts disposed however to be ferocious with you for ever writing down such a preposterous truism  my satire is against those who see figures and averages and nothing elsethe representatives of the wickedest and most enormous vice of this timethe men who through long years to come will do more to damage the real useful truths of political economy than i could do if i tried in my whole life the addled heads who would take the average of cold in the crimea during twelve months as a reason for clothing a soldier in nankeens on a night when he would be frozen to death in fur and who would comfort the labourer in travelling twelve miles a day to and from his work by telling him that the average distance of one inhabited place from another in the whole area of england is not more than four miles bah what have you to do with these  i shall put the book upon a private shelf after reading it by once upon a time i should have buried my pipe of peace and sent you this blast of my warhorn three or four days ago but that i have been reading to a little audience of three thousand five hundred at bradford

content if in their wretched intervals of pleasure they read for amusement and do no worse they are born at the oar and they live and die at it good god what would we have of them

stout very red very jovial in a physical point of view altogether  mark and i walked to dartford from greenwich last monday and found mrs  acting the stranger with a strolling company from the standard theatre in mr munns schoolroom the stage was a little wider than your table here and its surface was composed of loose boards laid on the school forms dogs sniffed about it during the performances and the carpenters highlows were ostentatiously taken off and displayed in the proscenium  we stayed until a quarter to ten when we were obliged to fly to the railroad but we sent the landlord of the hotel down with the following articles          1 bottle superior old port         1   do    do    golden sherry         1   do    do    best french brandy         1   do    do    1st

read the fatal revenge dont do what the minor theatrical people call despiser me but i think its very bad the concluding narrative is by far the most meritorious part of the business still the people are so very convulsive and tumble down so many places and are always knocking other peoples bones about in such a very irrational way that i object the way in which earthquakes wont swallow the monsters and volcanoes in eruption wont boil them is extremely aggravating also their habit of bolting when they are going to explain anything  you have sent me a very different and a much better book and for that i am truly grateful with the dust of maturin in my eyes i sat down and read the death of friends and the dust melted away in some of those tears it is good to shed i remember to have read the backroom window some years ago and i have associated it with you ever since it is a most delightful paper but the two volumes are all delightful and i have put them on a shelf where you sit down with charles lamb again with talfourds vindication of him hard by  we never meet i hope it is not irreligious but in this strange london i have an inclination to adapt a portion of the church service to our common experience thus  we have left unmet the people whom we ought to have met and we have met the people whom we ought not to have met and there seems to be no help in us              but i am always my dear procter                                       at a distance                                                  very cordially yours   sidenote mrs gaskell                                    tavistock house april 21st 1854  my dear mrs gaskell  i safely received the paper from mr shaen welcomed it with three cheers and instantly despatched it to the printer who has it in hand now  i have no intention of striking the monstrous claims at domination made by a certain class of manufacturers and the extent to which the way is made easy for working men to slide down into discontent under such hands are within my scheme but i am not going to strike so dont be afraid of me but i wish you would look at the story yourself and judge where and how near i seem to be approaching what you have in your mind the first two months of it will show that  i will make my will on the first favourable occasion we were playing games last night and were fearfully clever with kind regards to mr gaskell always my dear mrs gaskell                                                       faithfully yours   sidenote mr frank stone ara                                      tavistock house may 30th

tables sir in an empty state and was charmed with them likewise i recovered myself from a swoon occasioned by long contact with an unventilated man of a strong flavour from copenhagen by drinking an unknown species of celestial lemonade in that enchanted apartment  i am grieved to say that on saturday i stand engaged to dine at three weeks notice with one  a man who has read every book that ever was written and is a perfect gulf of information before exploding a mine of knowledge he has a habit of closing one eye and wrinkling up his nose so that he seems perpetually to be taking aim at you and knocking you over with a terrific charge then he looks again and takes another aim so you are always on your back with your legs in the air  how can a man be conversed with or walked with in the county of middlesex when he is reviewing the kentish militia on the shores of dover or sailing every day for three weeks between dover and calais

think i may as well report all well  we have a most charming place here it beats the former residence all to nothing we have a beautiful garden with all its fruits and flowers and a field of our own and a road of our own away to the column and everything that is airy and fresh the great beaucourt hovers about us like a guardian genius and i imagine that no english person in a carriage could by any possibility find the place  of the wonderful inventions and contrivances with which a certain inimitable creature has made the most of it i will say nothing until you have an opportunity of inspecting the same at present i will only observe that i have written exactly seventytwo words of hard times since i have been here  the children arrived on tuesday night by london boat in every stage and aspect of seasickness  the camp is about a mile off and huts are now building for they say sixty thousand soldiers i dont imagine it to be near enough to bother us  if the weather ever

very well i have met with what they call in the city a parcel of the celebrated 1846 champagne it is a very fine wine and calculated to do us good when weak  the camp is about a mile off voluptuous english authors reposing from their literary fatigues on their laurels are expected when all other things fail to lie on straw in the midst of it when the days are sunny and stare at the blue sea until they fall asleep about one hundred and fifty soldiers have been at various times billeted on beaucourt since we have been here and he has clinked glasses with them every one and read a ms book of his fathers on soldiers in general to them all  i shall be glad to hear what you say to these various proposals i write with the emperor in the town and a great expenditure of tricolour floating thereabouts but no stir makes its way to this inaccessible retreat it is like being up in a balloon lionising englishmen and germans start to call and are found lying imbecile in the road halfway up

1854  my dear mrs gaskell  i sent your ms off to wills yesterday with instructions to forward it to you without delay i hope you will have received it before this notification comes to hand  the usual festivity of this place at presentwhich is the blessing of soldiers by the ten thousandhas just now been varied by the baptising of some new bells lately hung up to my sorrow and lunacy in a neighbouring church an english lady was godmother and there was a procession afterwards wherein an english gentleman carried the relics in a highly suspicious box like a barrel organ and innumerable english ladies in white gowns and bridal wreaths walked two and two as if they had all gone to school again  at a review on the same day i was particularly struck by the commencement of the proceedings and its singular contrast to the usual military operations in hyde park nothing would induce the general commanding in chief to begin until chairs were brought for all the ladyspectators and a detachment of about a hundred men deployed into all manner of farmhouses to find the chairs nobody seemed to lose any dignity by the transaction either              with kindest regards my dear

know the piece you mention but am far from being convinced by it a great misgiving is upon me that in many things this thing among the rest too many are martyrs to our complacency and satisfaction and that we must give up something thereof for their poor sakes  my kindest regards to your sister and my love if i may send it to another of your relations                                          always

this gate we never see or hear of it unless we choose if you could come here in dry weather you would find it as pretty airy and pleasant a situation as you ever saw we illuminated the whole front of the house last nighteighteen windowsand an immense palace of light was seen sparkling on this hilltop for miles and miles away i rushed to a distance to look at it and never saw anything of the same kind half so pretty  the town18 looks like one immense flag it is so decked out with streamers and as the royal yacht approached yesterdaythe whole range of the cliff tops lined with troops and the artillery matches in hand all ready to fire the great guns the moment she made the harbour the sailors standing up in the prow of the yacht the prince in a blazing uniform left alone on the deck for everybody to seea stupendous silence and then such an infernal blazing and banging as never was heard it was almost as fine a sight as one could see under a deep blue sky in our own proper

secondly that the weather has entirely changed it is so cool that we have not only a fire in the drawingroom regularly but another to dine by the delicious freshness of the air is charming and it is generally bright and windy besides  thirdly that s intellectual faculties appear to have developed suddenly he has taken to borrowing money from which i infer as he has no intention whatever of repaying that his mental powers are of a high order having got a franc from me he fell upon mrs dickens for five sous she declining to enter into the transaction he beleaguered that feeble little couple harry and sydney into paying two sous each for tickets to behold the ravishing spectacle of an utterlynonexistentandthereforeimpossibletobeproduced toy theatre he eats stony apples and harbours designs upon his fellowcreatures until he has become lightheaded from the couch rendered uneasy by this disorder he has arisen with an excessively protuberant forehead a dull slow eye a complexion of a leaden hue and a croaky voice he has become a horror to me and i resort to the most cowardly expedients to avoid meeting him he on the other hand wanting another franc dodges me round those trees at the corner and at the back door and i have a presentiment upon me that i shall fall a sacrifice to his cupidity at last  on the sunday night after you left or rather on the monday morning at halfpast one mary was taken very ill english cholera she was sinking so fast and the sickness was so exceedingly alarming that it evidently would not do to wait for elliotson i caused everything to be done that we had naturally often thought of in a lonely house so full of children and fell back upon the old remedy though the difficulty of giving even it was rendered very great by the frightful sickness thank god she recovered so favourably that by breakfast time she was fast asleep she slept twentyfour hours and has never had the least uneasiness since i heardof course afterwardsthat she had had an attack of sickness two nights before i think that long ride and those late dinners had been too much for her without them i am inclined to doubt whether she would have been ill  last sunday as ever was the theatre took fire at halfpast eleven in the forenoon being close by the english church it showered hot sparks into that temple through the open windows whereupon the congregation shrieked and rose and tumbled out into the street  benignly observing to the only ancient female who would listen to him i fear we must part and afterwards being beheld in the streetin his robes and with a kind of sacred wildness on himhanding ladies over the kennel into shops and other structures where they had no business whatever or the least desire to go i got to the back of the theatre where i could see in through some great doors that had been forced open and whence the spectacle of the whole interior burning like a redhot cavern was really very fine even in the daylight meantime the soldiers were at work saving the scenery by pitching it into the next street and the poor little properties one spinningwheel a feeble imitation of a watermill and a basketful of the dismalest artificial flowers very conspicuous were being passed from hand to hand with the greatest excitement as if they were rescued children or lovely women in four or five hours the whole place was burnt down except the outer walls never in my days did i behold such feeble endeavours in the way of extinguishment on an average i should say it took ten minutes to throw half a gallon of water on the great roaring heap and every time it was insulted in this way it gave a ferocious burst and everybody ran off beaucourt has been going about for two days in a clean collar which phenomenon evidently means something but i dont know what elliotson reports that the great conjuror lives at his hotel has extra wine every day and fares expensively is he the devil  i have heard from the kernel19 waal sir sayin as he minded to locate himself with us for a week i expected to have heard from him again this morning but have not beard comes tomorrow  kindest regards and remembrances from all ward lives in a little street

faithfully   sidenote mr frank stone ara                                     boulogne friday oct 13th 1854  my dear stone  having some little matters that rather press on my attention to see to in town i have made up my mind to relinquish the walking project and come straight home by way of folkestone on tuesday i shall be due in town at midnight and shall hope to see you next day with the top of your coatcollar mended  everything that happens here we suppose to be an announcement of the taking of sebastopol when a churchclock strikes we think it is the joybell and fly out of the house in a burst of nationalityto sneak in again if they practise firing at the camp we are sure it is the artillery celebrating the fall of the russian and we become enthusiastic in a moment i live in constant readiness to illuminate the whole house whatever anybody says i believe everybody says every day that sebastopol is in flames sometimes the commanderinchief has blown himself up with seventyfive thousand men sometimes he has cut his way through lord raglan and has fallen back on the advancing body of the russians one hundred and fortytwo thousand strong whom he is going to bring up i dont know where from or how or when or why for the destruction of the allies all these things in the words of the catechism i steadfastly believe until i become a mere driveller a moonstruck babbling staring credulous imbecile greedy gaping woodenheaded addlebrained woolgathering dreary vacant obstinate civilian                             ever my fellowcountryman affectionately   sidenote mr john saunders                                  tavistock house october 26th 1854  dear sir  i have had much gratification and pleasure in the receipt of your obliging communication allow me to thank you for it in the first place with great cordiality  although i cannot say that i came without any prepossessions to the perusal of your play for i had favourable inclinings towards it before i began i can say that i read it with the closest attention and that it inspired me with a strong interest and a genuine and high admiration the parts that involve some of the greatest difficulties of your task appear to me those in which you shine most i would particularly instance the end of julia as a very striking example of this the delicacy and beauty of her redemption from her weak rash lover are very far indeed beyond the range of any ordinary dramatist and display the true poetical strength  as your hopes now centre in mr phelps and in seeing the child of your fancy on his stage i will venture to point out to you not only what i take to be very dangerous portions of loves martyrdom as it stands for presentation on the stage but portions which i believe mr phelps will speedily regard in that light when he sees it before him in the persons of live men and women on the wooden boards knowing him i think he will be then as violently discouraged as he is now generously exalted and it may be useful to you to be prepared for the consideration of those passages  i do not regard it as a great stumblingblock that the play of modern times best known to an audience proceeds upon the main idea of this namely that there was a hunchback who because of his deformity mistrusted himself but it is certainly a grain in the balance when the balance is going the wrong way and therefore it should be most carefully trimmed the incident of the ring is an insignificant one to look at over a row of gaslights is difficult to convey to an audience and the least thing will make it ludicrous if it be so well done by mr phelps himself as to be otherwise than ludicrous it will be disagreeable if it be either it will be perilous and doubly so because you revert to it the quarrel scene between the two brothers in the third act is now so long that the justification of blind passion and impetuositywhich can alone bear out franklyn before the bodily eyes of a great concourse of spectators in plunging at the life of his own brotheris lost that the two should be parted and that franklyn should again drive at him and strike him and then wound him is a state of things to set the sympathy of an audience in the wrong direction and turn it from the man you make happy to the man you leave unhappy i would on no account allow the artist to appear attended by that picture more than once all the most sudden inconstancy of clarence i would soften down margaret must act much better than any actress i have ever seen if all her lines fall in pleasant places therefore i think she needs compression too  all this applies solely to the theatre if you ever revise the sheets for readers will you note in the margin the broken laughter and the appeals to the deity if on summing them up you find you want them all i would leave them as they stand by all means if not i would blot accordingly  it is only in the hope of being slightly useful to you by anticipating what i believe mr phelps will discoveror what if ever he should pass it i have a strong conviction the audience will find outthat i have ventured on these few hints your concurrence with them generally on reconsideration or your preference for the poem as it stands can not in the least affect my interest in your success on the other hand i have a perfect confidence in your not taking my misgivings ill they arise out of my sincere desire for the triumph of your work  with renewed thanks for the pleasure you have afforded me                                       i am dear sir faithfully yours   sidenote mr w c macready               tavistock house november 1st 1854                                    and a constitutionally foggy day  my dearest macready  i thought it better not to encumber the address to working men with details firstly because they would detract from whatever fiery effect the words may have in them secondly because writing and petitioning and pressing a subject upon members and candidates are now so clearly understood and thirdly because the paper was meant as an opening to a persistent pressure of the whole question on the public which would yield other opportunities of touching on such points  in the number for next weeknot thisis one of those followingup articles called a home question it is not written by me but is generally of my suggesting and is exceedingly well done by a thorough and experienced hand i think you will find in it generally what you want i have told the printers to send you a proof by post as soon as it is correctedthat is to say as soon as some insertions i made in it last night are in type and in their places  my dear old parr i dont believe a word you write about king john that is to say i dont believe you take into account the enormous difference between the energy summonableup in your study at sherborne and the energy that will fire up in you without so much as saying with your leave or by your leave in the town hall at birmingham i know you you ancient codger i know you therefore i will trouble you to be so good as to do an act of honesty after you have been to birmingham and to write to me ingenuous boy you were correct i find i could have read em king john with the greatest ease  in that vast hall in the busy town of sherborne in which our illustrious english novelist is expected to read next monththough he is strongly of opinion that he is deficient in power and too oldi wonder what accommodation there is for reading because our illustrious countryman likes to stand at a desk breasthigh with plenty of room about him a sloping top and a ledge to keep his book from tumbling off if such a thing should not be there however on his arrival i suppose even a sherborne carpenter could knock it up out of a deal board is there a deal board in sherborne though i should like to hear kateys opinion on that point  in this weeks household words there is an exact portrait of our boulogne landlord which i hope you will like i think of opening the next long book i write with a man of juvenile figure and strong face who is always persuading himself that he is infirm what do you think of the idea i should like to have your opinion about it i would make him an impetuous passionate sort of fellow devilish grim upon occasion and of an iron purpose droll i fancy   is getting a little too fat but appears to be troubled by the great responsibility of directing the whole war he doesnt seem to be quite clear that he has got the ships into the exact order he intended on the sea point of attack at sebastopol we went to the play last saturday night with stanfield whose high lights as maclise calls those knobs of brightness on the top of his cheeks were more radiant than ever we talked of you and i told stanny how they are imitating his acis and galatea sea in pericles at phelpss he didnt half like it but i added in nautical language that it was merely a piratical effort achieved by a handful of porpoisefaced swabs and that brought him up with a round turn as we say at sea  we are looking forward to the twentieth of next month with great pleasure all tavistock house send love and kisses to all sherborne house if there is anything i can bring down for you let me know in good course of time                               ever my dearest macready                                             most affectionately yours   sidenote the hon mrs watson                           tavistock house wednesday nov 1st 1854  my dear mrs watson  i take upon myself to answer your letter to catherine as i am referred to in it  the walk is not my writing it is very well done by a close imitator why i found myself so used up after hard times i scarcely know perhaps because i intended to do nothing in that way for a year when the idea laid hold of me by the throat in a very violent manner and because the compression and close condensation necessary for that disjointed form of publication gave me perpetual trouble but i really was tired which is a result so very incomprehensible that i cant forget it i have passed an idle autumn in a beautiful situation and am dreadfully brown and big for further particulars of boulogne see our french watering place in this present week of household words which contains a faithful portrait of our landlord there  if you carry out that bright croydon idea rely on our glad cooperation only let me know all about it a few days beforehand and if you feel equal to the contemplation of the moustache which has been cut lately it will give us the heartiest pleasure to come and meet you this in spite of the terrific duffery of the crystal palace it is a very remarkable thing in itself but to have so very large a building continually crammed down ones throat and to find it a new page in the whole duty of man to go there is a little more than even i and you know how amiable i am can endure  you always like to know what i am going to do so i beg to announce that on the 19th of december i am going to read the carol at reading where i undertook the presidency of the literary institution on the death of poor dear talfourd then i am going on to sherborne in dorsetshire to do the like for another institution which is one of the few remaining pleasures of macreadys life then i am coming home for christmas day then i believe i must go to bradford in yorkshire to read once more to a little fireside party of four thousand then i am coming home again to get up a new little version of the children in the wood yet to be written bythebye for the children to act on charleys birthday  i am full of mixed feeling about the waradmiration of our valiant men burning desires to cut the emperor of russias throat and something like despair to see how the old cannonsmoke and bloodmists obscure the wrongs and sufferings of the people at home when i consider the patriotic fund on the one hand and on the other the poverty and wretchedness engendered by cholera of which in london alone an infinitely larger number of english people than are likely to be slain in the whole russian war have miserably and needlessly diedi feel as if the world had been pushed back five hundred years if you are reading new books just now i think you will be interested with a controversy between whewell and brewster on the question of the shining orbs about us being inhabited or no whewells book is called on the plurality of worlds brewsters more worlds than one i shouldnt wonder if you know all about them they bring together a vast number of points of great interest in natural philosophy and some very curious reasoning on both sides and leave the matter pretty much where it was  we had a fine absurdity in connection with our luggage when we left boulogne the barometer had within a few hours fallen about a foot in honour of the occasion and it was a tremendous night blowing a gale of wind and raining a little deluge the luggage pretty heavy as you may suppose in a cart drawn by two horses stuck fast in a rut in our field and couldnt be moved our man made a lunatic by the extremity of the occasion ran down to the town to get two more horses to help it out when he returned with those horses and carter b the most beaming of men carter a who had been soaking all the time by the disabled vehicle descried in carter b the acknowledged enemy of his existence took his own two horses out and walked off with them after which the whole setout remained in the field all night and we came to town thirteen individuals with one comb and a pockethandkerchief i was upsidedown during the greater part of the passage  dr raes account of franklins unfortunate party is deeply interesting but i think hasty in its acceptance of the details particularly in the statement that they had eaten the dead bodies of their companions which i dont believe franklin on a former occasion was almost starved to death had gone through all the pains of that sad end and lain down to die and no such thought had presented itself to any of them in famous cases of shipwreck it is very rare indeed that any person of any humanising education or refinement resorts to this dreadful means of prolonging life in open boats the coarsest and commonest men of the shipwrecked party have done such things but i dont remember more than one instance in which an officer had overcome the loathing that the idea had inspired dr rae talks about their cooking these remains too i should like to know where the fuel came from           kindest love and best regards                       ever my dear mrs watson affectionately yours   sidenote mr clarkson stanfield ra                        tavistock house friday night nov 3rd 1854  my dear stanny  first of all here is enclosed a letter for mrs stanfield which if you dont immediately and faithfully deliver you will hear of in an unpleasant way from the stationhouse at the curve of the hill above you  secondly this is not to remind you that we meet at the athenæum next monday at five because none but a mouldy swab as never broke biscuit or lay out on the forselyardarm in a gale of wind ever forgot an appointment with a messmate  but what i want you to think of at your leisure is this when our dear old macready was in town last i saw it would give him so much interest and pleasure if i promised to go down and read my christmas carol to the little sherborne institution which is now one of the few active objects he has in the life about him that i came out with that promise in a boldi may say a swaggering way consequently on wednesday the 20th of december i am going down to see him with kate and georgina returning to town in good time for christmas on saturday the 23rd do you think you could manage to go and return with us i really believe there is scarcely anything in the world that would give him such extraordinary pleasure as such a visit and if you would empower me to send him an intimation that he may expect it he will have a daily joy in looking forward to the time i am seriously sure which wewhose light has not gone out and who are among our old dear pursuits and associationscan scarcely estimate  i dont like to broach the idea in a careless way and so i propose it thus and ask you to think of it                                         ever most affectionately yours   sidenote miss procter                             tavistock house sunday dec 17th 1854  my dear miss procter  you have given me a new sensation i did suppose that nothing in this singular world could surprise me but you have done it  you will believe my congratulations on the delicacy and talent of your writing to be sincere from the first i have always had an especial interest in that miss berwick and have over and over again questioned wills about her i suppose he has gone on gradually building up an imaginary structure of life and adventure for her but he has given me the strangest information only yesterday week when we were making up the poor travellers as i sat meditatively poking the office fire i said to him wills have you got that miss berwicks proof back of the little sailors song no he said well but why not i asked him why you know he answered as i have often told you before she dont live at the place to which her letters are addressed and so theres always difficulty and delay in communicating with her do you know what age she is i said here he looked unfathomably profound and returned rather advanced in life you said she was a governess didnt you said i to which he replied in the most emphatic and positive manner a governess  he then came and stood in the corner of the hearth with his back to the fire and delivered himself like an oracle concerning you he told me that early in life conveying to me the impression of about a quarter of a century ago you had had your feelings desperately wounded by some cause real or imaginaryit does not matter which said i with the greatest sagacityand that you had then taken to writing verses that you were of an unhappy temperament but keenly sensitive to encouragement that you wrote after the educational duties of the day were discharged that you sometimes thought of never writing any more that you had been away for some time with your pupils that your letters were of a mild and melancholy character and that you did not seem to care as much as might be expected about money all this time i sat poking the fire with a wisdom upon me absolutely crushing and finally i begged him to assure the lady that she might trust me with her real address and that it would be better to have it now as i hoped our further communications etc etc etc you must have felt enormously wicked last tuesday when i such a babe in the wood was unconsciously prattling to you but you have given me so much pleasure and have made me shed so many tears that i can only think of you now in association with the sentiment and grace of your verses  so pray accept the blessing and forgiveness of richard watts though i am afraid you come under both his conditions of exclusion20

rochester known as wattss charity is to the effect that it furnishes a nights lodging for six poor travellersnot being rogues or proctors     1855  narrative   in the beginning of this year charles dickens gave public readings at reading sherborne and bradford in yorkshire to which reference is made in the first following letters besides this he was fully occupied in getting up a play for his children which was acted on the 6th january mr planchés fairy extravaganza of fortunio and his seven gifted servants was the play selected the parts being filled by all his own children and some of their young friends and charles dickens mr mark lemon and mr wilkie collins playing with them the only grownup members of the company in february he made a short trip to paris with mr wilkie collins with an intention of going on to bordeaux which was abandoned on account of bad weather out of the success of the childrens play at tavistock house rose a scheme for a serious play at the same place mr collins undertaking to write a melodrama for the purpose and mr stanfield to paint scenery and dropscene charles dickens turned one of the rooms of the house into a very perfect little theatre and in june the lighthouse was acted for three nights with mr nightingales diary and animal magnetism as farces the actors being himself and several members of the original amateur company the actresses his two daughters and his sisterinlaw mr stanfield after entering most heartily into the enterprise and giving constant time and attention to the painting of his beautiful scenes was unfortunately ill and unable to attend the first performance we give a letter to him reporting its great success  in this summer charles dickens made a speech at a great meeting at drury lane theatre on the subject of administrative reform of which he writes to mr macready on this subject of administrative reform too we give two letters to the great nineveh traveller mr layard now sir austen h layard for whom as his letters show he conceived at once the affectionate friendship which went on increasing from this time for the rest of his life mr layard also spoke at the drury lane meeting  charles dickens had made a promise to give another reading at birmingham for the funds of the institute which still needed help and in a letter to mr arthur ryland asking him to fix a time for it he gives the first idea of a selection from david copperfield which was afterwards one of the most popular of his readings  he was at all times fond of making excursions for a dayor two or three daysto rochester and its neighbourhood and after one of these this year he writes to mr wills that he has seen a small freehold to be sold opposite the house on which he had fixed his childish affections and which he calls in this letter the hermitage its real name being gads hill place the latter house was not at that time to be had and he made some approach to negotiations as to the other little freehold which however did not come to anything later in the year however mr wills by an accident discovered that gads hill place the property of miss lynn the wellknown authoress and a constant contributor to household words was itself for sale and a negotiation for its purchase commenced which was not however completed until the following spring  later in the year the performance of the lighthouse was repeated for a charitable purpose at the campden house theatre  this autumn was passed at folkestone charles dickens had decided upon spending the following winter in paris and the family proceeded there from folkestone in october making a halt at boulogne from whence his sisterinlaw preceded the party to paris to secure lodgings with the help of lady olliffe he followed to make his choice of apartments that had been found and he writes to his wife and to mr wills giving a description of the paris house here he began little dorrit in a letter to mrs watson from folkestone he gives her the name which he had first proposed for this storynobodys fault  during his absence from england mr and mrs hogarth occupied tavistock house and his eldest son being now engaged in business remained with them coming to paris only for christmas three of his boys were at school at boulogne at this time and one walter landor at wimbledon studying for an indian army appointment   sidenote m de cerjat                                   tavistock house january 3rd 1855  my dear cerjat  when your christmas letter did not arrive according to custom i felt as if a bit of christmas had fallen out and there was no supplying the piece however it was soon supplied by yourself and the bowl became round and sound again  the christmas number of household words i suppose will reach lausanne about midsummer the first ten pages or soall under the head of the first poor travellerare written by me and i hope you will find in the story of the soldier which they contain something that may move you a little it moved me not a little in the writing and i believe has touched a vast number of people we have sold eighty thousand of it  i am but newly come home from reading at reading where i succeeded poor talfourd as the president of an institution and at sherborne in dorsetshire and at bradford in yorkshire wonderful audiences and the number at the last place three thousand seven hundred and yet but for the noise of their laughing and cheering they went like one man  the absorption of the english mind in the war is to me a melancholy thing every other subject of popular solicitude and sympathy goes down before it i fear i clearly see that for years to come domestic reforms are shaken to the root every miserable redtapist flourishes war over the head of every protester against his humbug and everything connected with it is pushed to such an unreasonable extent that however kind and necessary it may be in itself it becomes ridiculous for all this it is an indubitable fact i conceive that russia must be stopped and that the future peace of the world renders the war imperative upon us the duke of newcastle lately addressed a private letter to the newspapers entreating them to exercise a larger discretion in respect of the letters of our own correspondents against which lord raglan protests as giving the emperor of russia information for nothing which would cost him if indeed he could get it at all fifty or a hundred thousand pounds a year the communication has not been attended with much effect so far as i can see in the meantime i do suppose we have the wretchedest ministry that ever wasin whom nobody not in office of some sort believesyet whom there is nobody to displace the strangest result perhaps of years of reformed parliaments that ever the general sagacity did not foresee  let me recommend you as a brotherreader of high distinction two comedies both goldsmithsshe stoops to conquer and the goodnatured man both are so admirable and so delightfully written that they read wonderfully a friend of mine forster who wrote the life of goldsmith was very ill a year or so ago and begged me to read to him one night as he lay in bed something of goldsmiths i fell upon she stoops to conquer and we enjoyed it with that wonderful intensity that i believe he began to get better in the first scene and was all right again in the fifth act  i am charmed by your account of haldimand to whom my love tell him sydney smiths daughter has privately printed a life of her father with selections from his letters which has great merit and often presents him exactly as he used to be i have strongly urged her to publish it and i think she will do so about march  my eldest boy has come home from germany to learn a business life at birmingham i think first of all the whole nine are well and happy ditto mrs dickens ditto georgina my two girls are full of interest in yours and one of mine as i think i told you when i was at elysée is curiously like one of yours in the face they are all agog now about a great fairy play which is to come off here next monday the house is full of spangles gas jew theatrical tailors and pantomime carpenters we all unite in kindest and best loves to dear mrs cerjat and all the blooming daughters and i am with frequent thoughts of you and cordial affection ever my dear cerjat                                                   your faithful

pleasantly and was received with a cordial welcome if i had leisure to write a letter i should write you at this point perhaps the very best letter that ever was read but being in the agonies of getting up a gorgeous fairy play for the postboys on charleys birthday besides having the work of halfadozen to do as a regular thing i leave the merits of the wonderful epistle to your lively fancy  enclosing a kiss if you will have the kindness to return it when done with  i have just been reading my christmas carol in yorkshire i should have lost my heart to the beautiful young landlady of my hotel age twentynine dress black frock and jacket exquisitely braided if it had not been safe in your possession  many many happy years to you my regards to that obstinate old wurzell21 and his dame when you have them under lock and key again                                              ever affectionately yours   sidenote mrs gaskell                                  tavistock house january 27th 1855  my dear mrs gaskell  let me congratulate you on the conclusion of your story not because it is the end of a task to which you had conceived a dislike for i imagine you to have got the better of that delusion by this time but because it is the vigorous and powerful accomplishment of an anxious labour it seems to me that you have felt the ground thoroughly firm under your feet and have strided on with a force and purpose that must now give you pleasure  you will not i hope allow that notlucid interval of dissatisfaction with yourself and me which beset you for a minute or two once upon a time to linger in the shape of any disagreeable association with household words i shall still look forward to the large sides of paper and shall soon feel disappointed if they dont begin to reappear  i thought it best that wills should write the business letter on the conclusion of the story as that part of our communications had always previously rested with him i trust you found it satisfactory i refer to it not as a matter of mere form but because i sincerely wish everything between us to be beyond the possibility of misunderstanding or reservation                               dear mrs gaskell very faithfully yours   sidenote mr arthur ryland                             tavistock house monday jan 29th 1855  my dear mr ryland  i have been in the greatest difficultywhich i am not yet out ofto know what to read at birmingham i fear the idea of next month is now impracticable which of two other months do you think would be preferable for your birmingham objects next may or next december  having already read two christmas books at birmingham i should like to get out of that restriction and have a swim in the broader waters of one of my long books i have been poring over copperfield which is my favourite with the idea of getting a reading out of it to be called by some such name as young housekeeping and little emily but there is still the huge difficulty that i constructed the whole with immense pains and have so woven it up and blended it together that i cannot yet so separate the parts as to tell the story of davids married life with dora and the story of mr peggottys search for his niece within the time this is my object if i could possibly bring it to bear it would make a very attractive reading with a strong interest in it and a certain completeness  this is exactly the state of the case i dont mind confiding to you that i never can approach the book with perfect composure it had such perfect possession of me when i wrote it and that i no sooner begin to try to get it into this form than i begin to read it all and to feel that i cannot disturb it i have not been unmindful of the agreement we made at parting and i have sat staring at the backs of my books for an inspiration this project is the only one that i have constantly reverted to and yet i have made no progress in it                                                faithfully yours always   sidenote monsieur regnier            tavistock house london saturday evening feb 3rd 1855  my dear regnier  i am coming to paris for a week with my friend collinsson of the english painter who painted our green lanes and our cottage children so beautifully do not tell this to le vieux unless i have the ill fortune to stumble against him in the street i shall not make my arrival known to him  i purpose leaving here on sunday the 11th but i shall stay that night at boulogne to see two of my little boys who are at school there we shall come to paris on monday the 12th arriving there in the evening  now mon cher do you think you can without inconvenience engage me for a week an apartmentcheerful light and wholesomecontaining a comfortable salon et deux chambres à coucher i do not care whether it is an hotel or not but the reason why i do not write for an apartment to the hôtel brighton is that there they expect one to dine at home i mean in the apartment generally whereas as we are coming to paris expressly to be always looking about us we want to dine wherever we like every day consequently what we want to find is a good apartment where we can have our breakfast but where we shall never dine  can you engage such accommodation for me if you can i shall feel very much obliged to you if the apartment should happen to contain a little bed for a servant i might perhaps bring one but i do not care about that at all i want it to be pleasant and gay and to throw myself en garçon on the festive diableries de paris  mrs dickens and her sister send their kindest regards to madame regnier and you in which i heartily join all the children send their loves to the two brave boys and the normandy bonnes  i shall hope for a short answer from you one day next week

love that i will write to her again tomorrow afternoon i hope she may then receive my letter by monday morning and in it i purpose telling her when i may be expected home the weather is so severe and

any apartment in paris can be in such weather we are very well waited on and looked after we breakfast at ten read and write till two and then i go out walking all over paris while the invalid sits by

the fire and drink lemonade to which i add rum we go to bed between one and two i live in peace like an elderly gentleman and regard myself as in a negative state of virtue and respectability  the theatres are not particularly good but i have seen lemaître act in the most wonderful and astounding manner i am afraid we must go to the opéra comique on sunday tomorrow we dine with regnier and today with the olliffes  la joie fait peur at the français delighted me exquisitely played and beautifully imagined altogether last night we went to the porte st martin to see a piece english subject called jane osborne which the characters pronounce ja nosbornnne the seducer was lord nottingham the comic englishwomans name she kept lodgings and was a very bad character was missees christmas she had begun to get into great difficulties with a gentleman of the name of meestair cornhill when we were obliged to leave at the end of the first act by the intolerable stench of the place the whole theatre must be standing over some vast cesspool it was so alarming that i instantly rushed into a café and had brandy  my ear has gradually become so accustomed to french that i understand the people at the theatres for the first time with perfect ease and satisfaction i walked about with regnier for an hour and a half yesterday and received many compliments on my angelic manner of speaking the celestial language there is a winter franconis now high up on the boulevards just like the round theatre on the champs elysées and as bright and beautiful a clown from astleys is all in high favour there at present he talks slang english being evidently an idiot as if he felt a perfect confidence that everybody understands him his name is boswell and the whole cirque rang last night with cries

propose arranging to return about tuesday or wednesday in the meantime i am living like gil blas and doing nothing i am very much obliged to you indeed for the trouble you have kindly taken about the little freehold it is clear to me that its merits resolve themselves into the view and the spot if i had more money these considerations might with me overtop all others but as it is i consider the matter quite disposed of finally settled in the negative and to be thought no more about i shall not go down and look at it as i could add nothing to your report  paris is finer than ever and i go wandering about it all day we dine at all manner of places and go to two or three theatres in the evening i suppose as an old farmer said of scott i am makin mysel all the time but i seem to be rather a freeandeasy sort of superior vagabond  i live in continual terror of  and am strongly fortified within doors with a means of retreat into my bedroom always ready up to the present blessed moment his staggering form has not appeared  as to yesterdays post from england i have not at the present moment the slightest idea where it may be it is under the snow somewhere i suppose but nobody expects it

tavistock house february 26th 1855  my dear mr ryland  charley came home i assure you perfectly delighted with his visit to you and rapturous in his accounts of your great kindness to him  it appears to me that the first question in reference to my reading i have not advanced an inch in my copperfield trials bythebye is whether you think you could devise any plan in connection with the room at dees which would certainly bring my help in money up to five hundred pounds that is what i want if it could be done by a subscription for two nights for instance i would not be chary of my time and trouble but if you cannot see your way clearly to that result in that connection then i think it would be better to wait until we can have the town hall at christmas i have promised to read about christmas time at sheffield and at peterboro i could add birmingham to the list then if need were but what i want is to give the institution in all five hundred pounds that is my object and nothing less will satisfy me  will you think it over taking counsel with whomsoever you please and let me know what conclusion you arrive at only think of me as subservient to the institution

plain to you in a few words why i think it right to stay away from the lord mayors dinner to the club if i did not feel a kind of rectitude involved in my nonacceptance of his invitation your note would immediately induce me to change my mind  entertaining a strong opinion on the subject of the city corporation as it stands and the absurdity of its pretensions in an age perfectly different in all conceivable respects from that to which it properly belonged as a reality i have expressed that opinion on more than one occasion within a year or so in household words i do not think it consistent with my respect for myself or for the art i profess to blow hot and cold in the same breath and to laugh at the institution in print and accept the hospitality of its representative while the ink is staring us all in the face there is a great deal too much of this among us and it does not elevate the earnestness or delicacy of literature  this is my sole consideration personally i have always met the present lord mayor on the most agreeable terms and i think him an excellent one as between you and me and him i cannot have the slightest objection to your telling him the truth on a more private occasion when he was not keeping his state i should be delighted to interchange any courtesy with that honourable and amiable gentleman mr moon

couttss really a greater pleasure to me than i could easily tell you i have thought a good deal of the duty we all owe you of helping you as much as we can being on very intimate terms with lemon the editor of punch a most affectionate and truehearted fellow i mentioned to him in confidence what i had at heart you will find yourself the subject of their next large cut and of some lines in an earnest spirit he again suggested the point to mr shirley brookes one of their regular corps who will do what is right in the illustrated london news and the weekly chronicle papers that go into the hands of large numbers of people i have also communicated with jerrold whom i trust and have begged him not to be diverted from the straight path of help to the most useful man in england on all possible occasions forster i will speak to carefully and i have no doubt it will quicken him a little not that we have anything to complain of in his direction if you ever see any new loophole cranny needleseye through which i can present your case to household words i most earnestly entreat you as your staunch friend and admireryou can have no truerto indicate it to me at any time or season and to count upon my being damascus steel to the core  all this is nothing because all these men and thousands of others dote upon you but i know it would be a comfort to me in your hardfighting place to be assured of such sympathy and therefore only i write  you have other recreations for your sundays in the session i daresay than to come here but it is generally a day on which i do not go out and when we dine at halfpast five in the easiest way in the world and smoke in the peacefulest manner perhaps one of these sundays after easter you might not be indisposed to begin to dig us out  and i should like on a saturday of your appointing to get a few of the serviceable men i knowsuch as i have mentionedabout you here will you think of this too and suggest a saturday for our dining together  i am really ashamed and moved that you should do your part so manfully and be left alone in the conflict i felt you to be all you are the first moment i saw you i know you will accept my regard and fidelity for what they are worth                                       dear layard very heartily yours   sidenote mr austen h layard                           tavistock house tuesday april 10th 1855  dear layard  i shall of course observe the strictest silence at present in reference to your resolutions it will be a most acceptable occupation to me to go over them with you and i have not a doubt of their producing a strong effect out of doors  there is nothing in the present time at once so galling and so alarming to me as the alienation of the people from their own public affairs i have no difficulty in understanding it they have had so little to do with the game through all these years of parliamentary reform that they have sullenly laid down their cards and taken to looking on the players who are left at the table do not see beyond it conceive that gain and loss and all the interest of the play are in their hands and will never be wiser until they and the table and the lights and the money are all overturned together and i believe the discontent to be so much the worse for smouldering instead of blazing openly that it is extremely like the general mind of france before the breaking out of the first revolution and is in danger of being turned by any one of a thousand accidentsa bad harvestthe last strain too much of aristocratic insolence or incapacitya defeat abroada mere chance at homewith such a devil of a conflagration as never has been beheld since  meanwhile all our english tufthunting toadeating and other manifestations of accursed gentilityto say nothing of the lord knows whos defiances of the proven truth before six hundred and fifty menare expressing themselves every day so every day the disgusted millions with this unnatural gloom are confirmed and hardened in the very worst of moods finally round all this is an atmosphere of poverty hunger and ignorant desperation of the mere existence of which perhaps not one man in a thousand of those not actually enveloped in it through the whole extent of this country has the least idea  it seems to me an absolute impossibility to direct the spirit of the people at this pass until it shows itself if they begin to bestir themselves in the vigorous national manner if they would appear in political reunion array themselves peacefully but in vast numbers against a system that they know to be rotten altogether make themselves heard like the sea all round this island i for one should be in such a movement heart and soul and should think it a duty of the plainest kind to go along with it and try to guide it by all possible means but you can no more help a people who do not help themselves than you can help a man who does not help himself and until the people can be got up from the lethargy which is an awful symptom of the advanced state of their disease i know of nothing that can be done beyond keeping their wrongs continually before them  i shall hope to see you soon after you come back your speeches at aberdeen are most admirable manful and earnest i would have such speeches at every marketcross and in every townhall and among all sorts and conditions of men up in the very balloons and down in the very divingbells                                                  ever cordially yours   sidenote mr john forster                          tavistock house saturday april 14th 1855  my dear forster  i cannot express to you how very much delighted i am with the steele i think it incomparably the best of the series the pleasanter humanity of the subject may commend it more to ones liking but that again requires a delicate handling which you have given to it in a most charming manner it is surely not possible to approach a man with a finer sympathy and the assertion of the claims of literature throughout is of the noblest and most gallant kind  i dont agree with you about the serious papers in the spectator which i think whether they be steeles or addisons are generally as indifferent as the humour of the spectator is delightful and i have always had a notion that prue understood her husband very well and held him in consequence when a fonder woman with less show of caprice must have let him go but these are points of opinion the paper is masterly and all i have got to say is that if  had a grain of the honest sentiment with which it overflows he never would or could have made so great a mistake                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote mr mark lemon                          tavistock house thursday april 26th 1855

written to you since because i thought it best to leave you quiet for a day i have no need to tell you my dear fellow that my thoughts have been constantly with you and that i have not forgotten and never shall forget who sat up with me one night when a little place in my house was left empty  it is hard to lose any child but there are many blessed sources of consolation in the loss of a baby there is a beautiful thought in fieldings journey from this world to the next where the baby he had lost many years before was found by him all radiant and happy building him a bower in the elysian fields where they were to live together when he came                                              ever affectionately yours  psour kindest loves to mrs lemon   sidenote mr clarkson stanfield ra

project with the greatest delight and i think we shall make a capital thing of it  it now occurs to me that we may as well do a farce too i should like to get in a little part for katey and also for charley if it were practicable what do you think of animal mag you and i in our old parts collins jeffrey charley the markis katey and mary or georgina the two ladies can you think of anything merry that is better it ought to be broad as a relief to the melodrama unless we could find something funny with a story in it too i rather incline myself to animal mag will you come round and deliver your

should have answered your note immediately on its arrival i cannot have the pleasure of seeing the famous medium tonight for i have some theatricals at home but i fear i shall not in any case be a good subject for the purpose as i altogether want faith in the thing  i have not the least belief in the awful unseen world being available for evening parties at so much per night and although i should be ready to receive enlightenment from any source i must say i have very little hope of it from the spirits who express themselves through mediums as i have never yet observed them to talk anything but nonsense of which as carlyle would say there is probably enough in these days of ours and in all days among mere mortality                                                  very faithfully yours   sidenote mr clarkson stanfield ra                           tavistock house wednesday june 20th 1855  my dear stanny  i write a hasty note to let you know that last night was perfectly wonderful  such an audience such a brilliant success from first to last the queen had taken it into her head in the morning to go to chatham and had carried phipps with her he wrote to me asking if it were possible to give him a quarter of an hour i got through that time before the overture and he came without any dinner so influenced by eager curiosity lemon and i did every conceivable absurdity i think in the farce and they never left off laughing at supper i proposed your health which was drunk with nine times nine and three cheers over we then turned to at scotch reels having had no exercise and danced in the maddest way until five this morning  it is as much as i can do to guide the pen                    with loves to mrs stanfield and all                                        ever most affectionately yours   sidenote mr w c macready                           tavistock house saturday june 30th 1855  my very dear macready  i write shortly after a days work at my desk rather than lose a post in answering your enthusiastic earnest and younghow young in all the best side of youthletter  to tell you the truth i confidently expected to hear from you i knew that if there were a man in the world who would be interested in and who would approve of my giving utterance to whatever was in me at this time it would be you i was as sure of you as of the sun this morning  the subject is surrounded by difficulties the association is sorely in want of able men and the resistance of all the phalanx who have an interest in corruption and mismanagement is the resistance of a struggle against death but the great first strong necessity is to rouse the people up to keep them stirring and vigilant to carry the war dead into the tent of such creatures as  and ring into their souls or what stands for them that the time for dandy insolence is gone for ever it may be necessary to come to that law of primogeniture i have no love for it or to come to even greater things but this is the first service to be done and unless it is done there is not a chance for this and to encourage timid people to come in i went to drury lane the other night and i wish you had been there and had seen and heard the people  the association will be proud to have your name and gift when we sat down on the stage the other night and were waiting a minute or two to begin i said to morley the chairman a thoroughly fine earnest fellow this reminds me so of one of my dearest friends with a melancholy so curious that i dont know whether the place feels familiar to me or strange he was full of interest directly and we went on talking of you until the moment of his getting up to open the business  they are going to print my speech in a tractform and send it all over the country i corrected it for the purpose last night we are all well charley in the city all the boys at home for the holidays three prizes brought home triumphantly one from the boulogne waters and one from wimbledon i taking dives into a new book and runs at leapfrog over household words and anne going to be marriedwhich is the only bad news  catherine georgie mary katey charley and all the rest send multitudes of loves ever my dearest macready with unalterable affection and attachment                                                   your faithful friend   sidenote mr w wilkie collins               3 albion villas folkestone tuesday july 17th 1855  my dear collins  walter goes back to school on the 1st of august will you come out of school to this breezy vacation on the same day or rather this day fortnight july 31st for that is the day on which he leaves us and we begin heres a parent to be able to be comfortable why a boy of that age should seem to have on at all times a hundred and fifty pair of doublesoled boots and to be always jumping a bottom stair with the whole hundred and fifty i dont know but the woeful fact is within my daily experience  we have a very pleasant little house overlooking the sea and i think you will like the place it rained in honour of our arrival with the greatest vigour yesterday i went out after dinner to buy some nails you know the arrangements that would be then in progress and i stopped in the rain about halfway down a steep crooked street like a crippled ladder to look at a little coachmakers where there had just been a sale speculating on the insolvent coachmakers business and what kind of coaches he could possibly have expected to get orders for in folkestone i thought what would bring together fifty people now in this little street at this little rainy minute on the instant a brewers van with two mad horses in it and the harness dangling about themlike the trappings of those horses you are acquainted with who bolted through the starry courts of heavendashed by me and in that instant such a crowd as would have accumulated in fleet street sprang up magically men fell out of windows dived out of doors plunged down courts precipitated themselves down steps came down waterspouts instead of rain i think and i never saw so wonderful an instance of the gregarious effect of an excitement  a man a woman and a child had been thrown out on the horses taking fright and the reins breaking the child is dead and the woman very ill but will probably recover and the man has a hand broken and other mischief done to him  let me know what wigan says if he does not take the play and readily too i would recommend you not to offer it elsewhere you have gained great reputation by it have done your position a deal of good and as i think stand so well with it that it is a pity to engender the notion that you care to stand better                                                        ever faithfully   sidenote mr w h wills

belonging to that condition  i have not a word of news i am steeped in my story and rise and fall by turns into enthusiasm and depression                                                        ever

often i write to youin intentioni dont know where you would find room for the correspondence  catherine tells me that you want to know the name of my new book i cannot bear that you should know it from anyone but me it will not be made public until the end of october the title is                              nobodys fault  keep it as the apple of your eyean expressive form of speech though i have not the least idea of what it means  next i wish to tell you that i have appointed to read at peterboro on tuesday the 18th of december i have told the dean that i cannot accept his hospitality and that i am going with mr wills to the inn therefore i shall be absolutely at your disposal and shall be more than disappointed if you dont stay with us as the time approaches will you let me know your arrangements and whether mr wills can bespeak any rooms for you in arranging for me georgy will give you our address in paris as soon as we shall have settled there we shall leave here i think in rather less than a month from this time  you know my state of mind as well as i do indeed if you dont know it much better it is not the state of mind i take it to be how i work how i walk how i shut myself up how i roll down hills and climb up cliffs how the new story is everywhereheaving in the sea flying with the clouds blowing in the wind how i settle to nothing and wonder in the old way at my own incomprehensibility i am getting on pretty well have done the first two numbers and am just now beginning the third which egotistical announcements i make to you because i know you will be interested in them  all the house send their kindest loves i think of inserting an advertisement in the times offering to submit the plornishghenter to public competition and to receive fifty thousand pounds if such another boy cannot be found and to pay five pounds my fortune if he can                        ever my dear mrs watson affectionately yours   sidenote mr w wilkie collins

always doing i shall be as the chairman says at mr evanss happy to oblige  i have almost finished no 3 in which i have relieved my indignant soul with a scarifier sticking at it day after day i am the incompletest letterwriter imaginableseem to have no idea of holding a pen for any other purpose but that book my fair laura has not yet reported concerning paris but i should think will have done so before i see you and now to that point i purpose being in town on monday the 8th when i have promised to dine with forster at the office between halfpast eleven and one that day i will expect you unless i hear from you to the contrary of course the h w stories are at your disposition if you should have completed your idea we might breakfast together at the g on the tuesday morning and discuss it or i shall be in town after ten on the monday night at the office i will tell you the idea of the christmas number which will put you in train i hope for a story i have postponed the shipwreck idea for a year as it seemed to require more force from me than i could well give it with the weight of a new start upon me  all here send their kindest remembrances we missed you very much and the plorn was quite inconsolable we slide down cæsar occasionally  they launched the boat the rapid building of which you remember the other day all the fishermen in the place all the nondescripts and all the boys pulled at it with ropes from six am to four pm every now and then the ropes broke and they all fell down in the shingle the obstinate way in which the beastly thing wouldnt move was so exasperating that i wondered they didnt shoot it or burn it whenever it moved an inch they all cheered whenever it wouldnt move they all swore finally when it was quite given over some one tumbled against it accidentally as it appeared to me looking out at my window here and it instantly shot about a mile into the sea and they all stood looking at it helplessly  kind regards to pigott in which all unite                                                        ever faithfully   sidenote mr w c macready                                 folkestone thursday oct 4th 1855  my dearest macready  i have been hammering away in that strenuous manner at my book that i have had leisure for scarcely any letters but such as i have been obliged to write having a horrible temptation when i lay down my bookpen to run out on the breezy downs here tear up the hills slide down the same and conduct myself in a frenzied manner for the relief that only exercise gives me  your letter to miss coutts in behalf of little miss warner i despatched straightway she is at present among the pyrenees and a letter from her crossed that one of mine in which i enclosed yours last week  pray stick to that dim notion you have of coming to paris how delightful it would be to see your aged countenance and perfectly bald head in that capital it will renew your youth to visit a theatre previously dining at the trois frères in company with the jocund boy who now addresses you do do stick to it  you will be pleased to hear i know that charley has gone into barings house under very auspicious circumstances mr bates of that firm had done me the kindness to place him at the brokers where he was and when said bates wrote to me a fortnight ago to say that an excellent opening had presented itself at barings he added that the brokers gave charley so high a character for ability and zeal that it would be unfair to receive him as a volunteer and he must begin at a fiftypound salary to which i graciously consented  as to the suffrage i have lost hope even in the ballot we appear to me to have proved the failure of representative institutions without an educated and advanced people to support them what with teaching people to keep in their stations what with bringing up the soul and body of the land to be a good child or to go to the beershop to go apoaching and go to the devil what with having no such thing as a middle class for though we are perpetually bragging of it as our safety it is nothing but a poor fringe on the mantle of the upper what with flunkyism toadyism letting the most contemptible lords come in for all manner of places reading the court circular for the new testament i do reluctantly believe that the english people are habitually consenting parties to the miserable imbecility into which we have fallen and never will help themselves out of it who is to do it if anybody is god knows but at present we are on the downhill road to being conquered and the people will be content to bear it sing rule britannia and will not be saved  in no 3 of my new book i have been blowing off a little of indignant steam which would otherwise blow me up and with gods leave i shall walk in the same all the days of my life but i have no present political faith or hopenot a grain  i am going to read the carol here tomorrow in a long carpenters shop which looks far more alarming as a place to hear in than the town hall at birmingham  kindest loves from all to your dear sister kate and the darlings it is blowing a gale here from the southwest and raining like mad

job to find a place that would in the least suit us for paris is perfectly full and there is nothing to be got at any sane price however we have found two apartmentsan entresol and a first floor with a kitchen and servants room at the top of the house at no 49 avenue des champs elysées  you must be prepared for a regular continental abode there is only one window in each room but the front apartments all look upon the main street of the champs elysées and the view is delightfully cheerful there are also plenty of rooms they are not over and above well furnished but by changing furniture from rooms we dont care for to rooms we do care for we shall be able to make them homelike and presentable i think the situation itself almost the finest in paris and the children will have a window from which to look on the busy life outside  we could have got a beautiful apartment in the rue faubourg st honoré for a very little more most elegantly furnished but the greater part of it was on a courtyard and it would never have done for the children this that i have taken for six months is seven hundred francs per month and twenty more for the concierge what you have to expect is a regular french residence which a little habitation will make pretty and comfortable with nothing showy in it but with plenty of rooms and with that wonderful street in which the barrière de lÉtoile stands outside the amount of rooms is the great thing and i believe it to be the place best suited for us at a not unreasonable price in paris  georgina and lady olliffe22 send their loves georgina and i add ours to mamey katey the plorn and harry                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote mr w h wills                  49 avenue des champs elysÉes paris                                             friday oct 19th 1855  my dear wills  after going through unheardof bedevilments of which you shall have further particulars as soon as i come right side upwards which may happen in a day or two we are at last established here in a series of closets but a great many of them with all paris perpetually passing under the windows letters may have been wandering after me to that home in the rue de balzac which is to be the subject of more lawsuits between the man who let it to me and the man who wouldnt let me have possession than any other house that ever was built but i have had no letters at all and have beenha haa maniac since last monday  i will try my hand at that paper for h w tomorrow if i can get a yard of flooring to sit upon but we have really been in that state of topsyturvyhood that even that has been an unattainable luxury and may yet be for eightandforty hours or so for anything i see to the contrary

this afternoon i found your letter of yesterday awaiting me i send this reply by my brother alfred who is here and who returns home tomorrow you should get it at the office early on tuesday  i will go to work tomorrow and will send you please god an article by tuesdays post which you will get on wednesday forenoon look carefully to the proof as i shall not have time to receive it for correction when you arrange about sending your parcels will you ascertain and communicate to me the prices of telegraph messages it will save me trouble having no foreign servant though french is in that respect a trump and may be useful on an emergency  i have two floors hereentresol and firstin a dolls house but really pretty within and the view without astounding as you will say when you come the house is on the exposition side about half a quarter of a mile above franconis of course on the other side of the way and close to the jardin dhîver each room has but one window in it but we have no fewer than six rooms besides the back ones looking on the champs elysées with the wonderful life perpetually flowing up and down we have no spareroom but excellent stowage for the whole family including a capital dressingroom for me and a really slapup kitchen near the stairs damage for the whole seven hundred francs a month  but sirbutwhen georgina the servants and i were here for the first night catherine and the rest being at boulogne i heard georgy restlessturned outasked whats the matter oh its dreadfully dirty i cant sleep for the smell of my room imagine all my stagemanagerial energies multiplied at daybreak by a thousand imagine the porter the porters wife the porters wifes sister a feeble upholsterer of enormous age from round the corner and all his workmen four boys summoned imagine the partners in the proprietorship of the apartment and martial little man with françoisprussian beard also summoned imagine your inimitable chief briefly explaining that dirt is not in his way and that he is driven to madness and that he devotes himself to no coat and a dirty face until the apartment is thoroughly purified imagine coproprietors at first astounded then urging that its not the custom then wavering then affected then confiding their utmost private sorrows to the inimitable offering new carpets accepted embraces not accepted and really responding like french bricks sallow unbrushed unshorn awful stalks the inimitable through the apartment until last night then all the improvements were concluded and i do really believe the place to be now worth eight or nine hundred francs per month you must picture it as the smallest place you ever saw but as exquisitely cheerful and vivacious clean as anything human can be and with a moving panorama always outside which is paris in itself  you mention a letter from miss coutts as to mrs browns illness which you say is enclosed to mrs charles dickens  it is not enclosed and i am mad to know where she writes from that i may write to her pray set this right for her uneasiness will be greatly intensified if she have no word from me  i thought we were to give £1700 for the house at gads hill are we bound to £1800 considering the improvements to be made it is a little too much isnt it i have a strong impression that at the utmost we were only to divide the difference and not to pass £1750 you will set me right if i am wrong but i dont think i am  i write very hastily with the piano playing and alfred looking for this                                        ever my dear wills faithfully   sidenote mr w h wills                    49 avenue des champs elysÉes                                          wednesday oct 24th 1855  my dear wills  in the gads hill matter i too would like to try the effect of not budging so do not go beyond the £1700 considering what i should have to expend on the one hand and the low price of stock on the other i do not feel disposed to go beyond that mark they wont let a purchaser escape for the sake of the £100 i think and austin was strongly of opinion when i saw him last that £1700 was enough  you cannot think how pleasant it is to me to find myself generally known and liked here if i go into a shop to buy anything and give my card the officiating priest or priestess brightens up and says ah cest lécrivain célèbre monsieur porte un nom trèsdistingué mais je suis honoré et intéressé de voir monsieur dickin je lis un des livres de monsieur tous les jours in the moniteur and a man who brought some little vases home last night said on connaît bien en france que monsieur dickin prend sa position sur la dignité de la littérature ah cest grande chose et ses caractères this was to georgina while he unpacked sont si spirituellement tournées cette madame tojare todgers ah quelle est drôle et précisément comme une dame que je connais à calais  you cannot have any doubt about this place if you will only recollect it is the great main road from the place de la

1855  my dear regnier  in thanking you for the box you kindly sent me the day before yesterday let me thank you a thousand times for the delight we derived from the representation of your beautiful and admirable piece i have hardly ever been so affected and interested in any theatre its construction is in the highest degree excellent the interest absorbing and the whole conducted by a masterly hand to a touching and natural conclusion  through the whole story from beginning to end i recognise the true spirit and feeling of an artist and i most heartily offer you and your fellowlabourer my felicitations on the success you have achieved that it will prove a very great and a lasting one i cannot for a moment doubt  o my friend if i could see an english actress with but one hundredth part of the nature and art of madame plessy i should believe our english theatre to be in a fair way towards its regeneration but i have no hope of ever beholding such a phenomenon i may as well expect ever to see upon an english stage an accomplished artist able to write and to embody what he writes like you                                                  faithfully yours ever   sidenote madame

it back pray do nothing of the sort and allow me to have the great pleasure of sending you the succeeding numbers as they reach me i have had such delight in your great genius and have so high an interest in it and admiration of it that i am proud of the honour of giving you a moments intellectual pleasure                                      believe me very faithfully yours   sidenote the hon mrs watson                             tavistock house sunday dec 23rd 1855  my dear mrs watson  i have a moment in which to redeem my promise of putting you in possession of my little friend no 2 before the general public it is of course at the disposal of your circle but until the month is out is understood to be a prisoner in the castle  if i had time to write anything i should still quite vainly try to tell you what interest and happiness i had in once more seeing you among your dear children let me congratulate you on your eton boys they are so handsome frank and genuinely modest that they charmed me a kiss to the little fairhaired darling and the rest the love of my heart to every stone in the old house  enormous effect at sheffield but really not a better audience perceptively than at peterboro for that could hardly be but they were more enthusiastically demonstrative and they took the line and to tiny tim who did not die with a most prodigious shout and roll of thunder                            ever my dear friend most faithfully yours  footnotes  21 captain cavendish boyle was governor of the military prison at weedon  22 wife of the late sir joseph olliffe physician to the british embassy     1856  narrative   charles dickens having taken an appartement in paris for the winter months 49 avenue des champs elysées was there with his family until the middle of may he much enjoyed this winter sojourn meeting many old friends making new friends and interchanging hospitalities with the french artistic world he had also many friends from england to visit him mr wilkie collins had an appartement de garçon hard by and the two companions were constantly together the rev james white and his family also spent their winter at paris having taken an appartement at 49 avenue des champs elysées and the girls of the two families had the same masters and took their lessons together after the whites departure mr macready paid charles dickens a visit occupying the vacant appartement  during this winter charles dickens was however constantly backwards and forwards between paris and london on household words business and was also at work on his little dorrit  while in paris he sat for his portrait to the great ary scheffer it was exhibited at the royal academy exhibition of this year and is now in the national portrait gallery  the summer was again spent at boulogne and once more at the villa des moulineaux where he received constant visits from english friends mr wilkie collins taking up his quarters for many weeks at a little cottage in the garden and there the idea of another play to be acted at tavistock house was first started many of our letters for this year have reference to this play and will show the interest which charles dickens took in it and the immense amount of care and pains given by him to the careful carrying out of this favourite amusement  the christmas number of household words written by charles dickens and mr collins called the wreck of the golden mary was planned by the two friends during this summer holiday  it was in this year that one of the great wishes of his life was to be realised the muchcoveted housegads hill placehaving been purchased by him and the cheque written on the 14th of marchon a friday as he writes to his sisterinlaw in the letter of this date he frequently remarked that all the important and so far fortunate events of his life had happened to him on a friday so that contrary to the usual superstition that day had come to be looked upon by his family as his lucky day  the allusion to the plainness of miss boyles handwriting is goodhumouredly ironical that ladys writing being by no means famous for its legibility  the anne mentioned in the letter to his sisterinlaw which follows the one to miss boyle was the faithful servant who had lived with the family so long and who having left to be married the previous year had found it a very difficult matter to recover from her sorrow at this parting and the godfathers present was for a son of mr edmund yates  the humble petition was written to mr wilkie collins during that gentlemans visit to paris  the explanation of the remark to mr wills 6th april that he had paid the money to mr poole is that charles dickens was the trustee through whom the dramatist received his pension  the letter to the duke of devonshire has reference to the peace illuminations after the crimean war  the m forgues for whom at mr collinss request he writes a short biography of himself was the editor of the revue des deux mondes  the speech at the london tavern was on behalf of the artists benevolent fund  miss kate macready had sent some clever poems to household words with which charles dickens had been much pleased he makes allusion to these in our two remaining letters to mr macready  i did write it for you letter to mrs watson 17th october refers to that part of little dorrit which treats of the visit of the dorrit family to the great st bernard an expedition which it will be remembered he made himself in company with mr and mrs watson and other friends  the letter to mrs horne refers to a joke about the name of a friend of this ladys who had once been brought by her to tavistock house the letter to mr mitton concerns the lighting of the little theatre at tavistock house  our last letter is in answer to one from mr kent asking him to sit to mr john watkins for his photograph we should add however that he did subsequently give this gentleman some sittings   sidenote mr w h wills                           49 champs elysÉes sunday jan 6th 1856  my dear wills  i should like morley to do a strike article and to work into it the greater part of what is here but i cannot represent myself as holding the opinion that all strikes among this unhappy class of society who find it so difficult to get a peaceful hearing are always necessarily wrong because i dont think so to open a discussion of the question by saying that the men are of course entirely and painfully in the wrong surely would be monstrous in any one show them to be in the wrong here but in the name of the eternal heavens show why upon the merits of this question nor can i possibly adopt the representation that these men are wrong because by throwing themselves out of work they throw other people possibly without their consent if such a principle had anything in it there could have been no civil war no raising by hampden of a troop of horse to the detriment of buckinghamshire agriculture no selfsacrifice in the political world and o good god when  treats of the suffering of wife and children can he suppose that these mistaken men dont feel it in the depths of their hearts and dont honestly and honourably most devoutly and faithfully believe that for those very children when they shall have children they are bearing all these miseries now  i hear from mrs fillonneau that her husband was obliged to leave town suddenly before he could get your parcel consequently he has not brought it and whites sovereignsunless you have got them back againare either lying out of circulation somewhere or are being spent by somebody else i will write again on tuesday my article is to begin the enclosed                                                        ever faithfully   sidenote mr mark lemon                    49 champs elysÉes paris monday jan 7th 1856  my dear mark  i want to know how jack and the beanstalk goes i have a notion from a noticea favourable notice howeverwhich i saw in galignani that webster has let down the comic business  in a piece at the ambigu called the rentrée à paris a mere scene in honour of the return of the troops from the crimea the other day there is a novelty which i think it worth letting you know of as it is easily available either for a serious or a comic interestthe introduction of a supposed electric telegraph the scene is the railway terminus at paris with the electric telegraph office on the prompt side and the clerks with their backs to the audiencemuch more real than if they were as they infallibly would be staring about the houseworking the needles and the little bell perpetually ringing there are assembled to greet the soldiers all the easily and naturally imagined elements of interestold veteran fathers young children agonised mothers sisters and brothers girl loverseach impatient to know of his or her own object of solicitude enter to these a certain marquis full of sympathy for all who says my friends i am one of you my brother has no commission yet he is a common soldier i wait for him as well as all brothers and sisters here wait for their brothers tell me whom you are expecting then they all tell him then he goes into the telegraphoffice and sends a message down the line to know how long the troops will be bell rings answer handed out on slip of paper delay on the line troops will not arrive for a quarter of an hour general disappointment but we have this brave electric telegraph my friends says the marquis give me your little messages and ill send them off general rush round the marquis exclamations hows henri my love to georges has

andtroops have proceeded will arrive in half a minute after this mother abandons all hope general commiseration troops rush in down a platform son only wounded and embraces her  as i have said and as you will see this is available for any purpose but done with equal distinction and rapidity it is a tremendous effect and got by the simplest means in the world there is nothing in the piece but it was impossible not to be moved and excited by the telegraph part of it  i hope you have seen something of stanny and have been to pantomimes with him and have drunk to the absent dick i miss you my dear old boy at the play woefully and miss the walk home and the partings at the corner of tavistock square and when i go by myself i come home stewing little dorrit in my head and the best part of my play is or ought to be in gordon street  i have written to beaucourt about taking that breezy housea little improvedfor the summer and i hope you and yours will come there often and stay there long my present idea if nothing should arise to unroot me sooner is to stay here until the middle of may then plant the family at boulogne and come with catherine and georgy home for two or three weeks when i shall next run across i dont know but i suppose next month  we are up to our knees in mud here literally in vehement despair i walked down the avenue outside the barrière de lÉtoile here yesterday and went straight on among the trees i came back with topboots of mud on nothing will cleanse the streets numbers of men and women are for ever scooping and sweeping in them and they are always one lake of yellow mud all my trousers go to the tailors every day and are ravelled out at the heels every night washing is awful  tell mrs lemon with my love that i have bought her some eau dor in grateful remembrance of her knowing what it is and crushing the tyrant of her existence by resolutely refusing to be put down when that monster would have silenced her you may imagine the loves and messages that are now being poured in upon me by all of them so i will give none of them though i am pretending to be very scrupulous about it and am looking i have no doubt as if i were writing them down with the greatest care                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote mr w wilkie collins                        49 champs elysÉes saturday jan 19th 1856  my dear collins  i had no idea you were so far on with your book and heartily congratulate you on being within sight of land  it is excessively pleasant to me to get your letter as it opens a perspective of theatrical and other lounging evenings and also of articles in household words it will not be the first time that we shall have got on well in paris and i hope it will not be by many a time the last  i purpose coming over early in february as soon in fact as i shall have knocked out no 5 of little d and therefore we can return in a jovial manner together as soon as i know my day of coming over i will write to you again and as the merchantssay charleywould add communicate same to you  the lodging en garçon shall be duly looked up and i shall of course make a point of finding it close here there will be no difficulty in that i will have concluded the treaty before starting for london and will take it by the month both because that is the cheapest way and because desirable places dont let for shorter terms  i have been sitting to scheffer todayconceive this if you please with no 5 upon my soulfour hours i am so addleheaded and bored that if you were here i should propose an instantaneous rush to the trois frères under existing circumstances i have no consolation  i think the portrait23 is the most astounding thing ever beheld upon this globe it has been shrieked over by the united family as oh the very image i went down to the entresol the moment i opened it and submitted it to the plornthen engaged with a halffranc musket in capturing a malakhoff of chairs he looked at it very hard and gave it as his opinion that it was misser hegg we suppose him to have confounded the colonel with jollins i met madame georges sand the other day at a dinner got up by madame viardot for that great purpose the human mind cannot conceive any one more astonishingly opposed to all my preconceptions if i had been shown her in a state of repose and asked what i thought her to be i should have said the queens monthly nurse au reste she has nothing of the bas bleu about her and is very quiet and agreeable  the way in which mysterious frenchmen call and want to embrace me suggests to any one who knows me intimately such infamous lurking slinking getting behind doors evading lyingso much mean resort to craven flights dastard subterfuges and miserable poltrooneryon my part that i merely suggest the arrival of cards like this  illustration hw    horgues   homme de lettres   or   drouse   membre de linstitut   or   cregibus patalanternois   ecole des beaux arts    every five minutes books also arrive with on the flyleaf    jaubaud   hommage à lillustre romancier dangleterre    charles de kean  and i then write letters of terrific empressement with assurances of all sorts of profound considerations and never by any chance become visible to the naked eye  at the porte st martin they are doing the orestes put into french verse by alexandre dumas really one of the absurdest things i ever saw the scene of the tomb with all manner of classical females in black grouping themselves on the lid and on the steps and on each other and in every conceivable aspect of obtrusive impossibility is just like the window of one of those artists in hair who address the friends of deceased persons tomorrow week a fête is coming off at the jardin dhîver next door but one here which i must certainly go to the fête of the company of the folies nouvelles the ladies of the company are to keep stalls and are to sell to messieurs the amateurs orangewater and lemonade paul le grand is to promenade among the company dressed as pierrot kalm the bigfaced comic singer is to do the like dressed as a russian cossack the entertainments are to conclude with la polka des bêtes féroces par la troupe entière des folies nouvelles i wish without invasion of the rights of british subjects or risk of war  could be seized by french troops brought over and made to assist  the appartement has not grown any bigger since you last had the joy of beholding me and upon my honour and word i live in terror of asking  to dinner lest she should not be able to get in at the diningroom door i think am not sure the diningroom would hold her if she could be once passed in but i dont see my way to that nevertheless we manage our own family dinners very snugly there and have good ones as i think you will say every day at halfpast five  i have a notion that we may knock out a series of descriptions for h w without much trouble it is very difficult to get into the catacombs but my name is so well known here that i think i may succeed i find that the guillotine can be got set up in private like punchs show what do you think of that for an article i find myself underlining words constantly it is not my nature it is mere imbecility after the four hours sitting  all unite in kindest remembrances to you your mother and brother                                                         ever cordially   sidenote miss mary boyle                           49 champs elysÉes paris jan 28th 1856  my dear mary  i am afraid you will think me an abandoned ruffian for not having acknowledged your more than handsome warmhearted letter before now but as usual i have been so occupied and so glad to get up from my desk and wallow in the mud at present about six feet deep here that pleasure correspondence is just the last thing in the world i have had leisure to take to business correspondence with all sorts and conditions of men and women o my mary is one of the dragons i am perpetually fighting and the more i throw it the more it stands upon its hind legs rampant and throws me  yes on that bright cold morning when i left peterboro i felt that the best thing i could do was to say that word that i would do anything in an honest way to avoid saying at one blow and make off i was so sorry to leave you all you can scarcely imagine what a chill and blank i felt on that monday evening at rockingham it was so sad to me and engendered a constraint so melancholy and peculiar that i doubt if i were ever much more out of sorts in my life next morning when it was light and sparkling out of doors i felt more at home again but when i came in from seeing poor dear watsons grave mrs watson asked me to go up in the gallery which i had last seen in the days of our merry play we went up and walked into the very part he had made and was so fond of and she looked out of one window and i looked out of another and for the life of me i could not decide in my own heart whether i should console or distress her by going and taking her hand and saying something of what was naturally in my mind so i said nothing and we came out again and on the whole perhaps it was best for i have no doubt we understood each other very well without speaking a word  sheffield was a tremendous success and an admirable audience they made me a present of tablecutlery after the reading was over and i came away by the mailtrain within threequarters of an hour changing my dress and getting on my wrappers partly in the fly partly at the inn partly on the platform when we got among the lincolnshire fens it began to snow that changed to sleet that changed to rain the frost was all gone as we neared london and the mud has all come at two or three oclock in the morning i stopped at peterboro again and thought of you all disconsolately the lady in the refreshmentroom was very hard upon me harder even than those fair enslavers usually are she gave me a cup of tea as if i were a hyena and she my cruel keeper with a strong dislike to me i mingled my tears with it and had a petrified bun of enormous antiquity in miserable meekness  it is clear to me that climates are gradually assimilating over a great part of the world and that in the most miserable part of our year there is very little to choose between london and paris except that london is not so muddy i have never seen dirtier or worse weather than we have had here since i returned in desperation i went out to the barrières last sunday on a headlong walk and came back with my very eyebrows smeared with mud georgina is usually invisible during the walking time of the day a turnedup nose may be seen in the midst of splashes but nothing more  i am settling to work again and my horrible restlessness immediately assails me it belongs to such times as i was writing the preceding page it suddenly came into my head that i would get up and go to calais i dont know why the moment i got there i should want to go somewhere else but as my friend the boots says see christmas number household words when you come to think what a game youve been up to ever since you was in your own cradle and what a poor sort of a chap you were and how its always yesterday with you or else tomorrow and never today thats where it is  my dear mary would you favour me with the name and address of the professor that taught you writing for i want to improve myself many a hand have i seen with many characteristics of beauty in itsome loopy some dashy some large some small some sloping to the right some sloping to the left some not sloping at all but what i like in your hand mary is its plainness it is like print them as runs may read just as well as if they stood still i should have thought it was copperplate if i hadnt known you they send all sorts of messages from here and so do i with my best regards to bedgy and pardner and the blessed babbies when shall we meet again i wonder and go somewhere ah

know that you have an objection which you once communicated to me i still hold as i did then that it is a reason for and not against pray reconsider the point your position in connection with dramatic literature has always suggested to me that there would be a great fitness and grace in your appearing in this post i am convinced that the public would regard it in that light and i particularly ask you to reflect that we never can do battle with the lords if we will not bestow ourselves to go into places which they have long monopolised now pray discuss this matter with yourself once more if you can come to a favourable conclusion i shall be really delighted and will of course come from paris to be by you if you cannot come to a favourable conclusion i shall be really sorry though i of course

yesterday evening webster mark stanny and i went to the olympic where the wigans ranged us in a row in a gorgeous and immense private box and where we saw still waters run deep i laughed in a conspicuous manner to that extent at emery when he received the dinnercompany that the people were more amused by me than by the piece i dont think i ever saw anything meant to be funny that struck me as so extraordinarily droll i couldnt get over it at all after the piece we went round by wigans invitation to drink with him it being positively impossible to get stanny off the stage we stood in the wings during the burlesque mrs wigan seemed really glad to see her old manager and the company overwhelmed him with embraces they had nearly all been at the meeting in the morning  i have seen charley

if i could arrange for a certain day i would secure them we cannot afford you and i i mean to keep much company because we shall have to look in at a theatre or so i daresay  it would suit my work best if i could keep myself clear until monday the 7th of april but in case that day should be too late for the beginning of your brief visit with a deference to any other engagements you have in contemplation then fix an earlier one and i will make little dorrit curtsy to it my recent visit to london and my having only just now come back have thrown me a little behindhand but i hope to come up with a wet sail in a few days  you should have seen the ruins of covent garden theatre i went in the moment i got to londonfour days after the fire although the audience part and the stage were so tremendously burnt out that there was not a piece of wood half the size of a lucifermatch for the eye to rest on though nothing whatever remained but bricks and smelted iron lying on a great black desert the theatre still looked so wonderfully like its old self grown gigantic that i never saw so strange a sight the wall dividing the front from the stage still remained and the iron passdoors stood ajar in an impossible and inaccessible frame the arches that supported the stage were there and the arches that supported the pit and in the centre of the latter lay something like a titanic grapevine that a hurricane had pulled up by the roots twisted and flung down there this was the great chandelier gye had kept the mens wardrobe at the top of the house over the great entrance staircase when the roof fell in it came down bodily and all that part of the ruins was like an old babylonic pavement bright rays tesselating the black ground sometimes in pieces so large that i could make out the clothes in the trovatore  i should run on for a couple of hours if i had to describe the spectacle as i saw it wherefore i will immediately muzzle myself all here unite in kindest loves

idea of your coming see how naturally i use the word when i am three hundred miles off to london so soon i would never have written one word about the jump over next week i am vexed that i did so but as i did i will not now propose a change in the arrangements as i know how methodical you tremendously old fellows are thats your secret i suspect thats the way in which the blood of the mirabels

because we shall wait dinner for you and you will merely have to tell that driver in the glazed hat to come straight here when the whites left i added their little apartment to this little apartment

and have not begun little dorrit no 8 yet but i took twentymile walks in the fresh air and perhaps in the long run did better than if i had been at work the report concerning scheffers portrait i had from ward it is in the best place in the largest room but i find the general impression of the artists exactly mine they almost all say that it wants something that nobody could mistake whom it was meant for but that it has something disappointing in it etc etc stanfield likes it better than any of the other painters i think his own picture is magnificent and frith in a little childs birthday party is quite delightful there are many interesting pictures when you see scheffer tell him from me that eastlake in his speech at the dinner referred to the portrait as a contribution from a distinguished man of genius in france worthy of himself and of his subject  i did the maddest thing last night and am deeply penitent this morning we stayed at websters till any hour and they wanted me at last to make punch which couldnt be done when the jug was brought because to websters burning indignation there was only one lemon in the house hereupon i then and there besought the establishment in general to come and drink punch on thursday night after the play on which occasion it will become necessary to furnish fully the table with some cold viands from fortnum and masons mark has looked in since i began this note to suggest that the great festival may come off at household words instead i am inclined to think it a good idea and that i shall transfer the locality to that business establishment but i am at present distracted with doubts and torn by remorse  the schoolroom and diningroom i have brought into habitable condition and comfortable appearance charley and i breakfast at halfpast eight and meet again at dinner when he does not dine in the city or has no engagement he looks very well  the audiences at gyes are described to me as absolute marvels of coldness no signs of emotion can be hammered out of them panizzi sat next me at the academy dinner and took it very ill that i disparaged  the amateurs here are getting up another pantomime but quarrel so violently among themselves that i doubt its ever getting on the stage webster expounded his scheme for rebuilding the adelphi to stanfield and myself last night and i felt bound to tell him that i thought it wrong from beginning to end this is all the theatrical news i know  i write by this post to georgy love to mamey katey harry and the noble plorn i should be glad to see him here

surprised to hear that i have done nothing yet except for h w and have only just settled down into a corner of the schoolroom the extent to which john and i wallowed in dust for four hours yesterday morning getting things neat and comfortable about us you may faintly imagine at four in the afternoon came stanfield to whom i no sooner described the notion of the new play than he immediately upset all my new arrangements by making a proscenium of the chairs and planning the scenery with walkingsticks one of the least things he did was getting on the top of the long table and hanging over the bar in the middle window where that top sash opens as if he had got a hinge in the middle of his body he is immensely excited on the subject mark had a farce ready for the managerial perusal but it wont do  i went to the dover theatre on friday night which was a miserable spectacle the pit is boarded over and it is a drinking and smoking place it was for the benefit of mrs  and the town had been very extensively placarded with dont forget friday i made out four and ninepence i am serious in the house when i went in we may have warmed up in the course of the evening to twelve shillings a jew played the grand piano mrs  sang no end of songs with not a bad voice poor creature mr  sang comic songs fearfully and danced clog hornpipes capitally and a miserable woman shivering in a shawl and bonnet sat in the sideboxes all the evening nursing master  aged seven months it was a most forlorn business and i should have contributed a sovereign to the treasury if i had known how  i walked to deal and back that day and on the previous day walked over the downs towards canterbury in a gale of wind it was better than still weather after all being wonderfully fresh and free  if the plorn were sitting at this schoolroom window in the corner he would see more cats in an hour than he ever saw in his life i never saw so many i think as i have seen since yesterday morning  there is a painful picture of a great deal of merit egg has bought it in the exhibition painted by the man who did those little interiors of forsters it is called the death of chatterton the dead figure is a good deal like arthur stone and i was touched on saturday to see that tender old file standing before it crying under his spectacles at the idea of seeing his son dead it was a very tender manifestation of his gentle old heart  this sums up my news which is no news at all kiss the plorn for me and expound to him that i am always looking forward to meeting him again among the birds and flowers in the garden

much correctness in itany biographical account of myself i mean i do not supply such particulars when i am asked for them by editors and compilers simply because i am asked for them every day if you want to prime forgues you may tell him without fear of anything wrong that i was born at portsmouth on the 7th of february 1812 that my father was in the navy pay office that i was taken by him to chatham when i was very young and lived and was educated there till i was twelve or thirteen i suppose that i was then put to a school near london where as at other places i distinguished myself like a brick that i was put in the office of a solicitor a friend of my fathers and didnt much like it and after a couple of years as well as i can remember applied myself with a celestial or diabolical energy to the study of such things as would qualify me to be a firstrate parliamentary reporterat that time a calling pursued by many clever men who were young at the bar that i made my début in the gallery at about eighteen i suppose engaged on a voluminous publication no longer in existence called the mirror of parliament that when the morning chronicle was purchased by sir john easthope and acquired a large circulation i was engaged there and that i remained there until i had begun to publish pickwick when i found myself in a condition to relinquish that part of my labours that i left the reputation behind me of being the best and most rapid reporter ever known and that i could do anything in that way under any sort of circumstances and often did i daresay i am at this present writing the best shorthand writer in the world  that i began without any interest or introduction of any kind to write fugitive pieces for the old monthly magazine when i was in the gallery for the mirror of parliament that my faculty for descriptive writing was seized upon the moment i joined the morning chronicle and that i was liberally paid there and handsomely acknowledged and wrote the greater part of the short descriptive sketches by boz in that paper that i had been a writer when i was a mere baby and always an actor from the same age that i married the daughter of a writer to the signet in edinburgh who was the great friend and assistant of scott and who first made lockhart known to him  and that here i am  finally if you want any dates of publication of books tell wills and hell get them for you  this is the first time i ever set down even these particulars and glancing them over i feel like a wild beast in a caravan describing himself in the keepers absence

improved the garden upon my life i believe there are at least twenty distinct smokingspots expressly made in it  and as soon as you can see your day in next month for coming over with stanny and webster will you let them both know i should not be very much surprised if i were to come over and fetch you when i know what your day is indeed i dont see how you could get across properly without me  there is a fête here tonight in honour of the imperial baptism and there will be another tomorrow the plorn has put on two bits of ribbon one pink and one blue which he calls companys to celebrate the occasion the fact that the receipts of the fêtes are to be given to the sufferers by the late floods reminds me that you will find at the passport office a tinbox condescendingly and considerately labelled in english                           for the overflowings  which the chief officer clearly believes to mean for the sufferers from the inundations  i observe more mingles in the laundresses shops and one inscription which looks like the name of a duet or chorus in a playbill here they mingle  will you congratulate mrs lemon with our loves on her gallant victory over the recreant cabman

and shiver and that you have stated times for doing so like the demons in the melodramas and that you mean to take a week to get well in  make haste about it like a dear fellow and keep up your spirits because i have made a bargain with stanny and webster that they shall come to boulogne tomorrow week thursday the 10th and stay a week and you know how much pleasure we shall all miss if you are not among usat least for some part of the time  if you find any unusually light appearance in the air at brighton it is a distant refraction i have no doubt of the gorgeous and shining surface of tavistock house now transcendently painted the theatre partition is put up and is a work of such terrific solidity that i suppose it will be dug up ages hence from the ruins of london by that australian of macaulays who is to be impressed by its ashes i have wandered through the spectral halls of the tavistock mansion two nights with feelings of the profoundest depression i have breakfasted there like a criminal in pentonville only not so well it is more like westminster abbey by midnight than the lowestspirited mansay you at present for examplecan well imagine  there has been a wonderful robbery at folkestone by the new manager of the pavilion who succeeded giovannini he had in keeping £16000 of a foreigners and bolted with it as he supposed but in reality with only £1400 of it the frenchman had previously bolted with the whole which was the property of his mother with him to england the frenchman brought a lady who was all the time and at the same time endeavouring to steal all the money from him and bolt with it herself the details are amazing and all the money a few pounds excepted has been got back  they will be full of sympathy and talk about you when i get home and i shall tell them that i send their loves beforehand they are all enclosed the moment you feel hearty just write me that word by post i shall be so delighted to receive it

evening july 5th 1856  my dear landor  i write to you so often in my books and my writing of letters is usually so confined to the numbers that i must write and in which i have no kind of satisfaction that i am afraid to think how long it is since we exchanged a direct letter but talking to your namesake this very day at dinner it suddenly entered my head that i would come into my room here as soon as dinner should be over and write my dear landor how are you for the pleasure of having the answer under your own hand that you do write and that pretty often i know beforehand else why do i read the examiner  we were in paris from october to may i perpetually flying between that city and london and there we found out by a blessed accident that your godson was horribly deaf i immediately consulted the principal physician of the deaf and dumb institution there one of the best aurists in europe and he kept the boy for three months and took unheardof pains with him he is now quite recovered has done extremely well at school has brought home a prize in triumph and will be eligible to go up for his india examination soon after next easter having a direct appointment he will probably be sent out soon after he has passed and so will fall into that strange life up the country before he well knows he is alive which indeed seems to be rather an advanced stage of knowledge  and there in paris at the same time i found marguerite power and little nelly living with their mother and a pretty sister in a very small neat apartment and working as marguerite told me hard for a living all that i saw of them filled me with respect and revived the tenderest remembrances of gore house they are coming to pass two or three weeks here for a country rest next month we had many long talks concerning gore house and all its bright associations and i can honestly report that they hold no one in more gentle and affectionate remembrance than you marguerite is still handsome though she had the smallpox two or three years ago and bears the traces of it here and there by daylight poor little nelly the quicker and more observant of the two shows some little tokens of a brokenoff marriage in a face too careworn for her years but is a very winning and sensible creature  we are expecting mary boyle too shortly  i have just been propounding to forster if it is not a wonderful testimony to the homely force of truth that one of the most popular books on earth has nothing in it to make anyone laugh or cry yet i think with some confidence that you never did either over any passage in robinson crusoe in particular i took fridays death as one of the least tender and in the true sense least sentimental things ever written it is a book i read very much and the wonder of its prodigious effect on me and everyone and the admiration thereof grows on me the more i observe this curious fact  kate and georgina send you their kindest loves and smile approvingly on me from the next room as i bend over my desk my dear landor you see many i daresay and hear from many i have no doubt who love you heartily but we silent people in the distance never forget you do not forget us and let us exchange

           saturday night july 5th 1856  my dear duke of devonshire  from this place where i am writing my way through the summer in the midst of rosy gardens and sea airs i cannot forbear writing to tell you with what uncommon pleasure i received your interesting letter and how sensible i always am of your kindness and generosity you were always in the mind of my household during your illness and to have so beautiful and fresh and manly an assurance of your recovery from it under your own hand is a privilege and delight that i will say no more of  i am so glad you like flora it came into my head one day that we have all had our floras and that it was a halfserious halfridiculous truth which had never been told it is a wonderful gratification to me to find that everybody knows her indeed some people seem to think i have done them a personal injury and that their individual floras god knows where they are or who are each and all little dorrits  we were all grievously disappointed that you were ill when we played mr collinss lighthouse at my house if you had been well i should have waited upon you with my humble petition that you would come and see it and if you had come i think you would have cried which would have charmed me i hope to produce another play at home next christmas and if i can only persuade you to see it from a special armchair and can only make you wretched my satisfaction will be intense may i tell you to beguile a moment of a little tag or end of a piece i saw in paris this last winter which struck me as the prettiest i had ever met with the piece was not a new one but a revival at the vaudevilleles mémoires du diable admirably constructed very interesting and extremely well played the plot is that a certain m robin has come into possession of the papers of a deceased lawyer and finds some relating to the wrongful withholding of an estate from a certain baroness and to certain other frauds involving even the denial of the marriage to the deceased baron and the tarnishing of his good name which are so very wicked that he binds them up in a book and labels them mémoires du diable armed with this knowledge he goes down to the desolate old château in the countrypart of the wrestedaway estatefrom which the baroness and her daughter are going to be ejected he informs the mother that he can right her and restore the property but must have as his reward her daughters hand in marriage she replies i cannot promise my daughter to a man of whom i know nothing the gain would be an unspeakable happiness but i resolutely decline the bargain the daughter however has observed all and she comes forward and says do what you have promised my mother you can do and i am yours then the piece goes on to its development in an admirable way through the unmasking of all the hypocrites now m robin partly through his knowledge of the secret ways of the old château derived from the lawyers papers and partly through his going to a masquerade as the devilthe better to explode what he knows on the hypocritesis supposed by the servants at the château really to be the devil at the opening of the last act he suddenly appears there before the young lady and she screams but recovering and laughing says you are not really the  oh dear no he replies have no connection with him but these people down here are so frightened and absurd see this little toy on the table i open it heres a little bell they have a notion that whenever this bell rings i shall appear very ignorant is it not very indeed says she well says m robin if you should want me very much to appear try the bell if only for a jest will you promise yes she promises and the play goes on at last he has righted the baroness completely and has only to hand her the last document which proves her marriage and restores her good name then he says madame in the progress of these endeavours i have learnt the happiness of doing good for its own sake i made a necessary bargain with you i release you from it i have done what i undertook to do i wish you and your amiable daughter all happiness adieu i take my leave bows himself out people on the stage astonished audience astonishedincensed the daughter is going to cry when she looks at the box on the table remembers the bell runs to it and rings it and he rushes back and takes her to his heart upon which we all cry with pleasure and then laugh heartily  this looks dreadfully long and perhaps you know it already if so i will endeavour to make amends with flora in future numbers  mrs dickens and her sister beg to present their remembrances to your grace and their congratulations on your recovery i saw paxton now and then when you were ill and always received from him most encouraging accounts i dont know how heavy he is going to be i mean in the scale but i begin to think daniel lambert must have been in his family                                 ever your graces faithful and obliged   sidenote mr w c

if anybody else had told me that i should have stared nevertheless i derived an impression from his manner that she had not been a profitable speculation in respect of money that very same day stanfield and i dined alone together at the garrick and drank your health we had had a ride by the river before dinner of course he would go and look at boats and had been talking of you it was this day week bythebye  i know of nothing of public interest that is new in france except that i am changing my moustache into a beard we all send our most tender loves to dearest miss macready and all the house the hammy boy is particularly anxious to have his love sent to misr creedy                          ever my dearest macready                                             most affectionately yours   sidenote mr w wilkie collins              villa des moulineaux boulogne sunday july 13th 1856  my dear collins  we are all sorry that you are not coming until the middle of next month but we hope that you will then be able to remain so that we may all come back together about the 10th of october i think recreation allowed etc that the play will take that time to write the ladies of the dram pers are frightfully anxious to get it under way and to see you locked up in the pavilion apropos of which noble edifice i have omitted to mention that it is made a more secluded retreat than it used to be and is greatly improved by the position of the door being changed it is as snug and as pleasant as possible and the genius of order has made a few little improvements about the house at the rate of about tenpence apiece which the genius of disorder will it is hoped appreciate  i think i must come over for a small spree and to fetch you suppose i were to come on the 9th or 10th of august to stay three or four days in town would that do for you let me know at the end of this month  i cannot tell you what a high opinion i have of anne rodway i took extracts out of the title because it conveyed to the manyheaded an idea of incompletenessof something unfinishedand is likely to stall some readers off i read the first part at the office with strong admiration and read the second on the railway coming back here being in town just after you had started on your cruise my behaviour before my fellowpassengers was weak in the extreme for i cried as much as you could possibly desire apart from the genuine force and beauty of the little narrative and the admirable personation of the girls identity and point of view it is done with an amount of honest pains and devotion to the work which few men have better reason to appreciate than i and which no man can have a more profound respect for i think it excellent feel a personal pride and pleasure in it which is a delightful sensation and know no one else who could have done it  of myself i have only to report that i have been hard at it with little dorrit and am now doing no 10 this last week i sketched out the notion characters and progress of the farce and sent it off to mark who has been ill of an ague it ought to be very funny the cat business is too ludicrous to be treated of in so small a sheet of paper so i must describe it vivâ voce when i come to town french has been so insufferably conceited since he shot tigerish cat no 1 intent on the noble dick with green eyes three inches in advance of her head that i am afraid i shall have to part with him all the boys likewise in new clothes and ready for church are at this instant prone on their stomachs behind bushes whooshing and crying after tigerish cat no 2 french here she comes there she goes etc i dare not put my head out of window for fear of being shot it is as like a coup détat as possible and tradesmen coming up the avenue cry plaintively ne tirez pas monsieur fleench cest moiboulanger ne tirez pas mon ami  likewise i shall have to recount to you the secret history of a robbery at the pavilion at folkestone which you will have to write  tell piggot when you see him that we shall all be much pleased if he will come at his own convenience while you are here and stay a few days with us  i shall have more than one notion of future work to suggest to you while we are beguiling the dreariness of an arctic winter in these parts may they prosper  kind regards from all to the dramatic poet of the establishment and to the d ps mother and brother                                                             ever yours  psif the flying dutchman should be done again pray do go and see it webster expressed his opinion to me that it was a neat piece i implore you to go and see a neat piece   sidenote mr w h wills                                 boulogne thursday august 7th 1856  my dear wills  i do not feel disposed to record those two chancery cases firstly because i would rather have no part in engendering in the mind of any human creature a hopeful confidence in that den of iniquity  and secondly because it seems to me that the real philosophy of the facts is altogether missed in the narrative the wrong which chanced to be set right in these two cases was done as all such wrong is mainly because these wicked courts of equity with all their means of evasion and postponement give scoundrels confidence in cheating if justice were cheap sure and speedy few such things could be it is because it has become through the vile dealing of those courts and the vermin they have called into existence a positive precept of experience that a man had better endure a great wrong than go or suffer himself to be taken into chancery with the dream of setting it right it is because of this that such nefarious speculations are made  therefore i see nothing at all to the credit of chancery in these cases but everything to its discredit and as to owing it to chancery to bear testimony to its having rendered justice in two such plain matters i have no debt of the kind upon my conscience                                              in haste ever faithfully   sidenote mr w c macready                                   boulogne friday august 8th 1856  my dearest macready  i like the second little poem very much indeed and think as you do that it is a great advance upon the first please to note that i make it a rule to pay for everything that is inserted in household words holding it to be a part of my trust to make my fellowproprietors understand that they have no right to unrequited labour therefore when wills who has been ill and is gone for a holiday does his invariable spiriting gently dont make kateys case different from adelaide procters  i am afraid there is no possibility of my reading dorsetshirewards i have made many conditional promises thus i am very much occupied but if i read at all i will read for your institution in such an order on my list edinburgh which is no 1 i have been obliged to put as far off as next christmas twelvemonth bristol stands next the working men at preston come next and so if i were to go out of the record and read for your people i should bring such a house about my ears as would shake little dorrit out of my head  being in town last saturday i went to see robson in a burlesque of medea it is an odd but perfectly true testimony to the extraordinary power of his performance which is of a very remarkable kind indeed that it points the badness of s acting in a most singular manner by bringing out what she might do and does not the scene with jason is perfectly terrific and the manner in which the comic rage and jealousy does not pitch itself over the floor at the stalls is in striking contrast to the manner in which the tragic rage and jealousy does he has a frantic song and dagger dance about ten minutes long altogether which has more passion in it than  could express in fifty years  we all unite in kindest love to miss macready and all your dear ones not forgetting my godson to whom i send his godfathers particular love twice over the hammy boy is so brown that you would scarcely know him                           ever my dear macready affectionately yours   sidenote mr w h wills                    tavistock house sunday morning sept 28th 1856  my dear wills  i suddenly remember this morning that in mr curtiss article health and education i left a line which must come out it is in effect that the want of healthy training leaves girls in a fit state to be the subjects of mesmerism i would not on any condition hurt elliotsons feelings as i should deeply by leaving that depreciatory kind of reference in any page of h w he has suffered quite enough without a stab from a friend so pray whatever the inconvenience may be in what bradbury calls the friars take that passage out by some extraordinary accident after observing it i forgot to do it                                                        ever faithfully   sidenote miss dickens                             tavistock house saturday oct 4th 1856  my dear mamey  the preparations for the play are already beginning and it is christened this is a great dramatic secret which i suppose you know already the frozen deep  tell katey with my best love that if she fail to come back six times as red hungry and strong as she was when she went away i shall give her part to somebody else  we shall all be very glad to see you both back again when i say we i include the birds who send their respectful duty and the plorn  kind regards to all at brighton                          ever my dear mamey your affectionate father   sidenote the hon mrs watson                             tavistock house tuesday oct 7th 1856  my dear mrs watson  i did write it for you and i hoped in writing it that you would think so all those remembrances are fresh in my mind as they often are and gave me an extraordinary interest in recalling the past i should have been grievously disappointed if you had not been pleased for i took aim at you with a most determined intention  let me congratulate you most heartily on your handsome eddy having passed his examination with such credit i am sure there is a spirit shining out of his eyes which will do well in that manly and generous pursuit you will naturally feel his departure very much and so will he but i have always observed within my experience that the men who have left home young have many long years afterwards had the tenderest love for it and for all associated with it thats a pleasant thing to think of as one of the wise and benevolent adjustments in these lives of ours  i have been so hard at work and shall be for the next eight or nine months that sometimes i fancy i have a digestion or a head or nerves or some odd encumbrance of that kind to which i am altogether unaccustomed and am obliged to rush at some other object for relief at present the house is in a state of tremendous excitement on account of mr collins having nearly finished the new play we are to act at christmas which is very interesting and extremely clever i hope this time you will come and see it we purpose producing it on charleys birthday twelfth night but we shall probably play four nights altogetherthe lighthouse on the last occasionso that if you could come for the two last nights you would see both the pieces i am going to try and do better than ever and already the schoolroom is in the hands of carpenters men from underground habitations in theatres who look as if they lived entirely upon smoke and gas meet me at unheardof hours mr stanfield is perpetually measuring the boards with a chalked piece of string and an umbrella and all the elder children are wildly punctual and businesslike to attract managerial commendation if you dont come i shall do something antagonistictry to unwrite no 11 i think i should particularly like you to see a new and serious piece so done because i dont think you know without seeing how good it is  none of the children suffered thank god from the boulogne risk the three little boys have gone back to school there and are all well katey came away ill but it turned out that she had the whoopingcough for the second time she has been to brighton and comes home today i hear great accounts of her and hope to find her quite well when she arrives presently i am afraid mary boyle has been praising the boulogne life too highly not that i deny however our having passed some very pleasant days together and our having had great pleasure in her visit  you will object to me dreadfully i know with a beard though not a great one but if you come and see the play you will find it necessary there and will perhaps be more tolerant of the fearful object afterwards i need not tell you how delighted we should be to see george if you would come together pray tell him so with my kind regards i like the notion of wentworth and his philosophy of all things i remember a philosophical gravity upon him a state of suspended opinion as to myself it struck me when we last met in which i thought there was a great deal of oddity and character  charley is doing very well at barings and attracting praise and reward to himself within this fortnight there turned up from the west indies where he is now a chief justice an old friend of mine of my own age who lived with me in lodgings in the adelphi when i was just charleys age he had a great affection for me at that time and always supposed i was to do some sort of wonders it was a very pleasant meeting indeed and he seemed to think it so odd that i shouldnt be charley  this is every atom of nonews that will come out of my head and i firmly believe it is all i have in itexcept that a cobbler at boulogne who had the nicest of little dogs that always sat in his sunny window watching him at work asked me if i would bring the dog home as he couldnt afford to pay the tax for him the cobbler and the dog being both my particular friends i complied the cobbler parted with the dog heartbroken when the dog got home here my man like an idiot as he is tied him up and then untied him the moment the gate was open the dog on the very day after his arrival ran out next day georgy and i saw him lying all covered with mud dead outside the neighbouring church how am i ever to tell the cobbler he is too poor to come to england so i feel that i must lie to him for life and say that the dog is fat and happy mr plornish much affected by this tragedy said i spose pa i shall meet the cobblers dog in heaven  georgy and catherine send their best love and i send mine pray write to me again some day and i cant be too busy to be happy in the sight of your familiar hand associated in my mind with so much that i love and honour                        ever my dear mr watson most faithfully yours   sidenote mrs horne

interval  and she is near you is she o i remember her well and i am still of my old opinion passionately devoted to her sex as i am they are the weakness of my existence i still consider her a failure she had some extraordinary christianname which i forget lashed into verse by my feelings i am inclined to write          my heart disowns         ophelia jones  only i think it was a more sounding

will grace it with your presence there is not one of the old actors whom you will fail to inspire as no one else can and i hope you will see a little result of a friendly union of the arts that you may think worth seeing and that you can see nowhere else  we propose repeating it on thursday the 8th monday the 12th and wednesday the 14th of january i do not encumber this note with so many bills and merely mention those nights in case any one of them should be more convenient to you than the first  but i shall hope for the first unless you dash me n bi put flora into the current number on purpose that this might catch you softened towards me and at a disadvantage if there is hope of your coming i will have the play clearly copied and will send it to you to read beforehand with the most grateful remembrances and the sincerest good wishes for your health and happiness                        i am ever my dear duke of devonshire                                             your faithful

wills described him as not very pleasant in his manners i derived the impression that he was so exceedingly dry that if he ever takes fire he must burn out and can never otherwise be extinguished  next day i received a letter from the secretary to say that the said surveyor had reported great additional risk from fire and that the directors at their meeting next tuesday would settle the extra amount of premium to be paid  thereupon i thought the matter was becoming complicated and wrote a commonsense note to the secretary which i begged might be read to the directors saying that i was quite prepared to pay any extra premium but setting forth the plain state of the case i did not say that the lord chief justice the chief baron and half the bench were coming though i felt a temptation to make a joke about burning them all  finally this morning comes up the secretary to me yesterday having been the great tuesday and says that he is requested by the directors to present their compliments and to say that they could not think of charging for any additional risk at all feeling convinced that i would place the gas which they considered to be the only danger under the charge of one competent man i then explained to him how carefully and systematically that was all arranged and we parted with drums beating and colours flying on both sides                                                        ever faithfully   sidenote mr w c macready                   tavistock house saturday evening dec 13th 1856  my dearest macready  we shall be charmed to squeeze willies

about the story not because it is otherwise than exceedingly pretty but because i am rather in a difficult position as to stories just now besides beginning a long one by collins with the new year which will last five or six months i have as i always have at this time a considerable residue of stories written for the christmas number not suitable to it and yet available for the general purposes of household words this limits my choice for the moment to stories that have some decided specialties or a great deal of story in them  but i will look over the accumulation before you come and i hope you will never see your little friend again but in print  you will find us expecting you on the night of the twentyfourth and heartily glad to welcome you the most terrific preparations are in hand

your request  scarcely a week passes without my receiving requests from various quarters to sit for likenesses to be taken by all the processes ever invented apart from my having an invincible objection to the multiplication of my countenance in the shopwindows i have not between my avocations and my needful recreation the time to comply with these proposals at this moment there are three cases out of a vast number in which i have said if i sit at all it shall be to you first to you second and to you third but i assure you i consider myself almost as unlikely to go through these three conditional achievements as i am to go to china judge when i am likely to get to mr watkins  i highly esteem and thank you for your sympathy with my writings i doubt if i have a more genial reader in
