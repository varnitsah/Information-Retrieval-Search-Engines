scribners sons                         1904     preface to the seventh volume   of the seventythree epigrams and jeux desprit which are printed at the commencement of this volume fortyfive were included in murrays onevolume edition of 1837 eighteen have been collected from various publications and ten are printed and published for the first time  the devils drive which appears in moores letters and journals and in the sixth volume of the collected edition of 1831 as an unfinished fragment of ninetyseven lines is now printed and published for the first time in its entirety 248 lines from a ms in the possession of the earl of ilchester a farewell petition to jch esq my boy hobbie o love and death and last words on greece are reprinted from the first volume of murrays magazine 1887  a few imperfect and worthless poems remain in ms but with these and one or two other unimportant exceptions the present edition of the poetical works may be regarded as complete  in compiling a bibliography of the successive editions and translations of lord byrons poetical works i have endeavoured in the first instance to give a full and particular account of the collected editions and separate issues of the poems and dramas which were open to my inspection and secondly to extract from general bibliographies catalogues of public and private libraries and other sources bibliographical records of editions which i have been unable to examine and were known to me only at secondhand it will be observed that the titlepages of editions which have passed through my hands are aligned the titles of all other editions are italicized  i cannot pretend that this assortment of bibliographical entries is even approximately exhaustive but as a sample of a bibliography it will i trust with all its imperfections be of service to the student of literature if not to the amateur or bibliophile with regard to nomenclature and other technicalities my aim has been to put the necessary information as clearly and as concisely as possible rather than to comply with the requirements of this or that formula but the path of the bibliographer is beset with difficulties al sirats archthe bridge of breadth narrower than the thread of a famished spider and sharper than the edge of a sword see the giaour line 483 note iaffords an easier and a safer foothold  to the general reader a bibliography says little or nothing but in one respect a bibliography of byron is of popular import it affords scientific proof of an almost unexampled fame of a farreaching and still potent influence teuton and latin and slav have taken byron to themselves and have made him their own no other english poet except shakespeare has been so widely read and so frequently translated of manfred i reckon one bohemian translation two danish two dutch three french nine german three hungarian three italian two polish one romaic one roumanian four russian and three spanish translations and in all probability there are others which have escaped my net the question the inevitable question ariseswhat was what is the secret of byrons continental vogue and why has his fame gone out into all lands why did goethe enshrine him in the second part of faust as the representative of the modern era  undoubtedly to be regarded as the greatest genius of our century conversations of goethe 1874 p 265  it is said and with truth that byrons revolutionary politics commended him to oppressed nationalities and their sympathizers that he was against the tramplerscastlereagh and the duke of wellington and the holy alliance that he stood for liberty another point in his favour was his freedom from cant his indifference to the pieties and proprieties of the britannic muse that he had the courage of his opinions doubtless in a time of trouble he was welcomed as the champion of revolt but deeper reasons must be sought for an almost exclusive preference for the works of one poet and a comparative indifference to the works of his rivals and contemporaries he fulfilled another perhaps a greater ideal an englishman turns to poetry for the expression in beautiful words of his happier and better feelings and he is not contented unless poetry tends to make him happier or betterhappier because better than he would be otherwise his favourite poems are psalms or at least metrical paraphrases of life men of other nations are less concerned about their feelings and their souls they regard the poet as the creator the inventor the maker par excellence and he who can imagine or make the greatest eidolon is the greatest poet childe harold and the corsair mazeppa and manfred cain and sardanapalus were new creations new types forms more real than living man which appealed to their artistic sense and led their imaginations captive it is a mark says goethe aus meinem leben dichtung und wahreit 1876 iii 125 of true poetry that as a secular gospel it knows how to free us from the earthly burdens which press upon us by inward serenity by outward charm the most lively as well as the gravest works have the same endto moderate both pleasure and pain through a happy mental representation it is passion translated into action the pageantry of history the transfiguration into visible lineaments of living moods and breathing thoughts which are the notes of this secular gospel and for one class of minds work out a secular redemption  it was not only the questionable belief that he was on the side of the people or his ethical and theological audacities or his prolonged continental exile which won for byron a greater name abroad than he has retained at home but the character of his poetry the english may think of byron as they please conversations of goethe 1874 p 171 but this is certain that they can show no poet who is to be compared to him he is different from all the others and for the most part greater the english may think of him as they please and for them or some of them there is a better oenomel a vinum dæmonum which byron has not in his gift the evidence of a worldwide fame will not endear a poet to a people and a generation who care less for the matter than the manner of verse or who believe in poetry as the symbol or credo of the imagination or the spirit but it should arrest attention and invite inquiry a bibliography is a dull epilogue to a poets works but it speaks with authority and it speaks last finis coronat opus  i must be permitted to renew my thanks to mr gf barwick superintendent of the reading room mr cyril davenport and other officials of the british museum of all grades and classes for their generous and courteous assistance in the preparation and completion of the bibliography the consultation of many hundreds of volumes of one author

                       from the poem carthon      o thou who rollest in yon azure field     round as the orb of my forefathers shield     whence are thy beams from what eternal store     dost thou o sun thy vast effulgence pour     in awful grandeur when thou movest on high     the stars start back and hide them in the sky     the pale moon sickens in thy brightening blaze     and in the western wave avoids thy gaze     alone thou shinest forthfor who can rise     companion of thy splendour in the skies     the mountain oaks are seen to fall away     mountains themselves by length of years decay     with ebbs and flows is the rough ocean tost     in heaven the moon is for a season lost     but thou amidst the fullness of thy joy     the same art ever blazing in the sky     when tempests wrap the world from pole to pole     when vivid lightnings flash and thunders roll     thou far above their utmost fury borne     lookst forth in beauty laughing them to scorn     but vainly now on me thy beauties blaze     ossian no longer can enraptured gaze     whether at morn in lucid lustre gay     on eastern clouds thy yellow tresses play     or else at eve in radiant glory drest     thou tremblest at the portals of the west     i see no more but thou mayest fail at length     like ossian lose thy beauty and thy strength     like himbut for a seasonin thy sphere     to shine with splendour then to disappear     thy years shall have an end and thou no more     bright through the world enlivening radiance pour     but sleep within thy clouds and fail to rise     heedless when morning calls thee to the skies     then now exult o sun and gaily shine     while youth and strength and beauty all are thine     for age is dark unlovely as the light     shed by the moon when clouds deform the night     glimmering uncertain as they hurry past     loud oer the plain is heard the northern blast     mists shroud the hills and neath the growing gloom     the weary traveller

earth sprung he     and making a jump from moscow to france       he stepped across the sea     and rested his hoof on a turnpike road     no very great way from a bishops abode36                         30                                    5      but first as he flew i forgot to say     that he hovered a moment upon his way       to look upon leipsic plain     and so sweet to his eye was its sulphury glare     and so soft to his ear was the cry of despair       that he perched on a mountain of slain     and he gazed with delight from its growing height     nor often on earth had he seen such a sight       nor his work done half as well     for the field ran so red with the blood of the dead                 40       that it blushed like the waves of hell     then loudly and wildly and long laughed he     methinks they have little need here of me                                    6      long he looked down on the hosts of each clime       while the warriors hand to hand were     gaulaustrian and muscovite heroes sublime     andmuse of fitzgerald arise with a rhyme       a quantity of landwehr37           gladness was there     for the men of all might and the monarchs of earth                  50     there met for the wolf and the worm to make mirth       and a feast for the fowls of the air                                    7      but he turned aside and looked from the ridge       of hills along the river     and the best thing he saw was a broken bridge38       which a corporal chose to shiver     though an emperors taste was displeased with his haste       the devil he thought it clever     and he laughed again in a lighter strain       oer the torrent swoln and rainy                                  60     when he saw on a fiery steed prince pon     in taking care of number one     get drowned with a great many                                    8      but the softest note that soothed his ear       was the sound of a widow sighing     and the sweetest sight was the icy tear     which horror froze in the blue eye clear       of a maid by her lover lying     as round her fell her long fair hair     and she looked to heaven with that frenzied air                      70     which seemed to ask if a god were there     and stretched by the wall of a ruined hut     with its hollow cheek and eyes half shut       a child of famine dying     and the carnage begun when resistance is done       and the fall of the vainly flying                                    9      then he gazed on a town by besiegers taken       nor cared he who were winning     but he saw an old maid for years forsaken       get up and leave her spinning                                     80     and she looked in her glass and to one that did pass     she saidpray are the rapes beginning39                                   10      but the devil has reached our cliffs so white       and what did he there i pray     if his eyes were good he but saw by night       what we see every day     but he made a tour and kept a journal     of all the wondrous sights nocturnal     and he sold it in shares to the men of the row     who bid pretty wellbut they cheated him though                 90                                   11      the devil first saw as he thought the mail       its coachman and his coat     so instead of a pistol he cocked his tail       and seized him by the throat     aha quoth he what have we here     t is a new barouche and an ancient peer40                                   12      so he sat him on his box again       and bade him have no fear     but be true to his club and staunch to his rein       his brothel and his beer                                         100     next to seeing a lord at the council board     i would rather see him here                                   13      satan hired a horse and gig       with promises to pay     and he pawned his horns for a spruce new wig       to redeem as he came away     and he whistled some tune a waltz or a jig       and drove off at the close of day                                   14      the first place he stopped athe heard the psalm       that rung

treat asthe epistle of one vetus42       had he found save in downright crimes     though i doubt if this drivelling encomiast of war     ever saw a field fought or felt a scar     yet his fame shall go farther than he can guess     for ill keep him a place in my hottest press                    130     and his works shall be bound in morocco denfer     and lettered behind with his nom de guerre

received a summons     and he thought as a quondam aristocrat     he might peep at the peers though to hear them were flat     and he walked up the house so like one of his own     that they say that he stood pretty near the throne                 140                                   18      he saw the lord liverpool seemingly wise       the lord westmoreland certainly silly     and jockey of norfolka man of some size       and chatham so like his friend billy43     and he saw the tears in lord eldons eyes       because the catholics would not rise       in spite of his prayers and his prophecies     and he heardwhich set satan himself a staring     a certain chief justice say something like swearing44     and the devil was shockedand quoth he i must go                150     for i find we have much better manners below     if thus he harangues when he passes my border     i shall hint to friend moloch to call him to order                                   19      then the devil went down to the humbler house       where he readily found his way     as natural to him as its hole to a mouse       he had been there many a day     and many a vote and soul and job he       had bid for and carried away from the lobby     but there now was a call and accomplished debaters                160     appeared in the glory of hats boots and gaiters     some paid rather morebut all worse dressed           than waiters                                   20      there was canning for war and whitbread for peace       and others as suited their fancies     but all were agreed that our debts should increase       excepting the demagogue francis     that rogue how could westminster chuse him again       to leaven the virtue of these honest men     but the devil remained till the break of day       blushed upon sleep and lord castlereagh45                      170     then up half the house got and satan got up       with the drowsy to snoreor the hungry to sup     but so torpid the power of some speakers t is said     that they sent even him to his brimstone bed                                   21      he had seen george rosebut george was grown dumb        and only lied in thought46     and the devil has all the pleasure to come       of hearing him talk as he ought     with the falsest of tongues the sincerest of men       his veracity were but deceit

would acknowledge complete                                   22      satan next took the army list in hand       where he found a new field marshal     and when he saw this high command       conferred on his highness of cumberland47     oh were i prone to cavilor were i not the devil       i should say this was somewhat partial                           190     since the only wounds that

thought himself of eating     and began to cram from a plate of ham       wherewith a page was retreating     having nothing else to do for the friends each so near       had sold all their souls long before                            210     as he swallowed down the bacon he wished himself a jew       for the sake of another crime more     for sinning itself is but half a recreation     unless it ensures most infallible damnation                                   25      but he turned him about for he heard a sound       which even his ear found faults in     for whirling aboveunderneathand around       were his fairest disciples waltzing50     and quoth hethough this bethe premier pas to me       against it i would warn all                                     220     should i introduce

   though he knew that his works were somewhat sad     he never had found them quite so bad     for this was the book which of yore job sorely smitten     said oh that mine enemy mine enemy had written                                   27      then he found sixty scribblers in separate cells52       and marvelled what they were doing     for they looked like little fiends in their own little

operation to colonel montford the colonel instead of remaining on the spot to direct it and to give the signal ordered a corporal and four sappers to blow up the bridge the instant the enemy should

                   p 184  note 1a facsimile of the titlepage 2 faces p xii of vol i of the poetical works 1898 it has been alleged that largepaper copies of this edition were issued from the newark press it is certain that large copies a copy in the british museum cut for binding measures 220 x 122 printed on paper bearing a watermark dated 1806 were thrown upon the market at an early period but it has not been ascertained at what date or in what place they were printed they are undoubtedly deliberate forgeries they purport even in respect of errata to be identical with the genuine issue of 1807 but they were not set up from the same type and it is inconceivable that a second issue set up from different type and with slightly different ornaments was printed by ridge for piratical purposes to cite a few obvious differencesin the title of the largepaper copies the first a of the word translated is printed Λ greek l  and the greek ν greek n in αινεε greek ainee and νεικει greek neikei appears as υ greek u not ν greek n reversed in the errata on the reverse of p xiii page 153 note is incorrectly given as 163 note and this slip on the part of the falsarius is more remarkable as two other errata in the errata are carefully reproduced in the greek motto on p 22 the letter ρ greek r twice appears as ς greek s and finally the ornaments on pp 1 and 187 though intended to be are not identical in the museum copy a portrait of lord byron from a sketch taken on his leaving england engraved by i west and published by v hone ludgate hill 1819 precedes the titlepage and together with the binding affords good if not conclusive proof that this copy was printed before 1820  see for a correspondence on these lp copies of 1807 the athenæum june 1898 pp 694 695  see too for further interesting and conclusive evidence that the ornament on p 187 of the lp copies was not printed from the newark block newark as a publishing town by tm blagg 1898 pp 2830  note 2an

publication of the hints and that accordingly on october 13 1811 they stood still it was not however till after the appearance of childe harolds etc mayjune 1812 that byron determined to suppress the already printed fifth edition of english bards and at the same time to abandon the publication of his two other satires at this time says dallas recollections of the life of lord byron 1898 p 241 the hints from horace was far advanced in his recollections etc pp 104113 he gives by way of a fair specimen 156 lines of the stillunpublished poem and as these extracts are taken from the first 211 lines and his text corresponds with proof b see poetical works 1898 i 390 variants ii iii it may be inferred that dallas transcribed them from his fragmentary proofsheets and that the press was stopped at

article in the westminster review generally ascribed to sir john hobhouse and for several years the verses have been selling in the streets as a broadside it could therefore serve no purpose to

several editions of english bards and scotch reviewers was mr leicester warren better known as lord de tabley who communicated some notes in 1877 to notes and queries series v vol vii pp 145 etc but it was reserved to the late mr dykes campbell mr bertram dobell and other correspondents to the athenæum may 5 to july 7 1894 to point out that the problem was still farther complicated by the existence of spurious issues of at least three out of the five or six distinct editions of the satire  all editions genuine or spurious claim as their publisher james cawthorn british library no 24 cockspur street but different printers were employed the first edition bears the imprint of t collins printer no 1 harveys buildings strand the second edition that of deans and co hart street covent garden the third edition that of t collins etc the fourth edition of 1810 that of t collins etc the fourth edition of 1811 james cawthorn and sharpe and hailes that of cox son and baylis great queen street london no printers name was attached to the suppressed fifth edition of 1812  genuine first editions have the watermark e and p 1804 or e and p 1805 or possibly no watermark at all a copy of the spurious first edition in mr murrays possession has the watermark s and c wise 1812 in addition to at least eleven variants in punctuation the spurious copy prints p 5 line 47 wizzard p 20 n medeira and in the same note anna dafert whereas the genuine copies print correctly wizard madeira and anna darfet  a genuine copy of the second edition which belonged to the late mr dykes campbell bears the watermark budgen and willmot 1808 on p 80 line 1007 abedeen is misprinted for aberdeen and the same misprint occurs in a copy of the second edition in the british museum in all probability there was no spurious issue of the second edition  of the third edition 1810 copies bearing the watermark ep 1804 or grt may be regarded as genuinerare exceptions among a host of forgeries which either lack a watermark altogether or bear watermarks of a later period mr gilbert r redgrave in an article the library december 1 1899 series ii vol i pp 1825 notes two distinct and divergent

british museum prints crawl for scrawl line 47 and p 73 for p 85  it has been surmised but conclusive proof is not forthcoming that a socalled fourth edition of 1810 1050 lines which purports to have been published by james cawthorn and bears the imprint printed by j collins harveys buildings strand london is a spurious issue it is practically a reprint of the third edition but in some copies there are misprints not to be found in other piracieseg crouds for crowds line 269 and alter for altarline 285  copies of the fourth edition of 1810 which may possibly be genuine bear a watermark grt or are on plain paper copies which are manifestly forgeries bear the watermarks jx 1810 and w pickering 1816  a second fourth edition 1052 lines published by james cawthorn and sharp  hailes 1811 and printed by cox son  baylis was certainly recognized by byron as a genuine fourth edition and must have passed through his hands or been subject to his emendation before it was sent to press copies of this edition bear his ms emendations of 18111812 and marginal notes of 1816 genuine copies eg leigh hunts copy now in the forster collection at the south kensington museum are printed on paper bearing a watermark j whatman 1805 there was however another issue of the fourth edition of 1811 printed on plain paper mr redgrave notes certain minute differences between these two issues in the edition on plain paper there is a hyphen to cockspurstreet on the titlepage and the word street is followed by a comma instead of a semicolon again in the plainpaper copies lambe is spelt with an e and in the watermark copies the word is correctly spelt lamb in the plainpaper copies the misprint postcript for postscript is repeated and in the copies bearing a watermark the word is correctly spelt postscript there are other differences in the advertisements at the end of the volume  a spurious fourth edition in mr murrays possession which has been enriched with a series of prints of persons and places bears the watermarks 1811 1814 each page has been inserted into a folio sheet bearing the watermark j whatman 1816 a fullsized octavo in small print bm 11645 p 15 which purports to be the fourth edition of 1811 is probably spurious it is the survival of a distinct issue from other genuine or spurious copies of the fourth edition  the spurious issues of the third and fourth editions whether they were printed in ireland or were secretly thrown upon the market by james cawthorn after byron had definitely selected murray as his publisher were designed for the general reader and not for the collector the issue of a spurious first edition after the improved and enlarged editions of 180911 were published must have been designed for the byron enthusiast if not the collector of first editions  the grangerized fourth editions prepared by mr wm tartt and mr evans in 1819 1820 and a third by john murray at about the same period and more remarkable still a copy of the fourth edition of 1811 prefaced by a specially printed list of names mentioned in the english bards and scotch reviewers interleaved with the additions made in the fifth edition bm point to the existence of a circle of worshippers who were prepared to treat byrons juvenilia as seriously as the minute critics of the present generation they seem to have been sufficiently numerous to make piracy if not forgery
