75188251	the life and adventures of nicholas nickleby  containing a faithful account of the fortunes misfortunes  uprisings downfallings and complete career of the nickelby family   by charles dickens     authors preface   this story was begun within a few months after the publication of the completed pickwick papers there were then a good many cheap yorkshire schools in existence there are very few now  of the monstrous neglect of education in england and the disregard of it by the state as a means of forming good or bad citizens and miserable or happy men private schools long afforded a notable example although any man who had proved his unfitness for any other occupation in life was free without examination or qualification to open a school anywhere although preparation for the functions he undertook was required in the surgeon who assisted to bring a boy into the world or might one day assist perhaps to send him out of it in the chemist the attorney the butcher the baker the candlestick maker the whole round of crafts and trades the schoolmaster excepted and although schoolmasters as a race were the blockheads and impostors who might naturally be expected to spring from such a state of things and to flourish in it these yorkshire schoolmasters were the lowest and most rotten round in the whole ladder traders in the avarice indifference or imbecility of parents and the helplessness of children ignorant sordid brutal men to whom few considerate persons would have entrusted the board and lodging of a horse or a dog they formed the worthy cornerstone of a structure which for absurdity and a magnificent highminded laissezaller neglect has rarely been exceeded in the world  we hear sometimes of an action for damages against the unqualified medical practitioner who has deformed a broken limb in pretending to heal it but what of the hundreds of thousands of minds that have been deformed for ever by the incapable pettifoggers who have pretended to form them  i make mention of the race as of the yorkshire schoolmasters in the past tense though it has not yet finally disappeared it is dwindling daily a long days work remains to be done about us in the way of education heaven knows but great improvements and facilities towards the attainment of a good one have been furnished of late years  i cannot call to mind now how i came to hear about yorkshire schools when i was a not very robust child sitting in byeplaces near rochester castle with a head full of partridge strap tom pipes and sancho panza but i know that my first impressions of them were picked up at that time and that they were somehow or other connected with a suppurated abscess that some boy had come home with in consequence of his yorkshire guide philosopher and friend having ripped it open with an inky penknife the impression made upon me however made never left me i was always curious about yorkshire schoolsfell long afterwards and at sundry times into the way of hearing more about themat last having an audience resolved to write about them  with that intent i went down into yorkshire before i began this book in very severe winter time which is pretty faithfully described herein as i wanted to see a schoolmaster or two and was forewarned that those gentlemen might in their modesty be shy of receiving a visit from the author of the pickwick papers i consulted with a professional friend who had a yorkshire connexion and with whom i concerted a pious fraud he gave me some letters of introduction in the name i think of my travelling companion they bore reference to a supposititious little boy who had been left with a widowed mother who didnt know what to do with him the poor lady had thought as a means of thawing the tardy compassion of her relations in his behalf of sending him to a yorkshire school i was the poor ladys friend travelling that way and if the recipient of the letter could inform me of a school in his neighbourhood the writer would be very much obliged  i went to several places in that part of the country where i understood the schools to be most plentifully sprinkled and had no occasion to deliver a letter until i came to a certain town which shall be nameless the person to whom it was addressed was not at home but he came down at night through the snow to the inn where i was staying it was after dinner and he needed little persuasion to sit down by the fire in a warm corner and take his share of the wine that was on the table  i am afraid he is dead now i recollect he was a jovial ruddy broadfaced man that we got acquainted directly and that we talked on all kinds of subjects except the school which he showed a great anxiety to avoid was there any large school near i asked him in reference to the letter oh yes he said there was a pratty big un was it a good one i asked ey he said it was as good as anoother that was a a matther of opinion and fell to looking at the fire staring round the room and whistling a little on my reverting to some other topic that we had been discussing he recovered immediately but though i tried him again and again i never approached the question of the school even if he were in the middle of a laugh without observing that his countenance fell and that he became uncomfortable at last when we had passed a couple of hours or so very agreeably he suddenly took up his hat and leaning over the table and looking me full in the face said in a low voice weel misther weve been vara pleasant toogather and arll spak my moind tivee dinnot let the weedur send her lattle boy to yan o our schoolmeasthers while theres a harse to hoold in a lunnun or a gootther to lie asleep in ar wouldnt mak ill words amang my neeburs and ar speak tivee quiet loike but im domd if ar can gang to bed and not tellee for weedurs sak to keep the lattle boy from a sike scoondrels while theres a harse to hoold in a lunnun or a gootther to lie asleep in repeating these words with great heartiness and with a solemnity on his jolly face that made it look twice as large as before he shook hands and went away i never saw him afterwards but i sometimes imagine that i descry a faint reflection of him in john browdie  in reference to these gentry i may here quote a few words from the original preface to this book  it has afforded the author great amusement and satisfaction during the progress of this work to learn from country friends and from a variety of ludicrous statements concerning himself in provincial newspapers that more than one yorkshire schoolmaster lays claim to being the original of mr squeers one worthy he has reason to believe has actually consulted authorities learned in the law as to his having good grounds on which to rest an action for libel another has meditated a journey to london for the express purpose of committing an assault and battery on his traducer a third perfectly remembers being waited on last january twelvemonth by two gentlemen one of whom held him in conversation while the other took his likeness and although mr squeers has but one eye and he has two and the published sketch does not resemble him whoever he may be in any other respect still he and all his friends and neighbours know at once for whom it is meant becausethe character is so like him  while the author cannot but feel the full force of the compliment thus conveyed to him he ventures to suggest that these contentions may arise from the fact that mr squeers is the representative of a class and not of an individual where imposture ignorance and brutal cupidity are the stock in trade of a small body of men and one is described by these characteristics all his fellows will recognise something belonging to themselves and each will have a misgiving that the portrait is his own  the authors object in calling public attention to the system would be very imperfectly fulfilled if he did not state now in his own person emphatically and earnestly that mr squeers and his school are faint and feeble pictures of an existing reality purposely subdued and kept down lest they should be deemed impossible that there are upon record trials at law in which damages have been sought as a poor recompense for lasting agonies and disfigurements inflicted upon children by the treatment of the master in these places involving such offensive and foul details of neglect cruelty and disease as no writer of fiction would have the boldness to imagine and that since he has been engaged upon these adventures he has received from private quarters far beyond the reach of suspicion or distrust accounts of atrocities in the perpetration of which upon neglected or repudiated children these schools have been the main instruments very far exceeding any that appear in these pages  this comprises all i need say on the subject except that if i had seen occasion i had resolved to reprint a few of these details of legal proceedings from certain old newspapers  one other quotation from the same preface may serve to introduce a fact that my readers may think curious  to turn to a more pleasant subject it may be right to say that there are two characters in this book which are drawn from life it is remarkable that what we call the world which is so very credulous in what professes to be true is most incredulous in what professes to be imaginary and that while every day in real life it will allow in one man no blemishes and in another no virtues it will seldom admit a very stronglymarked character either good or bad in a fictitious narrative to be within the limits of probability but those who take an interest in this tale will be glad to learn that the brothers cheeryble live that their liberal charity their singleness of heart their noble nature and their unbounded benevolence are no creations of the authors brain but are prompting every day and oftenest by stealth some munificent and generous deed in that town of which they are the pride and honour  if i were to attempt to sum up the thousands of letters from all sorts of people in all sorts of latitudes and climates which this unlucky paragraph brought down upon me i should get into an arithmetical difficulty from which i could not easily extricate myself suffice it to say that i believe the applications for loans gifts and offices of profit that i have been requested to forward to the originals of the brothers cheeryble with whom i never interchanged any communication in my life would have exhausted the combined patronage of all the lord chancellors since the accession of the house of brunswick and would have broken the rest of the bank of england  the brothers are now dead  there is only one other point on which i would desire to offer a remark if nicholas be not always found to be blameless or agreeable he is not always intended to appear so he is a young man of an impetuous temper and of little or no experience and i saw no reason why such a hero should be lifted out of nature      chapter 1  introduces all the rest   there once lived in a sequestered part of the county of devonshire one mr godfrey nickleby a worthy gentleman who taking it into his head rather late in life that he must get married and not being young enough or rich enough to aspire to the hand of a lady of fortune had wedded an old flame out of mere attachment who in her turn had taken him for the same reason thus two people who cannot afford to play cards for money sometimes sit down to a quiet game for love  some illconditioned persons who sneer at the lifematrimonial may perhaps suggest in this place that the good couple would be better likened to two principals in a sparring match who when fortune is low and backers scarce will chivalrously set to for the mere pleasure of the buffeting and in one respect indeed this comparison would hold good for as the adventurous pair of the fives court will afterwards send round a hat and trust to the bounty of the lookerson for the means of regaling themselves so mr godfrey nickleby and his partner the honeymoon being over looked out wistfully into the world relying in no inconsiderable degree upon chance for the improvement of their means mr nicklebys income at the period of his marriage fluctuated between sixty and eighty pounds per annum  there are people enough in the world heaven knows and even in london where mr nickleby dwelt in those days but few complaints prevail of the population being scanty it is extraordinary how long a man may look among the crowd without discovering the face of a friend but it is no less true mr nickleby looked and looked till his eyes became sore as his heart but no friend appeared and when growing tired of the search he turned his eyes homeward he saw very little there to relieve his weary vision a painter who has gazed too long upon some glaring colour refreshes his dazzled sight by looking upon a darker and more sombre tint but everything that met mr nicklebys gaze wore so black and gloomy a hue that he would have been beyond description refreshed by the very reverse of the contrast  at length after five years when mrs nickleby had presented her husband with a couple of sons and that embarrassed gentleman impressed with the necessity of making some provision for his family was seriously revolving in his mind a little commercial speculation of insuring his life next quarterday and then falling from the top of the monument by accident there came one morning by the general post a blackbordered letter to inform him how his uncle mr ralph nickleby was dead and had left him the bulk of his little property amounting in all to five thousand pounds sterling  as the deceased had taken no further notice of his nephew in his lifetime than sending to his eldest boy who had been christened after him on desperate speculation a silver spoon in a morocco case which as he had not too much to eat with it seemed a kind of satire upon his having been born without that useful article of plate in his mouth mr godfrey nickleby could at first scarcely believe the tidings thus conveyed to him on examination however they turned out to be strictly correct the amiable old gentleman it seemed had intended to leave the whole to the royal humane society and had indeed executed a will to that effect but the institution having been unfortunate enough a few months before to save the life of a poor relation to whom he paid a weekly allowance of three shillings and sixpence he had in a fit of very natural exasperation revoked the bequest in a codicil and left it all to mr godfrey nickleby with a special mention of his indignation not only against the society for saving the poor relations life but against the poor relation also for allowing himself to be saved  with a portion of this property mr godfrey nickleby purchased a small farm near dawlish in devonshire whither he retired with his wife and two children to live upon the best interest he could get for the rest of his money and the little produce he could raise from his land the two prospered so well together that when he died some fifteen years after this period and some five after his wife he was enabled to leave to his eldest son ralph three thousand pounds in cash and to his youngest son nicholas one thousand and the farm which was as small a landed estate as one would desire to see  these two brothers had been brought up together in a school at exeter and being accustomed to go home once a week had often heard from their mothers lips long accounts of their fathers sufferings in his days of poverty and of their deceased uncles importance in his days of affluence which recitals produced a very different impression on the two for while the younger who was of a timid and retiring disposition gleaned from thence nothing but forewarnings to shun the great world and attach himself to the quiet routine of a country life ralph the elder deduced from the oftenrepeated tale the two great morals that riches are the only true source of happiness and power and that it is lawful and just to compass their acquisition by all means short of felony and reasoned ralph with himself if no good came of my uncles money when he was alive a great deal of good came of it after he was dead inasmuch as my father has got it now and is saving it up for me which is a highly virtuous purpose and going back to the old gentleman good did come of it to him too for he had the pleasure of thinking of it all his life long and of being envied and courted by all his family besides and ralph always wound up these mental soliloquies by arriving at the conclusion that there was nothing like money  not confining himself to theory or permitting his faculties to rust even at that early age in mere abstract speculations this promising lad commenced usurer on a limited scale at school putting out at good interest a small capital of slatepencil and marbles and gradually extending his operations until they aspired to the copper coinage of this realm in which he speculated to considerable advantage nor did he trouble his borrowers with abstract calculations of figures or references to readyreckoners his simple rule of interest being all comprised in the one golden sentence twopence for every halfpenny which greatly simplified the accounts and which as a familiar precept more easily acquired and retained in the memory than any known rule of arithmetic cannot be too strongly recommended to the notice of capitalists both large and small and more especially of moneybrokers and billdiscounters indeed to do these gentlemen justice many of them are to this day in the frequent habit of adopting it with eminent success  in like manner did young ralph nickleby avoid all those minute and intricate calculations of odd days which nobody who has worked sums in simpleinterest can fail to have found most embarrassing by establishing the one general rule that all sums of principal and interest should be paid on pocketmoney day that is to say on saturday and that whether a loan were contracted on the monday or on the friday the amount of interest should be in both cases the same indeed he argued and with great show of reason that it ought to be rather more for one day than for five inasmuch as the borrower might in the former case be very fairly presumed to be in great extremity otherwise he would not borrow at all with such odds against him this fact is interesting as illustrating the secret connection and sympathy which always exist between great minds though master ralph nickleby was not at that time aware of it the class of gentlemen before alluded to proceed on just the same principle in all their transactions  from what we have said of this young gentleman and the natural admiration the reader will immediately conceive of his character it may perhaps be inferred that he is to be the hero of the work which we shall presently begin to set this point at rest for once and for ever we hasten to undeceive them and stride to its commencement  on the death of his father ralph nickleby who had been some time before placed in a mercantile house in london applied himself passionately to his old pursuit of moneygetting in which he speedily became so buried and absorbed that he quite forgot his brother for many years and if at times a recollection of his old playfellow broke upon him through the haze in which he livedfor gold conjures up a mist about a man more destructive of all his old senses and lulling to his feelings than the fumes of charcoalit brought along with it a companion thought that if they were intimate he would want to borrow money of him so mr ralph nickleby shrugged his shoulders and said things were better as they were  as for nicholas he lived a single man on the patrimonial estate until he grew tired of living alone and then he took to wife the daughter of a neighbouring gentleman with a dower of one thousand pounds this good lady bore him two children a son and a daughter and when the son was about nineteen and the daughter fourteen as near as we can guessimpartial records of young ladies ages being before the passing of the new act nowhere preserved in the registries of this countrymr nickleby looked about him for the means of repairing his capital now sadly reduced by this increase in his family and the expenses of their education  speculate with it said mrs nickleby  speculate my dear said mr nickleby as though in doubt  why not asked mrs nickleby  because my dear if we should lose it rejoined mr nickleby who was a slow and timetaking speaker if we should lose it we shall no longer be able to live my dear  fiddle said mrs nickleby  i am not altogether sure of that my dear said mr nickleby  theres nicholas pursued the lady quite a young manits time he was in the way of doing something for himself and kate too poor girl without a penny in the world think of your brother would he be what he is if he hadnt speculated  thats true replied mr nickleby very good my dear yes i will speculate my dear  speculation is a round game the players see little or nothing of their cards at first starting gains may be greatand so may losses the run of luck went against mr nickleby a mania prevailed a bubble burst four stockbrokers took villa residences at florence four hundred nobodies were ruined and among them mr nickleby  the very house i live in sighed the poor gentleman may be taken from me tomorrow not an article of my old furniture but will be sold to strangers  the last reflection hurt him so much that he took at once to his bed apparently resolved to keep that at all events  cheer up sir said the apothecary  you mustnt let yourself be cast down sir said the nurse  such things happen every day remarked the lawyer  and it is very sinful to rebel against them whispered the clergyman  and what no man with a family ought to do added the neighbours  mr nickleby shook his head and motioning them all out of the room embraced his wife and children and having pressed them by turns to his languidly beating heart sunk exhausted on his pillow they were concerned to find that his reason went astray after this for he babbled for a long time about the generosity and goodness of his brother and the merry old times when they were at school together this fit of wandering past he solemnly commended them to one who never deserted the widow or her fatherless children and smiling gently on them turned upon his face and observed that he thought he could fall asleep    chapter 2  of mr ralph nickleby and his establishments and his undertakings and of a great joint stock company of vast national importance   mr ralph nickleby was not strictly speaking what you would call a merchant neither was he a banker nor an attorney nor a special pleader nor a notary he was certainly not a tradesman and still less could he lay any claim to the title of a professional gentleman for it would have been impossible to mention any recognised profession to which he belonged nevertheless as he lived in a spacious house in golden square which in addition to a brass plate upon the streetdoor had another brass plate two sizes and a half smaller upon the left hand doorpost surrounding a brass model of an infants fist grasping a fragment of a skewer and displaying the word office it was clear that mr ralph nickleby did or pretended to do business of some kind and the fact if it required any further circumstantial evidence was abundantly demonstrated by the diurnal attendance between the hours of halfpast nine and five of a sallowfaced man in rusty brown who sat upon an uncommonly hard stool in a species of butlers pantry at the end of the passage and always had a pen behind his ear when he answered the bell  although a few members of the graver professions live about golden square it is not exactly in anybodys way to or from anywhere it is one of the squares that have been a quarter of the town that has gone down in the world and taken to letting lodgings many of its first and second floors are let furnished to single gentlemen and it takes boarders besides it is a great resort of foreigners the darkcomplexioned men who wear large rings and heavy watchguards and bushy whiskers and who congregate under the opera colonnade and about the boxoffice in the season between four and five in the afternoon when they give away the ordersall live in golden square or within a street of it two or three violins and a wind instrument from the opera band reside within its precincts its boardinghouses are musical and the notes of pianos and harps float in the evening time round the head of the mournful statue the guardian genius of a little wilderness of shrubs in the centre of the square on a summers night windows are thrown open and groups of swarthy moustached men are seen by the passerby lounging at the casements and smoking fearfully sounds of gruff voices practising vocal music invade the evenings silence and the fumes of choice tobacco scent the air there snuff and cigars and german pipes and flutes and violins and violoncellos divide the supremacy between them it is the region of song and smoke street bands are on their mettle in golden square and itinerant gleesingers quaver involuntarily as they raise their voices within its boundaries  this would not seem a spot very well adapted to the transaction of business but mr ralph nickleby had lived there notwithstanding for many years and uttered no complaint on that score he knew nobody round about and nobody knew him although he enjoyed the reputation of being immensely rich the tradesmen held that he was a sort of lawyer and the other neighbours opined that he was a kind of general agent both of which guesses were as correct and definite as guesses about other peoples affairs usually are or need to be  mr ralph nickleby sat in his private office one morning ready dressed to walk abroad he wore a bottlegreen spencer over a blue coat a white waistcoat grey mixture pantaloons and wellington boots drawn over them the corner of a smallplaited shirtfrill struggled out as if insisting to show itself from between his chin and the top button of his spencer and the latter garment was not made low enough to conceal a long gold watchchain composed of a series of plain rings which had its beginning at the handle of a gold repeater in mr nicklebys pocket and its termination in two little keys one belonging to the watch itself and the other to some patent padlock he wore a sprinkling of powder upon his head as if to make himself look benevolent but if that were his purpose he would perhaps have done better to powder his countenance also for there was something in its very wrinkles and in his cold restless eye which seemed to tell of cunning that would announce itself in spite of him however this might be there he was and as he was all alone neither the powder nor the wrinkles nor the eyes had the smallest effect good or bad upon anybody just then and are consequently no business of ours just now  mr nickleby closed an accountbook which lay on his desk and throwing himself back in his chair gazed with an air of abstraction through the dirty window some london houses have a melancholy little plot of ground behind them usually fenced in by four high whitewashed walls and frowned upon by stacks of chimneys in which there withers on from year to year a crippled tree that makes a show of putting forth a few leaves late in autumn when other trees shed theirs and drooping in the effort lingers on all crackled and smokedried till the following season when it repeats the same process and perhaps if the weather be particularly genial even tempts some rheumatic sparrow to chirrup in its branches people sometimes call these dark yards gardens it is not supposed that they were ever planted but rather that they are pieces of unreclaimed land with the withered vegetation of the original brickfield no man thinks of walking in this desolate place or of turning it to any account a few hampers halfadozen broken bottles and suchlike rubbish may be thrown there when the tenant first moves in but nothing more and there they remain until he goes away again the damp straw taking just as long to moulder as it thinks proper and mingling with the scanty box and stunted everbrowns and broken flowerpots that are scattered mournfully abouta prey to blacks and dirt  it was into a place of this kind that mr ralph nickleby gazed as he sat with his hands in his pockets looking out of the window he had fixed his eyes upon a distorted fir tree planted by some former tenant in a tub that had once been green and left there years before to rot away piecemeal there was nothing very inviting in the object but mr nickleby was wrapt in a brown study and sat contemplating it with far greater attention than in a more conscious mood he would have deigned to bestow upon the rarest exotic at length his eyes wandered to a little dirty window on the left through which the face of the clerk was dimly visible that worthy chancing to look up he beckoned him to attend  in obedience to this summons the clerk got off the high stool to which he had communicated a high polish by countless gettings off and on and presented himself in mr nicklebys room he was a tall man of middle age with two goggle eyes whereof one was a fixture a rubicund nose a cadaverous face and a suit of clothes if the term be allowable when they suited him not at all much the worse for wear very much too small and placed upon such a short allowance of buttons that it was marvellous how he contrived to keep them on  was that halfpast twelve noggs said mr nickleby in a sharp and grating voice  not more than fiveandtwenty minutes by the noggs was going to add publichouse clock but recollecting himself substituted regular time  my watch has stopped said mr nickleby i dont know from what cause  not wound up said noggs  yes it is said mr nickleby  overwound then rejoined noggs  that cant very well be observed mr nickleby  must be said noggs  well said mr nickleby putting the repeater back in his pocket perhaps it is  noggs gave a peculiar grunt as was his custom at the end of all disputes with his master to imply that he noggs triumphed and as he rarely spoke to anybody unless somebody spoke to him fell into a grim silence and rubbed his hands slowly over each other cracking the joints of his fingers and squeezing them into all possible distortions the incessant performance of this routine on every occasion and the communication of a fixed and rigid look to his unaffected eye so as to make it uniform with the other and to render it impossible for anybody to determine where or at what he was looking were two among the numerous peculiarities of mr noggs which struck an inexperienced observer at first sight  i am going to the london tavern this morning said mr nickleby  public meeting inquired noggs  mr nickleby nodded i expect a letter from the solicitor respecting that mortgage of ruddles if it comes at all it will be here by the two oclock delivery i shall leave the city about that time and walk to charing cross on the lefthand side of the way if there are any letters come and meet me and bring them with you  noggs nodded and as he nodded there came a ring at the office bell the master looked up from his papers and the clerk calmly remained in a stationary position  the bell said noggs as though in explanation at home  yes  to anybody  yes  to the taxgatherer  no let him call again  noggs gave vent to his usual grunt as much as to say i thought so and the ring being repeated went to the door whence he presently returned ushering in by the name of mr bonney a pale gentleman in a violent hurry who with his hair standing up in great disorder all over his head and a very narrow white cravat tied loosely round his throat looked as if he had been knocked up in the night and had not dressed himself since  my dear nickleby said the gentleman taking off a white hat which was so full of papers that it would scarcely stick upon his head theres not a moment to lose i have a cab at the door sir matthew pupker takes the chair and three members of parliament are positively coming i have seen two of them safely out of bed the third who was at crockfords all night has just gone home to put a clean shirt on and take a bottle or two of soda water and will certainly be with us in time to address the meeting he is a little excited by last night but never mind that he always speaks the stronger for it  it seems to promise pretty well said mr ralph nickleby whose deliberate manner was strongly opposed to the vivacity of the other man of business  pretty well echoed mr bonney its the finest idea that was ever started united metropolitan improved hot muffin and crumpet baking and punctual delivery company capital five millions in five hundred thousand shares of ten pounds each why the very name will get the shares up to a premium in ten days  and when they are at a premium said mr ralph nickleby smiling  when they are you know what to do with them as well as any man alive and how to back quietly out at the right time said mr bonney slapping the capitalist familiarly on the shoulder bythebye what a very remarkable man that clerk of yours is  yes poor devil replied ralph drawing on his gloves though newman noggs kept his horses and hounds once  ay ay said the other carelessly  yes continued ralph and not many years ago either but he squandered his money invested it anyhow borrowed at interest and in short made first a thorough fool of himself and then a beggar he took to drinking and had a touch of paralysis and then came here to borrow a pound as in his better days i had  done business with him said mr bonney with a meaning look  just so replied ralph i couldnt lend it you know  oh of course not  but as i wanted a clerk just then to open the door and so forth i took him out of charity and he has remained with me ever since he is a little mad i think said mr nickleby calling up a charitable look but he is useful enough poor creatureuseful enough  the kindhearted gentleman omitted to add that newman noggs being utterly destitute served him for rather less than the usual wages of a boy of thirteen and likewise failed to mention in his hasty chronicle that his eccentric taciturnity rendered him an especially valuable person in a place where much business was done of which it was desirable no mention should be made out of doors the other gentleman was plainly impatient to be gone however and as they hurried into the hackney cabriolet immediately afterwards perhaps mr nickleby forgot to mention circumstances so unimportant  there was a great bustle in bishopsgate street within as they drew up and it being a windy day halfadozen men were tacking across the road under a press of paper bearing gigantic announcements that a public meeting would be holden at one oclock precisely to take into consideration the propriety of petitioning parliament in favour of the united metropolitan improved hot muffin and crumpet baking and punctual delivery company capital five millions in five hundred thousand shares of ten pounds each which sums were duly set forth in fat black figures of considerable size mr bonney elbowed his way briskly upstairs receiving in his progress many low bows from the waiters who stood on the landings to show the way and followed by mr nickleby dived into a suite of apartments behind the great public room in the second of which was a businesslooking table and several businesslooking people  hear cried a gentleman with a double chin as mr bonney presented himself chair gentlemen chair  the newcomers were received with universal approbation and mr bonney bustled up to the top of the table took off his hat ran his fingers through his hair and knocked a hackneycoachmans knock on the table with a little hammer whereat several gentlemen cried hear and nodded slightly to each other as much as to say what spirited conduct that was just at this moment a waiter feverish with agitation tore into the room and throwing the door open with a crash shouted sir matthew pupker  the committee stood up and clapped their hands for joy and while they were clapping them in came sir matthew pupker attended by two live members of parliament one irish and one scotch all smiling and bowing and looking so pleasant that it seemed a perfect marvel how any man could have the heart to vote against them sir matthew pupker especially who had a little round head with a flaxen wig on the top of it fell into such a paroxysm of bows that the wig threatened to be jerked off every instant when these symptoms had in some degree subsided the gentlemen who were on speaking terms with sir matthew pupker or the two other members crowded round them in three little groups near one or other of which the gentlemen who were not on speaking terms with sir matthew pupker or the two other members stood lingering and smiling and rubbing their hands in the desperate hope of something turning up which might bring them into notice all this time sir matthew pupker and the two other members were relating to their separate circles what the intentions of government were about taking up the bill with a full account of what the government had said in a whisper the last time they dined with it and how the government had been observed to wink when it said so from which premises they were at no loss to draw the conclusion that if the government had one object more at heart than another that one object was the welfare and advantage of the united metropolitan improved hot muffin and crumpet baking and punctual delivery company  meanwhile and pending the arrangement of the proceedings and a fair division of the speechifying the public in the large room were eyeing by turns the empty platform and the ladies in the music gallery in these amusements the greater portion of them had been occupied for a couple of hours before and as the most agreeable diversions pall upon the taste on a too protracted enjoyment of them the sterner spirits now began to hammer the floor with their bootheels and to express their dissatisfaction by various hoots and cries these vocal exertions emanating from the people who had been there longest naturally proceeded from those who were nearest to the platform and furthest from the policemen in attendance who having no great mind to fight their way through the crowd but entertaining nevertheless a praiseworthy desire to do something to quell the disturbance immediately began to drag forth by the coat tails and collars all the quiet people near the door at the same time dealing out various smart and tingling blows with their truncheons after the manner of that ingenious actor mr punch whose brilliant example both in the fashion of his weapons and their use this branch of the executive occasionally follows  several very exciting skirmishes were in progress when a loud shout attracted the attention even of the belligerents and then there poured on to the platform from a door at the side a long line of gentlemen with their hats off all looking behind them and uttering vociferous cheers the cause whereof was sufficiently explained when sir matthew pupker and the two other real members of parliament came to the front amidst deafening shouts and testified to each other in dumb motions that they had never seen such a glorious sight as that in the whole course of their public career  at length and at last the assembly left off shouting but sir matthew pupker being voted into the chair they underwent a relapse which lasted five minutes this over sir matthew pupker went on to say what must be his feelings on that great occasion and what must be that occasion in the eyes of the world and what must be the intelligence of his fellowcountrymen before him and what must be the wealth and respectability of his honourable friends behind him and lastly what must be the importance to the wealth the happiness the comfort the liberty the very existence of a free and great people of such an institution as the united metropolitan improved hot muffin and crumpet baking and punctual delivery company  mr bonney then presented himself to move the first resolution and having run his right hand through his hair and planted his left in an easy manner in his ribs he consigned his hat to the care of the gentleman with the double chin who acted as a species of bottleholder to the orators generally and said he would read to them the first resolutionthat this meeting views with alarm and apprehension the existing state of the muffin trade in this metropolis and its neighbourhood that it considers the muffin boys as at present constituted wholly underserving the confidence of the public and that it deems the whole muffin system alike prejudicial to the health and morals of the people and subversive of the best interests of a great commercial and mercantile community the honourable gentleman made a speech which drew tears from the eyes of the ladies and awakened the liveliest emotions in every individual present he had visited the houses of the poor in the various districts of london and had found them destitute of the slightest vestige of a muffin which there appeared too much reason to believe some of these indigent persons did not taste from years end to years end he had found that among muffinsellers there existed drunkenness debauchery and profligacy which he attributed to the debasing nature of their employment as at present exercised he had found the same vices among the poorer class of people who ought to be muffin consumers and this he attributed to the despair engendered by their being placed beyond the reach of that nutritious article which drove them to seek a false stimulant in intoxicating liquors he would undertake to prove before a committee of the house of commons that there existed a combination to keep up the price of muffins and to give the bellmen a monopoly he would prove it by bellmen at the bar of that house and he would also prove that these men corresponded with each other by secret words and signs as snooks walker ferguson is murphy right and many others it was this melancholy state of things that the company proposed to correct firstly by prohibiting under heavy penalties all private muffin trading of every description secondly by themselves supplying the public generally and the poor at their own homes with muffins of first quality at reduced prices it was with this object that a bill had been introduced into parliament by their patriotic chairman sir matthew pupker it was this bill that they had met to support it was the supporters of this bill who would confer undying brightness and splendour upon england under the name of the united metropolitan improved hot muffin and crumpet baking and punctual delivery company he would add with a capital of five millions in five hundred thousand shares of ten pounds each  mr ralph nickleby seconded the resolution and another gentleman having moved that it be amended by the insertion of the words and crumpet after the word muffin whenever it occurred it was carried triumphantly only one man in the crowd cried no and he was promptly taken into custody and straightway borne off  the second resolution which recognised the expediency of immediately abolishing all muffin or crumpet sellers all traders in muffins or crumpets of whatsoever description whether male or female boys or men ringing handbells or otherwise was moved by a grievous gentleman of semiclerical appearance who went at once into such deep pathetics that he knocked the first speaker clean out of the course in no time you might have heard a pin falla pin a featheras he described the cruelties inflicted on muffin boys by their masters which he very wisely urged were in themselves a sufficient reason for the establishment of that inestimable company it seemed that the unhappy youths were nightly turned out into the wet streets at the most inclement periods of the year to wander about in darkness and rainor it might be hail or snowfor hours together without shelter food or warmth and let the public never forget upon the latter point that while the muffins were provided with warm clothing and blankets the boys were wholly unprovided for and left to their own miserable resources shame the honourable gentleman related one case of a muffin boy who having been exposed to this inhuman and barbarous system for no less than five years at length fell a victim to a cold in the head beneath which he gradually sunk until he fell into a perspiration and recovered this he could vouch for on his own authority but he had heard and he had no reason to doubt the fact of a still more heartrending and appalling circumstance he had heard of the case of an orphan muffin boy who having been run over by a hackney carriage had been removed to the hospital had undergone the amputation of his leg below the knee and was now actually pursuing his occupation on crutches fountain of justice were these things to last  this was the department of the subject that took the meeting and this was the style of speaking to enlist their sympathies the men shouted the ladies wept into their pockethandkerchiefs till they were moist and waved them till they were dry the excitement was tremendous and mr nickleby whispered his friend that the shares were thenceforth at a premium of fiveandtwenty per cent  the resolution was of course carried with loud acclamations every man holding up both hands in favour of it as he would in his enthusiasm have held up both legs also if he could have conveniently accomplished it this done the draft of the proposed petition was read at length and the petition said as all petitions do say that the petitioners were very humble and the petitioned very honourable and the object very virtuous therefore said the petition the bill ought to be passed into a law at once to the everlasting honour and glory of that most honourable and glorious commons of england in parliament assembled  then the gentleman who had been at crockfords all night and who looked something the worse about the eyes in consequence came forward to tell his fellowcountrymen what a speech he meant to make in favour of that petition whenever it should be presented and how desperately he meant to taunt the parliament if they rejected the bill and to inform them also that he regretted his honourable friends had not inserted a clause rendering the purchase of muffins and crumpets compulsory upon all classes of the community which heopposing all halfmeasures and preferring to go the extreme animalpledged himself to propose and divide upon in committee after announcing this determination the honourable gentleman grew jocular and as patent boots lemoncoloured kid gloves and a fur coat collar assist jokes materially there was immense laughter and much cheering and moreover such a brilliant display of ladies pockethandkerchiefs as threw the grievous gentleman quite into the shade  and when the petition had been read and was about to be adopted there came forward the irish member who was a young gentleman of ardent temperament with such a speech as only an irish member can make breathing the true soul and spirit of poetry and poured forth with such fervour that it made one warm to look at him in the course whereof he told them how he would demand the extension of that great boon to his native country how he would claim for her equal rights in the muffin laws as in all other laws and how he yet hoped to see the day when crumpets should be toasted in her lowly cabins and muffin bells should ring in her rich green valleys and after him came the scotch member with various pleasant allusions to the probable amount of profits which increased the good humour that the poetry had awakened and all the speeches put together did exactly what they were intended to do and established in the hearers minds that there was no speculation so promising or at the same time so praiseworthy as the united metropolitan improved hot muffin and crumpet baking and punctual delivery company  so the petition in favour of the bill was agreed upon and the meeting adjourned with acclamations and mr nickleby and the other directors went to the office to lunch as they did every day at halfpast one oclock and to remunerate themselves for which trouble as the company was yet in its infancy they only charged three guineas each man for every such attendance    chapter 3  mr ralph nickleby receives sad tidings of his brother but bears up nobly against the intelligence communicated to him the reader is informed how he liked nicholas who is herein introduced and how kindly he proposed to make his fortune at once   having rendered his zealous assistance towards dispatching the lunch with all that promptitude and energy which are among the most important qualities that men of business can possess mr ralph nickleby took a cordial farewell of his fellowspeculators and bent his steps westward in unwonted good humour as he passed st pauls he stepped aside into a doorway to set his watch and with his hand on the key and his eye on the cathedral dial was intent upon so doing when a man suddenly stopped before him it was newman noggs  ah newman said mr nickleby looking up as he pursued his occupation the letter about the mortgage has come has it i thought it would  wrong replied newman  what and nobody called respecting it inquired mr nickleby pausing noggs shook his head  what has come then inquired mr nickleby  i have said newman  what else demanded the master sternly  this said newman drawing a sealed letter slowly from his pocket postmark strand black wax black border womans hand c n in the corner  black wax said mr nickleby glancing at the letter i know something of that hand too newman i shouldnt be surprised if my brother were dead  i dont think you would said newman quietly  why not sir demanded mr nickleby  you never are surprised replied newman thats all  mr nickleby snatched the letter from his assistant and fixing a cold look upon him opened read it put it in his pocket and having now hit the time to a second began winding up his watch  it is as i expected newman said mr nickleby while he was thus engaged he is dead dear me well thats sudden thing i shouldnt have thought it really with these touching expressions of sorrow mr nickleby replaced his watch in his fob and fitting on his gloves to a nicety turned upon his way and walked slowly westward with his hands behind him  children alive inquired noggs stepping up to him  why thats the very thing replied mr nickleby as though his thoughts were about them at that moment they are both alive  both repeated newman noggs in a low voice  and the widow too added mr nickleby and all three in london confound them all three here newman  newman fell a little behind his master and his face was curiously twisted as by a spasm but whether of paralysis or grief or inward laughter nobody but himself could possibly explain the expression of a mans face is commonly a help to his thoughts or glossary on his speech but the countenance of newman noggs in his ordinary moods was a problem which no stretch of ingenuity could solve  go home said mr nickleby after they had walked a few paces looking round at the clerk as if he were his dog the words were scarcely uttered when newman darted across the road slunk among the crowd and disappeared in an instant  reasonable certainly muttered mr nickleby to himself as he walked on very reasonable my brother never did anything for me and i never expected it the breath is no sooner out of his body than i am to be looked to as the support of a great hearty woman and a grown boy and girl what are they to me i never saw them  full of these and many other reflections of a similar kind mr nickleby made the best of his way to the strand and referring to his letter as if to ascertain the number of the house he wanted stopped at a private door about halfway down that crowded thoroughfare  a miniature painter lived there for there was a large gilt frame screwed upon the streetdoor in which were displayed upon a black velvet ground two portraits of naval dress coats with faces looking out of them and telescopes attached one of a young gentleman in a very vermilion uniform flourishing a sabre and one of a literary character with a high forehead a pen and ink six books and a curtain there was moreover a touching representation of a young lady reading a manuscript in an unfathomable forest and a charming whole length of a largeheaded little boy sitting on a stool with his legs foreshortened to the size of saltspoons besides these works of art there were a great many heads of old ladies and gentlemen smirking at each other out of blue and brown skies and an elegantly written card of terms with an embossed border  mr nickleby glanced at these frivolities with great contempt and gave a double knock which having been thrice repeated was answered by a servant girl with an uncommonly dirty face  is mrs nickleby at home girl demanded ralph sharply  her name aint nickleby said the girl la creevy you mean  mr nickleby looked very indignant at the handmaid on being thus corrected and demanded with much asperity what she meant which she was about to state when a female voice proceeding from a perpendicular staircase at the end of the passage inquired who was wanted  mrs nickleby said ralph  its the second floor hannah said the same voice what a stupid thing you are is the second floor at home  somebody went out just now but i think it was the attic which had been a cleaning of himself replied the girl  you had better see said the invisible female show the gentleman where the bell is and tell him he mustnt knock double knocks for the second floor i cant allow a knock except when the bells broke and then it must be two single ones  here said ralph walking in without more parley i beg your pardon is that mrs la whatshername  creevyla creevy replied the voice as a yellow headdress bobbed over the banisters  ill speak to you a moment maam with your leave said ralph  the voice replied that the gentleman was to walk up but he had walked up before it spoke and stepping into the first floor was received by the wearer of the yellow headdress who had a gown to correspond and was of much the same colour herself miss la creevy was a mincing young lady of fifty and miss la creevys apartment was the gilt frame downstairs on a larger scale and something dirtier  hem said miss la creevy coughing delicately behind her black silk mitten a miniature i presume a very stronglymarked countenance for the purpose sir have you ever sat before  you mistake my purpose i see maam replied mr nickleby in his usual blunt fashion i have no money to throw away on miniatures maam and nobody to give one to thank god if i had seeing you on the stairs i wanted to ask a question of you about some lodgers here  miss la creevy coughed once morethis cough was to conceal her disappointmentand said oh indeed  i infer from what you said to your servant that the floor above belongs to you maam said mr nickleby  yes it did miss la creevy replied the upper part of the house belonged to her and as she had no necessity for the secondfloor rooms just then she was in the habit of letting them indeed there was a lady from the country and her two children in them at that present speaking  a widow maam said ralph  yes she is a widow replied the lady  a poor widow maam said ralph with a powerful emphasis on that little adjective which conveys so much  well im afraid she is poor rejoined miss la creevy  i happen to know that she is maam said ralph now what business has a poor widow in such a house as this maam  very true replied miss la creevy not at all displeased with this implied compliment to the apartments exceedingly true  i know her circumstances intimately maam said ralph in fact i am a relation of the family and i should recommend you not to keep them here maam  i should hope if there was any incompatibility to meet the pecuniary obligations said miss la creevy with another cough that the ladys family would  no they wouldnt maam interrupted ralph hastily dont think it  if i am to understand that said miss la creevy the case wears a very different appearance  you may understand it then maam said ralph and make your arrangements accordingly i am the family maamat least i believe i am the only relation they have and i think it right that you should know i cant support them in their extravagances how long have they taken these lodgings for  only from week to week replied miss la creevy mrs nickleby paid the first week in advance  then you had better get them out at the end of it said ralph they cant do better than go back to the country maam they are in everybodys way here  certainly said miss la creevy rubbing her hands if mrs nickleby took the apartments without the means of paying for them it was very unbecoming a lady  of course it was maam said ralph  and naturally continued miss la creevy i who am at presentheman unprotected female cannot afford to lose by the apartments  of course you cant maam replied ralph  though at the same time added miss la creevy who was plainly wavering between her goodnature and her interest i have nothing whatever to say against the lady who is extremely pleasant and affable though poor thing she seems terribly low in her spirits nor against the young people either for nicer or betterbehaved young people cannot be  very well maam said ralph turning to the door for these encomiums on poverty irritated him i have done my duty and perhaps more than i ought of course nobody will thank me for saying what i have  i am sure i am very much obliged to you at least sir said miss la creevy in a gracious manner would you do me the favour to look at a few specimens of my portrait painting  youre very good maam said mr nickleby making off with great speed but as i have a visit to pay upstairs and my time is precious i really cant  at any other time when you are passing i shall be most happy said miss la creevy perhaps you will have the kindness to take a card of terms with you thank yougoodmorning  goodmorning maam said ralph shutting the door abruptly after him to prevent any further conversation now for my sisterinlaw bah  climbing up another perpendicular flight composed with great mechanical ingenuity of nothing but corner stairs mr ralph nickleby stopped to take breath on the landing when he was overtaken by the handmaid whom the politeness of miss la creevy had dispatched to announce him and who had apparently been making a variety of unsuccessful attempts since their last interview to wipe her dirty face clean upon an apron much dirtier  what name said the girl  nickleby replied ralph  oh mrs nickleby said the girl throwing open the door heres mr nickleby  a lady in deep mourning rose as mr ralph nickleby entered but appeared incapable of advancing to meet him and leant upon the arm of a slight but very beautiful girl of about seventeen who had been sitting by her a youth who appeared a year or two older stepped forward and saluted ralph as his uncle  oh growled ralph with an illfavoured frown you are nicholas i suppose  that is my name sir replied the youth  put my hat down said ralph imperiously well maam how do you do you must bear up against sorrow maam i always do  mine was no common loss said mrs nickleby applying her handkerchief to her eyes  it was no uncommon loss maam returned ralph as he coolly unbuttoned his spencer husbands die every day maam and wives too  and brothers also sir said nicholas with a glance of indignation  yes sir and puppies and pugdogs likewise replied his uncle taking a chair you didnt mention in your letter what my brothers complaint was maam  the doctors could attribute it to no particular disease said mrs nickleby shedding tears we have too much reason to fear that he died of a broken heart  pooh said ralph theres no such thing i can understand a mans dying of a broken neck or suffering from a broken arm or a broken head or a broken leg or a broken nose but a broken heartnonsense its the cant of the day if a man cant pay his debts he dies of a broken heart and his widows a martyr  some people i believe have no hearts to break observed nicholas quietly  how old is this boy for gods sake inquired ralph wheeling back his chair and surveying his nephew from head to foot with intense scorn  nicholas is very nearly nineteen replied the widow  nineteen eh said ralph and what do you mean to do for your bread sir  not to live upon my mother replied nicholas his heart swelling as he spoke  youd have little enough to live upon if you did retorted the uncle eyeing him contemptuously  whatever it be said nicholas flushed with anger i shall not look to you to make it more  nicholas my dear recollect yourself remonstrated mrs nickleby  dear nicholas pray urged the young lady  hold your tongue sir said ralph upon my word fine beginnings mrs nicklebyfine beginnings  mrs nickleby made no other reply than entreating nicholas by a gesture to keep silent and the uncle and nephew looked at each other for some seconds without speaking the face of the old man was stern hardfeatured and forbidding that of the young one open handsome and ingenuous the old mans eye was keen with the twinklings of avarice and cunning the young mans bright with the light of intelligence and spirit his figure was somewhat slight but manly and well formed and apart from all the grace of youth and comeliness there was an emanation from the warm young heart in his look and bearing which kept the old man down  however striking such a contrast as this may be to lookerson none ever feel it with half the keenness or acuteness of perfection with which it strikes to the very soul of him whose inferiority it marks it galled ralph to the hearts core and he hated nicholas from that hour  the mutual inspection was at length brought to a close by ralph withdrawing his eyes with a great show of disdain and calling nicholas a boy this word is much used as a term of reproach by elderly gentlemen towards their juniors probably with the view of deluding society into the belief that if they could be young again they wouldnt on any account  well maam said ralph impatiently the creditors have administered you tell me and theres nothing left for you  nothing replied mrs nickleby  and you spent what little money you had in coming all the way to london to see what i could do for you pursued ralph  i hoped faltered mrs nickleby that you might have an opportunity of doing something for your brothers children it was his dying wish that i should appeal to you in their behalf  i dont know how it is muttered ralph walking up and down the room but whenever a man dies without any property of his own he always seems to think he has a right to dispose of other peoples what is your daughter fit for maam  kate has been well educated sobbed mrs nickleby tell your uncle my dear how far you went in french and extras  the poor girl was about to murmur something when her uncle stopped her very unceremoniously  we must try and get you apprenticed at some boardingschool said ralph you have not been brought up too delicately for that i hope  no indeed uncle replied the weeping girl i will try to do anything that will gain me a home and bread  well well said ralph a little softened either by his nieces beauty or her distress stretch a point and say the latter you must try it and if the life is too hard perhaps dressmaking or tambourwork will come lighter have you ever done anything sir turning to his nephew  no replied nicholas bluntly  no i thought not said ralph this is the way my brother brought up his children maam  nicholas has not long completed such education as his poor father could give him rejoined mrs nickleby and he was thinking of  of making something of him someday said ralph the old story always thinking and never doing if my brother had been a man of activity and prudence he might have left you a rich woman maam and if he had turned his son into the world as my father turned me when i wasnt as old as that boy by a year and a half he would have been in a situation to help you instead of being a burden upon you and increasing your distress my brother was a thoughtless inconsiderate man mrs nickleby and nobody i am sure can have better reason to feel that than you  this appeal set the widow upon thinking that perhaps she might have made a more successful venture with her one thousand pounds and then she began to reflect what a comfortable sum it would have been just then which dismal thoughts made her tears flow faster and in the excess of these griefs she being a wellmeaning woman enough but weak withal fell first to deploring her hard fate and then to remarking with many sobs that to be sure she had been a slave to poor nicholas and had often told him she might have married better as indeed she had very often and that she never knew in his lifetime how the money went but that if he had confided in her they might all have been better off that day with other bitter recollections common to most married ladies either during their coverture or afterwards or at both periods mrs nickleby concluded by lamenting that the dear departed had never deigned to profit by her advice save on one occasion which was a strictly veracious statement inasmuch as he had only acted upon it once and had ruined himself in consequence  mr ralph nickleby heard all this with a halfsmile and when the widow had finished quietly took up the subject where it had been left before the above outbreak  are you willing to work sir he inquired frowning on his nephew  of course i am replied nicholas haughtily  then see here sir said his uncle this caught my eye this morning and you may thank your stars for it  with this exordium mr ralph nickleby took a newspaper from his pocket and after unfolding it and looking for a short time among the advertisements read as follows  educationat mr wackford squeerss academy dotheboys hall at the delightful village of dotheboys near greta bridge in yorkshire youth are boarded clothed booked furnished with pocketmoney provided with all necessaries instructed in all languages living and dead mathematics orthography geometry astronomy trigonometry the use of the globes algebra single stick if required writing arithmetic fortification and every other branch of classical literature terms twenty guineas per annum no extras no vacations and diet unparalleled mr squeers is in town and attends daily from one till four at the saracens head snow hill nb an able assistant wanted annual salary 5 pounds a master of arts would be preferred  there said ralph folding the paper again let him get that situation and his fortune is made  but he is not a master of arts said mrs nickleby  that replied ralph that i think can be got over  but the salary is so small and it is such a long way off uncle faltered kate  hush kate my dear interposed mrs nickleby your uncle must know best  i say repeated ralph tartly let him get that situation and his fortune is made if he dont like that let him get one for himself without friends money recommendation or knowledge of business of any kind let him find honest employment in london which will keep him in shoe leather and ill give him a thousand pounds at least said mr ralph nickleby checking himself i would if i had it  poor fellow said the young lady oh uncle must we be separated so soon  dont tease your uncle with questions when he is thinking only for our good my love said mrs nickleby nicholas my dear i wish you would say something  yes mother yes said nicholas who had hitherto remained silent and absorbed in thought if i am fortunate enough to be appointed to this post sir for which i am so imperfectly qualified what will become of those i leave behind  your mother and sister sir replied ralph will be provided for in that case not otherwise by me and placed in some sphere of life in which they will be able to be independent that will be my immediate care they will not remain as they are one week after your departure i will undertake  then said nicholas starting gaily up and wringing his uncles hand i am ready to do anything you wish me let us try our fortune with mr squeers at once he can but refuse  he wont do that said ralph he will be glad to have you on my recommendation make yourself of use to him and youll rise to be a partner in the establishment in no time bless me only think if he were to die why your fortunes made at once  to be sure i see it all said poor nicholas delighted with a thousand visionary ideas that his good spirits and his inexperience were conjuring up before him or suppose some young nobleman who is being educated at the hall were to take a fancy to me and get his father to appoint me his travelling tutor when he left and when we come back from the continent procured me some handsome appointment eh uncle  ah to be sure sneered ralph  and who knows but when he came to see me when i was settled as he would of course he might fall in love with kate who would be keeping my house andand marry her eh uncle who knows  who indeed snarled ralph  how happy we should be cried nicholas with enthusiasm the pain of parting is nothing to the joy of meeting again kate will be a beautiful woman and i so proud to hear them say so and mother so happy to be with us once again and all these sad times forgotten and the picture was too bright a one to bear and nicholas fairly overpowered by it smiled faintly and burst into tears  this simple family born and bred in retirement and wholly unacquainted with what is called the worlda conventional phrase which being interpreted often signifieth all the rascals in itmingled their tears together at the thought of their first separation and this first gush of feeling over were proceeding to dilate with all the buoyancy of untried hope on the bright prospects before them when mr ralph nickleby suggested that if they lost time some more fortunate candidate might deprive nicholas of the steppingstone to fortune which the advertisement pointed out and so undermine all their airbuilt castles this timely reminder effectually stopped the conversation nicholas having carefully copied the address of mr squeers the uncle and nephew issued forth together in quest of that accomplished gentleman nicholas firmly persuading himself that he had done his relative great injustice in disliking him at first sight and mrs nickleby being at some pains to inform her daughter that she was sure he was a much more kindly disposed person than he seemed which miss nickleby dutifully remarked he might very easily be  to tell the truth the good ladys opinion had been not a little influenced by her brotherinlaws appeal to her better understanding and his implied compliment to her high deserts and although she had dearly loved her husband and still doted on her children he had struck so successfully on one of those little jarring chords in the human heart ralph was well acquainted with its worst weaknesses though he knew nothing of its best that she had already begun seriously to consider herself the amiable and suffering victim of her late husbands imprudence    chapter 4  nicholas and his uncle to secure the fortune without loss of time wait upon mr wackford squeers the yorkshire schoolmaster   snow hill what kind of place can the quiet townspeople who see the words emblazoned in all the legibility of gilt letters and dark shading on the northcountry coaches take snow hill to be all people have some undefined and shadowy notion of a place whose name is frequently before their eyes or often in their ears what a vast number of random ideas there must be perpetually floating about regarding this same snow hill the name is such a good one snow hillsnow hill too coupled with a saracens head picturing to us by a double association of ideas something stern and rugged a bleak desolate tract of country open to piercing blasts and fierce wintry stormsa dark cold gloomy heath lonely by day and scarcely to be thought of by honest folks at nighta place which solitary wayfarers shun and where desperate robbers congregatethis or something like this should be the prevalent notion of snow hill in those remote and rustic parts through which the saracens head like some grim apparition rushes each day and night with mysterious and ghostlike punctuality holding its swift and headlong course in all weathers and seeming to bid defiance to the very elements themselves  the reality is rather different but by no means to be despised notwithstanding there at the very core of london in the heart of its business and animation in the midst of a whirl of noise and motion stemming as it were the giant currents of life that flow ceaselessly on from different quarters and meet beneath its walls stands newgate and in that crowded street on which it frowns so darklywithin a few feet of the squalid tottering housesupon the very spot on which the vendors of soup and fish and damaged fruit are now plying their tradesscores of human beings amidst a roar of sounds to which even the tumult of a great city is as nothing four six or eight strong men at a time have been hurried violently and swiftly from the world when the scene has been rendered frightful with excess of human life when curious eyes have glared from casement and housetop and wall and pillar and when in the mass of white and upturned faces the dying wretch in his allcomprehensive look of agony has met not onenot onethat bore the impress of pity or compassion  near to the jail and by consequence near to smithfield also and the compter and the bustle and noise of the city and just on that particular part of snow hill where omnibus horses going eastward seriously think of falling down on purpose and where horses in hackney cabriolets going westward not unfrequently fall by accident is the coachyard of the saracens head inn its portal guarded by two saracens heads and shoulders which it was once the pride and glory of the choice spirits of this metropolis to pull down at night but which have for some time remained in undisturbed tranquillity possibly because this species of humour is now confined to st jamess parish where door knockers are preferred as being more portable and bellwires esteemed as convenient toothpicks whether this be the reason or not there they are frowning upon you from each side of the gateway the inn itself garnished with another saracens head frowns upon you from the top of the yard while from the door of the hind boot of all the red coaches that are standing therein there glares a small saracens head with a twin expression to the large saracens heads below so that the general appearance of the pile is decidedly of the saracenic order  when you walk up this yard you will see the bookingoffice on your left and the tower of st sepulchres church darting abruptly up into the sky on your right and a gallery of bedrooms on both sides just before you you will observe a long window with the words coffeeroom legibly painted above it and looking out of that window you would have seen in addition if you had gone at the right time mr wackford squeers with his hands in his pockets  mr squeerss appearance was not prepossessing he had but one eye and the popular prejudice runs in favour of two the eye he had was unquestionably useful but decidedly not ornamental being of a greenish grey and in shape resembling the fanlight of a street door the blank side of his face was much wrinkled and puckered up which gave him a very sinister appearance especially when he smiled at which times his expression bordered closely on the villainous his hair was very flat and shiny save at the ends where it was brushed stiffly up from a low protruding forehead which assorted well with his harsh voice and coarse manner he was about two or three and fifty and a trifle below the middle size he wore a white neckerchief with long ends and a suit of scholastic black but his coat sleeves being a great deal too long and his trousers a great deal too short he appeared ill at ease in his clothes and as if he were in a perpetual state of astonishment at finding himself so respectable  mr squeers was standing in a box by one of the coffeeroom fireplaces fitted with one such table as is usually seen in coffeerooms and two of extraordinary shapes and dimensions made to suit the angles of the partition in a corner of the seat was a very small deal trunk tied round with a scanty piece of cord and on the trunk was perchedhis laceup halfboots and corduroy trousers dangling in the aira diminutive boy with his shoulders drawn up to his ears and his hands planted on his knees who glanced timidly at the schoolmaster from time to time with evident dread and apprehension  halfpast three muttered mr squeers turning from the window and looking sulkily at the coffeeroom clock there will be nobody here today  much vexed by this reflection mr squeers looked at the little boy to see whether he was doing anything he could beat him for as he happened not to be doing anything at all he merely boxed his ears and told him not to do it again  at midsummer muttered mr squeers resuming his complaint i took down ten boys ten twenties is two hundred pound i go back at eight oclock tomorrow morning and have got only threethree oughts is an oughtthree twos is sixsixty pound whats come of all the boys whats parents got in their heads what does it all mean  here the little boy on the top of the trunk gave a violent sneeze  halloa sir growled the schoolmaster turning round whats that sir  nothing please sir replied the little boy  nothing sir exclaimed mr squeers  please sir i sneezed rejoined the boy trembling till the little trunk shook under him  oh sneezed did you retorted mr squeers then what did you say nothing for sir  in default of a better answer to this question the little boy screwed a couple of knuckles into each of his eyes and began to cry wherefore mr squeers knocked him off the trunk with a blow on one side of the face and knocked him on again with a blow on the other  wait till i get you down into yorkshire my young gentleman said mr squeers and then ill give you the rest will you hold that noise sir  yeyeyes sobbed the little boy rubbing his face very hard with the beggars petition in printed calico  then do so at once sir said squeers do you hear  as this admonition was accompanied with a threatening gesture and uttered with a savage aspect the little boy rubbed his face harder as if to keep the tears back and beyond alternately sniffing and choking gave no further vent to his emotions  mr squeers said the waiter looking in at this juncture heres a gentleman asking for you at the bar  show the gentleman in richard replied mr squeers in a soft voice put your handkerchief in your pocket you little scoundrel or ill murder you when the gentleman goes  the schoolmaster had scarcely uttered these words in a fierce whisper when the stranger entered affecting not to see him mr squeers feigned to be intent upon mending a pen and offering benevolent advice to his youthful pupil  my dear child said mr squeers all people have their trials this early trial of yours that is fit to make your little heart burst and your very eyes come out of your head with crying what is it nothing less than nothing you are leaving your friends but you will have a father in me my dear and a mother in mrs squeers at the delightful village of dotheboys near greta bridge in yorkshire where youth are boarded clothed booked washed furnished with pocketmoney provided with all necessaries  it is the gentleman observed the stranger stopping the schoolmaster in the rehearsal of his advertisement mr squeers i believe sir  the same sir said mr squeers with an assumption of extreme surprise  the gentleman said the stranger that advertised in the times newspaper  morning post chronicle herald and advertiser regarding the academy called dotheboys hall at the delightful village of dotheboys near greta bridge in yorkshire added mr squeers you come on business sir i see by my young friends how do you do my little gentleman and how do you do sir with this salutation mr squeers patted the heads of two holloweyed smallboned little boys whom the applicant had brought with him and waited for further communications  i am in the oil and colour way my name is snawley sir said the stranger  squeers inclined his head as much as to say and a remarkably pretty name too  the stranger continued i have been thinking mr squeers of placing my two boys at your school  it is not for me to say so sir replied mr squeers but i dont think you could possibly do a better thing  hem said the other twenty pounds per annewum i believe mr squeers  guineas rejoined the schoolmaster with a persuasive smile  pounds for two i think mr squeers said mr snawley solemnly  i dont think it could be done sir replied squeers as if he had never considered the proposition before let me see four fives is twenty double that and deduct thewell a pound either way shall not stand betwixt us you must recommend me to your connection sir and make it up that way  they are not great eaters said mr snawley  oh that doesnt matter at all replied squeers we dont consider the boys appetites at our establishment this was strictly true they did not  every wholesome luxury sir that yorkshire can afford continued squeers every beautiful moral that mrs squeers can instil everyin short every comfort of a home that a boy could wish for will be theirs mr snawley  i should wish their morals to be particularly attended to said mr snawley  i am glad of that sir replied the schoolmaster drawing himself up they have come to the right shop for morals sir  you are a moral man yourself said mr snawley  i rather believe i am sir replied squeers  i have the satisfaction to know you are sir said mr snawley i asked one of your references and he said you were pious  well sir i hope i am a little in that line replied squeers  i hope i am also rejoined the other could i say a few words with you in the next box  by all means rejoined squeers with a grin my dears will you speak to your new playfellow a minute or two that is one of my boys sir belling his name isa taunton boy that sir  is he indeed rejoined mr snawley looking at the poor little urchin as if he were some extraordinary natural curiosity  he goes down with me tomorrow sir said squeers thats his luggage that he is a sitting upon now each boy is required to bring sir two suits of clothes six shirts six pair of stockings two nightcaps two pockethandkerchiefs two pair of shoes two hats and a razor  a razor exclaimed mr snawley as they walked into the next box what for  to shave with replied squeers in a slow and measured tone  there was not much in these three words but there must have been something in the manner in which they were said to attract attention for the schoolmaster and his companion looked steadily at each other for a few seconds and then exchanged a very meaning smile snawley was a sleek flatnosed man clad in sombre garments and long black gaiters and bearing in his countenance an expression of much mortification and sanctity so his smiling without any obvious reason was the more remarkable  up to what age do you keep boys at your school then he asked at length  just as long as their friends make the quarterly payments to my agent in town or until such time as they run away replied squeers let us understand each other i see we may safely do so what are these boysnatural children  no rejoined snawley meeting the gaze of the schoolmasters one eye they aint  i thought they might be said squeers coolly we have a good many of them that boys one  him in the next box said snawley  squeers nodded in the affirmative his companion took another peep at the little boy on the trunk and turning round again looked as if he were quite disappointed to see him so much like other boys and said he should hardly have thought it  he is cried squeers but about these boys of yours you wanted to speak to me  yes replied snawley the fact is i am not their father mr squeers im only their fatherinlaw  oh is that it said the schoolmaster that explains it at once i was wondering what the devil you were going to send them to yorkshire for ha ha oh i understand now  you see i have married the mother pursued snawley its expensive keeping boys at home and as she has a little money in her own right i am afraid women are so very foolish mr squeers that she might be led to squander it on them which would be their ruin you know  i see returned squeers throwing himself back in his chair and waving his hand  and this resumed snawley has made me anxious to put them to some school a good distance off where there are no holidaysnone of those illjudged coming home twice a year that unsettle childrens minds soand where they may rough it a littleyou comprehend  the payments regular and no questions asked said squeers nodding his head  thats it exactly rejoined the other morals strictly attended to though  strictly said squeers  not too much writing home allowed i suppose said the fatherinlaw hesitating  none except a circular at christmas to say they never were so happy and hope they may never be sent for rejoined squeers  nothing could be better said the fatherinlaw rubbing his hands  then as we understand each other said squeers will you allow me to ask you whether you consider me a highly virtuous exemplary and wellconducted man in private life and whether as a person whose business it is to take charge of youth you place the strongest confidence in my unimpeachable integrity liberality religious principles and ability  certainly i do replied the fatherinlaw reciprocating the schoolmasters grin  perhaps you wont object to say that if i make you a reference  not the least in the world  thats your sort said squeers taking up a pen this is doing business and thats what i like  having entered mr snawleys address the schoolmaster had next to perform the still more agreeable office of entering the receipt of the first quarters payment in advance which he had scarcely completed when another voice was heard inquiring for mr squeers  here he is replied the schoolmaster what is it  only a matter of business sir said ralph nickleby presenting himself closely followed by nicholas there was an advertisement of yours in the papers this morning  there was sir this way if you please said squeers who had by this time got back to the box by the fireplace wont you be seated  why i think i will replied ralph suiting the action to the word and placing his hat on the table before him this is my nephew sir mr nicholas nickleby  how do you do sir said squeers  nicholas bowed said he was very well and seemed very much astonished at the outward appearance of the proprietor of dotheboys hall as indeed he was  perhaps you recollect me said ralph looking narrowly at the schoolmaster  you paid me a small account at each of my halfyearly visits to town for some years i think sir replied squeers  i did rejoined ralph  for the parents of a boy named dorker who unfortunately  unfortunately died at dotheboys hall said ralph finishing the sentence  i remember very well sir rejoined squeers ah mrs squeers sir was as partial to that lad as if he had been her own the attention sir that was bestowed upon that boy in his illness dry toast and warm tea offered him every night and morning when he couldnt swallow anythinga candle in his bedroom on the very night he diedthe best dictionary sent up for him to lay his head uponi dont regret it though it is a pleasant thing to reflect that one did ones duty by him  ralph smiled as if he meant anything but smiling and looked round at the strangers present  these are only some pupils of mine said wackford squeers pointing to the little boy on the trunk and the two little boys on the floor who had been staring at each other without uttering a word and writhing their bodies into most remarkable contortions according to the custom of little boys when they first become acquainted this gentleman sir is a parent who is kind enough to compliment me upon the course of education adopted at dotheboys hall which is situated sir at the delightful village of dotheboys near greta bridge in yorkshire where youth are boarded clothed booked washed furnished with pocketmoney  yes we know all about that sir interrupted ralph testily its in the advertisement  you are very right sir it is in the advertisement replied squeers  and in the matter of fact besides interrupted mr snawley i feel bound to assure you sir and i am proud to have this opportunity of assuring you that i consider mr squeers a gentleman highly virtuous exemplary well conducted and  i make no doubt of it sir interrupted ralph checking the torrent of recommendation no doubt of it at all suppose we come to business  with all my heart sir rejoined squeers never postpone business is the very first lesson we instil into our commercial pupils master belling my dear always remember that do you hear  yes sir repeated master belling  he recollects what it is does he said ralph  tell the gentleman said squeers  never repeated master belling  very good said squeers go on  never repeated master belling again  very good indeed said squeers yes  p suggested nicholas goodnaturedly  performbusiness said master belling neverperformbusiness  very well sir said squeers darting a withering look at the culprit you and i will perform a little business on our private account byandby  and just now said ralph we had better transact our own perhaps  if you please said squeers  well resumed ralph its brief enough soon broached and i hope easily concluded you have advertised for an able assistant sir  precisely so said squeers  and you really want one  certainly answered squeers  here he is said ralph my nephew nicholas hot from school with everything he learnt there fermenting in his head and nothing fermenting in his pocket is just the man you want  i am afraid said squeers perplexed with such an application from a youth of nicholass figure i am afraid the young man wont suit me  yes he will said ralph i know better dont be cast down sir you will be teaching all the young noblemen in dotheboys hall in less than a weeks time unless this gentleman is more obstinate than i take him to be  i fear sir said nicholas addressing mr squeers that you object to my youth and to my not being a master of arts  the absence of a college degree is an objection replied squeers looking as grave as he could and considerably puzzled no less by the contrast between the simplicity of the nephew and the worldly manner of the uncle than by the incomprehensible allusion to the young noblemen under his tuition  look here sir said ralph ill put this matter in its true light in two seconds  if youll have the goodness rejoined squeers  this is a boy or a youth or a lad or a young man or a hobbledehoy or whatever you like to call him of eighteen or nineteen or thereabouts said ralph  that i see observed the schoolmaster  so do i said mr snawley thinking it as well to back his new friend occasionally  his father is dead he is wholly ignorant of the world has no resources whatever and wants something to do said ralph i recommend him to this splendid establishment of yours as an opening which will lead him to fortune if he turns it to proper account do you see that  everybody must see that replied squeers half imitating the sneer with which the old gentleman was regarding his unconscious relative  i do of course said nicholas eagerly  he does of course you observe said ralph in the same dry hard manner if any caprice of temper should induce him to cast aside this golden opportunity before he has brought it to perfection i consider myself absolved from extending any assistance to his mother and sister look at him and think of the use he may be to you in halfadozen ways now the question is whether for some time to come at all events he wont serve your purpose better than twenty of the kind of people you would get under ordinary circumstances isnt that a question for consideration  yes it is said squeers answering a nod of ralphs head with a nod of his own  good rejoined ralph let me have two words with you  the two words were had apart in a couple of minutes mr wackford squeers announced that mr nicholas nickleby was from that moment thoroughly nominated to and installed in the office of first assistant master at dotheboys hall  your uncles recommendation has done it mr nickleby said wackford squeers  nicholas overjoyed at his success shook his uncles hand warmly and could almost have worshipped squeers upon the spot  he is an oddlooking man thought nicholas what of that porson was an oddlooking man and so was doctor johnson all these bookworms are  at eight oclock tomorrow morning mr nickleby said squeers the coach starts you must be here at a quarter before as we take these boys with us  certainly sir said nicholas  and your fare down i have paid growled ralph so youll have nothing to do but keep yourself warm  here was another instance of his uncles generosity nicholas felt his unexpected kindness so much that he could scarcely find words to thank him indeed he had not found half enough when they took leave of the schoolmaster and emerged from the saracens head gateway  i shall be here in the morning to see you fairly off said ralph no skulking  thank you sir replied nicholas i never shall forget this kindness  take care you dont replied his uncle you had better go home now and pack up what you have got to pack do you think you could find your way to golden square first  certainly said nicholas i can easily inquire  leave these papers with my clerk then said ralph producing a small parcel and tell him to wait till i come home  nicholas cheerfully undertook the errand and bidding his worthy uncle an affectionate farewell which that warmhearted old gentleman acknowledged by a growl hastened away to execute his commission  he found golden square in due course mr noggs who had stepped out for a minute or so to the publichouse was opening the door with a latchkey as he reached the steps  whats that inquired noggs pointing to the parcel  papers from my uncle replied nicholas and youre to have the goodness to wait till he comes home if you please  uncle cried noggs  mr nickleby said nicholas in explanation  come in said newman  without another word he led nicholas into the passage and thence into the official pantry at the end of it where he thrust him into a chair and mounting upon his high stool sat with his arms hanging straight down by his sides gazing fixedly upon him as from a tower of observation  there is no answer said nicholas laying the parcel on a table beside him  newman said nothing but folding his arms and thrusting his head forward so as to obtain a nearer view of nicholass face scanned his features closely  no answer said nicholas speaking very loud under the impression that newman noggs was deaf  newman placed his hands upon his knees and without uttering a syllable continued the same close scrutiny of his companions face  this was such a very singular proceeding on the part of an utter stranger and his appearance was so extremely peculiar that nicholas who had a sufficiently keen sense of the ridiculous could not refrain from breaking into a smile as he inquired whether mr noggs had any commands for him  noggs shook his head and sighed upon which nicholas rose and remarking that he required no rest bade him goodmorning  it was a great exertion for newman noggs and nobody knows to this day how he ever came to make it the other party being wholly unknown to him but he drew a long breath and actually said out loud without once stopping that if the young gentleman did not object to tell he should like to know what his uncle was going to do for him  nicholas had not the least objection in the world but on the contrary was rather pleased to have an opportunity of talking on the subject which occupied his thoughts so he sat down again and his sanguine imagination warming as he spoke entered into a fervent and glowing description of all the honours and advantages to be derived from his appointment at that seat of learning dotheboys hall  but whats the matterare you ill said nicholas suddenly breaking off as his companion after throwing himself into a variety of uncouth attitudes thrust his hands under the stool and cracked his fingerjoints as if he were snapping all the bones in his hands  newman noggs made no reply but went on shrugging his shoulders and cracking his fingerjoints smiling horribly all the time and looking steadfastly at nothing out of the tops of his eyes in a most ghastly manner  at first nicholas thought the mysterious man was in a fit but on further consideration decided that he was in liquor under which circumstances he deemed it prudent to make off at once he looked back when he had got the streetdoor open newman noggs was still indulging in the same extraordinary gestures and the cracking of his fingers sounded louder that ever    chapter 5  nicholas starts for yorkshire of his leavetaking and his fellowtravellers and what befell them on the road   if tears dropped into a trunk were charms to preserve its owner from sorrow and misfortune nicholas nickleby would have commenced his expedition under most happy auspices there was so much to be done and so little time to do it in so many kind words to be spoken and such bitter pain in the hearts in which they rose to impede their utterance that the little preparations for his journey were made mournfully indeed a hundred things which the anxious care of his mother and sister deemed indispensable for his comfort nicholas insisted on leaving behind as they might prove of some after use or might be convertible into money if occasion required a hundred affectionate contests on such points as these took place on the sad night which preceded his departure and as the termination of every angerless dispute brought them nearer and nearer to the close of their slight preparations kate grew busier and busier and wept more silently  the box was packed at last and then there came supper with some little delicacy provided for the occasion and as a setoff against the expense of which kate and her mother had feigned to dine when nicholas was out the poor lad nearly choked himself by attempting to partake of it and almost suffocated himself in affecting a jest or two and forcing a melancholy laugh thus they lingered on till the hour of separating for the night was long past and then they found that they might as well have given vent to their real feelings before for they could not suppress them do what they would so they let them have their way and even that was a relief  nicholas slept well till six next morning dreamed of home or of what was home onceno matter which for things that are changed or gone will come back as they used to be thank god in sleepand rose quite brisk and gay he wrote a few lines in pencil to say the goodbye which he was afraid to pronounce himself and laying them with half his scanty stock of money at his sisters door shouldered his box and crept softly downstairs  is that you hannah cried a voice from miss la creevys sittingroom whence shone the light of a feeble candle  it is i miss la creevy said nicholas putting down the box and looking in  bless us exclaimed miss la creevy starting and putting her hand to her curlpapers youre up very early mr nickleby  so are you replied nicholas  its the fine arts that bring me out of bed mr nickleby returned the lady im waiting for the light to carry out an idea  miss la creevy had got up early to put a fancy nose into a miniature of an ugly little boy destined for his grandmother in the country who was expected to bequeath him property if he was like the family  to carry out an idea repeated miss la creevy and thats the great convenience of living in a thoroughfare like the strand when i want a nose or an eye for any particular sitter i have only to look out of window and wait till i get one  does it take long to get a nose now inquired nicholas smiling  why that depends in a great measure on the pattern replied miss la creevy snubs and romans are plentiful enough and there are flats of all sorts and sizes when theres a meeting at exeter hall but perfect aquilines i am sorry to say are scarce and we generally use them for uniforms or public characters  indeed said nicholas if i should meet with any in my travels ill endeavour to sketch them for you  you dont mean to say that you are really going all the way down into yorkshire this cold winters weather mr nickleby said miss la creevy i heard something of it last night  i do indeed replied nicholas needs must you know when somebody drives necessity is my driver and that is only another name for the same gentleman  well i am very sorry for it thats all i can say said miss la creevy as much on your mothers and sisters account as on yours your sister is a very pretty young lady mr nickleby and that is an additional reason why she should have somebody to protect her i persuaded her to give me a sitting or two for the streetdoor case ah shell make a sweet miniature as miss la creevy spoke she held up an ivory countenance intersected with very perceptible skyblue veins and regarded it with so much complacency that nicholas quite envied her  if you ever have an opportunity of showing kate some little kindness said nicholas presenting his hand i think you will  depend upon that said the goodnatured miniature painter and god bless you mr nickleby and i wish you well  it was very little that nicholas knew of the world but he guessed enough about its ways to think that if he gave miss la creevy one little kiss perhaps she might not be the less kindly disposed towards those he was leaving behind so he gave her three or four with a kind of jocose gallantry and miss la creevy evinced no greater symptoms of displeasure than declaring as she adjusted her yellow turban that she had never heard of such a thing and couldnt have believed it possible  having terminated the unexpected interview in this satisfactory manner nicholas hastily withdrew himself from the house by the time he had found a man to carry his box it was only seven oclock so he walked slowly on a little in advance of the porter and very probably with not half as light a heart in his breast as the man had although he had no waistcoat to cover it with and had evidently from the appearance of his other garments been spending the night in a stable and taking his breakfast at a pump  regarding with no small curiosity and interest all the busy preparations for the coming day which every street and almost every house displayed and thinking now and then that it seemed rather hard that so many people of all ranks and stations could earn a livelihood in london and that he should be compelled to journey so far in search of one nicholas speedily arrived at the saracens head snow hill having dismissed his attendant and seen the box safely deposited in the coachoffice he looked into the coffeeroom in search of mr squeers  he found that learned gentleman sitting at breakfast with the three little boys before noticed and two others who had turned up by some lucky chance since the interview of the previous day ranged in a row on the opposite seat mr squeers had before him a small measure of coffee a plate of hot toast and a cold round of beef but he was at that moment intent on preparing breakfast for the little boys  this is twopennorth of milk is it waiter said mr squeers looking down into a large blue mug and slanting it gently so as to get an accurate view of the quantity of liquid contained in it  thats twopennorth sir replied the waiter  what a rare article milk is to be sure in london said mr squeers with a sigh just fill that mug up with lukewarm water william will you  to the wery top sir inquired the waiter why the milk will be drownded  never you mind that replied mr squeers serve it right for being so dear you ordered that thick bread and butter for three did you  coming directly sir  you neednt hurry yourself said squeers theres plenty of time conquer your passions boys and dont be eager after vittles as he uttered this moral precept mr squeers took a large bite out of the cold beef and recognised nicholas  sit down mr nickleby said squeers here we are a breakfasting you see  nicholas did not see that anybody was breakfasting except mr squeers but he bowed with all becoming reverence and looked as cheerful as he could  oh thats the milk and water is it william said squeers very good dont forget the bread and butter presently  at this fresh mention of the bread and butter the five little boys looked very eager and followed the waiter out with their eyes meanwhile mr squeers tasted the milk and water  ah said that gentleman smacking his lips heres richness think of the many beggars and orphans in the streets that would be glad of this little boys a shocking thing hunger isnt it mr nickleby  very shocking sir said nicholas  when i say number one pursued mr squeers putting the mug before the children the boy on the left hand nearest the window may take a drink and when i say number two the boy next him will go in and so till we come to number five which is the last boy are you ready  yes sir cried all the little boys with great eagerness  thats right said squeers calmly getting on with his breakfast keep ready till i tell you to begin subdue your appetites my dears and youve conquered human natur this is the way we inculcate strength of mind mr nickleby said the schoolmaster turning to nicholas and speaking with his mouth very full of beef and toast  nicholas murmured somethinghe knew not whatin reply and the little boys dividing their gaze between the mug the bread and butter which had by this time arrived and every morsel which mr squeers took into his mouth remained with strained eyes in torments of expectation  thank god for a good breakfast said squeers when he had finished number one may take a drink  number one seized the mug ravenously and had just drunk enough to make him wish for more when mr squeers gave the signal for number two who gave up at the same interesting moment to number three and the process was repeated until the milk and water terminated with number five  and now said the schoolmaster dividing the bread and butter for three into as many portions as there were children you had better look sharp with your breakfast for the horn will blow in a minute or two and then every boy leaves off  permission being thus given to fall to the boys began to eat voraciously and in desperate haste while the schoolmaster who was in high good humour after his meal picked his teeth with a fork and looked smilingly on in a very short time the horn was heard  i thought it wouldnt be long said squeers jumping up and producing a little basket from under the seat put what you havent had time to eat in here boys youll want it on the road  nicholas was considerably startled by these very economical arrangements but he had no time to reflect upon them for the little boys had to be got up to the top of the coach and their boxes had to be brought out and put in and mr squeerss luggage was to be seen carefully deposited in the boot and all these offices were in his department he was in the full heat and bustle of concluding these operations when his uncle mr ralph nickleby accosted him  oh here you are sir said ralph here are your mother and sister sir  where cried nicholas looking hastily round  here replied his uncle having too much money and nothing at all to do with it they were paying a hackney coach as i came up sir  we were afraid of being too late to see him before he went away from us said mrs nickleby embracing her son heedless of the unconcerned lookerson in the coachyard  very good maam returned ralph youre the best judge of course i merely said that you were paying a hackney coach i never pay a hackney coach maam i never hire one i havent been in a hackney coach of my own hiring for thirty years and i hope i shant be for thirty more if i live as long  i should never have forgiven myself if i had not seen him said mrs nickleby poor dear boygoing away without his breakfast too because he feared to distress us  mighty fine certainly said ralph with great testiness when i first went to business maam i took a penny loaf and a haporth of milk for my breakfast as i walked to the city every morning what do you say to that maam breakfast bah  now nickleby said squeers coming up at the moment buttoning his greatcoat i think youd better get up behind im afraid of one of them boys falling off and then theres twenty pound a year gone  dear nicholas whispered kate touching her brothers arm who is that vulgar man  eh growled ralph whose quick ears had caught the inquiry do you wish to be introduced to mr squeers my dear  that the schoolmaster no uncle oh no replied kate shrinking back  im sure i heard you say as much my dear retorted ralph in his cold sarcastic manner mr squeers heres my niece nicholass sister  very glad to make your acquaintance miss said squeers raising his hat an inch or two i wish mrs squeers took gals and we had you for a teacher i dont know though whether she mightnt grow jealous if we had ha ha ha  if the proprietor of dotheboys hall could have known what was passing in his assistants breast at that moment he would have discovered with some surprise that he was as near being soundly pummelled as he had ever been in his life kate nickleby having a quicker perception of her brothers emotions led him gently aside and thus prevented mr squeers from being impressed with the fact in a peculiarly disagreeable manner  my dear nicholas said the young lady who is this man what kind of place can it be that you are going to  i hardly know kate replied nicholas pressing his sisters hand i suppose the yorkshire folks are rather rough and uncultivated thats all  but this person urged kate  is my employer or master or whatever the proper name may be replied nicholas quickly and i was an ass to take his coarseness ill they are looking this way and it is time i was in my place bless you love and goodbye mother look forward to our meeting again someday uncle farewell thank you heartily for all you have done and all you mean to do quite ready sir  with these hasty adieux nicholas mounted nimbly to his seat and waved his hand as gallantly as if his heart went with it  at this moment when the coachman and guard were comparing notes for the last time before starting on the subject of the waybill when porters were screwing out the last reluctant sixpences itinerant newsmen making the last offer of a morning paper and the horses giving the last impatient rattle to their harness nicholas felt somebody pulling softly at his leg he looked down and there stood newman noggs who pushed up into his hand a dirty letter  whats this inquired nicholas  hush rejoined noggs pointing to mr ralph nickleby who was saying a few earnest words to squeers a short distance off take it read it nobody knows thats all  stop cried nicholas  no replied noggs  nicholas cried stop again but newman noggs was gone  a minutes bustle a banging of the coach doors a swaying of the vehicle to one side as the heavy coachman and still heavier guard climbed into their seats a cry of all right a few notes from the horn a hasty glance of two sorrowful faces below and the hard features of mr ralph nicklebyand the coach was gone too and rattling over the stones of smithfield  the little boys legs being too short to admit of their feet resting upon anything as they sat and the little boys bodies being consequently in imminent hazard of being jerked off the coach nicholas had enough to do over the stones to hold them on between the manual exertion and the mental anxiety attendant upon this task he was not a little relieved when the coach stopped at the peacock at islington he was still more relieved when a heartylooking gentleman with a very goodhumoured face and a very fresh colour got up behind and proposed to take the other corner of the seat  if we put some of these youngsters in the middle said the newcomer theyll be safer in case of their going to sleep eh  if youll have the goodness sir replied squeers thatll be the very thing mr nickleby take three of them boys between you and the gentleman belling and the youngest snawley can sit between me and the guard three children said squeers explaining to the stranger books as two  i have not the least objection i am sure said the freshcoloured gentleman i have a brother who wouldnt object to book his six children as two at any butchers or bakers in the kingdom i dare say far from it  six children sir exclaimed squeers  yes and all boys replied the stranger  mr nickleby said squeers in great haste catch hold of that basket let me give you a card sir of an establishment where those six boys can be brought up in an enlightened liberal and moral manner with no mistake at all about it for twenty guineas a year eachtwenty guineas siror id take all the boys together upon a average right through and say a hundred pound a year for the lot  oh said the gentleman glancing at the card you are the mr squeers mentioned here i presume  yes i am sir replied the worthy pedagogue mr wackford squeers is my name and im very far from being ashamed of it these are some of my boys sir thats one of my assistants sirmr nickleby a gentlemans son and a good scholar mathematical classical and commercial we dont do things by halves at our shop all manner of learning my boys take down sir the expense is never thought of and they get paternal treatment and washing in  upon my word said the gentleman glancing at nicholas with a halfsmile and a more than half expression of surprise these are advantages indeed  you may say that sir rejoined squeers thrusting his hands into his greatcoat pockets the most unexceptionable references are given and required i wouldnt take a reference with any boy that wasnt responsible for the payment of five pound five a quarter no not if you went down on your knees and asked me with the tears running down your face to do it  highly considerate said the passenger  its my great aim and end to be considerate sir rejoined squeers snawley junior if you dont leave off chattering your teeth and shaking with the cold ill warm you with a severe thrashing in about half a minutes time  sit fast here genelmen said the guard as he clambered up  all right behind there dick cried the coachman  all right was the reply off she goes and off she did goif coaches be feminineamidst a loud flourish from the guards horn and the calm approval of all the judges of coaches and coachhorses congregated at the peacock but more especially of the helpers who stood with the cloths over their arms watching the coach till it disappeared and then lounged admiringly stablewards bestowing various gruff encomiums on the beauty of the turnout  when the guard who was a stout old yorkshireman had blown himself quite out of breath he put the horn into a little tunnel of a basket fastened to the coachside for the purpose and giving himself a plentiful shower of blows on the chest and shoulders observed it was uncommon cold after which he demanded of every person separately whether he was going right through and if not where he was going satisfactory replies being made to these queries he surmised that the roads were pretty heavy arter that fall last night and took the liberty of asking whether any of them gentlemen carried a snuffbox it happening that nobody did he remarked with a mysterious air that he had heard a medical gentleman as went down to grantham last week say how that snufftaking was bad for the eyes but for his part he had never found it so and what he said was that everybody should speak as they found nobody attempting to controvert this position he took a small brownpaper parcel out of his hat and putting on a pair of horn spectacles the writing being crabbed read the direction halfadozen times over having done which he consigned the parcel to its old place put up his spectacles again and stared at everybody in turn after this he took another blow at the horn by way of refreshment and having now exhausted his usual topics of conversation folded his arms as well as he could in so many coats and falling into a solemn silence looked carelessly at the familiar objects which met his eye on every side as the coach rolled on the only things he seemed to care for being horses and droves of cattle which he scrutinised with a critical air as they were passed upon the road  the weather was intensely and bitterly cold a great deal of snow fell from time to time and the wind was intolerably keen mr squeers got down at almost every stageto stretch his legs as he saidand as he always came back from such excursions with a very red nose and composed himself to sleep directly there is reason to suppose that he derived great benefit from the process the little pupils having been stimulated with the remains of their breakfast and further invigorated by sundry small cups of a curious cordial carried by mr squeers which tasted very like toastandwater put into a brandy bottle by mistake went to sleep woke shivered and cried as their feelings prompted nicholas and the goodtempered man found so many things to talk about that between conversing together and cheering up the boys the time passed with them as rapidly as it could under such adverse circumstances  so the day wore on at eton slocomb there was a good coach dinner of which the box the four front outsides the one inside nicholas the goodtempered man and mr squeers partook while the five little boys were put to thaw by the fire and regaled with sandwiches a stage or two further on the lamps were lighted and a great todo occasioned by the taking up at a roadside inn of a very fastidious lady with an infinite variety of cloaks and small parcels who loudly lamented for the behoof of the outsides the nonarrival of her own carriage which was to have taken her on and made the guard solemnly promise to stop every green chariot he saw coming which as it was a dark night and he was sitting with his face the other way that officer undertook with many fervent asseverations to do lastly the fastidious lady finding there was a solitary gentleman inside had a small lamp lighted which she carried in reticule and being after much trouble shut in the horses were put into a brisk canter and the coach was once more in rapid motion  the night and the snow came on together and dismal enough they were there was no sound to be heard but the howling of the wind for the noise of the wheels and the tread of the horses feet were rendered inaudible by the thick coating of snow which covered the ground and was fast increasing every moment the streets of stamford were deserted as they passed through the town and its old churches rose frowning and dark from the whitened ground twenty miles further on two of the front outside passengers wisely availing themselves of their arrival at one of the best inns in england turned in for the night at the george at grantham the remainder wrapped themselves more closely in their coats and cloaks and leaving the light and warmth of the town behind them pillowed themselves against the luggage and prepared with many halfsuppressed moans again to encounter the piercing blast which swept across the open country  they were little more than a stage out of grantham or about halfway between it and newark when nicholas who had been asleep for a short time was suddenly roused by a violent jerk which nearly threw him from his seat grasping the rail he found that the coach had sunk greatly on one side though it was still dragged forward by the horses and whileconfused by their plunging and the loud screams of the lady insidehe hesitated for an instant whether to jump off or not the vehicle turned easily over and relieved him from all further uncertainty by flinging him into the road    chapter 6  in which the occurrence of the accident mentioned in the last chapter affords an opportunity to a couple of gentlemen to tell stories against each other   wo ho cried the guard on his legs in a minute and running to the leaders heads is there ony genelmen there as can len a hond here keep quiet dang ye wo ho  whats the matter demanded nicholas looking sleepily up  matther mun matter eneaf for one neight replied the guard dang the walleyed bay hes gane mad wi glory i think carse tcoorch is over here cant ye len a hond dom it id ha dean it if all my boans were brokken  here cried nicholas staggering to his feet im ready im only a little abroad thats all  hoold em toight cried the guard while ar coot treaces hang on tivem sumhoo well deane my lod thats it letem goa noo dang em theyll gang whoam fast eneaf  in truth the animals were no sooner released than they trotted back with much deliberation to the stable they had just left which was distant not a mile behind  can you blo a harn asked the guard disengaging one of the coachlamps  i dare say i can replied nicholas  then just blo away into that un as lies on the grund fit to wakken the deead willee said the man while i stop sum o this here squealing inside cumin cumin deant make that noise wooman  as the man spoke he proceeded to wrench open the uppermost door of the coach while nicholas seizing the horn awoke the echoes far and wide with one of the most extraordinary performances on that instrument ever heard by mortal ears it had its effect however not only in rousing such of their fall but in summoning assistance to their relief for lights gleamed in the distance and people were already astir  in fact a man on horseback galloped down before the passengers were well collected together and a careful investigation being instituted it appeared that the lady inside had broken her lamp and the gentleman his head that the two front outsides had escaped with black eyes the box with a bloody nose the coachman with a contusion on the temple mr squeers with a portmanteau bruise on his back and the remaining passengers without any injury at allthanks to the softness of the snowdrift in which they had been overturned these facts were no sooner thoroughly ascertained than the lady gave several indications of fainting but being forewarned that if she did she must be carried on some gentlemans shoulders to the nearest publichouse she prudently thought better of it and walked back with the rest  they found on reaching it that it was a lonely place with no very great accommodation in the way of apartmentsthat portion of its resources being all comprised in one public room with a sanded floor and a chair or two however a large faggot and a plentiful supply of coals being heaped upon the fire the appearance of things was not long in mending and by the time they had washed off all effaceable marks of the late accident the room was warm and light which was a most agreeable exchange for the cold and darkness out of doors  well mr nickleby said squeers insinuating himself into the warmest corner you did very right to catch hold of them horses i should have done it myself if i had come to in time but i am very glad you did it you did it very well very well  so well said the merryfaced gentleman who did not seem to approve very much of the patronising tone adopted by squeers that if they had not been firmly checked when they were you would most probably have had no brains left to teach with  this remark called up a discourse relative to the promptitude nicholas had displayed and he was overwhelmed with compliments and commendations  i am very glad to have escaped of course observed squeers every man is glad when he escapes from danger but if any one of my charges had been hurtif i had been prevented from restoring any one of these little boys to his parents whole and sound as i received himwhat would have been my feelings why the wheel atop of my head would have been far preferable to it  are they all brothers sir inquired the lady who had carried the davy or safetylamp  in one sense they are maam replied squeers diving into his greatcoat pocket for cards they are all under the same parental and affectionate treatment mrs squeers and myself are a mother and father to every one of em mr nickleby hand the lady them cards and offer these to the gentleman perhaps they might know of some parents that would be glad to avail themselves of the establishment  expressing himself to this effect mr squeers who lost no opportunity of advertising gratuitously placed his hands upon his knees and looked at the pupils with as much benignity as he could possibly affect while nicholas blushing with shame handed round the cards as directed  i hope you suffer no inconvenience from the overturn maam said the merryfaced gentleman addressing the fastidious lady as though he were charitably desirous to change the subject  no bodily inconvenience replied the lady  no mental inconvenience i hope  the subject is a very painful one to my feelings sir replied the lady with strong emotion and i beg you as a gentleman not to refer to it  dear me said the merryfaced gentleman looking merrier still i merely intended to inquire  i hope no inquiries will be made said the lady or i shall be compelled to throw myself on the protection of the other gentlemen landlord pray direct a boy to keep watch outside the doorand if a green chariot passes in the direction of grantham to stop it instantly  the people of the house were evidently overcome by this request and when the lady charged the boy to remember as a means of identifying the expected green chariot that it would have a coachman with a goldlaced hat on the box and a footman most probably in silk stockings behind the attentions of the good woman of the inn were redoubled even the boxpassenger caught the infection and growing wonderfully deferential immediately inquired whether there was not very good society in that neighbourhood to which the lady replied yes there was in a manner which sufficiently implied that she moved at the very tiptop and summit of it all  as the guard has gone on horseback to grantham to get another coach said the goodtempered gentleman when they had been all sitting round the fire for some time in silence and as he must be gone a couple of hours at the very least i propose a bowl of hot punch what say you sir  this question was addressed to the brokenheaded inside who was a man of very genteel appearance dressed in mourning he was not past the middle age but his hair was grey it seemed to have been prematurely turned by care or sorrow he readily acceded to the proposal and appeared to be prepossessed by the frank goodnature of the individual from whom it emanated  this latter personage took upon himself the office of tapster when the punch was ready and after dispensing it all round led the conversation to the antiquities of york with which both he and the greyhaired gentleman appeared to be well acquainted when this topic flagged he turned with a smile to the greyheaded gentleman and asked if he could sing  i cannot indeed replied gentleman smiling in his turn  thats a pity said the owner of the goodhumoured countenance is there nobody here who can sing a song to lighten the time  the passengers one and all protested that they could not that they wished they could that they couldnt remember the words of anything without the book and so forth  perhaps the lady would not object said the president with great respect and a merry twinkle in his eye some little italian thing out of the last opera brought out in town would be most acceptable i am sure  as the lady condescended to make no reply but tossed her head contemptuously and murmured some further expression of surprise regarding the absence of the green chariot one or two voices urged upon the president himself the propriety of making an attempt for the general benefit  i would if i could said he of the goodtempered face for i hold that in this as in all other cases where people who are strangers to each other are thrown unexpectedly together they should endeavour to render themselves as pleasant for the joint sake of the little community as possible  i wish the maxim were more generally acted on in all cases said the greyheaded gentleman  im glad to hear it returned the other perhaps as you cant sing youll tell us a story  nay i should ask you  after you i will with pleasure  indeed said the greyhaired gentleman smiling well let it be so i fear the turn of my thoughts is not calculated to lighten the time you must pass here but you have brought this upon yourselves and shall judge we were speaking of york minster just now my story shall have some reference to it let us call it   the five sisters of york   after a murmur of approbation from the other passengers during which the fastidious lady drank a glass of punch unobserved the greyheaded gentleman thus went on  a great many years agofor the fifteenth century was scarce two years old at the time and king henry the fourth sat upon the throne of englandthere dwelt in the ancient city of york five maiden sisters the subjects of my tale  these five sisters were all of surpassing beauty the eldest was in her twentythird year the second a year younger the third a year younger than the second and the fourth a year younger than the third they were tall stately figures with dark flashing eyes and hair of jet dignity and grace were in their every movement and the fame of their great beauty had spread through all the country round  but if the four elder sisters were lovely how beautiful was the youngest a fair creature of sixteen the blushing tints in the soft bloom on the fruit or the delicate painting on the flower are not more exquisite than was the blending of the rose and lily in her gentle face or the deep blue of her eye the vine in all its elegant luxuriance is not more graceful than were the clusters of rich brown hair that sported round her brow  if we all had hearts like those which beat so lightly in the bosoms of the young and beautiful what a heaven this earth would be if while our bodies grow old and withered our hearts could but retain their early youth and freshness of what avail would be our sorrows and sufferings but the faint image of eden which is stamped upon them in childhood chafes and rubs in our rough struggles with the world and soon wears away too often to leave nothing but a mournful blank remaining  the heart of this fair girl bounded with joy and gladness devoted attachment to her sisters and a fervent love of all beautiful things in nature were its pure affections her gleesome voice and merry laugh were the sweetest music of their home she was its very light and life the brightest flowers in the garden were reared by her the caged birds sang when they heard her voice and pined when they missed its sweetness alice dear alice what living thing within the sphere of her gentle witchery could fail to love her  you may seek in vain now for the spot on which these sisters lived for their very names have passed away and dusty antiquaries tell of them as of a fable but they dwelt in an old wooden houseold even in those dayswith overhanging gables and balconies of rudelycarved oak which stood within a pleasant orchard and was surrounded by a rough stone wall whence a stout archer might have winged an arrow to st marys abbey the old abbey flourished then and the five sisters living on its fair domains paid yearly dues to the black monks of st benedict to which fraternity it belonged  it was a bright and sunny morning in the pleasant time of summer when one of those black monks emerged from the abbey portal and bent his steps towards the house of the fair sisters heaven above was blue and earth beneath was green the river glistened like a path of diamonds in the sun the birds poured forth their songs from the shady trees the lark soared high above the waving corn and the deep buzz of insects filled the air everything looked gay and smiling but the holy man walked gloomily on with his eyes bent upon the ground the beauty of the earth is but a breath and man is but a shadow what sympathy should a holy preacher have with either  with eyes bent upon the ground then or only raised enough to prevent his stumbling over such obstacles as lay in his way the religious man moved slowly forward until he reached a small postern in the wall of the sisters orchard through which he passed closing it behind him the noise of soft voices in conversation and of merry laughter fell upon his ears ere he had advanced many paces and raising his eyes higher than was his humble wont he descried at no great distance the five sisters seated on the grass with alice in the centre all busily plying their customary task of embroidering  save you fair daughters said the friar and fair in truth they were even a monk might have loved them as choice masterpieces of his makers hand  the sisters saluted the holy man with becoming reverence and the eldest motioned him to a mossy seat beside them but the good friar shook his head and bumped himself down on a very hard stoneat which no doubt approving angels were gratified  ye were merry daughters said the monk  you know how light of heart sweet alice is replied the eldest sister passing her fingers through the tresses of the smiling girl  and what joy and cheerfulness it wakes up within us to see all nature beaming in brightness and sunshine father added alice blushing beneath the stern look of the recluse  the monk answered not save by a grave inclination of the head and the sisters pursued their task in silence  still wasting the precious hours said the monk at length turning to the eldest sister as he spoke still wasting the precious hours on this vain trifling alas alas that the few bubbles on the surface of eternityall that heaven wills we should see of that dark deep streamshould be so lightly scattered  father urged the maiden pausing as did each of the others in her busy task we have prayed at matins our daily alms have been distributed at the gate the sick peasants have been tendedall our morning tasks have been performed i hope our occupation is a blameless one  see here said the friar taking the frame from her hand an intricate winding of gaudy colours without purpose or object unless it be that one day it is destined for some vain ornament to minister to the pride of your frail and giddy sex day after day has been employed upon this senseless task and yet it is not half accomplished the shade of each departed day falls upon our graves and the worm exults as he beholds it to know that we are hastening thither daughters is there no better way to pass the fleeting hours  the four elder sisters cast down their eyes as if abashed by the holy mans reproof but alice raised hers and bent them mildly on the friar  our dear mother said the maiden heaven rest her soul  amen cried the friar in a deep voice  our dear mother faltered the fair alice was living when these long tasks began and bade us when she should be no more ply them in all discretion and cheerfulness in our leisure hours she said that if in harmless mirth and maidenly pursuits we passed those hours together they would prove the happiest and most peaceful of our lives and that if in later times we went forth into the world and mingled with its cares and trialsif allured by its temptations and dazzled by its glitter we ever forgot that love and duty which should bind in holy ties the children of one loved parenta glance at the old work of our common girlhood would awaken good thoughts of bygone days and soften our hearts to affection and love  alice speaks truly father said the elder sister somewhat proudly and so saying she resumed her work as did the others  it was a kind of sampler of large size that each sister had before her the device was of a complex and intricate description and the pattern and colours of all five were the same the sisters bent gracefully over their work the monk resting his chin upon his hands looked from one to the other in silence  how much better he said at length to shun all such thoughts and chances and in the peaceful shelter of the church devote your lives to heaven infancy childhood the prime of life and old age wither as rapidly as they crowd upon each other think how human dust rolls onward to the tomb and turning your faces steadily towards that goal avoid the cloud which takes its rise among the pleasures of the world and cheats the senses of their votaries the veil daughters the veil  never sisters cried alice barter not the light and air of heaven and the freshness of earth and all the beautiful things which breathe upon it for the cold cloister and the cell natures own blessings are the proper goods of life and we may share them sinlessly together to die is our heavy portion but oh let us die with life about us when our cold hearts cease to beat let warm hearts be beating near let our last look be upon the bounds which god has set to his own bright skies and not on stone walls and bars of iron dear sisters let us live and die if you list in this green gardens compass only shun the gloom and sadness of a cloister and we shall be happy  the tears fell fast from the maidens eyes as she closed her impassioned appeal and hid her face in the bosom of her sister  take comfort alice said the eldest kissing her fair forehead the veil shall never cast its shadow on thy young brow how say you sisters for yourselves you speak and not for alice or for me  the sisters as with one accord cried that their lot was cast together and that there were dwellings for peace and virtue beyond the convents walls  father said the eldest lady rising with dignity you hear our final resolve the same pious care which enriched the abbey of st mary and left us orphans to its holy guardianship directed that no constraint should be imposed upon our inclinations but that we should be free to live according to our choice let us hear no more of this we pray you sisters it is nearly noon let us take shelter until evening with a reverence to the friar the lady rose and walked towards the house hand in hand with alice the other sisters followed  the holy man who had often urged the same point before but had never met with so direct a repulse walked some little distance behind with his eyes bent upon the earth and his lips moving as if in prayer as the sisters reached the porch he quickened his pace and called upon them to stop  stay said the monk raising his right hand in the air and directing an angry glance by turns at alice and the eldest sister stay and hear from me what these recollections are which you would cherish above eternity and awakenif in mercy they slumberedby means of idle toys the memory of earthly things is charged in after life with bitter disappointment affliction death with dreary change and wasting sorrow the time will one day come when a glance at those unmeaning baubles will tear open deep wounds in the hearts of some among you and strike to your inmost souls when that hour arrivesand mark me come it willturn from the world to which you clung to the refuge which you spurned find me the cell which shall be colder than the fire of mortals grows when dimmed by calamity and trial and there weep for the dreams of youth these things are heavens will not mine said the friar subduing his voice as he looked round upon the shrinking girls the virgins blessing be upon you daughters  with these words he disappeared through the postern and the sisters hastening into the house were seen no more that day  but nature will smile though priests may frown and next day the sun shone brightly and on the next and the next again and in the mornings glare and the evenings soft repose the five sisters still walked or worked or beguiled the time by cheerful conversation in their quiet orchard  time passed away as a tale that is told faster indeed than many tales that are told of which number i fear this may be one the house of the five sisters stood where it did and the same trees cast their pleasant shade upon the orchard grass the sisters too were there and lovely as at first but a change had come over their dwelling sometimes there was the clash of armour and the gleaming of the moon on caps of steel and at others jaded coursers were spurred up to the gate and a female form glided hurriedly forth as if eager to demand tidings of the weary messenger a goodly train of knights and ladies lodged one night within the abbey walls and next day rode away with two of the fair sisters among them then horsemen began to come less frequently and seemed to bring bad tidings when they did and at length they ceased to come at all and footsore peasants slunk to the gate after sunset and did their errand there by stealth once a vassal was dispatched in haste to the abbey at dead of night and when morning came there were sounds of woe and wailing in the sisters house and after this a mournful silence fell upon it and knight or lady horse or armour was seen about it no more  there was a sullen darkness in the sky and the sun had gone angrily down tinting the dull clouds with the last traces of his wrath when the same black monk walked slowly on with folded arms within a stonesthrow of the abbey a blight had fallen on the trees and shrubs and the wind at length beginning to break the unnatural stillness that had prevailed all day sighed heavily from time to time as though foretelling in grief the ravages of the coming storm the bat skimmed in fantastic flights through the heavy air and the ground was alive with crawling things whose instinct brought them forth to swell and fatten in the rain  no longer were the friars eyes directed to the earth they were cast abroad and roamed from point to point as if the gloom and desolation of the scene found a quick response in his own bosom again he paused near the sisters house and again he entered by the postern  but not again did his ear encounter the sound of laughter or his eyes rest upon the beautiful figures of the five sisters all was silent and deserted the boughs of the trees were bent and broken and the grass had grown long and rank no light feet had pressed it for many many a day  with the indifference or abstraction of one well accustomed to the change the monk glided into the house and entered a low dark room four sisters sat there their black garments made their pale faces whiter still and time and sorrow had worked deep ravages they were stately yet but the flush and pride of beauty were gone  and alicewhere was she in heaven  the monkeven the monkcould bear with some grief here for it was long since these sisters had met and there were furrows in their blanched faces which years could never plough he took his seat in silence and motioned them to continue their speech  they are here sisters said the elder lady in a trembling voice i have never borne to look upon them since and now i blame myself for my weakness what is there in her memory that we should dread to call up our old days shall be a solemn pleasure yet  she glanced at the monk as she spoke and opening a cabinet brought forth the five frames of work completed long before her step was firm but her hand trembled as she produced the last one and when the feelings of the other sisters gushed forth at sight of it her pentup tears made way and she sobbed god bless her  the monk rose and advanced towards them it was almost the last thing she touched in health he said in a low voice  it was cried the elder lady weeping bitterly  the monk turned to the second sister  the gallant youth who looked into thine eyes and hung upon thy very breath when first he saw thee intent upon this pastime lies buried on a plain whereof the turf is red with blood rusty fragments of armour once brightly burnished lie rotting on the ground and are as little distinguishable for his as are the bones that crumble in the mould  the lady groaned and wrung her hands  the policy of courts he continued turning to the two other sisters drew ye from your peaceful home to scenes of revelry and splendour the same policy and the restless ambition ofproud and fiery men have sent ye back widowed maidens and humbled outcasts do i speak truly  the sobs of the two sisters were their only reply  there is little need said the monk with a meaning look to fritter away the time in gewgaws which shall raise up the pale ghosts of hopes of early years bury them heap penance and mortification on their heads keep them down and let the convent be their grave  the sisters asked for three days to deliberate and felt that night as though the veil were indeed the fitting shroud for their dead joys but morning came again and though the boughs of the orchard trees drooped and ran wild upon the ground it was the same orchard still the grass was coarse and high but there was yet the spot on which they had so often sat together when change and sorrow were but names there was every walk and nook which alice had made glad and in the minster nave was one flat stone beneath which she slept in peace  and could they remembering how her young heart had sickened at the thought of cloistered walls look upon her grave in garbs which would chill the very ashes within it could they bow down in prayer and when all heaven turned to hear them bring the dark shade of sadness on one angels face no  they sent abroad to artists of great celebrity in those times and having obtained the churchs sanction to their work of piety caused to be executed in five large compartments of richly stained glass a faithful copy of their old embroidery work these were fitted into a large window until that time bare of ornament and when the sun shone brightly as she had so well loved to see it the familiar patterns were reflected in their original colours and throwing a stream of brilliant light upon the pavement fell warmly on the name of alice  for many hours in every day the sisters paced slowly up and down the nave or knelt by the side of the flat broad stone only three were seen in the customary place after many years then but two and for a long time afterwards but one solitary female bent with age at length she came no more and the stone bore five plain christian names  that stone has worn away and been replaced by others and many generations have come and gone since then time has softened down the colours but the same stream of light still falls upon the forgotten tomb of which no trace remains and to this day the stranger is shown in york cathedral an old window called the five sisters   thats a melancholy tale said the merryfaced gentleman emptying his glass  it is a tale of life and life is made up of such sorrows returned the other courteously but in a grave and sad tone of voice  there are shades in all good pictures but there are lights too if we choose to contemplate them said the gentleman with the merry face the youngest sister in your tale was always lighthearted  and died early said the other gently  she would have died earlier perhaps had she been less happy said the first speaker with much feeling do you think the sisters who loved her so well would have grieved the less if her life had been one of gloom and sadness if anything could soothe the first sharp pain of a heavy loss it would bewith methe reflection that those i mourned by being innocently happy here and loving all about them had prepared themselves for a purer and happier world the sun does not shine upon this fair earth to meet frowning eyes depend upon it  i believe you are right said the gentleman who had told the story  believe retorted the other can anybody doubt it take any subject of sorrowful regret and see with how much pleasure it is associated the recollection of past pleasure may become pain  it does interposed the other  well it does to remember happiness which cannot be restored is pain but of a softened kind our recollections are unfortunately mingled with much that we deplore and with many actions which we bitterly repent still in the most chequered life i firmly think there are so many little rays of sunshine to look back upon that i do not believe any mortal unless he had put himself without the pale of hope would deliberately drain a goblet of the waters of lethe if he had it in his power  possibly you are correct in that belief said the greyhaired gentleman after a short reflection i am inclined to think you are  why then replied the other the good in this state of existence preponderates over the bad let miscalled philosophers tell us what they will if our affections be tried our affections are our consolation and comfort and memory however sad is the best and purest link between this world and a better but come ill tell you a story of another kind  after a very brief silence the merryfaced gentleman sent round the punch and glancing slyly at the fastidious lady who seemed desperately apprehensive that he was going to relate something improper began   the baron of grogzwig   the baron von koeldwethout of grogzwig in germany was as likely a young baron as you would wish to see i neednt say that he lived in a castle because thats of course neither need i say that he lived in an old castle for what german baron ever lived in a new one there were many strange circumstances connected with this venerable building among which not the least startling and mysterious were that when the wind blew it rumbled in the chimneys or even howled among the trees in the neighbouring forest and that when the moon shone she found her way through certain small loopholes in the wall and actually made some parts of the wide halls and galleries quite light while she left others in gloomy shadow i believe that one of the barons ancestors being short of money had inserted a dagger in a gentleman who called one night to ask his way and it was supposed that these miraculous occurrences took place in consequence and yet i hardly know how that could have been either because the barons ancestor who was an amiable man felt very sorry afterwards for having been so rash and laying violent hands upon a quantity of stone and timber which belonged to a weaker baron built a chapel as an apology and so took a receipt from heaven in full of all demands  talking of the barons ancestor puts me in mind of the barons great claims to respect on the score of his pedigree i am afraid to say i am sure how many ancestors the baron had but i know that he had a great many more than any other man of his time and i only wish that he had lived in these latter days that he might have had more it is a very hard thing upon the great men of past centuries that they should have come into the world so soon because a man who was born three or four hundred years ago cannot reasonably be expected to have had as many relations before him as a man who is born now the last man whoever he isand he may be a cobbler or some low vulgar dog for aught we knowwill have a longer pedigree than the greatest nobleman now alive and i contend that this is not fair  well but the baron von koeldwethout of grogzwig he was a fine swarthy fellow with dark hair and large moustachios who rode ahunting in clothes of lincoln green with russet boots on his feet and a bugle slung over his shoulder like the guard of a long stage when he blew this bugle fourandtwenty other gentlemen of inferior rank in lincoln green a little coarser and russet boots with a little thicker soles turned out directly and away galloped the whole train with spears in their hands like lacquered area railings to hunt down the boars or perhaps encounter a bear in which latter case the baron killed him first and greased his whiskers with him afterwards  this was a merry life for the baron of grogzwig and a merrier still for the barons retainers who drank rhine wine every night till they fell under the table and then had the bottles on the floor and called for pipes never were such jolly roystering rollicking merrymaking blades as the jovial crew of grogzwig  but the pleasures of the table or the pleasures of under the table require a little variety especially when the same fiveandtwenty people sit daily down to the same board to discuss the same subjects and tell the same stories the baron grew weary and wanted excitement he took to quarrelling with his gentlemen and tried kicking two or three of them every day after dinner this was a pleasant change at first but it became monotonous after a week or so and the baron felt quite out of sorts and cast about in despair for some new amusement  one night after a days sport in which he had outdone nimrod or gillingwater and slaughtered another fine bear and brought him home in triumph the baron von koeldwethout sat moodily at the head of his table eyeing the smoky roof of the hall with a discontented aspect he swallowed huge bumpers of wine but the more he swallowed the more he frowned the gentlemen who had been honoured with the dangerous distinction of sitting on his right and left imitated him to a miracle in the drinking and frowned at each other  i will cried the baron suddenly smiting the table with his right hand and twirling his moustache with his left fill to the lady of grogzwig  the fourandtwenty lincoln greens turned pale with the exception of their fourandtwenty noses which were unchangeable  i said to the lady of grogzwig repeated the baron looking round the board  to the lady of grogzwig shouted the lincoln greens and down their fourandtwenty throats went fourandtwenty imperial pints of such rare old hock that they smacked their eightandforty lips and winked again  the fair daughter of the baron von swillenhausen said koeldwethout condescending to explain we will demand her in marriage of her father ere the sun goes down tomorrow if he refuse our suit we will cut off his nose  a hoarse murmur arose from the company every man touched first the hilt of his sword and then the tip of his nose with appalling significance  what a pleasant thing filial piety is to contemplate if the daughter of the baron von swillenhausen had pleaded a preoccupied heart or fallen at her fathers feet and corned them in salt tears or only fainted away and complimented the old gentleman in frantic ejaculations the odds are a hundred to one but swillenhausen castle would have been turned out at window or rather the baron turned out at window and the castle demolished the damsel held her peace however when an early messenger bore the request of von koeldwethout next morning and modestly retired to her chamber from the casement of which she watched the coming of the suitor and his retinue she was no sooner assured that the horseman with the large moustachios was her proffered husband than she hastened to her fathers presence and expressed her readiness to sacrifice herself to secure his peace the venerable baron caught his child to his arms and shed a wink of joy  there was great feasting at the castle that day the fourandtwenty lincoln greens of von koeldwethout exchanged vows of eternal friendship with twelve lincoln greens of von swillenhausen and promised the old baron that they would drink his wine till all was bluemeaning probably until their whole countenances had acquired the same tint as their noses everybody slapped everybody elses back when the time for parting came and the baron von koeldwethout and his followers rode gaily home  for six mortal weeks the bears and boars had a holiday the houses of koeldwethout and swillenhausen were united the spears rusted and the barons bugle grew hoarse for lack of blowing  those were great times for the fourandtwenty but alas their high and palmy days had taken boots to themselves and were already walking off  my dear said the baroness  my love said the baron  those coarse noisy men  which maam said the baron starting  the baroness pointed from the window at which they stood to the courtyard beneath where the unconscious lincoln greens were taking a copious stirrupcup preparatory to issuing forth after a boar or two  my hunting train maam said the baron  disband them love murmured the baroness  disband them cried the baron in amazement  to please me love replied the baroness  to please the devil maam answered the baron  whereupon the baroness uttered a great cry and swooned away at the barons feet  what could the baron do he called for the ladys maid and roared for the doctor and then rushing into the yard kicked the two lincoln greens who were the most used to it and cursing the others all round bade them gobut never mind where i dont know the german for it or i would put it delicately that way  it is not for me to say by what means or by what degrees some wives manage to keep down some husbands as they do although i may have my private opinion on the subject and may think that no member of parliament ought to be married inasmuch as three married members out of every four must vote according to their wives consciences if there be such things and not according to their own all i need say just now is that the baroness von koeldwethout somehow or other acquired great control over the baron von koeldwethout and that little by little and bit by bit and day by day and year by year the baron got the worst of some disputed question or was slyly unhorsed from some old hobby and that by the time he was a fat hearty fellow of fortyeight or thereabouts he had no feasting no revelry no hunting train and no huntingnothing in short that he liked or used to have and that although he was as fierce as a lion and as bold as brass he was decidedly snubbed and put down by his own lady in his own castle of grogzwig  nor was this the whole extent of the barons misfortunes about a year after his nuptials there came into the world a lusty young baron in whose honour a great many fireworks were let off and a great many dozens of wine drunk but next year there came a young baroness and next year another young baron and so on every year either a baron or baroness and one year both together until the baron found himself the father of a small family of twelve upon every one of these anniversaries the venerable baroness von swillenhausen was nervously sensitive for the wellbeing of her child the baroness von koeldwethout and although it was not found that the good lady ever did anything material towards contributing to her childs recovery still she made it a point of duty to be as nervous as possible at the castle of grogzwig and to divide her time between moral observations on the barons housekeeping and bewailing the hard lot of her unhappy daughter and if the baron of grogzwig a little hurt and irritated at this took heart and ventured to suggest that his wife was at least no worse off than the wives of other barons the baroness von swillenhausen begged all persons to take notice that nobody but she sympathised with her dear daughters sufferings upon which her relations and friends remarked that to be sure she did cry a great deal more than her soninlaw and that if there were a hardhearted brute alive it was that baron of grogzwig  the poor baron bore it all as long as he could and when he could bear it no longer lost his appetite and his spirits and sat himself gloomily and dejectedly down but there were worse troubles yet in store for him and as they came on his melancholy and sadness increased times changed he got into debt the grogzwig coffers ran low though the swillenhausen family had looked upon them as inexhaustible and just when the baroness was on the point of making a thirteenth addition to the family pedigree von koeldwethout discovered that he had no means of replenishing them  i dont see what is to be done said the baron i think ill kill myself  this was a bright idea the baron took an old huntingknife from a cupboard hard by and having sharpened it on his boot made what boys call an offer at his throat  hem said the baron stopping short perhaps its not sharp enough  the baron sharpened it again and made another offer when his hand was arrested by a loud screaming among the young barons and baronesses who had a nursery in an upstairs tower with iron bars outside the window to prevent their tumbling out into the moat  if i had been a bachelor said the baron sighing i might have done it fifty times over without being interrupted hallo put a flask of wine and the largest pipe in the little vaulted room behind the hall  one of the domestics in a very kind manner executed the barons order in the course of half an hour or so and von koeldwethout being apprised thereof strode to the vaulted room the walls of which being of dark shining wood gleamed in the light of the blazing logs which were piled upon the hearth the bottle and pipe were ready and upon the whole the place looked very comfortable  leave the lamp said the baron  anything else my lord inquired the domestic  the room replied the baron the domestic obeyed and the baron locked the door  ill smoke a last pipe said the baron and then ill be off so putting the knife upon the table till he wanted it and tossing off a goodly measure of wine the lord of grogzwig threw himself back in his chair stretched his legs out before the fire and puffed away  he thought about a great many thingsabout his present troubles and past days of bachelorship and about the lincoln greens long since dispersed up and down the country no one knew whither with the exception of two who had been unfortunately beheaded and four who had killed themselves with drinking his mind was running upon bears and boars when in the process of draining his glass to the bottom he raised his eyes and saw for the first time and with unbounded astonishment that he was not alone  no he was not for on the opposite side of the fire there sat with folded arms a wrinkled hideous figure with deeply sunk and bloodshot eyes and an immensely long cadaverous face shadowed by jagged and matted locks of coarse black hair he wore a kind of tunic of a dull bluish colour which the baron observed on regarding it attentively was clasped or ornamented down the front with coffin handles his legs too were encased in coffin plates as though in armour and over his left shoulder he wore a short dusky cloak which seemed made of a remnant of some pall he took no notice of the baron but was intently eyeing the fire  halloa said the baron stamping his foot to attract attention  halloa replied the stranger moving his eyes towards the baron but not his face or himself what now  what now replied the baron nothing daunted by his hollow voice and lustreless eyes i should ask that question how did you get here  through the door replied the figure  what are you says the baron  a man replied the figure  i dont believe it says the baron  disbelieve it then says the figure  i will rejoined the baron  the figure looked at the bold baron of grogzwig for some time and then said familiarly  theres no coming over you i see im not a man  what are you then asked the baron  a genius replied the figure  you dont look much like one returned the baron scornfully  i am the genius of despair and suicide said the apparition now you know me  with these words the apparition turned towards the baron as if composing himself for a talkand what was very remarkable was that he threw his cloak aside and displaying a stake which was run through the centre of his body pulled it out with a jerk and laid it on the table as composedly as if it had been a walkingstick  now said the figure glancing at the huntingknife are you ready for me  not quite rejoined the baron i must finish this pipe first  look sharp then said the figure  you seem in a hurry said the baron  why yes i am answered the figure theyre doing a pretty brisk business in my way over in england and france just now and my time is a good deal taken up  do you drink said the baron touching the bottle with the bowl of his pipe  nine times out of ten and then very hard rejoined the figure drily  never in moderation asked the baron  never replied the figure with a shudder that breeds cheerfulness  the baron took another look at his new friend whom he thought an uncommonly queer customer and at length inquired whether he took any active part in such little proceedings as that which he had in contemplation  no replied the figure evasively but i am always present  just to see fair i suppose said the baron  just that replied the figure playing with his stake and examining the ferule be as quick as you can will you for theres a young gentleman who is afflicted with too much money and leisure wanting me now i find  going to kill himself because he has too much money exclaimed the baron quite tickled ha ha thats a good one this was the first time the baron had laughed for many a long day  i say expostulated the figure looking very much scared dont do that again  why not demanded the baron  because it gives me pain all over replied the figure sigh as much as you please that does me good  the baron sighed mechanically at the mention of the word the figure brightening up again handed him the huntingknife with most winning politeness  its not a bad idea though said the baron feeling the edge of the weapon a man killing himself because he has too much money  pooh said the apparition petulantly no better than a mans killing himself because he has none or little  whether the genius unintentionally committed himself in saying this or whether he thought the barons mind was so thoroughly made up that it didnt matter what he said i have no means of knowing i only know that the baron stopped his hand all of a sudden opened his eyes wide and looked as if quite a new light had come upon him for the first time  why certainly said von koeldwethout nothing is too bad to be retrieved  except empty coffers cried the genius  well but they may be one day filled again said the baron  scolding wives snarled the genius  oh they may be made quiet said the baron  thirteen children shouted the genius  cant all go wrong surely said the baron  the genius was evidently growing very savage with the baron for holding these opinions all at once but he tried to laugh it off and said if he would let him know when he had left off joking he should feel obliged to him  but i am not joking i was never farther from it remonstrated the baron  well i am glad to hear that said the genius looking very grim because a joke without any figure of speech is the death of me come quit this dreary world at once  i dont know said the baron playing with the knife its a dreary one certainly but i dont think yours is much better for you have not the appearance of being particularly comfortable that puts me in mindwhat security have i that i shall be any the better for going out of the world after all he cried starting up i never thought of that  dispatch cried the figure gnashing his teeth  keep off said the baron ill brood over miseries no longer but put a good face on the matter and try the fresh air and the bears again and if that dont do ill talk to the baroness soundly and cut the von swillenhausens dead with this the baron fell into his chair and laughed so loud and boisterously that the room rang with it  the figure fell back a pace or two regarding the baron meanwhile with a look of intense terror and when he had ceased caught up the stake plunged it violently into its body uttered a frightful howl and disappeared  von koeldwethout never saw it again having once made up his mind to action he soon brought the baroness and the von swillenhausens to reason and died many years afterwards not a rich man that i am aware of but certainly a happy one leaving behind him a numerous family who had been carefully educated in bear and boarhunting under his own personal eye and my advice to all men is that if ever they become hipped and melancholy from similar causes as very many men do they look at both sides of the question applying a magnifyingglass to the best one and if they still feel tempted to retire without leave that they smoke a large pipe and drink a full bottle first and profit by the laudable example of the baron of grogzwig   the fresh coach is ready ladies and gentlemen if you please said a new driver looking in  this intelligence caused the punch to be finished in a great hurry and prevented any discussion relative to the last story mr squeers was observed to draw the greyheaded gentleman on one side and to ask a question with great apparent interest it bore reference to the five sisters of york and was in fact an inquiry whether he could inform him how much per annum the yorkshire convents got in those days with their boarders  the journey was then resumed nicholas fell asleep towards morning and when he awoke found with great regret that during his nap both the baron of grogzwig and the greyhaired gentleman had got down and were gone the day dragged on uncomfortably enough at about six oclock that night he and mr squeers and the little boys and their united luggage were all put down together at the george and new inn greta bridge    chapter 7  mr and mrs squeers at home   mr squeers being safely landed left nicholas and the boys standing with the luggage in the road to amuse themselves by looking at the coach as it changed horses while he ran into the tavern and went through the legstretching process at the bar after some minutes he returned with his legs thoroughly stretched if the hue of his nose and a short hiccup afforded any criterion and at the same time there came out of the yard a rusty ponychaise and a cart driven by two labouring men  put the boys and the boxes into the cart said squeers rubbing his hands and this young man and me will go on in the chaise get in nickleby  nicholas obeyed mr squeers with some difficulty inducing the pony to obey also they started off leaving the cartload of infant misery to follow at leisure  are you cold nickleby inquired squeers after they had travelled some distance in silence  rather sir i must say  well i dont find fault with that said squeers its a long journey this weather  is it much farther to dotheboys hall sir asked nicholas  about three mile from here replied squeers but you neednt call it a hall down here  nicholas coughed as if he would like to know why  the fact is it aint a hall observed squeers drily  oh indeed said nicholas whom this piece of intelligence much astonished  no replied squeers we call it a hall up in london because it sounds better but they dont know it by that name in these parts a man may call his house an island if he likes theres no act of parliament against that i believe  i believe not sir rejoined nicholas  squeers eyed his companion slyly at the conclusion of this little dialogue and finding that he had grown thoughtful and appeared in nowise disposed to volunteer any observations contented himself with lashing the pony until they reached their journeys end  jump out said squeers hallo there come and put this horse up be quick will you  while the schoolmaster was uttering these and other impatient cries nicholas had time to observe that the school was a long coldlooking house one storey high with a few straggling outbuildings behind and a barn and stable adjoining after the lapse of a minute or two the noise of somebody unlocking the yardgate was heard and presently a tall lean boy with a lantern in his hand issued forth  is that you smike cried squeers  yes sir replied the boy  then why the devil didnt you come before  please sir i fell asleep over the fire answered smike with humility  fire what fire wheres there a fire demanded the schoolmaster sharply  only in the kitchen sir replied the boy missus said as i was sitting up i might go in there for a warm  your missus is a fool retorted squeers youd have been a deuced deal more wakeful in the cold ill engage  by this time mr squeers had dismounted and after ordering the boy to see to the pony and to take care that he hadnt any more corn that night he told nicholas to wait at the frontdoor a minute while he went round and let him in  a host of unpleasant misgivings which had been crowding upon nicholas during the whole journey thronged into his mind with redoubled force when he was left alone his great distance from home and the impossibility of reaching it except on foot should he feel ever so anxious to return presented itself to him in most alarming colours and as he looked up at the dreary house and dark windows and upon the wild country round covered with snow he felt a depression of heart and spirit which he had never experienced before  now then cried squeers poking his head out at the frontdoor where are you nickleby  here sir replied nicholas  come in then said squeers the wind blows in at this door fit to knock a man off his legs  nicholas sighed and hurried in mr squeers having bolted the door to keep it shut ushered him into a small parlour scantily furnished with a few chairs a yellow map hung against the wall and a couple of tables one of which bore some preparations for supper while on the other a tutors assistant a murrays grammar halfadozen cards of terms and a worn letter directed to wackford squeers esquire were arranged in picturesque confusion  they had not been in this apartment a couple of minutes when a female bounced into the room and seizing mr squeers by the throat gave him two loud kisses one close after the other like a postmans knock the lady who was of a large rawboned figure was about half a head taller than mr squeers and was dressed in a dimity nightjacket with her hair in papers she had also a dirty nightcap on relieved by a yellow cotton handkerchief which tied it under the chin  how is my squeery said this lady in a playful manner and a very hoarse voice  quite well my love replied squeers hows the cows  all right every one ofem answered the lady  and the pigs said squeers  as well as they were when you went away  come thats a blessing said squeers pulling off his greatcoat the boys are all as they were i suppose  oh yes theyre well enough replied mrs squeers snappishly that young pitchers had a fever  no exclaimed squeers damn that boy hes always at something of that sort  never was such a boy i do believe said mrs squeers whatever he has is always catching too i say its obstinacy and nothing shall ever convince me that it isnt id beat it out of him and i told you that six months ago  so you did my love rejoined squeers well try what can be done  pending these little endearments nicholas had stood awkwardly enough in the middle of the room not very well knowing whether he was expected to retire into the passage or to remain where he was he was now relieved from his perplexity by mr squeers  this is the new young man my dear said that gentleman  oh replied mrs squeers nodding her head at nicholas and eyeing him coldly from top to toe  hell take a meal with us tonight said squeers and go among the boys tomorrow morning you can give him a shakedown here tonight cant you  we must manage it somehow replied the lady you dont much mind how you sleep i suppose sir  no indeed replied nicholas i am not particular  thats lucky said mrs squeers and as the ladys humour was considered to lie chiefly in retort mr squeers laughed heartily and seemed to expect that nicholas should do the same  after some further conversation between the master and mistress relative to the success of mr squeerss trip and the people who had paid and the people who had made default in payment a young servant girl brought in a yorkshire pie and some cold beef which being set upon the table the boy smike appeared with a jug of ale  mr squeers was emptying his greatcoat pockets of letters to different boys and other small documents which he had brought down in them the boy glanced with an anxious and timid expression at the papers as if with a sickly hope that one among them might relate to him the look was a very painful one and went to nicholass heart at once for it told a long and very sad history  it induced him to consider the boy more attentively and he was surprised to observe the extraordinary mixture of garments which formed his dress although he could not have been less than eighteen or nineteen years old and was tall for that age he wore a skeleton suit such as is usually put upon very little boys and which though most absurdly short in the arms and legs was quite wide enough for his attenuated frame in order that the lower part of his legs might be in perfect keeping with this singular dress he had a very large pair of boots originally made for tops which might have been once worn by some stout farmer but were now too patched and tattered for a beggar heaven knows how long he had been there but he still wore the same linen which he had first taken down for round his neck was a tattered childs frill only half concealed by a coarse mans neckerchief he was lame and as he feigned to be busy in arranging the table glanced at the letters with a look so keen and yet so dispirited and hopeless that nicholas could hardly bear to watch him  what are you bothering about there smike cried mrs squeers let the things alone cant you  eh said squeers looking up oh its you is it  yes sir replied the youth pressing his hands together as though to control by force the nervous wandering of his fingers is there  well said squeers  have youdid anybodyhas nothing been heardabout me  devil a bit replied squeers testily  the lad withdrew his eyes and putting his hand to his face moved towards the door  not a word resumed squeers and never will be now this is a pretty sort of thing isnt it that you should have been left here all these years and no money paid after the first sixnor no notice taken nor no clue to be got who you belong to its a pretty sort of thing that i should have to feed a great fellow like you and never hope to get one penny for it isnt it  the boy put his hand to his head as if he were making an effort to recollect something and then looking vacantly at his questioner gradually broke into a smile and limped away  ill tell you what squeers remarked his wife as the door closed i think that young chaps turning silly  i hope not said the schoolmaster for hes a handy fellow out of doors and worth his meat and drink anyway i should think hed have wit enough for us though if he was but come lets have supper for i am hungry and tired and want to get to bed  this reminder brought in an exclusive steak for mr squeers who speedily proceeded to do it ample justice nicholas drew up his chair but his appetite was effectually taken away  hows the steak squeers said mrs s  tender as a lamb replied squeers have a bit  i couldnt eat a morsel replied his wife whatll the young man take my dear  whatever he likes thats present rejoined squeers in a most unusual burst of generosity  what do you say mr knuckleboy inquired mrs squeers  ill take a little of the pie if you please replied nicholas a very little for im not hungry  well its a pity to cut the pie if youre not hungry isnt it said mrs squeers will you try a bit of the beef  whatever you please replied nicholas abstractedly its all the same to me  mrs squeers looked vastly gracious on receiving this reply and nodding to squeers as much as to say that she was glad to find the young man knew his station assisted nicholas to a slice of meat with her own fair hands  ale squeery inquired the lady winking and frowning to give him to understand that the question propounded was whether nicholas should have ale and not whether he squeers would take any  certainly said squeers retelegraphing in the same manner a glassful  so nicholas had a glassful and being occupied with his own reflections drank it in happy innocence of all the foregone proceedings  uncommon juicy steak that said squeers as he laid down his knife and fork after plying it in silence for some time  its prime meat rejoined his lady i bought a good large piece of it myself on purpose for  for what exclaimed squeers hastily not for the  no no not for them rejoined mrs squeers on purpose for you against you came home lor you didnt think i could have made such a mistake as that  upon my word my dear i didnt know what you were going to say said squeers who had turned pale  you neednt make yourself uncomfortable remarked his wife laughing heartily to think that i should be such a noddy well  this part of the conversation was rather unintelligible but popular rumour in the neighbourhood asserted that mr squeers being amiably opposed to cruelty to animals not unfrequently purchased for boy consumption the bodies of horned cattle who had died a natural death possibly he was apprehensive of having unintentionally devoured some choice morsel intended for the young gentlemen  supper being over and removed by a small servant girl with a hungry eye mrs squeers retired to lock it up and also to take into safe custody the clothes of the five boys who had just arrived and who were halfway up the troublesome flight of steps which leads to deaths door in consequence of exposure to the cold they were then regaled with a light supper of porridge and stowed away side by side in a small bedstead to warm each other and dream of a substantial meal with something hot after it if their fancies set that way which it is not at all improbable they did  mr squeers treated himself to a stiff tumbler of brandy and water made on the liberal halfandhalf principle allowing for the dissolution of the sugar and his amiable helpmate mixed nicholas the ghost of a small glassful of the same compound this done mr and mrs squeers drew close up to the fire and sitting with their feet on the fender talked confidentially in whispers while nicholas taking up the tutors assistant read the interesting legends in the miscellaneous questions and all the figures into the bargain with as much thought or consciousness of what he was doing as if he had been in a magnetic slumber  at length mr squeers yawned fearfully and opined that it was high time to go to bed upon which signal mrs squeers and the girl dragged in a small straw mattress and a couple of blankets and arranged them into a couch for nicholas  well put you into your regular bedroom tomorrow nickelby said squeers let me see who sleeps in brookss bed my dear  in brookss said mrs squeers pondering theres jennings little bolder graymarsh and whats his name  so there is rejoined squeers yes brooks is full  full thought nicholas i should think he was  theres a place somewhere i know said squeers but i cant at this moment call to mind where it is however well have that all settled tomorrow goodnight nickleby seven oclock in the morning mind  i shall be ready sir replied nicholas goodnight  ill come in myself and show you where the well is said squeers youll always find a little bit of soap in the kitchen window that belongs to you  nicholas opened his eyes but not his mouth and squeers was again going away when he once more turned back  i dont know i am sure he said whose towel to put you on but if youll make shift with something tomorrow morning mrs squeers will arrange that in the course of the day my dear dont forget  ill take care replied mrs squeers and mind you take care young man and get first wash the teacher ought always to have it but they get the better of him if they can  mr squeers then nudged mrs squeers to bring away the brandy bottle lest nicholas should help himself in the night and the lady having seized it with great precipitation they retired together  nicholas being left alone took halfadozen turns up and down the room in a condition of much agitation and excitement but growing gradually calmer sat himself down in a chair and mentally resolved that come what come might he would endeavour for a time to bear whatever wretchedness might be in store for him and that remembering the helplessness of his mother and sister he would give his uncle no plea for deserting them in their need good resolutions seldom fail of producing some good effect in the mind from which they spring he grew less desponding andso sanguine and buoyant is youtheven hoped that affairs at dotheboys hall might yet prove better than they promised  he was preparing for bed with something like renewed cheerfulness when a sealed letter fell from his coat pocket in the hurry of leaving london it had escaped his attention and had not occurred to him since but it at once brought back to him the recollection of the mysterious behaviour of newman noggs  dear me said nicholas what an extraordinary hand  it was directed to himself was written upon very dirty paper and in such cramped and crippled writing as to be almost illegible after great difficulty and much puzzling he contrived to read as follows  my dear young man  i know the world your father did not or he would not have done me a kindness when there was no hope of return you do not or you would not be bound on such a journey  if ever you want a shelter in london dont be angry at this i once thought i never should they know where i live at the sign of the crown in silver street golden square it is at the corner of silver street and james street with a bar door both ways you can come at night once nobody was ashamednever mind that its all over  excuse errors i should forget how to wear a whole coat now i have forgotten all my old ways my spelling may have gone with them  newman noggs  ps if you should go near barnard castle there is good ale at the kings head say you know me and i am sure they will not charge you for it you may say mr noggs there for i was a gentleman then i was indeed   it may be a very undignified circumstances to record but after he had folded this letter and placed it in his pocketbook nicholas nicklebys eyes were dimmed with a moisture that might have been taken for tears    chapter 8  of the internal economy of dotheboys hall   a ride of two hundred and odd miles in severe weather is one of the best softeners of a hard bed that ingenuity can devise perhaps it is even a sweetener of dreams for those which hovered over the rough couch of nicholas and whispered their airy nothings in his ear were of an agreeable and happy kind he was making his fortune very fast indeed when the faint glimmer of an expiring candle shone before his eyes and a voice he had no difficulty in recognising as part and parcel of mr squeers admonished him that it was time to rise  past seven nickleby said mr squeers  has morning come already asked nicholas sitting up in bed  ah that has it replied squeers and ready iced too now nickleby come tumble up will you  nicholas needed no further admonition but tumbled up at once and proceeded to dress himself by the light of the taper which mr squeers carried in his hand  heres a pretty go said that gentleman the pumps froze  indeed said nicholas not much interested in the intelligence  yes replied squeers you cant wash yourself this morning  not wash myself exclaimed nicholas  no not a bit of it rejoined squeers tartly so you must be content with giving yourself a dry polish till we break the ice in the well and can get a bucketful out for the boys dont stand staring at me but do look sharp will you  offering no further observation nicholas huddled on his clothes squeers meanwhile opened the shutters and blew the candle out when the voice of his amiable consort was heard in the passage demanding admittance  come in my love said squeers  mrs squeers came in still habited in the primitive nightjacket which had displayed the symmetry of her figure on the previous night and further ornamented with a beaver bonnet of some antiquity which she wore with much ease and lightness on the top of the nightcap before mentioned  drat the things said the lady opening the cupboard i cant find the school spoon anywhere  never mind it my dear observed squeers in a soothing manner its of no consequence  no consequence why how you talk retorted mrs squeers sharply isnt it brimstone morning  i forgot my dear rejoined squeers yes it certainly is we purify the boys bloods now and then nickleby  purify fiddlesticks ends said his lady dont think young man that we go to the expense of flower of brimstone and molasses just to purify them because if you think we carry on the business in that way youll find yourself mistaken and so i tell you plainly  my dear said squeers frowning hem  oh nonsense rejoined mrs squeers if the young man comes to be a teacher here let him understand at once that we dont want any foolery about the boys they have the brimstone and treacle partly because if they hadnt something or other in the way of medicine theyd be always ailing and giving a world of trouble and partly because it spoils their appetites and comes cheaper than breakfast and dinner so it does them good and us good at the same time and thats fair enough im sure  having given this explanation mrs squeers put her head into the closet and instituted a stricter search after the spoon in which mr squeers assisted a few words passed between them while they were thus engaged but as their voices were partially stifled by the cupboard all that nicholas could distinguish was that mr squeers said what mrs squeers had said was injudicious and that mrs squeers said what mr squeers said was stuff  a vast deal of searching and rummaging ensued and it proving fruitless smike was called in and pushed by mrs squeers and boxed by mr squeers which course of treatment brightening his intellects enabled him to suggest that possibly mrs squeers might have the spoon in her pocket as indeed turned out to be the case as mrs squeers had previously protested however that she was quite certain she had not got it smike received another box on the ear for presuming to contradict his mistress together with a promise of a sound thrashing if he were not more respectful in future so that he took nothing very advantageous by his motion  a most invaluable woman that nickleby said squeers when his consort had hurried away pushing the drudge before her  indeed sir observed nicholas  i dont know her equal said squeers i do not know her equal that woman nickleby is always the samealways the same bustling lively active saving creetur that you see her now  nicholas sighed involuntarily at the thought of the agreeable domestic prospect thus opened to him but squeers was fortunately too much occupied with his own reflections to perceive it  its my way to say when i am up in london continued squeers that to them boys she is a mother but she is more than a mother to them ten times more she does things for them boys nickleby that i dont believe half the mothers going would do for their own sons  i should think they would not sir answered nicholas  now the fact was that both mr and mrs squeers viewed the boys in the light of their proper and natural enemies or in other words they held and considered that their business and profession was to get as much from every boy as could by possibility be screwed out of him on this point they were both agreed and behaved in unison accordingly the only difference between them was that mrs squeers waged war against the enemy openly and fearlessly and that squeers covered his rascality even at home with a spice of his habitual deceit as if he really had a notion of someday or other being able to take himself in and persuade his own mind that he was a very good fellow  but come said squeers interrupting the progress of some thoughts to this effect in the mind of his usher lets go to the schoolroom and lend me a hand with my schoolcoat will you  nicholas assisted his master to put on an old fustian shootingjacket which he took down from a peg in the passage and squeers arming himself with his cane led the way across a yard to a door in the rear of the house  there said the schoolmaster as they stepped in together this is our shop nickleby  it was such a crowded scene and there were so many objects to attract attention that at first nicholas stared about him really without seeing anything at all by degrees however the place resolved itself into a bare and dirty room with a couple of windows whereof a tenth part might be of glass the remainder being stopped up with old copybooks and paper there were a couple of long old rickety desks cut and notched and inked and damaged in every possible way two or three forms a detached desk for squeers and another for his assistant the ceiling was supported like that of a barn by crossbeams and rafters and the walls were so stained and discoloured that it was impossible to tell whether they had ever been touched with paint or whitewash  but the pupilsthe young noblemen how the last faint traces of hope the remotest glimmering of any good to be derived from his efforts in this den faded from the mind of nicholas as he looked in dismay around pale and haggard faces lank and bony figures children with the countenances of old men deformities with irons upon their limbs boys of stunted growth and others whose long meagre legs would hardly bear their stooping bodies all crowded on the view together there were the bleared eye the harelip the crooked foot and every ugliness or distortion that told of unnatural aversion conceived by parents for their offspring or of young lives which from the earliest dawn of infancy had been one horrible endurance of cruelty and neglect there were little faces which should have been handsome darkened with the scowl of sullen dogged suffering there was childhood with the light of its eye quenched its beauty gone and its helplessness alone remaining there were viciousfaced boys brooding with leaden eyes like malefactors in a jail and there were young creatures on whom the sins of their frail parents had descended weeping even for the mercenary nurses they had known and lonesome even in their loneliness with every kindly sympathy and affection blasted in its birth with every young and healthy feeling flogged and starved down with every revengeful passion that can fester in swollen hearts eating its evil way to their core in silence what an incipient hell was breeding here  and yet this scene painful as it was had its grotesque features which in a less interested observer than nicholas might have provoked a smile mrs squeers stood at one of the desks presiding over an immense basin of brimstone and treacle of which delicious compound she administered a large instalment to each boy in succession using for the purpose a common wooden spoon which might have been originally manufactured for some gigantic top and which widened every young gentlemans mouth considerably they being all obliged under heavy corporal penalties to take in the whole of the bowl at a gasp in another corner huddled together for companionship were the little boys who had arrived on the preceding night three of them in very large leather breeches and two in old trousers a something tighter fit than drawers are usually worn at no great distance from these was seated the juvenile son and heir of mr squeersa striking likeness of his fatherkicking with great vigour under the hands of smike who was fitting upon him a pair of new boots that bore a most suspicious resemblance to those which the least of the little boys had worn on the journey downas the little boy himself seemed to think for he was regarding the appropriation with a look of most rueful amazement besides these there was a long row of boys waiting with countenances of no pleasant anticipation to be treacled and another file who had just escaped from the infliction making a variety of wry mouths indicative of anything but satisfaction the whole were attired in such motley illassorted extraordinary garments as would have been irresistibly ridiculous but for the foul appearance of dirt disorder and disease with which they were associated  now said squeers giving the desk a great rap with his cane which made half the little boys nearly jump out of their boots is that physicking over  just over said mrs squeers choking the last boy in her hurry and tapping the crown of his head with the wooden spoon to restore him here you smike take away now look sharp  smike shuffled out with the basin and mrs squeers having called up a little boy with a curly head and wiped her hands upon it hurried out after him into a species of washhouse where there was a small fire and a large kettle together with a number of little wooden bowls which were arranged upon a board  into these bowls mrs squeers assisted by the hungry servant poured a brown composition which looked like diluted pincushions without the covers and was called porridge a minute wedge of brown bread was inserted in each bowl and when they had eaten their porridge by means of the bread the boys ate the bread itself and had finished their breakfast whereupon mr squeers said in a solemn voice for what we have received may the lord make us truly thankfuland went away to his own  nicholas distended his stomach with a bowl of porridge for much the same reason which induces some savages to swallow earthlest they should be inconveniently hungry when there is nothing to eat having further disposed of a slice of bread and butter allotted to him in virtue of his office he sat himself down to wait for schooltime  he could not but observe how silent and sad the boys all seemed to be there was none of the noise and clamour of a schoolroom none of its boisterous play or hearty mirth the children sat crouching and shivering together and seemed to lack the spirit to move about the only pupil who evinced the slightest tendency towards locomotion or playfulness was master squeers and as his chief amusement was to tread upon the other boys toes in his new boots his flow of spirits was rather disagreeable than otherwise  after some halfhours delay mr squeers reappeared and the boys took their places and their books of which latter commodity the average might be about one to eight learners a few minutes having elapsed during which mr squeers looked very profound as if he had a perfect apprehension of what was inside all the books and could say every word of their contents by heart if he only chose to take the trouble that gentleman called up the first class  obedient to this summons there ranged themselves in front of the schoolmasters desk halfadozen scarecrows out at knees and elbows one of whom placed a torn and filthy book beneath his learned eye  this is the first class in english spelling and philosophy nickleby said squeers beckoning nicholas to stand beside him well get up a latin one and hand that over to you now then wheres the first boy  please sir hes cleaning the backparlour window said the temporary head of the philosophical class  so he is to be sure rejoined squeers we go upon the practical mode of teaching nickleby the regular education system clean clean verb active to make bright to scour win win der der winder a casement when the boy knows this out of book he goes and does it its just the same principle as the use of the globes wheres the second boy  please sir hes weeding the garden replied a small voice  to be sure said squeers by no means disconcerted so he is bot bot tin tin bottin ney ney bottinney noun substantive a knowledge of plants when he has learned that bottinney means a knowledge of plants he goes and knows em thats our system nickleby what do you think of it  its very useful one at any rate answered nicholas  i believe you rejoined squeers not remarking the emphasis of his usher third boy whats horse  a beast sir replied the boy  so it is said squeers aint it nickleby  i believe there is no doubt of that sir answered nicholas  of course there isnt said squeers a horse is a quadruped and quadrupeds latin for beast as everybody thats gone through the grammar knows or else wheres the use of having grammars at all  where indeed said nicholas abstractedly  as youre perfect in that resumed squeers turning to the boy go and look after my horse and rub him down well or ill rub you down the rest of the class go and draw water up till somebody tells you to leave off for its washingday tomorrow and they want the coppers filled  so saying he dismissed the first class to their experiments in practical philosophy and eyed nicholas with a look half cunning and half doubtful as if he were not altogether certain what he might think of him by this time  thats the way we do it nickleby he said after a pause  nicholas shrugged his shoulders in a manner that was scarcely perceptible and said he saw it was  and a very good way it is too said squeers now just take them fourteen little boys and hear them some reading because you know you must begin to be useful idling about here wont do  mr squeers said this as if it had suddenly occurred to him either that he must not say too much to his assistant or that his assistant did not say enough to him in praise of the establishment the children were arranged in a semicircle round the new master and he was soon listening to their dull drawling hesitating recital of those stories of engrossing interest which are to be found in the more antiquated spellingbooks  in this exciting occupation the morning lagged heavily on at one oclock the boys having previously had their appetites thoroughly taken away by stirabout and potatoes sat down in the kitchen to some hard salt beef of which nicholas was graciously permitted to take his portion to his own solitary desk to eat it there in peace after this there was another hour of crouching in the schoolroom and shivering with cold and then school began again  it was mr squeers custom to call the boys together and make a sort of report after every halfyearly visit to the metropolis regarding the relations and friends he had seen the news he had heard the letters he had brought down the bills which had been paid the accounts which had been left unpaid and so forth this solemn proceeding always took place in the afternoon of the day succeeding his return perhaps because the boys acquired strength of mind from the suspense of the morning or possibly because mr squeers himself acquired greater sternness and inflexibility from certain warm potations in which he was wont to indulge after his early dinner be this as it may the boys were recalled from housewindow garden stable and cowyard and the school were assembled in full conclave when mr squeers with a small bundle of papers in his hand and mrs s following with a pair of canes entered the room and proclaimed silence  let any boy speak a word without leave said mr squeers mildly and ill take the skin off his back  this special proclamation had the desired effect and a deathlike silence immediately prevailed in the midst of which mr squeers went on to say  boys ive been to london and have returned to my family and you as strong and well as ever  according to halfyearly custom the boys gave three feeble cheers at this refreshing intelligence such cheers sights of extra strength with the chill on  i have seen the parents of some boys continued squeers turning over his papers and theyre so glad to hear how their sons are getting on that theres no prospect at all of their going away which of course is a very pleasant thing to reflect upon for all parties  two or three hands went to two or three eyes when squeers said this but the greater part of the young gentlemen having no particular parents to speak of were wholly uninterested in the thing one way or other  i have had disappointments to contend against said squeers looking very grim bolders father was two pound ten short where is bolder  here he is please sir rejoined twenty officious voices boys are very like men to be sure  come here bolder said squeers  an unhealthylooking boy with warts all over his hands stepped from his place to the masters desk and raised his eyes imploringly to squeerss face his own quite white from the rapid beating of his heart  bolder said squeers speaking very slowly for he was considering as the saying goes where to have him bolder if you father thinks that becausewhy whats this sir  as squeers spoke he caught up the boys hand by the cuff of his jacket and surveyed it with an edifying aspect of horror and disgust  what do you call this sir demanded the schoolmaster administering a cut with the cane to expedite the reply  i cant help it indeed sir rejoined the boy crying they will come its the dirty work i think sirat least i dont know what it is sir but its not my fault  bolder said squeers tucking up his wristbands and moistening the palm of his right hand to get a good grip of the cane youre an incorrigible young scoundrel and as the last thrashing did you no good we must see what another will do towards beating it out of you  with this and wholly disregarding a piteous cry for mercy mr squeers fell upon the boy and caned him soundly not leaving off indeed until his arm was tired out  there said squeers when he had quite done rub away as hard as you like you wont rub that off in a hurry oh you wont hold that noise wont you put him out smike  the drudge knew better from long experience than to hesitate about obeying so he bundled the victim out by a sidedoor and mr squeers perched himself again on his own stool supported by mrs squeers who occupied another at his side  now let us see said squeers a letter for cobbey stand up cobbey  another boy stood up and eyed the letter very hard while squeers made a mental abstract of the same  oh said squeers cobbeys grandmother is dead and his uncle john has took to drinking which is all the news his sister sends except eighteenpence which will just pay for that broken square of glass mrs squeers my dear will you take the money  the worthy lady pocketed the eighteenpence with a most businesslike air and squeers passed on to the next boy as coolly as possible  graymarsh said squeers hes the next stand up graymarsh  another boy stood up and the schoolmaster looked over the letter as before  graymarshs maternal aunt said squeers when he had possessed himself of the contents is very glad to hear hes so well and happy and sends her respectful compliments to mrs squeers and thinks she must be an angel she likewise thinks mr squeers is too good for this world but hopes he may long be spared to carry on the business would have sent the two pair of stockings as desired but is short of money so forwards a tract instead and hopes graymarsh will put his trust in providence hopes above all that he will study in everything to please mr and mrs squeers and look upon them as his only friends and that he will love master squeers and not object to sleeping five in a bed which no christian should ah said squeers folding it up a delightful letter very affecting indeed  it was affecting in one sense for graymarshs maternal aunt was strongly supposed by her more intimate friends to be no other than his maternal parent squeers however without alluding to this part of the story which would have sounded immoral before boys proceeded with the business by calling out mobbs whereupon another boy rose and graymarsh resumed his seat  mobbss stepmother said squeers took to her bed on hearing that he wouldnt eat fat and has been very ill ever since she wishes to know by an early post where he expects to go to if he quarrels with his vittles and with what feelings he could turn up his nose at the cowsliver broth after his good master had asked a blessing on it this was told her in the london newspapersnot by mr squeers for he is too kind and too good to set anybody against anybodyand it has vexed her so much mobbs cant think she is sorry to find he is discontented which is sinful and horrid and hopes mr squeers will flog him into a happier state of mind with which view she has also stopped his halfpenny a week pocketmoney and given a doublebladed knife with a corkscrew in it to the missionaries which she had bought on purpose for him  a sulky state of feeling said squeers after a terrible pause during which he had moistened the palm of his right hand again wont do cheerfulness and contentment must be kept up mobbs come to me  mobbs moved slowly towards the desk rubbing his eyes in anticipation of good cause for doing so and he soon afterwards retired by the sidedoor with as good cause as a boy need have  mr squeers then proceeded to open a miscellaneous collection of letters some enclosing money which mrs squeers took care of and others referring to small articles of apparel as caps and so forth all of which the same lady stated to be too large or too small and calculated for nobody but young squeers who would appear indeed to have had most accommodating limbs since everything that came into the school fitted him to a nicety his head in particular must have been singularly elastic for hats and caps of all dimensions were alike to him  this business dispatched a few slovenly lessons were performed and squeers retired to his fireside leaving nicholas to take care of the boys in the schoolroom which was very cold and where a meal of bread and cheese was served out shortly after dark  there was a small stove at that corner of the room which was nearest to the masters desk and by it nicholas sat down so depressed and selfdegraded by the consciousness of his position that if death could have come upon him at that time he would have been almost happy to meet it the cruelty of which he had been an unwilling witness the coarse and ruffianly behaviour of squeers even in his best moods the filthy place the sights and sounds about him all contributed to this state of feeling but when he recollected that being there as an assistant he actually seemedno matter what unhappy train of circumstances had brought him to that passto be the aider and abettor of a system which filled him with honest disgust and indignation he loathed himself and felt for the moment as though the mere consciousness of his present situation must through all time to come prevent his raising his head again  but for the present his resolve was taken and the resolution he had formed on the preceding night remained undisturbed he had written to his mother and sister announcing the safe conclusion of his journey and saying as little about dotheboys hall and saying that little as cheerfully as he possibly could he hoped that by remaining where he was he might do some good even there at all events others depended too much on his uncles favour to admit of his awakening his wrath just then  one reflection disturbed him far more than any selfish considerations arising out of his own position this was the probable destination of his sister kate his uncle had deceived him and might he not consign her to some miserable place where her youth and beauty would prove a far greater curse than ugliness and decrepitude to a caged man bound hand and foot this was a terrible ideabut no he thought his mother was by there was the portraitpainter toosimple enough but still living in the world and of it he was willing to believe that ralph nickleby had conceived a personal dislike to himself having pretty good reason by this time to reciprocate it he had no great difficulty in arriving at this conclusion and tried to persuade himself that the feeling extended no farther than between them  as he was absorbed in these meditations he all at once encountered the upturned face of smike who was on his knees before the stove picking a few stray cinders from the hearth and planting them on the fire he had paused to steal a look at nicholas and when he saw that he was observed shrunk back as if expecting a blow  you need not fear me said nicholas kindly are you cold  nno  you are shivering  i am not cold replied smike quickly i am used to it  there was such an obvious fear of giving offence in his manner and he was such a timid brokenspirited creature that nicholas could not help exclaiming poor fellow  if he had struck the drudge he would have slunk away without a word but now he burst into tears  oh dear oh dear he cried covering his face with his cracked and horny hands my heart will break it will it will  hush said nicholas laying his hand upon his shoulder be a man you are nearly one by years god help you  by years cried smike oh dear dear how many of them how many of them since i was a little child younger than any that are here now where are they all  whom do you speak of inquired nicholas wishing to rouse the poor halfwitted creature to reason tell me  my friends he replied myselfmyoh what sufferings mine have been  there is always hope said nicholas he knew not what to say  no rejoined the other no none for me do you remember the boy that died here  i was not here you know said nicholas gently but what of him  why replied the youth drawing closer to his questioners side i was with him at night and when it was all silent he cried no more for friends he wished to come and sit with him but began to see faces round his bed that came from home he said they smiled and talked to him and he died at last lifting his head to kiss them do you hear  yes yes rejoined nicholas  what faces will smile on me when i die cried his companion shivering who will talk to me in those long nights they cannot come from home they would frighten me if they did for i dont know what it is and shouldnt know them pain and fear pain and fear for me alive or dead no hope no hope  the bell rang to bed and the boy subsiding at the sound into his usual listless state crept away as if anxious to avoid notice it was with a heavy heart that nicholas soon afterwardsno not retired there was no retirement therefollowedto his dirty and crowded dormitory    chapter 9  of miss squeers mrs squeers master squeers and mr squeers and of various matters and persons connected no less with the squeerses than nicholas nickleby   when mr squeers left the schoolroom for the night he betook himself as has been before remarked to his own fireside which was situatednot in the room in which nicholas had supped on the night of his arrival but in a smaller apartment in the rear of the premises where his lady wife his amiable son and accomplished daughter were in the full enjoyment of each others society mrs squeers being engaged in the matronly pursuit of stockingdarning and the young lady and gentleman being occupied in the adjustment of some youthful differences by means of a pugilistic contest across the table which on the approach of their honoured parent subsided into a noiseless exchange of kicks beneath it  and in this place it may be as well to apprise the reader that miss fanny squeers was in her threeandtwentieth year if there be any one grace or loveliness inseparable from that particular period of life miss squeers may be presumed to have been possessed of it as there is no reason to suppose that she was a solitary exception to an universal rule she was not tall like her mother but short like her father from the former she inherited a voice of harsh quality from the latter a remarkable expression of the right eye something akin to having none at all  miss squeers had been spending a few days with a neighbouring friend and had only just returned to the parental roof to this circumstance may be referred her having heard nothing of nicholas until mr squeers himself now made him the subject of conversation  well my dear said squeers drawing up his chair what do you think of him by this time  think of who inquired mrs squeers who as she often remarked was no grammarian thank heaven  of the young manthe new teacherwho else could i mean  oh that knuckleboy said mrs squeers impatiently i hate him  what do you hate him for my dear asked squeers  whats that to you retorted mrs squeers if i hate him thats enough aint it  quite enough for him my dear and a great deal too much i dare say if he knew it replied squeers in a pacific tone i only ask from curiosity my dear  well then if you want to know rejoined mrs squeers ill tell you because hes a proud haughty consequential turnedupnosed peacock  mrs squeers when excited was accustomed to use strong language and moreover to make use of a plurality of epithets some of which were of a figurative kind as the word peacock and furthermore the allusion to nicholass nose which was not intended to be taken in its literal sense but rather to bear a latitude of construction according to the fancy of the hearers  neither were they meant to bear reference to each other so much as to the object on whom they were bestowed as will be seen in the present case a peacock with a turnedup nose being a novelty in ornithology and a thing not commonly seen  hem said squeers as if in mild deprecation of this outbreak he is cheap my dear the young man is very cheap  not a bit of it retorted mrs squeers  five pound a year said squeers  what of that its dear if you dont want him isnt it replied his wife  but we do want him urged squeers  i dont see that you want him any more than the dead said mrs squeers dont tell me you can put on the cards and in the advertisements education by mr wackford squeers and able assistants without having any assistants cant you isnt it done every day by all the masters about ive no patience with you  havent you said squeers sternly now ill tell you what mrs squeers in this matter of having a teacher ill take my own way if you please a slave driver in the west indies is allowed a man under him to see that his blacks dont run away or get up a rebellion and ill have a man under me to do the same with our blacks till such time as little wackford is able to take charge of the school  am i to take care of the school when i grow up a man father said wackford junior suspending in the excess of his delight a vicious kick which he was administering to his sister  you are my son replied mr squeers in a sentimental voice  oh my eye wont i give it to the boys exclaimed the interesting child grasping his fathers cane oh father wont i make em squeak again  it was a proud moment in mr squeerss life when he witnessed that burst of enthusiasm in his young childs mind and saw in it a foreshadowing of his future eminence he pressed a penny into his hand and gave vent to his feelings as did his exemplary wife also in a shout of approving laughter the infantine appeal to their common sympathies at once restored cheerfulness to the conversation and harmony to the company  hes a nasty stuckup monkey thats what i consider him said mrs squeers reverting to nicholas  supposing he is said squeers he is as well stuck up in our schoolroom as anywhere else isnt heespecially as he dont like it  well observed mrs squeers theres something in that i hope itll bring his pride down and it shall be no fault of mine if it dont  now a proud usher in a yorkshire school was such a very extraordinary and unaccountable thing to hear ofany usher at all being a novelty but a proud one a being of whose existence the wildest imagination could never have dreamedthat miss squeers who seldom troubled herself with scholastic matters inquired with much curiosity who this knuckleboy was that gave himself such airs  nickleby said squeers spelling the name according to some eccentric system which prevailed in his own mind your mother always calls things and people by their wrong names  no matter for that said mrs squeers i see them with right eyes and thats quite enough for me i watched him when you were laying on to little bolder this afternoon he looked as black as thunder all the while and one time started up as if he had more than got it in his mind to make a rush at you i saw him though he thought i didnt  never mind that father said miss squeers as the head of the family was about to reply who is the man  why your father has got some nonsense in his head that hes the son of a poor gentleman that died the other day said mrs squeers  the son of a gentleman  yes but i dont believe a word of it if hes a gentlemans son at all hes a fondling thats my opinion  mrs squeers intended to say foundling but as she frequently remarked when she made any such mistake it would be all the same a hundred years hence with which axiom of philosophy indeed she was in the constant habit of consoling the boys when they laboured under more than ordinary illusage  hes nothing of the kind said squeers in answer to the above remark for his father was married to his mother years before he was born and she is alive now if he was it would be no business of ours for we make a very good friend by having him here and if he likes to learn the boys anything besides minding them i have no objection i am sure  i say again i hate him worse than poison said mrs squeers vehemently  if you dislike him my dear returned squeers i dont know anybody who can show dislike better than you and of course theres no occasion with him to take the trouble to hide it  i dont intend to i assure you interposed mrs s  thats right said squeers and if he has a touch of pride about him as i think he has i dont believe theres woman in all england that can bring anybodys spirit down as quick as you can my love  mrs squeers chuckled vastly on the receipt of these flattering compliments and said she hoped she had tamed a high spirit or two in her day it is but due to her character to say that in conjunction with her estimable husband she had broken many and many a one  miss fanny squeers carefully treasured up this and much more conversation on the same subject until she retired for the night when she questioned the hungry servant minutely regarding the outward appearance and demeanour of nicholas to which queries the girl returned such enthusiastic replies coupled with so many laudatory remarks touching his beautiful dark eyes and his sweet smile and his straight legsupon which lastnamed articles she laid particular stress the general run of legs at dotheboys hall being crookedthat miss squeers was not long in arriving at the conclusion that the new usher must be a very remarkable person or as she herself significantly phrased it something quite out of the common and so miss squeers made up her mind that she would take a personal observation of nicholas the very next day  in pursuance of this design the young lady watched the opportunity of her mother being engaged and her father absent and went accidentally into the schoolroom to get a pen mended where seeing nobody but nicholas presiding over the boys she blushed very deeply and exhibited great confusion  i beg your pardon faltered miss squeers i thought my father wasor might bedear me how very awkward  mr squeers is out said nicholas by no means overcome by the apparition unexpected though it was  do you know will he be long sir asked miss squeers with bashful hesitation  he said about an hour replied nicholaspolitely of course but without any indication of being stricken to the heart by miss squeerss charms  i never knew anything happen so cross exclaimed the young lady thank you i am very sorry i intruded i am sure if i hadnt thought my father was here i wouldnt upon any account haveit is very provokingmust look so very strange murmured miss squeers blushing once more and glancing from the pen in her hand to nicholas at his desk and back again  if that is all you want said nicholas pointing to the pen and smiling in spite of himself at the affected embarrassment of the schoolmasters daughter perhaps i can supply his place  miss squeers glanced at the door as if dubious of the propriety of advancing any nearer to an utter stranger then round the schoolroom as though in some measure reassured by the presence of forty boys and finally sidled up to nicholas and delivered the pen into his hand with a most winning mixture of reserve and condescension  shall it be a hard or a soft nib inquired nicholas smiling to prevent himself from laughing outright  he has a beautiful smile thought miss squeers  which did you say asked nicholas  dear me i was thinking of something else for the moment i declare replied miss squeers oh as soft as possible if you please with which words miss squeers sighed it might be to give nicholas to understand that her heart was soft and that the pen was wanted to match  upon these instructions nicholas made the pen when he gave it to miss squeers miss squeers dropped it and when he stooped to pick it up miss squeers stopped also and they knocked their heads together whereat fiveandtwenty little boys laughed aloud being positively for the first and only time that halfyear  very awkward of me said nicholas opening the door for the young ladys retreat  not at all sir replied miss squeers it was my fault it was all my foolishaagoodmorning  goodbye said nicholas the next i make for you i hope will be made less clumsily take care you are biting the nib off now  really said miss squeers so embarrassing that i scarcely know what ivery sorry to give you so much trouble  not the least trouble in the world replied nicholas closing the schoolroom door  i never saw such legs in the whole course of my life said miss squeers as she walked away  in fact miss squeers was in love with nicholas nickleby  to account for the rapidity with which this young lady had conceived a passion for nicholas it may be necessary to state that the friend from whom she had so recently returned was a millers daughter of only eighteen who had contracted herself unto the son of a small cornfactor resident in the nearest market town miss squeers and the millers daughter being fast friends had covenanted together some two years before according to a custom prevalent among young ladies that whoever was first engaged to be married should straightway confide the mighty secret to the bosom of the other before communicating it to any living soul and bespeak her as bridesmaid without loss of time in fulfilment of which pledge the millers daughter when her engagement was formed came out express at eleven oclock at night as the cornfactors son made an offer of his hand and heart at twentyfive minutes past ten by the dutch clock in the kitchen and rushed into miss squeerss bedroom with the gratifying intelligence now miss squeers being five years older and out of her teens which is also a great matter had since been more than commonly anxious to return the compliment and possess her friend with a similar secret but either in consequence of finding it hard to please herself or harder still to please anybody else had never had an opportunity so to do inasmuch as she had no such secret to disclose the little interview with nicholas had no sooner passed as above described however than miss squeers putting on her bonnet made her way with great precipitation to her friends house and upon a solemn renewal of divers old vows of secrecy revealed how that she wasnot exactly engaged but going to beto a gentlemans sonnone of your cornfactors but a gentlemans son of high descentwho had come down as teacher to dotheboys hall under most mysterious and remarkable circumstancesindeed as miss squeers more than once hinted she had good reason to believe induced by the fame of her many charms to seek her out and woo and win her  isnt it an extraordinary thing said miss squeers emphasising the adjective strongly  most extraordinary replied the friend but what has he said to you  dont ask me what he said my dear rejoined miss squeers if you had only seen his looks and smiles i never was so overcome in all my life  did he look in this way inquired the millers daughter counterfeiting as nearly as she could a favourite leer of the cornfactor  very like thatonly more genteel replied miss squeers  ah said the friend then he means something depend on it  miss squeers having slight misgivings on the subject was by no means ill pleased to be confirmed by a competent authority and discovering on further conversation and comparison of notes a great many points of resemblance between the behaviour of nicholas and that of the cornfactor grew so exceedingly confidential that she intrusted her friend with a vast number of things nicholas had not said which were all so very complimentary as to be quite conclusive then she dilated on the fearful hardship of having a father and mother strenuously opposed to her intended husband on which unhappy circumstance she dwelt at great length for the friends father and mother were quite agreeable to her being married and the whole courtship was in consequence as flat and commonplace an affair as it was possible to imagine  how i should like to see him exclaimed the friend  so you shall tilda replied miss squeers i should consider myself one of the most ungrateful creatures alive if i denied you i think mothers going away for two days to fetch some boys and when she does ill ask you and john up to tea and have him to meet you  this was a charming idea and having fully discussed it the friends parted  it so fell out that mrs squeerss journey to some distance to fetch three new boys and dun the relations of two old ones for the balance of a small account was fixed that very afternoon for the next day but one and on the next day but one mrs squeers got up outside the coach as it stopped to change at greta bridge taking with her a small bundle containing something in a bottle and some sandwiches and carrying besides a large white topcoat to wear in the nighttime with which baggage she went her way  whenever such opportunities as these occurred it was squeerss custom to drive over to the market town every evening on pretence of urgent business and stop till ten or eleven oclock at a tavern he much affected as the party was not in his way therefore but rather afforded a means of compromise with miss squeers he readily yielded his full assent thereunto and willingly communicated to nicholas that he was expected to take his tea in the parlour that evening at five oclock  to be sure miss squeers was in a desperate flutter as the time approached and to be sure she was dressed out to the best advantage with her hairit had more than a tinge of red and she wore it in a cropcurled in five distinct rows up to the very top of her head and arranged dexterously over the doubtful eye to say nothing of the blue sash which floated down her back or the worked apron or the long gloves or the green gauze scarf worn over one shoulder and under the other or any of the numerous devices which were to be as so many arrows to the heart of nicholas she had scarcely completed these arrangements to her entire satisfaction when the friend arrived with a whitybrown parcelflat and threecorneredcontaining sundry small adornments which were to be put on upstairs and which the friend put on talking incessantly when miss squeers had done the friends hair the friend did miss squeerss hair throwing in some striking improvements in the way of ringlets down the neck and then when they were both touched up to their entire satisfaction they went downstairs in full state with the long gloves on all ready for company  wheres john tilda said miss squeers  only gone home to clean himself replied the friend he will be here by the time the teas drawn  i do so palpitate observed miss squeers  ah i know what it is replied the friend  i have not been used to it you know tilda said miss squeers applying her hand to the left side of her sash  youll soon get the better of it dear rejoined the friend while they were talking thus the hungry servant brought in the teathings and soon afterwards somebody tapped at the room door  there he is cried miss squeers oh tilda  hush said tilda hem say come in  come in cried miss squeers faintly and in walked nicholas  goodevening said that young gentleman all unconscious of his conquest i understood from mr squeers that  oh yes its all right interposed miss squeers father dont tea with us but you wont mind that i dare say this was said archly  nicholas opened his eyes at this but he turned the matter off very coollynot caring particularly about anything just thenand went through the ceremony of introduction to the millers daughter with so much grace that that young lady was lost in admiration  we are only waiting for one more gentleman said miss squeers taking off the teapot lid and looking in to see how the tea was getting on  it was matter of equal moment to nicholas whether they were waiting for one gentleman or twenty so he received the intelligence with perfect unconcern and being out of spirits and not seeing any especial reason why he should make himself agreeable looked out of the window and sighed involuntarily  as luck would have it miss squeerss friend was of a playful turn and hearing nicholas sigh she took it into her head to rally the lovers on their lowness of spirits  but if its caused by my being here said the young lady dont mind me a bit for im quite as bad you may go on just as you would if you were alone  tilda said miss squeers colouring up to the top row of curls i am ashamed of you and here the two friends burst into a variety of giggles and glanced from time to time over the tops of their pockethandkerchiefs at nicholas who from a state of unmixed astonishment gradually fell into one of irrepressible laughteroccasioned partly by the bare notion of his being in love with miss squeers and partly by the preposterous appearance and behaviour of the two girls these two causes of merriment taken together struck him as being so keenly ridiculous that despite his miserable condition he laughed till he was thoroughly exhausted  well thought nicholas as i am here and seem expected for some reason or other to be amiable its of no use looking like a goose i may as well accommodate myself to the company  we blush to tell it but his youthful spirits and vivacity getting for the time the better of his sad thoughts he no sooner formed this resolution than he saluted miss squeers and the friend with great gallantry and drawing a chair to the teatable began to make himself more at home than in all probability an usher has ever done in his employers house since ushers were first invented  the ladies were in the full delight of this altered behaviour on the part of mr nickleby when the expected swain arrived with his hair very damp from recent washing and a clean shirt whereof the collar might have belonged to some giant ancestor forming together with a white waistcoat of similar dimensions the chief ornament of his person  well john said miss matilda price which bythebye was the name of the millers daughter  weel said john with a grin that even the collar could not conceal  i beg your pardon interposed miss squeers hastening to do the honours mr nicklebymr john browdie  servant sir said john who was something over six feet high with a face and body rather above the due proportion than below it  yours to command sir replied nicholas making fearful ravages on the bread and butter  mr browdie was not a gentleman of great conversational powers so he grinned twice more and having now bestowed his customary mark of recognition on every person in company grinned at nothing in particular and helped himself to food  old wooman awa beant she said mr browdie with his mouth full  miss squeers nodded assent  mr browdie gave a grin of special width as if he thought that really was something to laugh at and went to work at the bread and butter with increased vigour it was quite a sight to behold how he and nicholas emptied the plate between them  ye weant get bread and butther evry neight i expect mun said mr browdie after he had sat staring at nicholas a long time over the empty plate  nicholas bit his lip and coloured but affected not to hear the remark  ecod said mr browdie laughing boisterously they deant put too much intivem yell be nowt but skeen and boans if you stop here long eneaf ho ho ho  you are facetious sir said nicholas scornfully  na i deant know replied mr browdie but toother teacher cod he wur a learn un he wur the recollection of the last teachers leanness seemed to afford mr browdie the most exquisite delight for he laughed until he found it necessary to apply his coatcuffs to his eyes  i dont know whether your perceptions are quite keen enough mr browdie to enable you to understand that your remarks are offensive said nicholas in a towering passion but if they are have the goodness to  if you say another word john shrieked miss price stopping her admirers mouth as he was about to interrupt only half a word ill never forgive you or speak to you again  weel my lass i deant care aboot un said the cornfactor bestowing a hearty kiss on miss matilda let un gang on let un gang on  it now became miss squeerss turn to intercede with nicholas which she did with many symptoms of alarm and horror the effect of the double intercession was that he and john browdie shook hands across the table with much gravity and such was the imposing nature of the ceremonial that miss squeers was overcome and shed tears  whats the matter fanny said miss price  nothing tilda replied miss squeers sobbing  there never was any danger said miss price was there mr nickleby  none at all replied nicholas absurd  thats right whispered miss price say something kind to her and shell soon come round here shall john and i go into the little kitchen and come back presently  not on any account rejoined nicholas quite alarmed at the proposition what on earth should you do that for  well said miss price beckoning him aside and speaking with some degree of contemptyou are a one to keep company  what do you mean said nicholas i am not a one to keep company at allhere at all events i cant make this out  no nor i neither rejoined miss price but men are always fickle and always were and always will be that i can make out very easily  fickle cried nicholas what do you suppose you dont mean to say that you think  oh no i think nothing at all retorted miss price pettishly look at her dressed so beautiful and looking so wellreally almost handsome i am ashamed at you  my dear girl what have i got to do with her dressing beautifully or looking well inquired nicholas  come dont call me a dear girl said miss pricesmiling a little though for she was pretty and a coquette too in her small way and nicholas was goodlooking and she supposed him the property of somebody else which were all reasons why she should be gratified to think she had made an impression on himor fanny will be saying its my fault come were going to have a game at cards pronouncing these last words aloud she tripped away and rejoined the big yorkshireman  this was wholly unintelligible to nicholas who had no other distinct impression on his mind at the moment than that miss squeers was an ordinarylooking girl and her friend miss price a pretty one but he had not time to enlighten himself by reflection for the hearth being by this time swept up and the candle snuffed they sat down to play speculation  there are only four of us tilda said miss squeers looking slyly at nicholas so we had better go partners two against two  what do you say mr nickleby inquired miss price  with all the pleasure in life replied nicholas and so saying quite unconscious of his heinous offence he amalgamated into one common heap those portions of a dotheboys hall card of terms which represented his own counters and those allotted to miss price respectively  mr browdie said miss squeers hysterically shall we make a bank against them  the yorkshireman assentedapparently quite overwhelmed by the new ushers impudenceand miss squeers darted a spiteful look at her friend and giggled convulsively  the deal fell to nicholas and the hand prospered  we intend to win everything said he  tilda has won something she didnt expect i think havent you dear said miss squeers maliciously  only a dozen and eight love replied miss price affecting to take the question in a literal sense  how dull you are tonight sneered miss squeers  no indeed replied miss price i am in excellent spirits i was thinking you seemed out of sorts  me cried miss squeers biting her lips and trembling with very jealousy oh no  thats well remarked miss price your hairs coming out of curl dear  never mind me tittered miss squeers you had better attend to your partner  thank you for reminding her said nicholas so she had  the yorkshireman flattened his nose once or twice with his clenched fist as if to keep his hand in till he had an opportunity of exercising it upon the features of some other gentleman and miss squeers tossed her head with such indignation that the gust of wind raised by the multitudinous curls in motion nearly blew the candle out  i never had such luck really exclaimed coquettish miss price after another hand or two its all along of you mr nickleby i think i should like to have you for a partner always  i wish you had  youll have a bad wife though if you always win at cards said miss price  not if your wish is gratified replied nicholas i am sure i shall have a good one in that case  to see how miss squeers tossed her head and the cornfactor flattened his nose while this conversation was carrying on it would have been worth a small annuity to have beheld that let alone miss prices evident joy at making them jealous and nicholas nicklebys happy unconsciousness of making anybody uncomfortable  we have all the talking to ourselves it seems said nicholas looking goodhumouredly round the table as he took up the cards for a fresh deal  you do it so well tittered miss squeers that it would be a pity to interrupt wouldnt it mr browdie he he he  nay said nicholas we do it in default of having anybody else to talk to  well talk to you you know if youll say anything said miss price  thank you tilda dear retorted miss squeers majestically  or you can talk to each other if you dont choose to talk to us said miss price rallying her dear friend john why dont you say something  say summat repeated the yorkshireman  ay and not sit there so silent and glum  weel then said the yorkshireman striking the table heavily with his fist what i says thisdang my boans and boddy if i stan this ony longer do ye gang whoam wi me and do yon loight an toight young whipster look sharp out for a brokken head next time he cums under my hond  mercy on us whats all this cried miss price in affected astonishment  cum whoam tell e cum whoam replied the yorkshireman sternly and as he delivered the reply miss squeers burst into a shower of tears arising in part from desperate vexation and in part from an impotent desire to lacerate somebodys countenance with her fair fingernails  this state of things had been brought about by divers means and workings miss squeers had brought it about by aspiring to the high state and condition of being matrimonially engaged without good grounds for so doing miss price had brought it about by indulging in three motives of action first a desire to punish her friend for laying claim to a rivalship in dignity having no good title secondly the gratification of her own vanity in receiving the compliments of a smart young man and thirdly a wish to convince the cornfactor of the great danger he ran in deferring the celebration of their expected nuptials while nicholas had brought it about by half an hours gaiety and thoughtlessness and a very sincere desire to avoid the imputation of inclining at all to miss squeers so the means employed and the end produced were alike the most natural in the world for young ladies will look forward to being married and will jostle each other in the race to the altar and will avail themselves of all opportunities of displaying their own attractions to the best advantage down to the very end of time as they have done from its beginning  why and heres fanny in tears now exclaimed miss price as if in fresh amazement what can be the matter  oh you dont know miss of course you dont know pray dont trouble yourself to inquire said miss squeers producing that change of countenance which children call making a face  well im sure exclaimed miss price  and who cares whether you are sure or not maam retorted miss squeers making another face  you are monstrous polite maam said miss price  i shall not come to you to take lessons in the art maam retorted miss squeers  you neednt take the trouble to make yourself plainer than you are maam however rejoined miss price because thats quite unnecessary  miss squeers in reply turned very red and thanked god that she hadnt got the bold faces of some people miss price in rejoinder congratulated herself upon not being possessed of the envious feeling of other people whereupon miss squeers made some general remark touching the danger of associating with low persons in which miss price entirely coincided observing that it was very true indeed and she had thought so a long time  tilda exclaimed miss squeers with dignity i hate you  ah theres no love lost between us i assure you said miss price tying her bonnet strings with a jerk youll cry your eyes out when im gone you know you will  i scorn your words minx said miss squeers  you pay me a great compliment when you say so answered the millers daughter curtseying very low wish you a very goodnight maam and pleasant dreams attend your sleep  with this parting benediction miss price swept from the room followed by the huge yorkshireman who exchanged with nicholas at parting that peculiarly expressive scowl with which the cutandthrust counts in melodramatic performances inform each other they will meet again  they were no sooner gone than miss squeers fulfilled the prediction of her quondam friend by giving vent to a most copious burst of tears and uttering various dismal lamentations and incoherent words nicholas stood looking on for a few seconds rather doubtful what to do but feeling uncertain whether the fit would end in his being embraced or scratched and considering that either infliction would be equally agreeable he walked off very quietly while miss squeers was moaning in her pockethandkerchief  this is one consequence thought nicholas when he had groped his way to the dark sleepingroom of my cursed readiness to adapt myself to any society in which chance carries me if i had sat mute and motionless as i might have done this would not have happened  he listened for a few minutes but all was quiet  i was glad he murmured to grasp at any relief from the sight of this dreadful place or the presence of its vile master i have set these people by the ears and made two new enemies where heaven knows i needed none well it is a just punishment for having forgotten even for an hour what is around me now  so saying he felt his way among the throng of wearyhearted sleepers and crept into his poor bed    chapter 10  how mr ralph nickleby provided for his niece and sisterinlaw   on the second morning after the departure of nicholas for yorkshire kate nickleby sat in a very faded chair raised upon a very dusty throne in miss la creevys room giving that lady a sitting for the portrait upon which she was engaged and towards the full perfection of which miss la creevy had had the streetdoor case brought upstairs in order that she might be the better able to infuse into the counterfeit countenance of miss nickleby a bright salmon fleshtint which she had originally hit upon while executing the miniature of a young officer therein contained and which bright salmon fleshtint was considered by miss la creevys chief friends and patrons to be quite a novelty in art as indeed it was  i think i have caught it now said miss la creevy the very shade this will be the sweetest portrait i have ever done certainly  it will be your genius that makes it so then i am sure replied kate smiling  no no i wont allow that my dear rejoined miss la creevy its a very nice subjecta very nice subject indeedthough of course something depends upon the mode of treatment  and not a little observed kate  why my dear you are right there said miss la creevy in the main you are right there though i dont allow that it is of such very great importance in the present case ah the difficulties of art my dear are great  they must be i have no doubt said kate humouring her goodnatured little friend  they are beyond anything you can form the faintest conception of replied miss la creevy what with bringing out eyes with all ones power and keeping down noses with all ones force and adding to heads and taking away teeth altogether you have no idea of the trouble one little miniature is  the remuneration can scarcely repay you said kate  why it does not and thats the truth answered miss la creevy and then people are so dissatisfied and unreasonable that nine times out of ten theres no pleasure in painting them sometimes they say oh how very serious you have made me look miss la creevy and at others la miss la creevy how very smirking when the very essence of a good portrait is that it must be either serious or smirking or its no portrait at all  indeed said kate laughing  certainly my dear because the sitters are always either the one or the other replied miss la creevy look at the royal academy all those beautiful shiny portraits of gentlemen in black velvet waistcoats with their fists doubled up on round tables or marble slabs are serious you know and all the ladies who are playing with little parasols or little dogs or little childrenits the same rule in art only varying the objectsare smirking in fact said miss la creevy sinking her voice to a confidential whisper there are only two styles of portrait painting the serious and the smirk and we always use the serious for professional people except actors sometimes and the smirk for private ladies and gentlemen who dont care so much about looking clever  kate seemed highly amused by this information and miss la creevy went on painting and talking with immovable complacency  what a number of officers you seem to paint said kate availing herself of a pause in the discourse and glancing round the room  number of what child inquired miss la creevy looking up from her work character portraits oh yestheyre not real military men you know  no  bless your heart of course not only clerks and that who hire a uniform coat to be painted in and send it here in a carpet bag some artists said miss la creevy keep a red coat and charge sevenandsixpence extra for hire and carmine but i dont do that myself for i dont consider it legitimate  drawing herself up as though she plumed herself greatly upon not resorting to these lures to catch sitters miss la creevy applied herself more intently to her task only raising her head occasionally to look with unspeakable satisfaction at some touch she had just put in and now and then giving miss nickleby to understand what particular feature she was at work upon at the moment not she expressly observed that you should make it up for painting my dear but because its our custom sometimes to tell sitters what part we are upon in order that if theres any particular expression they want introduced they may throw it in at the time you know  and when said miss la creevy after a long silence to wit an interval of full a minute and a half when do you expect to see your uncle again  i scarcely know i had expected to have seen him before now replied kate soon i hope for this state of uncertainty is worse than anything  i suppose he has money hasnt he inquired miss la creevy  he is very rich i have heard rejoined kate i dont know that he is but i believe so  ah you may depend upon it he is or he wouldnt be so surly remarked miss la creevy who was an odd little mixture of shrewdness and simplicity when a mans a bear he is generally pretty independent  his manner is rough said kate  rough cried miss la creevy a porcupines a featherbed to him i never met with such a crossgrained old savage  it is only his manner i believe observed kate timidly he was disappointed in early life i think i have heard or has had his temper soured by some calamity i should be sorry to think ill of him until i knew he deserved it  well thats very right and proper observed the miniature painter and heaven forbid that i should be the cause of your doing so but now mightnt he without feeling it himself make you and your mama some nice little allowance that would keep you both comfortable until you were well married and be a little fortune to her afterwards what would a hundred a year for instance be to him  i dont know what it would be to him said kate with energy but it would be that to me i would rather die than take  heyday cried miss la creevy  a dependence upon him said kate would embitter my whole life i should feel begging a far less degradation  well exclaimed miss la creevy this of a relation whom you will not hear an indifferent person speak ill of my dear sounds oddly enough i confess  i dare say it does replied kate speaking more gently indeed i am sure it must iionly mean that with the feelings and recollection of better times upon me i could not bear to live on anybodys bountynot his particularly but anybodys  miss la creevy looked slyly at her companion as if she doubted whether ralph himself were not the subject of dislike but seeing that her young friend was distressed made no remark  i only ask of him continued kate whose tears fell while she spoke that he will move so little out of his way in my behalf as to enable me by his recommendationonly by his recommendationto earn literally my bread and remain with my mother whether we shall ever taste happiness again depends upon the fortunes of my dear brother but if he will do this and nicholas only tells us that he is well and cheerful i shall be contented  as she ceased to speak there was a rustling behind the screen which stood between her and the door and some person knocked at the wainscot  come in whoever it is cried miss la creevy  the person complied and coming forward at once gave to view the form and features of no less an individual than mr ralph nickleby himself  your servant ladies said ralph looking sharply at them by turns you were talking so loud that i was unable to make you hear  when the man of business had a more than commonly vicious snarl lurking at his heart he had a trick of almost concealing his eyes under their thick and protruding brows for an instant and then displaying them in their full keenness as he did so now and tried to keep down the smile which parted his thin compressed lips and puckered up the bad lines about his mouth they both felt certain that some part if not the whole of their recent conversation had been overheard  i called in on my way upstairs more than half expecting to find you here said ralph addressing his niece and looking contemptuously at the portrait is that my nieces portrait maam  yes it is mr nickleby said miss la creevy with a very sprightly air and between you and me and the post sir it will be a very nice portrait too though i say it who am the painter  dont trouble yourself to show it to me maam cried ralph moving away i have no eye for likenesses is it nearly finished  why yes replied miss la creevy considering with the pencil end of her brush in her mouth two sittings more will  have them at once maam said ralph shell have no time to idle over fooleries after tomorrow work maam work we must all work have you let your lodgings maam  i have not put a bill up yet sir  put it up at once maam they wont want the rooms after this week or if they do cant pay for them now my dear if youre ready well lose no more time  with an assumption of kindness which sat worse upon him even than his usual manner mr ralph nickleby motioned to the young lady to precede him and bowing gravely to miss la creevy closed the door and followed upstairs where mrs nickleby received him with many expressions of regard stopping them somewhat abruptly ralph waved his hand with an impatient gesture and proceeded to the object of his visit  i have found a situation for your daughter maam said ralph  well replied mrs nickleby now i will say that that is only just what i have expected of you depend upon it i said to kate only yesterday morning at breakfast that after your uncle has provided in that most ready manner for nicholas he will not leave us until he has done at least the same for you these were my very words as near as i remember kate my dear why dont you thank your  let me proceed maam pray said ralph interrupting his sisterinlaw in the full torrent of her discourse  kate my love let your uncle proceed said mrs nickleby  i am most anxious that he should mama rejoined kate  well my dear if you are anxious that he should you had better allow your uncle to say what he has to say without interruption observed mrs nickleby with many small nods and frowns your uncles time is very valuable my dear and however desirous you may beand naturally desirous as i am sure any affectionate relations who have seen so little of your uncle as we have must naturally be to protract the pleasure of having him among us still we are bound not to be selfish but to take into consideration the important nature of his occupations in the city  i am very much obliged to you maam said ralph with a scarcely perceptible sneer an absence of business habits in this family leads apparently to a great waste of words before businesswhen it does come under considerationis arrived at at all  i fear it is so indeed replied mrs nickleby with a sigh your poor brother  my poor brother maam interposed ralph tartly had no idea what business waswas unacquainted i verily believe with the very meaning of the word  i fear he was said mrs nickleby with her handkerchief to her eyes if it hadnt been for me i dont know what would have become of him  what strange creatures we are the slight bait so skilfully thrown out by ralph on their first interview was dangling on the hook yet at every small deprivation or discomfort which presented itself in the course of the fourandtwenty hours to remind her of her straitened and altered circumstances peevish visions of her dower of one thousand pounds had arisen before mrs nicklebys mind until at last she had come to persuade herself that of all her late husbands creditors she was the worst used and the most to be pitied and yet she had loved him dearly for many years and had no greater share of selfishness than is the usual lot of mortals such is the irritability of sudden poverty a decent annuity would have restored her thoughts to their old train at once  repining is of no use maam said ralph of all fruitless errands sending a tear to look after a day that is gone is the most fruitless  so it is sobbed mrs nickleby so it is  as you feel so keenly in your own purse and person the consequences of inattention to business maam said ralph i am sure you will impress upon your children the necessity of attaching themselves to it early in life  of course i must see that rejoined mrs nickleby sad experience you know brotherinlawkate my dear put that down in the next letter to nicholas or remind me to do it if i write  ralph paused for a few moments and seeing that he had now made pretty sure of the mother in case the daughter objected to his proposition went on to say  the situation that i have made interest to procure maam is withwith a milliner and dressmaker in short  a milliner cried mrs nickleby  a milliner and dressmaker maam replied ralph dressmakers in london as i need not remind you maam who are so well acquainted with all matters in the ordinary routine of life make large fortunes keep equipages and become persons of great wealth and fortune  now the first idea called up in mrs nicklebys mind by the words milliner and dressmaker were connected with certain wicker baskets lined with black oilskin which she remembered to have seen carried to and fro in the streets but as ralph proceeded these disappeared and were replaced by visions of large houses at the west end neat private carriages and a bankers book all of which images succeeded each other with such rapidity that he had no sooner finished speaking than she nodded her head and said very true with great appearance of satisfaction  what your uncle says is very true kate my dear said mrs nickleby i recollect when your poor papa and i came to town after we were married that a young lady brought me home a chip cottagebonnet with white and green trimming and green persian lining in her own carriage which drove up to the door full gallopat least i am not quite certain whether it was her own carriage or a hackney chariot but i remember very well that the horse dropped down dead as he was turning round and that your poor papa said he hadnt had any corn for a fortnight  this anecdote so strikingly illustrative of the opulence of milliners was not received with any great demonstration of feeling inasmuch as kate hung down her head while it was relating and ralph manifested very intelligible symptoms of extreme impatience  the ladys name said ralph hastily striking in is mantalinimadame mantalini i know her she lives near cavendish square if your daughter is disposed to try after the situation ill take her there directly  have you nothing to say to your uncle my love inquired mrs nickleby  a great deal replied kate but not now i would rather speak to him when we are aloneit will save his time if i thank him and say what i wish to say to him as we walk along  with these words kate hurried away to hide the traces of emotion that were stealing down her face and to prepare herself for the walk while mrs nickleby amused her brotherinlaw by giving him with many tears a detailed account of the dimensions of a rosewood cabinet piano they had possessed in their days of affluence together with a minute description of eight drawingroom chairs with turned legs and green chintz squabs to match the curtains which had cost two pounds fifteen shillings apiece and had gone at the sale for a mere nothing  these reminiscences were at length cut short by kates return in her walking dress when ralph who had been fretting and fuming during the whole time of her absence lost no time and used very little ceremony in descending into the street  now he said taking her arm walk as fast as you can and youll get into the step that youll have to walk to business with every morning so saying he led kate off at a good round pace towards cavendish square  i am very much obliged to you uncle said the young lady after they had hurried on in silence for some time very  im glad to hear it said ralph i hope youll do your duty  i will try to please uncle replied kate indeed i  dont begin to cry growled ralph i hate crying  its very foolish i know uncle began poor kate  it is replied ralph stopping her short and very affected besides let me see no more of it  perhaps this was not the best way to dry the tears of a young and sensitive female about to make her first entry on an entirely new scene of life among cold and uninterested strangers but it had its effect notwithstanding kate coloured deeply breathed quickly for a few moments and then walked on with a firmer and more determined step  it was a curious contrast to see how the timid country girl shrunk through the crowd that hurried up and down the streets giving way to the press of people and clinging closely to ralph as though she feared to lose him in the throng and how the stern and hardfeatured man of business went doggedly on elbowing the passengers aside and now and then exchanging a gruff salutation with some passing acquaintance who turned to look back upon his pretty charge with looks expressive of surprise and seemed to wonder at the illassorted companionship but it would have been a stranger contrast still to have read the hearts that were beating side by side to have laid bare the gentle innocence of the one and the rugged villainy of the other to have hung upon the guileless thoughts of the affectionate girl and been amazed that among all the wily plots and calculations of the old man there should not be one word or figure denoting thought of death or of the grave but so it was and stranger stillthough this is a thing of every daythe warm young heart palpitated with a thousand anxieties and apprehensions while that of the old worldly man lay rusting in its cell beating only as a piece of cunning mechanism and yielding no one throb of hope or fear or love or care for any living thing  uncle said kate when she judged they must be near their destination i must ask one question of you i am to live at home  at home replied ralph wheres that  i mean with my motherthe widow said kate emphatically  you will live to all intents and purposes here rejoined ralph for here you will take your meals and here you will be from morning till nightoccasionally perhaps till morning again  but at night i mean said kate i cannot leave her uncle i must have some place that i can call a home it will be wherever she is you know and may be a very humble one  may be said ralph walking faster in the impatience provoked by the remark must be you mean may be a humble one is the girl mad  the word slipped from my lips i did not mean it indeed urged kate  i hope not said ralph  but my question uncle you have not answered it  why i anticipated something of the kind said ralph andthough i object very strongly mindhave provided against it i spoke of you as an outofdoor worker so you will go to this home that may be humble every night  there was comfort in this kate poured forth many thanks for her uncles consideration which ralph received as if he had deserved them all and they arrived without any further conversation at the dressmakers door which displayed a very large plate with madame mantalinis name and occupation and was approached by a handsome flight of steps there was a shop to the house but it was let off to an importer of otto of roses madame mantalinis showsrooms were on the firstfloor a fact which was notified to the nobility and gentry by the casual exhibition near the handsomely curtained windows of two or three elegant bonnets of the newest fashion and some costly garments in the most approved taste  a liveried footman opened the door and in reply to ralphs inquiry whether madame mantalini was at home ushered them through a handsome hall and up a spacious staircase into the show saloon which comprised two spacious drawingrooms and exhibited an immense variety of superb dresses and materials for dresses some arranged on stands others laid carelessly on sofas and others again scattered over the carpet hanging on the chevalglasses or mingling in some other way with the rich furniture of various descriptions which was profusely displayed  they waited here a much longer time than was agreeable to mr ralph nickleby who eyed the gaudy frippery about him with very little concern and was at length about to pull the bell when a gentleman suddenly popped his head into the room and seeing somebody there as suddenly popped it out again  here hollo cried ralph whos that  at the sound of ralphs voice the head reappeared and the mouth displaying a very long row of very white teeth uttered in a mincing tone the words demmit what nickleby oh demmit having uttered which ejaculations the gentleman advanced and shook hands with ralph with great warmth he was dressed in a gorgeous morning gown with a waistcoat and turkish trousers of the same pattern a pink silk neckerchief and bright green slippers and had a very copious watchchain wound round his body moreover he had whiskers and a moustache both dyed black and gracefully curled  demmit you dont mean to say you want me do you demmit said this gentleman smiting ralph on the shoulder  not yet said ralph sarcastically  ha ha demmit cried the gentleman when wheeling round to laugh with greater elegance he encountered kate nickleby who was standing near  my niece said ralph  i remember said the gentleman striking his nose with the knuckle of his forefinger as a chastening for his forgetfulness demmit i remember what you come for step this way nickleby my dear will you follow me ha ha they all follow me nickleby always did demmit always  giving loose to the playfulness of his imagination after this fashion the gentleman led the way to a private sittingroom on the second floor scarcely less elegantly furnished than the apartment below where the presence of a silver coffeepot an eggshell and sloppy china for one seemed to show that he had just breakfasted  sit down my dear said the gentleman first staring miss nickleby out of countenance and then grinning in delight at the achievement this cursed high room takes ones breath away these infernal sky parloursim afraid i must move nickleby  i would by all means replied ralph looking bitterly round  what a demd rum fellow you are nickleby said the gentleman the demdest longestheaded queeresttempered old coiner of gold and silver ever wasdemmit  having complimented ralph to this effect the gentleman rang the bell and stared at miss nickleby until it was answered when he left off to bid the man desire his mistress to come directly after which he began again and left off no more until madame mantalini appeared  the dressmaker was a buxom person handsomely dressed and rather goodlooking but much older than the gentleman in the turkish trousers whom she had wedded some six months before his name was originally muntle but it had been converted by an easy transition into mantalini the lady rightly considering that an english appellation would be of serious injury to the business he had married on his whiskers upon which property he had previously subsisted in a genteel manner for some years and which he had recently improved after patient cultivation by the addition of a moustache which promised to secure him an easy independence his share in the labours of the business being at present confined to spending the money and occasionally when that ran short driving to mr ralph nickleby to procure discountat a percentagefor the customers bills  my life said mr mantalini what a demd devil of a time you have been  i didnt even know mr nickleby was here my love said madame mantalini  then what a doubly demd infernal rascal that footman must be my soul remonstrated mr mantalini  my dear said madame that is entirely your fault  my fault my hearts joy  certainly returned the lady what can you expect dearest if you will not correct the man  correct the man my souls delight  yes i am sure he wants speaking to badly enough said madame pouting  then do not vex itself said mr mantalini he shall be horsewhipped till he cries out demnebly with this promise mr mantalini kissed madame mantalini and after that performance madame mantalini pulled mr mantalini playfully by the ear which done they descended to business  now maam said ralph who had looked on at all this with such scorn as few men can express in looks this is my niece  just so mr nickleby replied madame mantalini surveying kate from head to foot and back again can you speak french child  yes maam replied kate not daring to look up for she felt that the eyes of the odious man in the dressinggown were directed towards her  like a demd native asked the husband  miss nickleby offered no reply to this inquiry but turned her back upon the questioner as if addressing herself to make answer to what his wife might demand  we keep twenty young women constantly employed in the establishment said madame  indeed maam replied kate timidly  yes and some of em demd handsome too said the master  mantalini exclaimed his wife in an awful voice  my senses idol said mantalini  do you wish to break my heart  not for twenty thousand hemispheres populated withwithwith little balletdancers replied mantalini in a poetical strain  then you will if you persevere in that mode of speaking said his wife what can mr nickleby think when he hears you  oh nothing maam nothing replied ralph i know his amiable nature and yoursmere little remarks that give a zest to your daily intercourselovers quarrels that add sweetness to those domestic joys which promise to last so longthats all thats all  if an iron door could be supposed to quarrel with its hinges and to make a firm resolution to open with slow obstinacy and grind them to powder in the process it would emit a pleasanter sound in so doing than did these words in the rough and bitter voice in which they were uttered by ralph even mr mantalini felt their influence and turning affrighted round exclaimed what a demd horrid croaking  you will pay no attention if you please to what mr mantalini says observed his wife addressing miss nickleby  i do not maam said kate with quiet contempt  mr mantalini knows nothing whatever about any of the young women continued madame looking at her husband and speaking to kate if he has seen any of them he must have seen them in the street going to or returning from their work and not here he was never even in the room i do not allow it what hours of work have you been accustomed to  i have never yet been accustomed to work at all maam replied kate in a low voice  for which reason shell work all the better now said ralph putting in a word lest this confession should injure the negotiation  i hope so returned madame mantalini our hours are from nine to nine with extra work when were very full of business for which i allow payment as overtime  kate bowed her head to intimate that she heard and was satisfied  your meals continued madame mantalini that is dinner and tea you will take here i should think your wages would average from five to seven shillings a week but i cant give you any certain information on that point until i see what you can do  kate bowed her head again  if youre ready to come said madame mantalini you had better begin on monday morning at nine exactly and miss knag the forewoman shall then have directions to try you with some easy work at first is there anything more mr nickleby  nothing more maam replied ralph rising  then i believe thats all said the lady having arrived at this natural conclusion she looked at the door as if she wished to be gone but hesitated notwithstanding as though unwilling to leave to mr mantalini the sole honour of showing them downstairs ralph relieved her from her perplexity by taking his departure without delay madame mantalini making many gracious inquiries why he never came to see them and mr mantalini anathematising the stairs with great volubility as he followed them down in the hope of inducing kate to look rounda hope however which was destined to remain ungratified  there said ralph when they got into the street now youre provided for  kate was about to thank him again but he stopped her  i had some idea he said of providing for your mother in a pleasant part of the countryhe had a presentation to some almshouses on the borders of cornwall which had occurred to him more than oncebut as you want to be together i must do something else for her she has a little money  a very little replied kate  a little will go a long way if its used sparingly said ralph she must see how long she can make it last living rent free you leave your lodgings on saturday  you told us to do so uncle  yes there is a house empty that belongs to me which i can put you into till it is let and then if nothing else turns up perhaps i shall have another you must live there  is it far from here sir inquired kate  pretty well said ralph in another quarter of the townat the east end but ill send my clerk down to you at five oclock on saturday to take you there goodbye you know your way straight on  coldly shaking his nieces hand ralph left her at the top of regent street and turned down a bythoroughfare intent on schemes of moneygetting kate walked sadly back to their lodgings in the strand    chapter 11  newman noggs inducts mrs and miss nickleby into their new dwelling in the city   miss nicklebys reflections as she wended her way homewards were of that desponding nature which the occurrences of the morning had been sufficiently calculated to awaken her uncles was not a manner likely to dispel any doubts or apprehensions she might have formed in the outset neither was the glimpse she had had of madame mantalinis establishment by any means encouraging it was with many gloomy forebodings and misgivings therefore that she looked forward with a heavy heart to the opening of her new career  if her mothers consolations could have restored her to a pleasanter and more enviable state of mind there were abundance of them to produce the effect by the time kate reached home the good lady had called to mind two authentic cases of milliners who had been possessed of considerable property though whether they had acquired it all in business or had had a capital to start with or had been lucky and married to advantage she could not exactly remember however as she very logically remarked there must have been some young person in that way of business who had made a fortune without having anything to begin with and that being taken for granted why should not kate do the same miss la creevy who was a member of the little council ventured to insinuate some doubts relative to the probability of miss nicklebys arriving at this happy consummation in the compass of an ordinary lifetime but the good lady set that question entirely at rest by informing them that she had a presentiment on the subjecta species of secondsight with which she had been in the habit of clenching every argument with the deceased mr nickleby and in nine cases and threequarters out of every ten determining it the wrong way  i am afraid it is an unhealthy occupation said miss la creevy i recollect getting three young milliners to sit to me when i first began to paint and i remember that they were all very pale and sickly  oh thats not a general rule by any means observed mrs nickleby for i remember as well as if it was only yesterday employing one that i was particularly recommended to to make me a scarlet cloak at the time when scarlet cloaks were fashionable and she had a very red facea very red face indeed  perhaps she drank suggested miss la creevy  i dont know how that may have been returned mrs nickleby but i know she had a very red face so your argument goes for nothing  in this manner and with like powerful reasoning did the worthy matron meet every little objection that presented itself to the new scheme of the morning happy mrs nickleby a project had but to be new and it came home to her mind brightly varnished and gilded as a glittering toy  this question disposed of kate communicated her uncles desire about the empty house to which mrs nickleby assented with equal readiness characteristically remarking that on the fine evenings it would be a pleasant amusement for her to walk to the west end to fetch her daughter home and no less characteristically forgetting that there were such things as wet nights and bad weather to be encountered in almost every week of the year  i shall be sorrytruly sorry to leave you my kind friend said kate on whom the good feeling of the poor miniature painter had made a deep impression  you shall not shake me off for all that replied miss la creevy with as much sprightliness as she could assume i shall see you very often and come and hear how you get on and if in all london or all the wide world besides there is no other heart that takes an interest in your welfare there will be one little lonely woman that prays for it night and day  with this the poor soul who had a heart big enough for gog the guardian genius of london and enough to spare for magog to boot after making a great many extraordinary faces which would have secured her an ample fortune could she have transferred them to ivory or canvas sat down in a corner and had what she termed a real good cry  but no crying or talking or hoping or fearing could keep off the dreaded saturday afternoon or newman noggs either who punctual to his time limped up to the door and breathed a whiff of cordial gin through the keyhole exactly as such of the church clocks in the neighbourhood as agreed among themselves about the time struck five newman waited for the last stroke and then knocked  from mr ralph nickleby said newman announcing his errand when he got upstairs with all possible brevity  we shall be ready directly said kate we have not much to carry but i fear we must have a coach  ill get one replied newman  indeed you shall not trouble yourself said mrs nickleby  i will said newman  i cant suffer you to think of such a thing said mrs nickleby  you cant help it said newman  not help it  no i thought of it as i came along but didnt get one thinking you mightnt be ready i think of a great many things nobody can prevent that  oh yes i understand you mr noggs said mrs nickleby our thoughts are free of course everybodys thoughts are their own clearly  they wouldnt be if some people had their way muttered newman  well no more they would mr noggs and thats very true rejoined mrs nickleby some people to be sure are suchhows your master  newman darted a meaning glance at kate and replied with a strong emphasis on the last word of his answer that mr ralph nickleby was well and sent his love  i am sure we are very much obliged to him observed mrs nickleby  very said newman ill tell him so  it was no very easy matter to mistake newman noggs after having once seen him and as kate attracted by the singularity of his manner in which on this occasion however there was something respectful and even delicate notwithstanding the abruptness of his speech looked at him more closely she recollected having caught a passing glimpse of that strange figure before  excuse my curiosity she said but did i not see you in the coachyard on the morning my brother went away to yorkshire  newman cast a wistful glance on mrs nickleby and said no most unblushingly  no exclaimed kate i should have said so anywhere  youd have said wrong rejoined newman its the first time ive been out for three weeks ive had the gout  newman was very very far from having the appearance of a gouty subject and so kate could not help thinking but the conference was cut short by mrs nicklebys insisting on having the door shut lest mr noggs should take cold and further persisting in sending the servant girl for a coach for fear he should bring on another attack of his disorder to both conditions newman was compelled to yield presently the coach came and after many sorrowful farewells and a great deal of running backwards and forwards across the pavement on the part of miss la creevy in the course of which the yellow turban came into violent contact with sundry footpassengers it that is to say the coach not the turban went away again with the two ladies and their luggage inside and newman despite all mrs nicklebys assurances that it would be his deathon the box beside the driver  they went into the city turning down by the river side and after a long and very slow drive the streets being crowded at that hour with vehicles of every kind stopped in front of a large old dingy house in thames street the door and windows of which were so bespattered with mud that it would have appeared to have been uninhabited for years  the door of this deserted mansion newman opened with a key which he took out of his hatin which bythebye in consequence of the dilapidated state of his pockets he deposited everything and would most likely have carried his money if he had had anyand the coach being discharged he led the way into the interior of the mansion  old and gloomy and black in truth it was and sullen and dark were the rooms once so bustling with life and enterprise there was a wharf behind opening on the thames an empty dogkennel some bones of animals fragments of iron hoops and staves of old casks lay strewn about but no life was stirring there it was a picture of cold silent decay  this house depresses and chills one said kate and seems as if some blight had fallen on it if i were superstitious i should be almost inclined to believe that some dreadful crime had been perpetrated within these old walls and that the place had never prospered since how frowning and how dark it looks  lord my dear replied mrs nickleby dont talk in that way or youll frighten me to death  it is only my foolish fancy mama said kate forcing a smile  well then my love i wish you would keep your foolish fancy to yourself and not wake up my foolish fancy to keep it company retorted mrs nickleby why didnt you think of all this beforeyou are so carelesswe might have asked miss la creevy to keep us company or borrowed a dog or a thousand thingsbut it always was the way and was just the same with your poor dear father unless i thought of everything this was mrs nicklebys usual commencement of a general lamentation running through a dozen or so of complicated sentences addressed to nobody in particular and into which she now launched until her breath was exhausted  newman appeared not to hear these remarks but preceded them to a couple of rooms on the first floor which some kind of attempt had been made to render habitable in one were a few chairs a table an old hearthrug and some faded baize and a fire was ready laid in the grate in the other stood an old tent bedstead and a few scanty articles of chamber furniture  well my dear said mrs nickleby trying to be pleased now isnt this thoughtful and considerate of your uncle why we should not have had anything but the bed we bought yesterday to lie down upon if it hadnt been for his thoughtfulness  very kind indeed replied kate looking round  newman noggs did not say that he had hunted up the old furniture they saw from attic and cellar or that he had taken in the halfpennyworth of milk for tea that stood upon a shelf or filled the rusty kettle on the hob or collected the woodchips from the wharf or begged the coals but the notion of ralph nickleby having directed it to be done tickled his fancy so much that he could not refrain from cracking all his ten fingers in succession at which performance mrs nickleby was rather startled at first but supposing it to be in some remote manner connected with the gout did not remark upon  we need detain you no longer i think said kate  is there nothing i can do asked newman  nothing thank you rejoined miss nickleby  perhaps my dear mr noggs would like to drink our healths said mrs nickleby fumbling in her reticule for some small coin  i think mama said kate hesitating and remarking newmans averted face you would hurt his feelings if you offered it  newman noggs bowing to the young lady more like a gentleman than the miserable wretch he seemed placed his hand upon his breast and pausing for a moment with the air of a man who struggles to speak but is uncertain what to say quitted the room  as the jarring echoes of the heavy housedoor closing on its latch reverberated dismally through the building kate felt half tempted to call him back and beg him to remain a little while but she was ashamed to own her fears and newman noggs was on his road homewards    chapter 12  whereby the reader will be enabled to trace the further course of miss fanny squeers love and to ascertain whether it ran smooth or otherwise   it was a fortunate circumstance for miss fanny squeers that when her worthy papa returned home on the night of the small teaparty he was what the initiated term too far gone to observe the numerous tokens of extreme vexation of spirit which were plainly visible in her countenance being however of a rather violent and quarrelsome mood in his cups it is not impossible that he might have fallen out with her either on this or some imaginary topic if the young lady had not with a foresight and prudence highly commendable kept a boy up on purpose to bear the first brunt of the good gentlemans anger which having vented itself in a variety of kicks and cuffs subsided sufficiently to admit of his being persuaded to go to bed which he did with his boots on and an umbrella under his arm  the hungry servant attended miss squeers in her own room according to custom to curl her hair perform the other little offices of her toilet and administer as much flattery as she could get up for the purpose for miss squeers was quite lazy enough and sufficiently vain and frivolous withal to have been a fine lady and it was only the arbitrary distinctions of rank and station which prevented her from being one  how lovely your hair do curl tonight miss said the handmaiden i declare if it isnt a pity and a shame to brush it out  hold your tongue replied miss squeers wrathfully  some considerable experience prevented the girl from being at all surprised at any outbreak of illtemper on the part of miss squeers having a halfperception of what had occurred in the course of the evening she changed her mode of making herself agreeable and proceeded on the indirect tack  well i couldnt help saying miss if you was to kill me for it said the attendant that i never see nobody look so vulgar as miss price this night  miss squeers sighed and composed herself to listen  i know its very wrong in me to say so miss continued the girl delighted to see the impression she was making miss price being a friend of yourn and all but she do dress herself out so and go on in such a manner to get noticed thatohwell if people only saw themselves  what do you mean phib asked miss squeers looking in her own little glass where like most of us she sawnot herself but the reflection of some pleasant image in her own brain how you talk  talk miss its enough to make a tom cat talk french grammar only to see how she tosses her head replied the handmaid  she does toss her head observed miss squeers with an air of abstraction  so vain and so veryvery plain said the girl  poor tilda sighed miss squeers compassionately  and always laying herself out so to get to be admired pursued the servant oh dear its positive indelicate  i cant allow you to talk in that way phib said miss squeers tildas friends are low people and if she dont know any better its their fault and not hers  well but you know miss said phoebe for which name phib was used as a patronising abbreviation if she was only to take copy by a friendoh if she only knew how wrong she was and would but set herself right by you what a nice young woman she might be in time  phib rejoined miss squeers with a stately air its not proper for me to hear these comparisons drawn they make tilda look a coarse improper sort of person and it seems unfriendly in me to listen to them i would rather you dropped the subject phib at the same time i must say that if tilda price would take pattern by somebodynot me particularly  oh yes you miss interposed phib  well me phib if you will have it so said miss squeers i must say that if she would she would be all the better for it  so somebody else thinks or i am much mistaken said the girl mysteriously  what do you mean demanded miss squeers  never mind miss replied the girl i know what i know thats all  phib said miss squeers dramatically i insist upon your explaining yourself what is this dark mystery speak  why if you will have it miss its this said the servant girl mr john browdie thinks as you think and if he wasnt too far gone to do it creditable hed be very glad to be off with miss price and on with miss squeers  gracious heavens exclaimed miss squeers clasping her hands with great dignity what is this  truth maam and nothing but truth replied the artful phib  what a situation cried miss squeers on the brink of unconsciously destroying the peace and happiness of my own tilda what is the reason that men fall in love with me whether i like it or not and desert their chosen intendeds for my sake  because they cant help it miss replied the girl the reasons plain if miss squeers were the reason it was very plain  never let me hear of it again retorted miss squeers never do you hear tilda price has faultsmany faultsbut i wish her well and above all i wish her married for i think it highly desirablemost desirable from the very nature of her failingsthat she should be married as soon as possible no phib let her have mr browdie i may pity him poor fellow but i have a great regard for tilda and only hope she may make a better wife than i think she will  with this effusion of feeling miss squeers went to bed  spite is a little word but it represents as strange a jumble of feelings and compound of discords as any polysyllable in the language miss squeers knew as well in her heart of hearts that what the miserable servinggirl had said was sheer coarse lying flattery as did the girl herself yet the mere opportunity of venting a little illnature against the offending miss price and affecting to compassionate her weaknesses and foibles though only in the presence of a solitary dependant was almost as great a relief to her spleen as if the whole had been gospel truth nay more we have such extraordinary powers of persuasion when they are exerted over ourselves that miss squeers felt quite highminded and great after her noble renunciation of john browdies hand and looked down upon her rival with a kind of holy calmness and tranquillity that had a mighty effect in soothing her ruffled feelings  this happy state of mind had some influence in bringing about a reconciliation for when a knock came at the frontdoor next day and the millers daughter was announced miss squeers betook herself to the parlour in a christian frame of spirit perfectly beautiful to behold  well fanny said the millers daughter you see i have come to see you although we had some words last night  i pity your bad passions tilda replied miss squeers but i bear no malice i am above it  dont be cross fanny said miss price i have come to tell you something that i know will please you  what may that be tilda demanded miss squeers screwing up her lips and looking as if nothing in earth air fire or water could afford her the slightest gleam of satisfaction  this rejoined miss price after we left here last night john and i had a dreadful quarrel  that doesnt please me said miss squeersrelaxing into a smile though  lor i wouldnt think so bad of you as to suppose it did rejoined her companion thats not it  oh said miss squeers relapsing into melancholy go on  after a great deal of wrangling and saying we would never see each other any more continued miss price we made it up and this morning john went and wrote our names down to be put up for the first time next sunday so we shall be married in three weeks and i give you notice to get your frock made  there was mingled gall and honey in this intelligence the prospect of the friends being married so soon was the gall and the certainty of her not entertaining serious designs upon nicholas was the honey upon the whole the sweet greatly preponderated over the bitter so miss squeers said she would get the frock made and that she hoped tilda might be happy though at the same time she didnt know and would not have her build too much upon it for men were strange creatures and a great many married women were very miserable and wished themselves single again with all their hearts to which condolences miss squeers added others equally calculated to raise her friends spirits and promote her cheerfulness of mind  but come now fanny said miss price i want to have a word or two with you about young mr nickleby  he is nothing to me interrupted miss squeers with hysterical symptoms i despise him too much  oh you dont mean that i am sure replied her friend confess fanny dont you like him now  without returning any direct reply miss squeers all at once fell into a paroxysm of spiteful tears and exclaimed that she was a wretched neglected miserable castaway  i hate everybody said miss squeers and i wish that everybody was deadthat i do  dear dear said miss price quite moved by this avowal of misanthropical sentiments you are not serious i am sure  yes i am rejoined miss squeers tying tight knots in her pockethandkerchief and clenching her teeth and i wish i was dead too there  oh youll think very differently in another five minutes said matilda how much better to take him into favour again than to hurt yourself by going on in that way wouldnt it be much nicer now to have him all to yourself on good terms in a companykeeping lovemaking pleasant sort of manner  i dont know but what it would sobbed miss squeers oh tilda how could you have acted so mean and dishonourable i wouldnt have believed it of you if anybody had told me  heyday exclaimed miss price giggling one would suppose i had been murdering somebody at least  very nigh as bad said miss squeers passionately  and all this because i happen to have enough of good looks to make people civil to me cried miss price persons dont make their own faces and its no more my fault if mine is a good one than it is other peoples fault if theirs is a bad one  hold your tongue shrieked miss squeers in her shrillest tone or youll make me slap you tilda and afterwards i should be sorry for it  it is needless to say that by this time the temper of each young lady was in some slight degree affected by the tone of her conversation and that a dash of personality was infused into the altercation in consequence indeed the quarrel from slight beginnings rose to a considerable height and was assuming a very violent complexion when both parties falling into a great passion of tears exclaimed simultaneously that they had never thought of being spoken to in that way which exclamation leading to a remonstrance gradually brought on an explanation and the upshot was that they fell into each others arms and vowed eternal friendship the occasion in question making the fiftysecond time of repeating the same impressive ceremony within a twelvemonth  perfect amicability being thus restored a dialogue naturally ensued upon the number and nature of the garments which would be indispensable for miss prices entrance into the holy state of matrimony when miss squeers clearly showed that a great many more than the miller could or would afford were absolutely necessary and could not decently be dispensed with the young lady then by an easy digression led the discourse to her own wardrobe and after recounting its principal beauties at some length took her friend upstairs to make inspection thereof the treasures of two drawers and a closet having been displayed and all the smaller articles tried on it was time for miss price to return home and as she had been in raptures with all the frocks and had been stricken quite dumb with admiration of a new pink scarf miss squeers said in high good humour that she would walk part of the way with her for the pleasure of her company and off they went together miss squeers dilating as they walked along upon her fathers accomplishments and multiplying his income by ten to give her friend some faint notion of the vast importance and superiority of her family  it happened that that particular time comprising the short daily interval which was suffered to elapse between what was pleasantly called the dinner of mr squeerss pupils and their return to the pursuit of useful knowledge was precisely the hour when nicholas was accustomed to issue forth for a melancholy walk and to brood as he sauntered listlessly through the village upon his miserable lot miss squeers knew this perfectly well but had perhaps forgotten it for when she caught sight of that young gentleman advancing towards them she evinced many symptoms of surprise and consternation and assured her friend that she felt fit to drop into the earth  shall we turn back or run into a cottage asked miss price he dont see us yet  no tilda replied miss squeers it is my duty to go through with it and i will  as miss squeers said this in the tone of one who has made a high moral resolution and was besides taken with one or two chokes and catchings of breath indicative of feelings at a high pressure her friend made no further remark and they bore straight down upon nicholas who walking with his eyes bent upon the ground was not aware of their approach until they were close upon him otherwise he might perhaps have taken shelter himself  goodmorning said nicholas bowing and passing by  he is going murmured miss squeers i shall choke tilda  come back mr nickleby do cried miss price affecting alarm at her friends threat but really actuated by a malicious wish to hear what nicholas would say come back mr nickleby  mr nickleby came back and looked as confused as might be as he inquired whether the ladies had any commands for him  dont stop to talk urged miss price hastily but support her on the other side how do you feel now dear  better sighed miss squeers laying a beaver bonnet of a reddish brown with a green veil attached on mr nicklebys shoulder this foolish faintness  dont call it foolish dear said miss price her bright eye dancing with merriment as she saw the perplexity of nicholas you have no reason to be ashamed of it its those who are too proud to come round again without all this todo that ought to be ashamed  you are resolved to fix it upon me i see said nicholas smiling although i told you last night it was not my fault  there he says it was not his fault my dear remarked the wicked miss price perhaps you were too jealous or too hasty with him he says it was not his fault you hear i think thats apology enough  you will not understand me said nicholas pray dispense with this jesting for i have no time and really no inclination to be the subject or promoter of mirth just now  what do you mean asked miss price affecting amazement  dont ask him tilda cried miss squeers i forgive him  dear me said nicholas as the brown bonnet went down on his shoulder again this is more serious than i supposed allow me will you have the goodness to hear me speak  here he raised up the brown bonnet and regarding with most unfeigned astonishment a look of tender reproach from miss squeers shrunk back a few paces to be out of the reach of the fair burden and went on to say  i am very sorrytruly and sincerely sorryfor having been the cause of any difference among you last night i reproach myself most bitterly for having been so unfortunate as to cause the dissension that occurred although i did so i assure you most unwittingly and heedlessly  well thats not all you have got to say surely exclaimed miss price as nicholas paused  i fear there is something more stammered nicholas with a halfsmile and looking towards miss squeers it is a most awkward thing to saybutthe very mention of such a supposition makes one look like a puppystillmay i ask if that lady supposes that i entertain anyin short does she think that i am in love with her  delightful embarrassment thought miss squeers i have brought him to it at last answer for me dear she whispered to her friend  does she think so rejoined miss price of course she does  she does exclaimed nicholas with such energy of utterance as might have been for the moment mistaken for rapture  certainly replied miss price  if mr nickleby has doubted that tilda said the blushing miss squeers in soft accents he may set his mind at rest his sentiments are recipro  stop cried nicholas hurriedly pray hear me this is the grossest and wildest delusion the completest and most signal mistake that ever human being laboured under or committed i have scarcely seen the young lady halfadozen times but if i had seen her sixty times or am destined to see her sixty thousand it would be and will be precisely the same i have not one thought wish or hope connected with her unless it beand i say this not to hurt her feelings but to impress her with the real state of my ownunless it be the one object dear to my heart as life itself of being one day able to turn my back upon this accursed place never to set foot in it again or think of iteven think of itbut with loathing and disgust  with this particularly plain and straightforward declaration which he made with all the vehemence that his indignant and excited feelings could bring to bear upon it nicholas waiting to hear no more retreated  but poor miss squeers her anger rage and vexation the rapid succession of bitter and passionate feelings that whirled through her mind are not to be described refused refused by a teacher picked up by advertisement at an annual salary of five pounds payable at indefinite periods and found in food and lodging like the very boys themselves and this too in the presence of a little chit of a millers daughter of eighteen who was going to be married in three weeks time to a man who had gone down on his very knees to ask her she could have choked in right good earnest at the thought of being so humbled  but there was one thing clear in the midst of her mortification and that was that she hated and detested nicholas with all the narrowness of mind and littleness of purpose worthy a descendant of the house of squeers and there was one comfort too and that was that every hour in every day she could wound his pride and goad him with the infliction of some slight or insult or deprivation which could not but have some effect on the most insensible person and must be acutely felt by one so sensitive as nicholas with these two reflections uppermost in her mind miss squeers made the best of the matter to her friend by observing that mr nickleby was such an odd creature and of such a violent temper that she feared she should be obliged to give him up and parted from her  and here it may be remarked that miss squeers having bestowed her affections or whatever it might be that in the absence of anything better represented them on nicholas nickleby had never once seriously contemplated the possibility of his being of a different opinion from herself in the business miss squeers reasoned that she was prepossessing and beautiful and that her father was master and nicholas man and that her father had saved money and nicholas had none all of which seemed to her conclusive arguments why the young man should feel only too much honoured by her preference she had not failed to recollect either how much more agreeable she could render his situation if she were his friend and how much more disagreeable if she were his enemy and doubtless many less scrupulous young gentlemen than nicholas would have encouraged her extravagance had it been only for this very obvious and intelligible reason however he had thought proper to do otherwise and miss squeers was outrageous  let him see said the irritated young lady when she had regained her own room and eased her mind by committing an assault on phib if i dont set mother against him a little more when she comes back  it was scarcely necessary to do this but miss squeers was as good as her word and poor nicholas in addition to bad food dirty lodging and the being compelled to witness one dull unvarying round of squalid misery was treated with every special indignity that malice could suggest or the most grasping cupidity put upon him  nor was this all there was another and deeper system of annoyance which made his heart sink and nearly drove him wild by its injustice and cruelty  the wretched creature smike since the night nicholas had spoken kindly to him in the schoolroom had followed him to and fro with an everrestless desire to serve or help him anticipating such little wants as his humble ability could supply and content only to be near him he would sit beside him for hours looking patiently into his face and a word would brighten up his careworn visage and call into it a passing gleam even of happiness he was an altered being he had an object now and that object was to show his attachment to the only personthat person a strangerwho had treated him not to say with kindness but like a human creature  upon this poor being all the spleen and illhumour that could not be vented on nicholas were unceasingly bestowed drudgery would have been nothingsmike was well used to that buffetings inflicted without cause would have been equally a matter of course for to them also he had served a long and weary apprenticeship but it was no sooner observed that he had become attached to nicholas than stripes and blows stripes and blows morning noon and night were his only portion squeers was jealous of the influence which his man had so soon acquired and his family hated him and smike paid for both nicholas saw it and ground his teeth at every repetition of the savage and cowardly attack  he had arranged a few regular lessons for the boys and one night as he paced up and down the dismal schoolroom his swollen heart almost bursting to think that his protection and countenance should have increased the misery of the wretched being whose peculiar destitution had awakened his pity he paused mechanically in a dark corner where sat the object of his thoughts  the poor soul was poring hard over a tattered book with the traces of recent tears still upon his face vainly endeavouring to master some task which a child of nine years old possessed of ordinary powers could have conquered with ease but which to the addled brain of the crushed boy of nineteen was a sealed and hopeless mystery yet there he sat patiently conning the page again and again stimulated by no boyish ambition for he was the common jest and scoff even of the uncouth objects that congregated about him but inspired by the one eager desire to please his solitary friend  nicholas laid his hand upon his shoulder  i cant do it said the dejected creature looking up with bitter disappointment in every feature no no  do not try replied nicholas  the boy shook his head and closing the book with a sigh looked vacantly round and laid his head upon his arm he was weeping  do not for gods sake said nicholas in an agitated voice i cannot bear to see you  they are more hard with me than ever sobbed the boy  i know it rejoined nicholas they are  but for you said the outcast i should die they would kill me they would i know they would  you will do better poor fellow replied nicholas shaking his head mournfully when i am gone  gone cried the other looking intently in his face  softly rejoined nicholas yes  are you going demanded the boy in an earnest whisper  i cannot say replied nicholas i was speaking more to my own thoughts than to you  tell me said the boy imploringly oh do tell me will you gowill you  i shall be driven to that at last said nicholas the world is before me after all  tell me urged smike is the world as bad and dismal as this place  heaven forbid replied nicholas pursuing the train of his own thoughts its hardest coarsest toil were happiness to this  should i ever meet you there demanded the boy speaking with unusual wildness and volubility  yes replied nicholas willing to soothe him  no no said the other clasping him by the hand should ishould itell me that again say i should be sure to find you  you would replied nicholas with the same humane intention and i would help and aid you and not bring fresh sorrow on you as i have done here  the boy caught both the young mans hands passionately in his and hugging them to his breast uttered a few broken sounds which were unintelligible squeers entered at the moment and he shrunk back into his old corner    chapter 13  nicholas varies the monotony of dothebys hall by a most vigorous and remarkable proceeding which leads to consequences of some importance   the cold feeble dawn of a january morning was stealing in at the windows of the common sleepingroom when nicholas raising himself on his arm looked among the prostrate forms which on every side surrounded him as though in search of some particular object  it needed a quick eye to detect from among the huddled mass of sleepers the form of any given individual as they lay closely packed together covered for warmths sake with their patched and ragged clothes little could be distinguished but the sharp outlines of pale faces over which the sombre light shed the same dull heavy colour with here and there a gaunt arm thrust forth its thinness hidden by no covering but fully exposed to view in all its shrunken ugliness there were some who lying on their backs with upturned faces and clenched hands just visible in the leaden light bore more the aspect of dead bodies than of living creatures and there were others coiled up into strange and fantastic postures such as might have been taken for the uneasy efforts of pain to gain some temporary relief rather than the freaks of slumber a fewand these were among the youngest of the childrenslept peacefully on with smiles upon their faces dreaming perhaps of home but ever and again a deep and heavy sigh breaking the stillness of the room announced that some new sleeper had awakened to the misery of another day and as morning took the place of night the smiles gradually faded away with the friendly darkness which had given them birth  dreams are the bright creatures of poem and legend who sport on earth in the night season and melt away in the first beam of the sun which lights grim care and stern reality on their daily pilgrimage through the world  nicholas looked upon the sleepers at first with the air of one who gazes upon a scene which though familiar to him has lost none of its sorrowful effect in consequence and afterwards with a more intense and searching scrutiny as a man would who missed something his eye was accustomed to meet and had expected to rest upon he was still occupied in this search and had half risen from his bed in the eagerness of his quest when the voice of squeers was heard calling from the bottom of the stairs  now then cried that gentleman are you going to sleep all day up there  you lazy hounds added mrs squeers finishing the sentence and producing at the same time a sharp sound like that which is occasioned by the lacing of stays  we shall be down directly sir replied nicholas  down directly said squeers ah you had better be down directly or ill be down upon some of you in less wheres that smike  nicholas looked hurriedly round again but made no answer  smike shouted squeers  do you want your head broke in a fresh place smike demanded his amiable lady in the same key  still there was no reply and still nicholas stared about him as did the greater part of the boys who were by this time roused  confound his impudence muttered squeers rapping the stairrail impatiently with his cane nickleby  well sir  send that obstinate scoundrel down dont you hear me calling  he is not here sir replied nicholas  dont tell me a lie retorted the schoolmaster he is  he is not retorted nicholas angrily dont tell me one  we shall soon see that said mr squeers rushing upstairs ill find him i warrant you  with which assurance mr squeers bounced into the dormitory and swinging his cane in the air ready for a blow darted into the corner where the lean body of the drudge was usually stretched at night the cane descended harmlessly upon the ground there was nobody there  what does this mean said squeers turning round with a very pale face where have you hid him  i have seen nothing of him since last night replied nicholas  come said squeers evidently frightened though he endeavoured to look otherwise you wont save him this way where is he  at the bottom of the nearest pond for aught i know rejoined nicholas in a low voice and fixing his eyes full on the masters face  damn you what do you mean by that retorted squeers in great perturbation without waiting for a reply he inquired of the boys whether any one among them knew anything of their missing schoolmate  there was a general hum of anxious denial in the midst of which one shrill voice was heard to say as indeed everybody thought  please sir i think smikes run away sir  ha cried squeers turning sharp round who said that  tomkins please sir rejoined a chorus of voices mr squeers made a plunge into the crowd and at one dive caught a very little boy habited still in his nightgear and the perplexed expression of whose countenance as he was brought forward seemed to intimate that he was as yet uncertain whether he was about to be punished or rewarded for the suggestion he was not long in doubt  you think he has run away do you sir demanded squeers  yes please sir replied the little boy  and what sir said squeers catching the little boy suddenly by the arms and whisking up his drapery in a most dexterous manner what reason have you to suppose that any boy would want to run away from this establishment eh sir  the child raised a dismal cry by way of answer and mr squeers throwing himself into the most favourable attitude for exercising his strength beat him until the little urchin in his writhings actually rolled out of his hands when he mercifully allowed him to roll away as he best could  there said squeers now if any other boy thinks smike has run away i shall be glad to have a talk with him  there was of course a profound silence during which nicholas showed his disgust as plainly as looks could show it  well nickleby said squeers eyeing him maliciously you think he has run away i suppose  i think it extremely likely replied nicholas in a quiet manner  oh you do do you sneered squeers maybe you know he has  i know nothing of the kind  he didnt tell you he was going i suppose did he sneered squeers  he did not replied nicholas i am very glad he did not for it would then have been my duty to have warned you in time  which no doubt you would have been devilish sorry to do said squeers in a taunting fashion  i should indeed replied nicholas you interpret my feelings with great accuracy  mrs squeers had listened to this conversation from the bottom of the stairs but now losing all patience she hastily assumed her nightjacket and made her way to the scene of action  whats all this here todo said the lady as the boys fell off right and left to save her the trouble of clearing a passage with her brawny arms what on earth are you a talking to him for squeery  why my dear said squeers the fact is that smike is not to be found  well i know that said the lady and wheres the wonder if you get a parcel of proudstomached teachers that set the young dogs a rebelling what else can you look for now young man you just have the kindness to take yourself off to the schoolroom and take the boys off with you and dont you stir out of there till you have leave given you or you and i may fall out in a way thatll spoil your beauty handsome as you think yourself and so i tell you  indeed said nicholas  yes and indeed and indeed again mister jackanapes said the excited lady and i wouldnt keep such as you in the house another hour if i had my way  nor would you if i had mine replied nicholas now boys  ah now boys said mrs squeers mimicking as nearly as she could the voice and manner of the usher follow your leader boys and take pattern by smike if you dare see what hell get for himself when he is brought back and mind i tell you that you shall have as bad and twice as bad if you so much as open your mouths about him  if i catch him said squeers ill only stop short of flaying him alive i give you notice boys  if you catch him retorted mrs squeers contemptuously you are sure to you cant help it if you go the right way to work come away with you  with these words mrs squeers dismissed the boys and after a little light skirmishing with those in the rear who were pressing forward to get out of the way but were detained for a few moments by the throng in front succeeded in clearing the room when she confronted her spouse alone  he is off said mrs squeers the cowhouse and stable are locked up so he cant be there and hes not downstairs anywhere for the girl has looked he must have gone york way and by a public road too  why must he inquired squeers  stupid said mrs squeers angrily he hadnt any money had he  never had a penny of his own in his whole life that i know of replied squeers  to be sure rejoined mrs squeers and he didnt take anything to eat with him that ill answer for ha ha ha  ha ha ha laughed squeers  then of course said mrs s he must beg his way and he could do that nowhere but on the public road  thats true exclaimed squeers clapping his hands  true yes but you would never have thought of it for all that if i hadnt said so replied his wife now if you take the chaise and go one road and i borrow swallows chaise and go the other what with keeping our eyes open and asking questions one or other of us is pretty certain to lay hold of him  the worthy ladys plan was adopted and put in execution without a moments delay after a very hasty breakfast and the prosecution of some inquiries in the village the result of which seemed to show that he was on the right track squeers started forth in the ponychaise intent upon discovery and vengeance shortly afterwards mrs squeers arrayed in the white topcoat and tied up in various shawls and handkerchiefs issued forth in another chaise and another direction taking with her a goodsized bludgeon several odd pieces of strong cord and a stout labouring man all provided and carried upon the expedition with the sole object of assisting in the capture and once caught insuring the safe custody of the unfortunate smike  nicholas remained behind in a tumult of feeling sensible that whatever might be the upshot of the boys flight nothing but painful and deplorable consequences were likely to ensue from it death from want and exposure to the weather was the best that could be expected from the protracted wandering of so poor and helpless a creature alone and unfriended through a country of which he was wholly ignorant there was little perhaps to choose between this fate and a return to the tender mercies of the yorkshire school but the unhappy being had established a hold upon his sympathy and compassion which made his heart ache at the prospect of the suffering he was destined to undergo he lingered on in restless anxiety picturing a thousand possibilities until the evening of next day when squeers returned alone and unsuccessful  no news of the scamp said the schoolmaster who had evidently been stretching his legs on the old principle not a few times during the journey ill have consolation for this out of somebody nickleby if mrs squeers dont hunt him down so i give you warning  it is not in my power to console you sir said nicholas it is nothing to me  isnt it said squeers in a threatening manner we shall see  we shall rejoined nicholas  heres the pony run right off his legs and me obliged to come home with a hack cob thatll cost fifteen shillings besides other expenses said squeers whos to pay for that do you hear  nicholas shrugged his shoulders and remained silent  ill have it out of somebody i tell you said squeers his usual harsh crafty manner changed to open bullying none of your whining vapourings here mr puppy but be off to your kennel for its past your bedtime come get out  nicholas bit his lip and knit his hands involuntarily for his fingerends tingled to avenge the insult but remembering that the man was drunk and that it could come to little but a noisy brawl he contented himself with darting a contemptuous look at the tyrant and walked as majestically as he could upstairs not a little nettled however to observe that miss squeers and master squeers and the servant girl were enjoying the scene from a snug corner the two former indulging in many edifying remarks about the presumption of poor upstarts which occasioned a vast deal of laughter in which even the most miserable of all miserable servant girls joined while nicholas stung to the quick drew over his head such bedclothes as he had and sternly resolved that the outstanding account between himself and mr squeers should be settled rather more speedily than the latter anticipated  another day came and nicholas was scarcely awake when he heard the wheels of a chaise approaching the house it stopped the voice of mrs squeers was heard and in exultation ordering a glass of spirits for somebody which was in itself a sufficient sign that something extraordinary had happened nicholas hardly dared to look out of the window but he did so and the very first object that met his eyes was the wretched smike so bedabbled with mud and rain so haggard and worn and wild that but for his garments being such as no scarecrow was ever seen to wear he might have been doubtful even then of his identity  lift him out said squeers after he had literally feasted his eyes in silence upon the culprit bring him in bring him in  take care cried mrs squeers as her husband proffered his assistance we tied his legs under the apron and madeem fast to the chaise to prevent his giving us the slip again  with hands trembling with delight squeers unloosened the cord and smike to all appearance more dead than alive was brought into the house and securely locked up in a cellar until such time as mr squeers should deem it expedient to operate upon him in presence of the assembled school  upon a hasty consideration of the circumstances it may be matter of surprise to some persons that mr and mrs squeers should have taken so much trouble to repossess themselves of an incumbrance of which it was their wont to complain so loudly but their surprise will cease when they are informed that the manifold services of the drudge if performed by anybody else would have cost the establishment some ten or twelve shillings per week in the shape of wages and furthermore that all runaways were as a matter of policy made severe examples of at dotheboys hall inasmuch as in consequence of the limited extent of its attractions there was but little inducement beyond the powerful impulse of fear for any pupil provided with the usual number of legs and the power of using them to remain  the news that smike had been caught and brought back in triumph ran like wildfire through the hungry community and expectation was on tiptoe all the morning on tiptoe it was destined to remain however until afternoon when squeers having refreshed himself with his dinner and further strengthened himself by an extra libation or so made his appearance accompanied by his amiable partner with a countenance of portentous import and a fearful instrument of flagellation strong supple waxended and newin short purchased that morning expressly for the occasion  is every boy here asked squeers in a tremendous voice  every boy was there but every boy was afraid to speak so squeers glared along the lines to assure himself and every eye drooped and every head cowered down as he did so  each boy keep his place said squeers administering his favourite blow to the desk and regarding with gloomy satisfaction the universal start which it never failed to occasion nickleby to your desk sir  it was remarked by more than one small observer that there was a very curious and unusual expression in the ushers face but he took his seat without opening his lips in reply squeers casting a triumphant glance at his assistant and a look of most comprehensive despotism on the boys left the room and shortly afterwards returned dragging smike by the collaror rather by that fragment of his jacket which was nearest the place where his collar would have been had he boasted such a decoration  in any other place the appearance of the wretched jaded spiritless object would have occasioned a murmur of compassion and remonstrance it had some effect even there for the lookerson moved uneasily in their seats and a few of the boldest ventured to steal looks at each other expressive of indignation and pity  they were lost on squeers however whose gaze was fastened on the luckless smike as he inquired according to custom in such cases whether he had anything to say for himself  nothing i suppose said squeers with a diabolical grin  smike glanced round and his eye rested for an instant on nicholas as if he had expected him to intercede but his look was riveted on his desk  have you anything to say demanded squeers again giving his right arm two or three flourishes to try its power and suppleness stand a little out of the way mrs squeers my dear ive hardly got room enough  spare me sir cried smike  oh thats all is it said squeers yes ill flog you within an inch of your life and spare you that  ha ha ha laughed mrs squeers thats a good un  i was driven to do it said smike faintly and casting another imploring look about him  driven to do it were you said squeers oh it wasnt your fault it was mine i supposeeh  a nasty ungrateful pigheaded brutish obstinate sneaking dog exclaimed mrs squeers taking smikes head under her arm and administering a cuff at every epithet what does he mean by that  stand aside my dear replied squeers well try and find out  mrs squeers being out of breath with her exertions complied squeers caught the boy firmly in his grip one desperate cut had fallen on his bodyhe was wincing from the lash and uttering a scream of painit was raised again and again about to fallwhen nicholas nickleby suddenly starting up cried stop in a voice that made the rafters ring  who cried stop said squeers turning savagely round  i said nicholas stepping forward this must not go on  must not go on cried squeers almost in a shriek  no thundered nicholas  aghast and stupefied by the boldness of the interference squeers released his hold of smike and falling back a pace or two gazed upon nicholas with looks that were positively frightful  i say must not repeated nicholas nothing daunted shall not i will prevent it  squeers continued to gaze upon him with his eyes starting out of his head but astonishment had actually for the moment bereft him of speech  you have disregarded all my quiet interference in the miserable lads behalf said nicholas you have returned no answer to the letter in which i begged forgiveness for him and offered to be responsible that he would remain quietly here dont blame me for this public interference you have brought it upon yourself not i  sit down beggar screamed squeers almost beside himself with rage and seizing smike as he spoke  wretch rejoined nicholas fiercely touch him at your peril i will not stand by and see it done my blood is up and i have the strength of ten such men as you look to yourself for by heaven i will not spare you if you drive me on  stand back cried squeers brandishing his weapon  i have a long series of insults to avenge said nicholas flushed with passion and my indignation is aggravated by the dastardly cruelties practised on helpless infancy in this foul den have a care for if you do raise the devil within me the consequences shall fall heavily upon your own head  he had scarcely spoken when squeers in a violent outbreak of wrath and with a cry like the howl of a wild beast spat upon him and struck him a blow across the face with his instrument of torture which raised up a bar of livid flesh as it was inflicted smarting with the agony of the blow and concentrating into that one moment all his feelings of rage scorn and indignation nicholas sprang upon him wrested the weapon from his hand and pinning him by the throat beat the ruffian till he roared for mercy  the boyswith the exception of master squeers who coming to his fathers assistance harassed the enemy in the rearmoved not hand or foot but mrs squeers with many shrieks for aid hung on to the tail of her partners coat and endeavoured to drag him from his infuriated adversary while miss squeers who had been peeping through the keyhole in expectation of a very different scene darted in at the very beginning of the attack and after launching a shower of inkstands at the ushers head beat nicholas to her hearts content animating herself at every blow with the recollection of his having refused her proffered love and thus imparting additional strength to an arm which as she took after her mother in this respect was at no time one of the weakest  nicholas in the full torrent of his violence felt the blows no more than if they had been dealt with feathers but becoming tired of the noise and uproar and feeling that his arm grew weak besides he threw all his remaining strength into halfadozen finishing cuts and flung squeers from him with all the force he could muster the violence of his fall precipitated mrs squeers completely over an adjacent form and squeers striking his head against it in his descent lay at his full length on the ground stunned and motionless  having brought affairs to this happy termination and ascertained to his thorough satisfaction that squeers was only stunned and not dead upon which point he had had some unpleasant doubts at first nicholas left his family to restore him and retired to consider what course he had better adopt he looked anxiously round for smike as he left the room but he was nowhere to be seen  after a brief consideration he packed up a few clothes in a small leathern valise and finding that nobody offered to oppose his progress marched boldly out by the frontdoor and shortly afterwards struck into the road which led to greta bridge  when he had cooled sufficiently to be enabled to give his present circumstances some little reflection they did not appear in a very encouraging light he had only four shillings and a few pence in his pocket and was something more than two hundred and fifty miles from london whither he resolved to direct his steps that he might ascertain among other things what account of the mornings proceedings mr squeers transmitted to his most affectionate uncle  lifting up his eyes as he arrived at the conclusion that there was no remedy for this unfortunate state of things he beheld a horseman coming towards him whom on nearer approach he discovered to his infinite chagrin to be no other than mr john browdie who clad in cords and leather leggings was urging his animal forward by means of a thick ash stick which seemed to have been recently cut from some stout sapling  i am in no mood for more noise and riot thought nicholas and yet do what i will i shall have an altercation with this honest blockhead and perhaps a blow or two from yonder staff  in truth there appeared some reason to expect that such a result would follow from the encounter for john browdie no sooner saw nicholas advancing than he reined in his horse by the footpath and waited until such time as he should come up looking meanwhile very sternly between the horses ears at nicholas as he came on at his leisure  servant young genelman said john  yours said nicholas  weel we ha met at last observed john making the stirrup ring under a smart touch of the ash stick  yes replied nicholas hesitating come he said frankly after a moments pause we parted on no very good terms the last time we met it was my fault i believe but i had no intention of offending you and no idea that i was doing so i was very sorry for it afterwards will you shake hands  shake honds cried the goodhumoured yorkshireman ah that i weel at the same time he bent down from the saddle and gave nicholass fist a huge wrench but waat be the matther wi thy feace mun it be all brokken loike  it is a cut said nicholas turning scarlet as he spokea blow but i returned it to the giver and with good interest too  noa did ee though exclaimed john browdie well deane i loike un for thot  the fact is said nicholas not very well knowing how to make the avowal the fact is that i have been illtreated  noa interposed john browdie in a tone of compassion for he was a giant in strength and stature and nicholas very likely in his eyes seemed a mere dwarf deant say thot  yes i have replied nicholas by that man squeers and i have beaten him soundly and am leaving this place in consequence  what cried john browdie with such an ecstatic shout that the horse quite shied at it beatten the schoolmeasther ho ho ho beatten the schoolmeasther who ever heard o the loike o that noo giv us thee hond agean yoongster beatten the schoolmeasther dang it i loov thee fort  with these expressions of delight john browdie laughed and laughed againso loud that the echoes far and wide sent back nothing but jovial peals of merrimentand shook nicholas by the hand meanwhile no less heartily when his mirth had subsided he inquired what nicholas meant to do on his informing him to go straight to london he shook his head doubtfully and inquired if he knew how much the coaches charged to carry passengers so far  no i do not said nicholas but it is of no great consequence to me for i intend walking  gang awa to lunnun afoot cried john in amazement  every step of the way replied nicholas i should be many steps further on by this time and so goodbye  nay noo replied the honest countryman reining in his impatient horse stan still tellee hoo much cash hast thee gotten  not much said nicholas colouring but i can make it enough where theres a will theres a way you know  john browdie made no verbal answer to this remark but putting his hand in his pocket pulled out an old purse of solid leather and insisted that nicholas should borrow from him whatever he required for his present necessities  deant be afeard mun he said tak eneaf to carry thee whoam theelt pay me yan day a warrant  nicholas could by no means be prevailed upon to borrow more than a sovereign with which loan mr browdie after many entreaties that he would accept of more observing with a touch of yorkshire caution that if he didnt spend it all he could put the surplus by till he had an opportunity of remitting it carriage free was fain to content himself  tak that bit o timber to help thee on wi mun he added pressing his stick on nicholas and giving his hand another squeeze keep a good heart and bless thee beatten the schoolmeasther cod its the best thing ave heerd this twonty year  so saying and indulging with more delicacy than might have been expected from him in another series of loud laughs for the purpose of avoiding the thanks which nicholas poured forth john browdie set spurs to his horse and went off at a smart canter looking back from time to time as nicholas stood gazing after him and waving his hand cheerily as if to encourage him on his way nicholas watched the horse and rider until they disappeared over the brow of a distant hill and then set forward on his journey  he did not travel far that afternoon for by this time it was nearly dark and there had been a heavy fall of snow which not only rendered the way toilsome but the track uncertain and difficult to find after daylight save by experienced wayfarers he lay that night at a cottage where beds were let at a cheap rate to the more humble class of travellers and rising betimes next morning made his way before night to boroughbridge passing through that town in search of some cheap restingplace he stumbled upon an empty barn within a couple of hundred yards of the roadside in a warm corner of which he stretched his weary limbs and soon fell asleep  when he awoke next morning and tried to recollect his dreams which had been all connected with his recent sojourn at dotheboys hall he sat up rubbed his eyes and starednot with the most composed countenance possibleat some motionless object which seemed to be stationed within a few yards in front of him  strange cried nicholas can this be some lingering creation of the visions that have scarcely left me it cannot be realand yet ii am awake smike  the form moved rose advanced and dropped upon its knees at his feet it was smike indeed  why do you kneel to me said nicholas hastily raising him  to go with youanywhereeverywhereto the worlds endto the churchyard grave replied smike clinging to his hand let me oh do let me you are my homemy kind friendtake me with you pray  i am a friend who can do little for you said nicholas kindly how came you here  he had followed him it seemed had never lost sight of him all the way had watched while he slept and when he halted for refreshment and had feared to appear before lest he should be sent back he had not intended to appear now but nicholas had awakened more suddenly than he looked for and he had had no time to conceal himself  poor fellow said nicholas your hard fate denies you any friend but one and he is nearly as poor and helpless as yourself  may imay i go with you asked smike timidly i will be your faithful hardworking servant i will indeed i want no clothes added the poor creature drawing his rags together these will do very well i only want to be near you  and you shall cried nicholas and the world shall deal by you as it does by me till one or both of us shall quit it for a better come  with these words he strapped his burden on his shoulders and taking his stick in one hand extended the other to his delighted charge and so they passed out of the old barn together    chapter 14  having the misfortune to treat of none but common people is necessarily of a mean and vulgar character   in that quarter of london in which golden square is situated there is a bygone faded tumbledown street with two irregular rows of tall meagre houses which seem to have stared each other out of countenance years ago the very chimneys appear to have grown dismal and melancholy from having had nothing better to look at than the chimneys over the way their tops are battered and broken and blackened with smoke and here and there some taller stack than the rest inclining heavily to one side and toppling over the roof seems to meditate taking revenge for half a centurys neglect by crushing the inhabitants of the garrets beneath  the fowls who peck about the kennels jerking their bodies hither and thither with a gait which none but town fowls are ever seen to adopt and which any country cock or hen would be puzzled to understand are perfectly in keeping with the crazy habitations of their owners dingy illplumed drowsy flutterers sent like many of the neighbouring children to get a livelihood in the streets they hop from stone to stone in forlorn search of some hidden eatable in the mud and can scarcely raise a crow among them the only one with anything approaching to a voice is an aged bantam at the bakers and even he is hoarse in consequence of bad living in his last place  to judge from the size of the houses they have been at one time tenanted by persons of better condition than their present occupants but they are now let off by the week in floors or rooms and every door has almost as many plates or bellhandles as there are apartments within the windows are for the same reason sufficiently diversified in appearance being ornamented with every variety of common blind and curtain that can easily be imagined while every doorway is blocked up and rendered nearly impassable by a motley collection of children and porter pots of all sizes from the baby in arms and the halfpint pot to the fullgrown girl and halfgallon can  in the parlour of one of these houses which was perhaps a thought dirtier than any of its neighbours which exhibited more bellhandles children and porter pots and caught in all its freshness the first gust of the thick black smoke that poured forth night and day from a large brewery hard by hung a bill announcing that there was yet one room to let within its walls though on what story the vacant room could beregard being had to the outward tokens of many lodgers which the whole front displayed from the mangle in the kitchen window to the flowerpots on the parapetit would have been beyond the power of a calculating boy to discover  the common stairs of this mansion were bare and carpetless but a curious visitor who had to climb his way to the top might have observed that there were not wanting indications of the progressive poverty of the inmates although their rooms were shut thus the firstfloor lodgers being flush of furniture kept an old mahogany tablereal mahoganyon the landingplace outside which was only taken in when occasion required on the second story the spare furniture dwindled down to a couple of old deal chairs of which one belonging to the backroom was shorn of a leg and bottomless the story above boasted no greater excess than a wormeaten washtub and the garret landingplace displayed no costlier articles than two crippled pitchers and some broken blackingbottles  it was on this garret landingplace that a hardfeatured squarefaced man elderly and shabby stopped to unlock the door of the front attic into which having surmounted the task of turning the rusty key in its still more rusty wards he walked with the air of legal owner  this person wore a wig of short coarse red hair which he took off with his hat and hung upon a nail having adopted in its place a dirty cotton nightcap and groped about in the dark till he found a remnant of candle he knocked at the partition which divided the two garrets and inquired in a loud voice whether mr noggs had a light  the sounds that came back were stifled by the lath and plaster and it seemed moreover as though the speaker had uttered them from the interior of a mug or other drinking vessel but they were in the voice of newman and conveyed a reply in the affirmative  a nasty night mr noggs said the man in the nightcap stepping in to light his candle  does it rain asked newman  does it replied the other pettishly i am wet through  it doesnt take much to wet you and me through mr crowl said newman laying his hand upon the lappel of his threadbare coat  well and that makes it the more vexatious observed mr crowl in the same pettish tone  uttering a low querulous growl the speaker whose harsh countenance was the very epitome of selfishness raked the scanty fire nearly out of the grate and emptying the glass which noggs had pushed towards him inquired where he kept his coals  newman noggs pointed to the bottom of a cupboard and mr crowl seizing the shovel threw on half the stock which noggs very deliberately took off again without saying a word  you have not turned saving at this time of day i hope said crowl  newman pointed to the empty glass as though it were a sufficient refutation of the charge and briefly said that he was going downstairs to supper  to the kenwigses asked crowl  newman nodded assent  think of that now said crowl if i didntthinking that you were certain not to go because you said you wouldnttell kenwigs i couldnt come and make up my mind to spend the evening with you  i was obliged to go said newman they would have me  well but whats to become of me urged the selfish man who never thought of anybody else its all your fault ill tell you whatill sit by your fire till you come back again  newman cast a despairing glance at his small store of fuel but not having the courage to say noa word which in all his life he never had said at the right time either to himself or anyone elsegave way to the proposed arrangement mr crowl immediately went about making himself as comfortable with newman noggs means as circumstances would admit of his being made  the lodgers to whom crowl had made allusion under the designation of the kenwigses were the wife and olive branches of one mr kenwigs a turner in ivory who was looked upon as a person of some consideration on the premises inasmuch as he occupied the whole of the first floor comprising a suite of two rooms mrs kenwigs too was quite a lady in her manners and of a very genteel family having an uncle who collected a waterrate besides which distinction the two eldest of her little girls went twice a week to a dancing school in the neighbourhood and had flaxen hair tied with blue ribbons hanging in luxuriant pigtails down their backs and wore little white trousers with frills round the anklesfor all of which reasons and many more equally valid but too numerous to mention mrs kenwigs was considered a very desirable person to know and was the constant theme of all the gossips in the street and even three or four doors round the corner at both ends  it was the anniversary of that happy day on which the church of england as by law established had bestowed mrs kenwigs upon mr kenwigs and in grateful commemoration of the same mrs kenwigs had invited a few select friends to cards and a supper in the first floor and had put on a new gown to receive them in which gown being of a flaming colour and made upon a juvenile principle was so successful that mr kenwigs said the eight years of matrimony and the five children seemed all a dream and mrs kenwigs younger and more blooming than on the very first sunday he had kept company with her  beautiful as mrs kenwigs looked when she was dressed though and so stately that you would have supposed she had a cook and housemaid at least and nothing to do but order them about she had a world of trouble with the preparations more indeed than she being of a delicate and genteel constitution could have sustained had not the pride of housewifery upheld her at last however all the things that had to be got together were got together and all the things that had to be got out of the way were got out of the way and everything was ready and the collector himself having promised to come fortune smiled upon the occasion  the party was admirably selected there were first of all mr kenwigs and mrs kenwigs and four olive kenwigses who sat up to supper firstly because it was but right that they should have a treat on such a day and secondly because their going to bed in presence of the company would have been inconvenient not to say improper then there was a young lady who had made mrs kenwigss dress and whoit was the most convenient thing in the worldliving in the twopair back gave up her bed to the baby and got a little girl to watch it then to match this young lady was a young man who had known mr kenwigs when he was a bachelor and was much esteemed by the ladies as bearing the reputation of a rake to these were added a newlymarried couple who had visited mr and mrs kenwigs in their courtship and a sister of mrs kenwigss who was quite a beauty besides whom there was another young man supposed to entertain honourable designs upon the lady last mentioned and mr noggs who was a genteel person to ask because he had been a gentleman once there were also an elderly lady from the backparlour and one more young lady who next to the collector perhaps was the great lion of the party being the daughter of a theatrical fireman who went on in the pantomime and had the greatest turn for the stage that was ever known being able to sing and recite in a manner that brought the tears into mrs kenwigss eyes there was only one drawback upon the pleasure of seeing such friends and that was that the lady in the backparlour who was very fat and turned of sixty came in a low bookmuslin dress and short kid gloves which so exasperated mrs kenwigs that that lady assured her visitors in private that if it hadnt happened that the supper was cooking at the backparlour grate at that moment she certainly would have requested its representative to withdraw  my dear said mr kenwigs wouldnt it be better to begin a round game  kenwigs my dear returned his wife i am surprised at you would you begin without my uncle  i forgot the collector said kenwigs oh no that would never do  hes so particular said mrs kenwigs turning to the other married lady that if we began without him i should be out of his will for ever  dear cried the married lady  youve no idea what he is replied mrs kenwigs and yet as good a creature as ever breathed  the kindesthearted man as ever was said kenwigs  it goes to his heart i believe to be forced to cut the water off when the people dont pay observed the bachelor friend intending a joke  george said mr kenwigs solemnly none of that if you please  it was only my joke said the friend abashed  george rejoined mr kenwigs a joke is a wery good thinga wery good thingbut when that joke is made at the expense of mrs kenwigss feelings i set my face against it a man in public life expects to be sneered atit is the fault of his elewated sitiwation and not of himself mrs kenwigss relation is a public man and that he knows george and that he can bear but putting mrs kenwigs out of the question if i could put mrs kenwigs out of the question on such an occasion as this i have the honour to be connected with the collector by marriage and i cannot allow these remarks in my mr kenwigs was going to say house but he rounded the sentence with apartments  at the conclusion of these observations which drew forth evidences of acute feeling from mrs kenwigs and had the intended effect of impressing the company with a deep sense of the collectors dignity a ring was heard at the bell  thats him whispered mr kenwigs greatly excited morleena my dear run down and let your uncle in and kiss him directly you get the door open hem lets be talking  adopting mr kenwigss suggestion the company spoke very loudly to look easy and unembarrassed and almost as soon as they had begun to do so a short old gentleman in drabs and gaiters with a face that might have been carved out of lignum vitae for anything that appeared to the contrary was led playfully in by miss morleena kenwigs regarding whose uncommon christian name it may be here remarked that it had been invented and composed by mrs kenwigs previous to her first lyingin for the special distinction of her eldest child in case it should prove a daughter  oh uncle i am so glad to see you said mrs kenwigs kissing the collector affectionately on both cheeks so glad  many happy returns of the day my dear replied the collector returning the compliment  now this was an interesting thing here was a collector of waterrates without his book without his pen and ink without his double knock without his intimidation kissingactually kissingan agreeable female and leaving taxes summonses notices that he had called or announcements that he would never call again for two quarters due wholly out of the question it was pleasant to see how the company looked on quite absorbed in the sight and to behold the nods and winks with which they expressed their gratification at finding so much humanity in a taxgatherer  where will you sit uncle said mrs kenwigs in the full glow of family pride which the appearance of her distinguished relation occasioned  anywheres my dear said the collector i am not particular  not particular what a meek collector if he had been an author who knew his place he couldnt have been more humble  mr lillyvick said kenwigs addressing the collector some friends here sir are very anxious for the honour ofthank youmr and mrs cutler mr lillyvick  proud to know you sir said mr cutler ive heerd of you very often these were not mere words of ceremony for mr cutler having kept house in mr lillyvicks parish had heard of him very often indeed his attention in calling had been quite extraordinary  george you know i think mr lillyvick said kenwigs lady from downstairsmr lillyvick mr snewkesmr lillyvick miss greenmr lillyvick mr lillyvickmiss petowker of the theatre royal drury lane very glad to make two public characters acquainted mrs kenwigs my dear will you sort the counters  mrs kenwigs with the assistance of newman noggs who as he performed sundry little acts of kindness for the children at all times and seasons was humoured in his request to be taken no notice of and was merely spoken about in a whisper as the decayed gentleman did as he was desired and the greater part of the guests sat down to speculation while newman himself mrs kenwigs and miss petowker of the theatre royal drury lane looked after the suppertable  while the ladies were thus busying themselves mr lillyvick was intent upon the game in progress and as all should be fish that comes to a watercollectors net the dear old gentleman was by no means scrupulous in appropriating to himself the property of his neighbours which on the contrary he abstracted whenever an opportunity presented itself smiling goodhumouredly all the while and making so many condescending speeches to the owners that they were delighted with his amiability and thought in their hearts that he deserved to be chancellor of the exchequer at least  after a great deal of trouble and the administration of many slaps on the head to the infant kenwigses whereof two of the most rebellious were summarily banished the cloth was laid with much elegance and a pair of boiled fowls a large piece of pork applepie potatoes and greens were served at sight of which the worthy mr lillyvick vented a great many witticisms and plucked up amazingly to the immense delight and satisfaction of the whole body of admirers  very well and very fast the supper went off no more serious difficulties occurring than those which arose from the incessant demand for clean knives and forks which made poor mrs kenwigs wish more than once that private society adopted the principle of schools and required that every guest should bring his own knife fork and spoon which doubtless would be a great accommodation in many cases and to no one more so than to the lady and gentleman of the house especially if the school principle were carried out to the full extent and the articles were expected as a matter of delicacy not to be taken away again  everybody having eaten everything the table was cleared in a most alarming hurry and with great noise and the spirits whereat the eyes of newman noggs glistened being arranged in order with water both hot and cold the party composed themselves for conviviality mr lillyvick being stationed in a large armchair by the fireside and the four little kenwigses disposed on a small form in front of the company with their flaxen tails towards them and their faces to the fire an arrangement which was no sooner perfected than mrs kenwigs was overpowered by the feelings of a mother and fell upon the left shoulder of mr kenwigs dissolved in tears  they are so beautiful said mrs kenwigs sobbing  oh dear said all the ladies so they are its very natural you should feel proud of that but dont give way dont  i cannot help it and it dont signify sobbed mrs kenwigs oh theyre too beautiful to live much too beautiful  on hearing this alarming presentiment of their being doomed to an early death in the flower of their infancy all four little girls raised a hideous cry and burying their heads in their mothers lap simultaneously screamed until the eight flaxen tails vibrated again mrs kenwigs meanwhile clasping them alternately to her bosom with attitudes expressive of distraction which miss petowker herself might have copied  at length the anxious mother permitted herself to be soothed into a more tranquil state and the little kenwigses being also composed were distributed among the company to prevent the possibility of mrs kenwigs being again overcome by the blaze of their combined beauty this done the ladies and gentlemen united in prophesying that they would live for many many years and that there was no occasion at all for mrs kenwigs to distress herself which in good truth there did not appear to be the loveliness of the children by no means justifying her apprehensions  this day eight year said mr kenwigs after a pause dear meah  this reflection was echoed by all present who said ah first and dear me afterwards  i was younger then tittered mrs kenwigs  no said the collector  certainly not added everybody  i remember my niece said mr lillyvick surveying his audience with a grave air i remember her on that very afternoon when she first acknowledged to her mother a partiality for kenwigs mother she says i love him  adore him i said uncle interposed mrs kenwigs  love him i think my dear said the collector firmly  perhaps you are right uncle replied mrs kenwigs submissively i thought it was adore  love my dear retorted mr lillyvick mother she says i love him what do i hear cries her mother and instantly falls into strong conwulsions  a general exclamation of astonishment burst from the company  into strong conwulsions repeated mr lillyvick regarding them with a rigid look kenwigs will excuse my saying in the presence of friends that there was a very great objection to him on the ground that he was beneath the family and would disgrace it you remember kenwigs  certainly replied that gentleman in no way displeased at the reminiscence inasmuch as it proved beyond all doubt what a high family mrs kenwigs came of  i shared in that feeling said mr lillyvick perhaps it was natural perhaps it wasnt  a gentle murmur seemed to say that in one of mr lillyvicks station the objection was not only natural but highly praiseworthy  i came round to him in time said mr lillyvick after they were married and there was no help for it i was one of the first to say that kenwigs must be taken notice of the family did take notice of him in consequence and on my representation and i am bound to sayand proud to saythat i have always found him a very honest wellbehaved upright respectable sort of man kenwigs shake hands  i am proud to do it sir said mr kenwigs  so am i kenwigs rejoined mr lillyvick  a very happy life i have led with your niece sir said kenwigs  it would have been your own fault if you had not sir remarked mr lillyvick  morleena kenwigs cried her mother at this crisis much affected kiss your dear uncle  the young lady did as she was requested and the three other little girls were successively hoisted up to the collectors countenance and subjected to the same process which was afterwards repeated on them by the majority of those present  oh dear mrs kenwigs said miss petowker while mr noggs is making that punch to drink happy returns in do let morleena go through that figure dance before mr lillyvick  no no my dear replied mrs kenwigs it will only worry my uncle  it cant worry him i am sure said miss petowker you will be very much pleased wont you sir  that i am sure i shall replied the collector glancing at the punchmixer  well then ill tell you what said mrs kenwigs morleena shall do the steps if uncle can persuade miss petowker to recite us the blooddrinkers burial afterwards  there was a great clapping of hands and stamping of feet at this proposition the subject whereof gently inclined her head several times in acknowledgment of the reception  you know said miss petowker reproachfully that i dislike doing anything professional in private parties  oh but not here said mrs kenwigs we are all so very friendly and pleasant that you might as well be going through it in your own room besides the occasion  i cant resist that interrupted miss petowker anything in my humble power i shall be delighted to do  mrs kenwigs and miss petowker had arranged a small programme of the entertainments between them of which this was the prescribed order but they had settled to have a little pressing on both sides because it looked more natural the company being all ready miss petowker hummed a tune and morleena danced a dance having previously had the soles of her shoes chalked with as much care as if she were going on the tightrope it was a very beautiful figure comprising a great deal of work for the arms and was received with unbounded applause  if i was blessed with aa child said miss petowker blushing of such genius as that i would have her out at the opera instantly  mrs kenwigs sighed and looked at mr kenwigs who shook his head and observed that he was doubtful about it  kenwigs is afraid said mrs k  what of inquired miss petowker not of her failing  oh no replied mrs kenwigs but if she grew up what she is nowonly think of the young dukes and marquises  very right said the collector  still submitted miss petowker if she took a proper pride in herself you know  theres a good deal in that observed mrs kenwigs looking at her husband  i only know faltered miss petowkerit may be no rule to be surebut i have never found any inconvenience or unpleasantness of that sort  mr kenwigs with becoming gallantry said that settled the question at once and that he would take the subject into his serious consideration this being resolved upon miss petowker was entreated to begin the blooddrinkers burial to which end that young lady let down her back hair and taking up her position at the other end of the room with the bachelor friend posted in a corner to rush out at the cue in death expire and catch her in his arms when she died raving mad went through the performance with extraordinary spirit and to the great terror of the little kenwigses who were all but frightened into fits  the ecstasies consequent upon the effort had not yet subsided and newman who had not been thoroughly sober at so late an hour for a long long time had not yet been able to put in a word of announcement that the punch was ready when a hasty knock was heard at the roomdoor which elicited a shriek from mrs kenwigs who immediately divined that the baby had fallen out of bed  who is that demanded mr kenwigs sharply  dont be alarmed its only me said crowl looking in in his nightcap the baby is very comfortable for i peeped into the room as i came down and its fast asleep and so is the girl and i dont think the candle will set fire to the bedcurtain unless a draught was to get into the roomits mr noggs thats wanted  me cried newman much astonished  why it is a queer hour isnt it replied crowl who was not best pleased at the prospect of losing his fire and they are queerlooking people too all covered with rain and mud shall i tell them to go away  no said newman rising people how many  two rejoined crowl  want me by name asked newman  by name replied crowl mr newman noggs as pat as need be  newman reflected for a few seconds and then hurried away muttering that he would be back directly he was as good as his word for in an exceedingly short time he burst into the room and seizing without a word of apology or explanation a lighted candle and tumbler of hot punch from the table darted away like a madman  what the deuce is the matter with him exclaimed crowl throwing the door open hark is there any noise above  the guests rose in great confusion and looking in each others faces with much perplexity and some fear stretched their necks forward and listened attentively    chapter 15  acquaints the reader with the cause and origin of the interruption described in the last chapter and with some other matters necessary to be known   newman noggs scrambled in violent haste upstairs with the steaming beverage which he had so unceremoniously snatched from the table of mr kenwigs and indeed from the very grasp of the waterrate collector who was eyeing the contents of the tumbler at the moment of its unexpected abstraction with lively marks of pleasure visible in his countenance he bore his prize straight to his own backgarret where footsore and nearly shoeless wet dirty jaded and disfigured with every mark of fatiguing travel sat nicholas and smike at once the cause and partner of his toil both perfectly worn out by their unwonted and protracted exertion  newmans first act was to compel nicholas with gentle force to swallow half of the punch at a breath nearly boiling as it was and his next to pour the remainder down the throat of smike who never having tasted anything stronger than aperient medicine in his whole life exhibited various odd manifestations of surprise and delight during the passage of the liquor down his throat and turned up his eyes most emphatically when it was all gone  you are wet through said newman passing his hand hastily over the coat which nicholas had thrown off and iihavent even a change he added with a wistful glance at the shabby clothes he wore himself  i have dry clothes or at least such as will serve my turn well in my bundle replied nicholas if you look so distressed to see me you will add to the pain i feel already at being compelled for one night to cast myself upon your slender means for aid and shelter  newman did not look the less distressed to hear nicholas talking in this strain but upon his young friend grasping him heartily by the hand and assuring him that nothing but implicit confidence in the sincerity of his professions and kindness of feeling towards himself would have induced him on any consideration even to have made him acquainted with his arrival in london mr noggs brightened up again and went about making such arrangements as were in his power for the comfort of his visitors with extreme alacrity  these were simple enough poor newmans means halting at a very considerable distance short of his inclinations but slight as they were they were not made without much bustling and running about as nicholas had husbanded his scanty stock of money so well that it was not yet quite expended a supper of bread and cheese with some cold beef from the cooks shop was soon placed upon the table and these viands being flanked by a bottle of spirits and a pot of porter there was no ground for apprehension on the score of hunger or thirst at all events such preparations as newman had it in his power to make for the accommodation of his guests during the night occupied no very great time in completing and as he had insisted as an express preliminary that nicholas should change his clothes and that smike should invest himself in his solitary coat which no entreaties would dissuade him from stripping off for the purpose the travellers partook of their frugal fare with more satisfaction than one of them at least had derived from many a better meal  they then drew near the fire which newman noggs had made up as well as he could after the inroads of crowl upon the fuel and nicholas who had hitherto been restrained by the extreme anxiety of his friend that he should refresh himself after his journey now pressed him with earnest questions concerning his mother and sister  well replied newman with his accustomed taciturnity both well  they are living in the city still inquired nicholas  they are said newman  and my sisteradded nicholas is she still engaged in the business which she wrote to tell me she thought she should like so much  newman opened his eyes rather wider than usual but merely replied by a gasp which according to the action of the head that accompanied it was interpreted by his friends as meaning yes or no in the present instance the pantomime consisted of a nod and not a shake so nicholas took the answer as a favourable one  now listen to me said nicholas laying his hand on newmans shoulder before i would make an effort to see them i deemed it expedient to come to you lest by gratifying my own selfish desire i should inflict an injury upon them which i can never repair what has my uncle heard from yorkshire  newman opened and shut his mouth several times as though he were trying his utmost to speak but could make nothing of it and finally fixed his eyes on nicholas with a grim and ghastly stare  what has he heard urged nicholas colouring you see that i am prepared to hear the very worst that malice can have suggested why should you conceal it from me i must know it sooner or later and what purpose can be gained by trifling with the matter for a few minutes when half the time would put me in possession of all that has occurred tell me at once pray  tomorrow morning said newman hear it tomorrow  what purpose would that answer urged nicholas  you would sleep the better replied newman  i should sleep the worse answered nicholas impatiently sleep exhausted as i am and standing in no common need of rest i cannot hope to close my eyes all night unless you tell me everything  and if i should tell you everything said newman hesitating  why then you may rouse my indignation or wound my pride rejoined nicholas but you will not break my rest for if the scene were acted over again i could take no other part than i have taken and whatever consequences may accrue to myself from it i shall never regret doing as i have donenever if i starve or beg in consequence what is a little poverty or suffering to the disgrace of the basest and most inhuman cowardice i tell you if i had stood by tamely and passively i should have hated myself and merited the contempt of every man in existence the blackhearted scoundrel  with this gentle allusion to the absent mr squeers nicholas repressed his rising wrath and relating to newman exactly what had passed at dotheboys hall entreated him to speak out without more pressing thus adjured mr noggs took from an old trunk a sheet of paper which appeared to have been scrawled over in great haste and after sundry extraordinary demonstrations of reluctance delivered himself in the following terms  my dear young man you mustnt give way tothis sort of thing will never do you knowas to getting on in the world if you take everybodys part thats illtreateddamn it i am proud to hear of it and would have done it myself  newman accompanied this very unusual outbreak with a violent blow upon the table as if in the heat of the moment he had mistaken it for the chest or ribs of mr wackford squeers having by this open declaration of his feelings quite precluded himself from offering nicholas any cautious worldly advice which had been his first intention mr noggs went straight to the point  the day before yesterday said newman your uncle received this letter i took a hasty copy of it while he was out shall i read it  if you please replied nicholas newman noggs accordingly read as follows  dotheboys hall thursday morning  sir  my pa requests me to write to you the doctors considering it doubtful whether he will ever recuvver the use of his legs which prevents his holding a pen  we are in a state of mind beyond everything and my pa is one mask of brooses both blue and green likewise two forms are steepled in his goar we were kimpelled to have him carried down into the kitchen where he now lays you will judge from this that he has been brought very low  when your nevew that you recommended for a teacher had done this to my pa and jumped upon his body with his feet and also langwedge which i will not pollewt my pen with describing he assaulted my ma with dreadful violence dashed her to the earth and drove her back comb several inches into her head a very little more and it must have entered her skull we have a medical certifiket that if it had the tortershell would have affected the brain  me and my brother were then the victims of his feury since which we have suffered very much which leads us to the arrowing belief that we have received some injury in our insides especially as no marks of violence are visible externally i am screaming out loud all the time i write and so is my brother which takes off my attention rather and i hope will excuse mistakes  the monster having sasiated his thirst for blood ran away taking with him a boy of desperate character that he had excited to rebellyon and a garnet ring belonging to my ma and not having been apprehended by the constables is supposed to have been took up by some stagecoach my pa begs that if he comes to you the ring may be returned and that you will let the thief and assassin go as if we prosecuted him he would only be transported and if he is let go he is sure to be hung before long which will save us trouble and be much more satisfactory hoping to hear from you when convenient  i remain yours and cetrer fanny squeers  ps i pity his ignorance and despise him  a profound silence succeeded to the reading of this choice epistle during which newman noggs as he folded it up gazed with a kind of grotesque pity at the boy of desperate character therein referred to who having no more distinct perception of the matter in hand than that he had been the unfortunate cause of heaping trouble and falsehood upon nicholas sat mute and dispirited with a most woebegone and heartstricken look  mr noggs said nicholas after a few moments reflection i must go out at once  go out cried newman  yes said nicholas to golden square nobody who knows me would believe this story of the ring but it may suit the purpose or gratify the hatred of mr ralph nickleby to feign to attach credence to it it is duenot to him but to myselfthat i should state the truth and moreover i have a word or two to exchange with him which will not keep cool  they must said newman  they must not indeed rejoined nicholas firmly as he prepared to leave the house  hear me speak said newman planting himself before his impetuous young friend he is not there he is away from town he will not be back for three days and i know that letter will not be answered before he returns  are you sure of this asked nicholas chafing violently and pacing the narrow room with rapid strides  quite rejoined newman he had hardly read it when he was called away its contents are known to nobody but himself and us  are you certain demanded nicholas precipitately not even to my mother or sister if i thought that theyi will go therei must see them which is the way where is it  now be advised by me said newman speaking for the moment in his earnestness like any other manmake no effort to see even them till he comes home i know the man do not seem to have been tampering with anybody when he returns go straight to him and speak as boldly as you like guessing at the real truth he knows it as well as you or i trust him for that  you mean well to me and should know him better than i can replied nicholas after some consideration well let it be so  newman who had stood during the foregoing conversation with his back planted against the door ready to oppose any egress from the apartment by force if necessary resumed his seat with much satisfaction and as the water in the kettle was by this time boiling made a glassful of spirits and water for nicholas and a cracked mugfull for the joint accommodation of himself and smike of which the two partook in great harmony while nicholas leaning his head upon his hand remained buried in melancholy meditation  meanwhile the company below stairs after listening attentively and not hearing any noise which would justify them in interfering for the gratification of their curiosity returned to the chamber of the kenwigses and employed themselves in hazarding a great variety of conjectures relative to the cause of mr noggs sudden disappearance and detention  lor ill tell you what said mrs kenwigs suppose it should be an express sent up to say that his property has all come back again  dear me said mr kenwigs its not impossible perhaps in that case wed better send up and ask if he wont take a little more punch  kenwigs said mr lillyvick in a loud voice im surprised at you  whats the matter sir asked mr kenwigs with becoming submission to the collector of waterrates  making such a remark as that sir replied mr lillyvick angrily he has had punch already has he not sir i consider the way in which that punch was cut off if i may use the expression highly disrespectful to this company scandalous perfectly scandalous it may be the custom to allow such things in this house but its not the kind of behaviour that ive been used to see displayed and so i dont mind telling you kenwigs a gentleman has a glass of punch before him to which he is just about to set his lips when another gentleman comes and collars that glass of punch without a with your leave or by your leave and carries that glass of punch away this may be good mannersi dare say it isbut i dont understand it thats all and whats more i dont care if i never do its my way to speak my mind kenwigs and that is my mind and if you dont like it its past my regular time for going to bed and i can find my way home without making it later  here was an untoward event the collector had sat swelling and fuming in offended dignity for some minutes and had now fairly burst out the great manthe rich relationthe unmarried unclewho had it in his power to make morleena an heiress and the very baby a legateewas offended gracious powers where was this to end  i am very sorry sir said mr kenwigs humbly  dont tell me youre sorry retorted mr lillyvick with much sharpness you should have prevented it then  the company were quite paralysed by this domestic crash the backparlour sat with her mouth wide open staring vacantly at the collector in a stupor of dismay the other guests were scarcely less overpowered by the great mans irritation mr kenwigs not being skilful in such matters only fanned the flame in attempting to extinguish it  i didnt think of it i am sure sir said that gentleman i didnt suppose that such a little thing as a glass of punch would have put you out of temper  out of temper what the devil do you mean by that piece of impertinence mr kenwigs said the collector morleena childgive me my hat  oh youre not going mr lillyvick sir interposed miss petowker with her most bewitching smile  but still mr lillyvick regardless of the siren cried obdurately morleena my hat upon the fourth repetition of which demand mrs kenwigs sunk back in her chair with a cry that might have softened a waterbutt not to say a watercollector while the four little girls privately instructed to that effect clasped their uncles drab shorts in their arms and prayed him in imperfect english to remain  why should i stop here my dears said mr lillyvick im not wanted here  oh do not speak so cruelly uncle sobbed mrs kenwigs unless you wish to kill me  i shouldnt wonder if some people were to say i did replied mr lillyvick glancing angrily at kenwigs out of temper  oh i cannot bear to see him look so at my husband cried mrs kenwigs its so dreadful in families oh  mr lillyvick said kenwigs i hope for the sake of your niece that you wont object to be reconciled  the collectors features relaxed as the company added their entreaties to those of his nephewinlaw he gave up his hat and held out his hand  there kenwigs said mr lillyvick and let me tell you at the same time to show you how much out of temper i was that if i had gone away without another word it would have made no difference respecting that pound or two which i shall leave among your children when i die  morleena kenwigs cried her mother in a torrent of affection go down upon your knees to your dear uncle and beg him to love you all his life through for hes more a angel than a man and ive always said so  miss morleena approaching to do homage in compliance with this injunction was summarily caught up and kissed by mr lillyvick and thereupon mrs kenwigs darted forward and kissed the collector and an irrepressible murmur of applause broke from the company who had witnessed his magnanimity  the worthy gentleman then became once more the life and soul of the society being again reinstated in his old post of lion from which high station the temporary distraction of their thoughts had for a moment dispossessed him quadruped lions are said to be savage only when they are hungry biped lions are rarely sulky longer than when their appetite for distinction remains unappeased mr lillyvick stood higher than ever for he had shown his power hinted at his property and testamentary intentions gained great credit for disinterestedness and virtue and in addition to all was finally accommodated with a much larger tumbler of punch than that which newman noggs had so feloniously made off with  i say i beg everybodys pardon for intruding again said crowl looking in at this happy juncture but what a queer business this is isnt it noggs has lived in this house now going on for five years and nobody has ever been to see him before within the memory of the oldest inhabitant  its a strange time of night to be called away sir certainly said the collector and the behaviour of mr noggs himself is to say the least of it mysterious  well so it is rejoined growl and ill tell you whats morei think these two geniuses whoever they are have run away from somewhere  what makes you think that sir demanded the collector who seemed by a tacit understanding to have been chosen and elected mouthpiece to the company you have no reason to suppose that they have run away from anywhere without paying the rates and taxes due i hope  mr crowl with a look of some contempt was about to enter a general protest against the payment of rates or taxes under any circumstances when he was checked by a timely whisper from kenwigs and several frowns and winks from mrs k which providentially stopped him  why the fact is said crowl who had been listening at newmans door with all his might and main the fact is that they have been talking so loud that they quite disturbed me in my room and so i couldnt help catching a word here and a word there and all i heard certainly seemed to refer to their having bolted from some place or other i dont wish to alarm mrs kenwigs but i hope they havent come from any jail or hospital and brought away a fever or some unpleasantness of that sort which might be catching for the children  mrs kenwigs was so overpowered by this supposition that it needed all the tender attentions of miss petowker of the theatre royal drury lane to restore her to anything like a state of calmness not to mention the assiduity of mr kenwigs who held a fat smellingbottle to his ladys nose until it became matter of some doubt whether the tears which coursed down her face were the result of feelings or sal volatile  the ladies having expressed their sympathy singly and separately fell according to custom into a little chorus of soothing expressions among which such condolences as poor deari should feel just the same if i was herto be sure its a very trying thingand nobody but a mother knows what a mothers feelings is were among the most prominent and most frequently repeated in short the opinion of the company was so clearly manifested that mr kenwigs was on the point of repairing to mr noggss room to demand an explanation and had indeed swallowed a preparatory glass of punch with great inflexibility and steadiness of purpose when the attention of all present was diverted by a new and terrible surprise  this was nothing less than the sudden pouring forth of a rapid succession of the shrillest and most piercing screams from an upper story and to all appearance from the very twopair back in which the infant kenwigs was at that moment enshrined they were no sooner audible than mrs kenwigs opining that a strange cat had come in and sucked the babys breath while the girl was asleep made for the door wringing her hands and shrieking dismally to the great consternation and confusion of the company  mr kenwigs see what it is make haste cried the sister laying violent hands upon mrs kenwigs and holding her back by force oh dont twist about so dear or i can never hold you  my baby my blessed blessed blessed blessed baby screamed mrs kenwigs making every blessed louder than the last my own darling sweet innocent lillyvickoh let me go to him let me goooo  pending the utterance of these frantic cries and the wails and lamentations of the four little girls mr kenwigs rushed upstairs to the room whence the sounds proceeded at the door of which he encountered nicholas with the child in his arms who darted out with such violence that the anxious father was thrown down six stairs and alighted on the nearest landingplace before he had found time to open his mouth to ask what was the matter  dont be alarmed cried nicholas running down here it is its all out its all over pray compose yourselves theres no harm done and with these and a thousand other assurances he delivered the baby whom in his hurry he had carried upside down to mrs kenwigs and ran back to assist mr kenwigs who was rubbing his head very hard and looking much bewildered by his tumble  reassured by this cheering intelligence the company in some degree recovered from their fears which had been productive of some most singular instances of a total want of presence of mind thus the bachelor friend had for a long time supported in his arms mrs kenwigss sister instead of mrs kenwigs and the worthy mr lillyvick had been actually seen in the perturbation of his spirits to kiss miss petowker several times behind the roomdoor as calmly as if nothing distressing were going forward  it is a mere nothing said nicholas returning to mrs kenwigs the little girl who was watching the child being tired i suppose fell asleep and set her hair on fire  oh you malicious little wretch cried mrs kenwigs impressively shaking her forefinger at the small unfortunate who might be thirteen years old and was looking on with a singed head and a frightened face  i heard her cries continued nicholas and ran down in time to prevent her setting fire to anything else you may depend upon it that the child is not hurt for i took it off the bed myself and brought it here to convince you  this brief explanation over the infant who as he was christened after the collector rejoiced in the names of lillyvick kenwigs was partially suffocated under the caresses of the audience and squeezed to his mothers bosom until he roared again the attention of the company was then directed by a natural transition to the little girl who had had the audacity to burn her hair off and who after receiving sundry small slaps and pushes from the more energetic of the ladies was mercifully sent home the ninepence with which she was to have been rewarded being escheated to the kenwigs family  and whatever we are to say to you sir exclaimed mrs kenwigs addressing young lillyvicks deliverer i am sure i dont know  you need say nothing at all replied nicholas i have done nothing to found any very strong claim upon your eloquence i am sure  he might have been burnt to death if it hadnt been for you sir simpered miss petowker  not very likely i think replied nicholas for there was abundance of assistance here which must have reached him before he had been in any danger  you will let us drink your health anyvays sir said mr kenwigs motioning towards the table  in my absence by all means rejoined nicholas with a smile i have had a very fatiguing journey and should be most indifferent companya far greater check upon your merriment than a promoter of it even if i kept awake which i think very doubtful if you will allow me ill return to my friend mr noggs who went upstairs again when he found nothing serious had occurred goodnight  excusing himself in these terms from joining in the festivities nicholas took a most winning farewell of mrs kenwigs and the other ladies and retired after making a very extraordinary impression upon the company  what a delightful young man cried mrs kenwigs  uncommon gentlemanly really said mr kenwigs dont you think so mr lillyvick  yes said the collector with a dubious shrug of his shoulders he is gentlemanly very gentlemanlyin appearance  i hope you dont see anything against him uncle inquired mrs kenwigs  no my dear replied the collector no i trust he may not turn outwellno mattermy love to you my dear and long life to the baby  your namesake said mrs kenwigs with a sweet smile  and i hope a worthy namesake observed mr kenwigs willing to propitiate the collector i hope a baby as will never disgrace his godfather and as may be considered in arter years of a piece with the lillyvicks whose name he bears i do sayand mrs kenwigs is of the same sentiment and feels it as strong as i dothat i consider his being called lillyvick one of the greatest blessings and honours of my existence  the greatest blessing kenwigs murmured his lady  the greatest blessing said mr kenwigs correcting himself a blessing that i hope one of these days i may be able to deserve  this was a politic stroke of the kenwigses because it made mr lillyvick the great head and fountain of the babys importance the good gentleman felt the delicacy and dexterity of the touch and at once proposed the health of the gentleman name unknown who had signalised himself that night by his coolness and alacrity  who i dont mind saying observed mr lillyvick as a great concession is a goodlooking young man enough with manners that i hope his character may be equal to  he has a very nice face and style really said mrs kenwigs  he certainly has added miss petowker theres something in his appearance quitedear dear whats that word again  what word inquired mr lillyvick  whydear me how stupid i am replied miss petowker hesitating what do you call it when lords break off doorknockers and beat policemen and play at coaches with other peoples money and all that sort of thing  aristocratic suggested the collector  ah aristocratic replied miss petowker something very aristocratic about him isnt there  the gentleman held their peace and smiled at each other as who should say well theres no accounting for tastes but the ladies resolved unanimously that nicholas had an aristocratic air and nobody caring to dispute the position it was established triumphantly  the punch being by this time drunk out and the little kenwigses who had for some time previously held their little eyes open with their little forefingers becoming fractious and requesting rather urgently to be put to bed the collector made a move by pulling out his watch and acquainting the company that it was nigh two oclock whereat some of the guests were surprised and others shocked and hats and bonnets being groped for under the tables and in course of time found their owners went away after a vast deal of shaking of hands and many remarks how they had never spent such a delightful evening and how they marvelled to find it so late expecting to have heard that it was halfpast ten at the very latest and how they wished that mr and mrs kenwigs had a weddingday once a week and how they wondered by what hidden agency mrs kenwigs could possibly have managed so well and a great deal more of the same kind to all of which flattering expressions mr and mrs kenwigs replied by thanking every lady and gentleman seriatim for the favour of their company and hoping they might have enjoyed themselves only half as well as they said they had  as to nicholas quite unconscious of the impression he had produced he had long since fallen asleep leaving mr newman noggs and smike to empty the spirit bottle between them and this office they performed with such extreme goodwill that newman was equally at a loss to determine whether he himself was quite sober and whether he had ever seen any gentleman so heavily drowsily and completely intoxicated as his new acquaintance    chapter 16  nicholas seeks to employ himself in a new capacity and being unsuccessful accepts an engagement as tutor in a private family   the first care of nicholas next morning was to look after some room in which until better times dawned upon him he could contrive to exist without trenching upon the hospitality of newman noggs who would have slept upon the stairs with pleasure so that his young friend was accommodated  the vacant apartment to which the bill in the parlour window bore reference appeared on inquiry to be a small backroom on the second floor reclaimed from the leads and overlooking a sootbespeckled prospect of tiles and chimneypots for the letting of this portion of the house from week to week on reasonable terms the parlour lodger was empowered to treat he being deputed by the landlord to dispose of the rooms as they became vacant and to keep a sharp lookout that the lodgers didnt run away as a means of securing the punctual discharge of which last service he was permitted to live rentfree lest he should at any time be tempted to run away himself  of this chamber nicholas became the tenant and having hired a few common articles of furniture from a neighbouring broker and paid the first weeks hire in advance out of a small fund raised by the conversion of some spare clothes into ready money he sat himself down to ruminate upon his prospects which like the prospect outside his window were sufficiently confined and dingy as they by no means improved on better acquaintance and as familiarity breeds contempt he resolved to banish them from his thoughts by dint of hard walking so taking up his hat and leaving poor smike to arrange and rearrange the room with as much delight as if it had been the costliest palace he betook himself to the streets and mingled with the crowd which thronged them  although a man may lose a sense of his own importance when he is a mere unit among a busy throng all utterly regardless of him it by no means follows that he can dispossess himself with equal facility of a very strong sense of the importance and magnitude of his cares the unhappy state of his own affairs was the one idea which occupied the brain of nicholas walk as fast as he would and when he tried to dislodge it by speculating on the situation and prospects of the people who surrounded him he caught himself in a few seconds contrasting their condition with his own and gliding almost imperceptibly back into his old train of thought again  occupied in these reflections as he was making his way along one of the great public thoroughfares of london he chanced to raise his eyes to a blue board whereon was inscribed in characters of gold general agency office for places and situations of all kinds inquire within it was a shopfront fitted up with a gauze blind and an inner door and in the window hung a long and tempting array of written placards announcing vacant places of every grade from a secretarys to a footboys  nicholas halted instinctively before this temple of promise and ran his eye over the capitaltext openings in life which were so profusely displayed when he had completed his survey he walked on a little way and then back and then on again at length after pausing irresolutely several times before the door of the general agency office he made up his mind and stepped in  he found himself in a little floorclothed room with a high desk railed off in one corner behind which sat a lean youth with cunning eyes and a protruding chin whose performances in capitaltext darkened the window he had a thick ledger lying open before him and with the fingers of his right hand inserted between the leaves and his eyes fixed on a very fat old lady in a mobcapevidently the proprietress of the establishmentwho was airing herself at the fire seemed to be only waiting her directions to refer to some entries contained within its rusty clasps  as there was a board outside which acquainted the public that servantsofallwork were perpetually in waiting to be hired from ten till four nicholas knew at once that some halfdozen strong young women each with pattens and an umbrella who were sitting upon a form in one corner were in attendance for that purpose especially as the poor things looked anxious and weary he was not quite so certain of the callings and stations of two smart young ladies who were in conversation with the fat lady before the fire untilhaving sat himself down in a corner and remarked that he would wait until the other customers had been servedthe fat lady resumed the dialogue which his entrance had interrupted  cook tom said the fat lady still airing herself as aforesaid  cook said tom turning over some leaves of the ledger well  read out an easy place or two said the fat lady  pick out very light ones if you please young man interposed a genteel female in shepherdsplaid boots who appeared to be the client  mrs marker said tom reading russell place russell square offers eighteen guineas tea and sugar found two in family and see very little company five servants kept no man no followers  oh lor tittered the client that wont do read another young man will you  mrs wrymug said tom pleasant place finsbury wages twelve guineas no tea no sugar serious family  ah you neednt mind reading that interrupted the client  three serious footmen said tom impressively  three did you say asked the client in an altered tone  three serious footmen replied tom cook housemaid and nursemaid each female servant required to join the little bethel congregation three times every sundaywith a serious footman if the cook is more serious than the footman she will be expected to improve the footman if the footman is more serious than the cook he will be expected to improve the cook  ill take the address of that place said the client i dont know but what it mightnt suit me pretty well  heres another remarked tom turning over the leaves family of mr gallanbile mp fifteen guineas tea and sugar and servants allowed to see male cousins if godly note cold dinner in the kitchen on the sabbath mr gallanbile being devoted to the observance question no victuals whatever cooked on the lords day with the exception of dinner for mr and mrs gallanbile which being a work of piety and necessity is exempted mr gallanbile dines late on the day of rest in order to prevent the sinfulness of the cooks dressing herself  i dont think thatll answer as well as the other said the client after a little whispering with her friend ill take the other direction if you please young man i can but come back again if it dont do  tom made out the address as requested and the genteel client having satisfied the fat lady with a small fee meanwhile went away accompanied by her friend  as nicholas opened his mouth to request the young man to turn to letter s and let him know what secretaryships remained undisposed of there came into the office an applicant in whose favour he immediately retired and whose appearance both surprised and interested him  this was a young lady who could be scarcely eighteen of very slight and delicate figure but exquisitely shaped who walking timidly up to the desk made an inquiry in a very low tone of voice relative to some situation as governess or companion to a lady she raised her veil for an instant while she preferred the inquiry and disclosed a countenance of most uncommon beauty though shaded by a cloud of sadness which in one so young was doubly remarkable having received a card of reference to some person on the books she made the usual acknowledgment and glided away  she was neatly but very quietly attired so much so indeed that it seemed as though her dress if it had been worn by one who imparted fewer graces of her own to it might have looked poor and shabby her attendantfor she had onewas a redfaced roundeyed slovenly girl who from a certain roughness about the bare arms that peeped from under her draggled shawl and the halfwashedout traces of smut and blacklead which tattooed her countenance was clearly of a kin with the servantsofallwork on the form between whom and herself there had passed various grins and glances indicative of the freemasonry of the craft  this girl followed her mistress and before nicholas had recovered from the first effects of his surprise and admiration the young lady was gone it is not a matter of such complete and utter improbability as some sober people may think that he would have followed them out had he not been restrained by what passed between the fat lady and her bookkeeper  when is she coming again tom asked the fat lady  tomorrow morning replied tom mending his pen  where have you sent her to asked the fat lady  mrs clarks replied tom  shell have a nice life of it if she goes there observed the fat lady taking a pinch of snuff from a tin box  tom made no other reply than thrusting his tongue into his cheek and pointing the feather of his pen towards nicholasreminders which elicited from the fat lady an inquiry of now sir what can we do for you  nicholas briefly replied that he wanted to know whether there was any such post to be had as secretary or amanuensis to a gentleman  any such rejoined the mistress adozensuch ant there tom  i should think so answered that young gentleman and as he said it he winked towards nicholas with a degree of familiarity which he no doubt intended for a rather flattering compliment but with which nicholas was most ungratefully disgusted  upon reference to the book it appeared that the dozen secretaryships had dwindled down to one mr gregsbury the great member of parliament of manchester buildings westminster wanted a young man to keep his papers and correspondence in order and nicholas was exactly the sort of young man that mr gregsbury wanted  i dont know what the terms are as he said hed settle them himself with the party observed the fat lady but they must be pretty good ones because hes a member of parliament  inexperienced as he was nicholas did not feel quite assured of the force of this reasoning or the justice of this conclusion but without troubling himself to question it he took down the address and resolved to wait upon mr gregsbury without delay  i dont know what the number is said tom but manchester buildings isnt a large place and if the worst comes to the worst it wont take you very long to knock at all the doors on both sides of the way till you find him out i say what a goodlooking gal that was wasnt she  what girl demanded nicholas sternly  oh yes i knowwhat gal eh whispered tom shutting one eye and cocking his chin in the air you didnt see her you didnti say dont you wish you was me when she comes tomorrow morning  nicholas looked at the ugly clerk as if he had a mind to reward his admiration of the young lady by beating the ledger about his ears but he refrained and strode haughtily out of the office setting at defiance in his indignation those ancient laws of chivalry which not only made it proper and lawful for all good knights to hear the praise of the ladies to whom they were devoted but rendered it incumbent upon them to roam about the world and knock at head all such matteroffact and unpoetical characters as declined to exalt above all the earth damsels whom they had never chanced to look upon or hear ofas if that were any excuse  thinking no longer of his own misfortunes but wondering what could be those of the beautiful girl he had seen nicholas with many wrong turns and many inquiries and almost as many misdirections bent his steps towards the place whither he had been directed  within the precincts of the ancient city of westminster and within half a quarter of a mile of its ancient sanctuary is a narrow and dirty region the sanctuary of the smaller members of parliament in modern days it is all comprised in one street of gloomy lodginghouses from whose windows in vacationtime there frown long melancholy rows of bills which say as plainly as did the countenances of their occupiers ranged on ministerial and opposition benches in the session which slumbers with its fathers to let to let in busier periods of the year these bills disappear and the houses swarm with legislators there are legislators in the parlours in the first floor in the second in the third in the garrets the small apartments reek with the breath of deputations and delegates in damp weather the place is rendered close by the steams of moist acts of parliament and frouzy petitions general postmen grow faint as they enter its infected limits and shabby figures in quest of franks flit restlessly to and fro like the troubled ghosts of complete letterwriters departed this is manchester buildings and here at all hours of the night may be heard the rattling of latchkeys in their respective keyholes with now and thenwhen a gust of wind sweeping across the water which washes the buildings feet impels the sound towards its entrancethe weak shrill voice of some young member practising tomorrows speech all the livelong day there is a grinding of organs and clashing and clanging of little boxes of music for manchester buildings is an eelpot which has no outlet but its awkward moutha casebottle which has no thoroughfare and a short and narrow neckand in this respect it may be typical of the fate of some few among its more adventurous residents who after wriggling themselves into parliament by violent efforts and contortions find that it too is no thoroughfare for them that like manchester buildings it leads to nothing beyond itself and that they are fain at last to back out no wiser no richer not one whit more famous than they went in  into manchester buildings nicholas turned with the address of the great mr gregsbury in his hand as there was a stream of people pouring into a shabby house not far from the entrance he waited until they had made their way in and then making up to the servant ventured to inquire if he knew where mr gregsbury lived  the servant was a very pale shabby boy who looked as if he had slept underground from his infancy as very likely he had mr gregsbury said he mr gregsbury lodges here its all right come in  nicholas thought he might as well get in while he could so in he walked and he had no sooner done so than the boy shut the door and made off  this was odd enough but what was more embarrassing was that all along the passage and all along the narrow stairs blocking up the window and making the dark entry darker still was a confused crowd of persons with great importance depicted in their looks who were to all appearance waiting in silent expectation of some coming event from time to time one man would whisper his neighbour or a little group would whisper together and then the whisperers would nod fiercely to each other or give their heads a relentless shake as if they were bent upon doing something very desperate and were determined not to be put off whatever happened  as a few minutes elapsed without anything occurring to explain this phenomenon and as he felt his own position a peculiarly uncomfortable one nicholas was on the point of seeking some information from the man next him when a sudden move was visible on the stairs and a voice was heard to cry now gentleman have the goodness to walk up  so far from walking up the gentlemen on the stairs began to walk down with great alacrity and to entreat with extraordinary politeness that the gentlemen nearest the street would go first the gentlemen nearest the street retorted with equal courtesy that they couldnt think of such a thing on any account but they did it without thinking of it inasmuch as the other gentlemen pressing some halfdozen among whom was nicholas forward and closing up behind pushed them not merely up the stairs but into the very sittingroom of mr gregsbury which they were thus compelled to enter with most unseemly precipitation and without the means of retreat the press behind them more than filling the apartment  gentlemen said mr gregsbury you are welcome i am rejoiced to see you  for a gentleman who was rejoiced to see a body of visitors mr gregsbury looked as uncomfortable as might be but perhaps this was occasioned by senatorial gravity and a statesmanlike habit of keeping his feelings under control he was a tough burly thickheaded gentleman with a loud voice a pompous manner a tolerable command of sentences with no meaning in them and in short every requisite for a very good member indeed  now gentlemen said mr gregsbury tossing a great bundle of papers into a wicker basket at his feet and throwing himself back in his chair with his arms over the elbows you are dissatisfied with my conduct i see by the newspapers  yes mr gregsbury we are said a plump old gentleman in a violent heat bursting out of the throng and planting himself in the front  do my eyes deceive me said mr gregsbury looking towards the speaker or is that my old friend pugstyles  i am that man and no other sir replied the plump old gentleman  give me your hand my worthy friend said mr gregsbury pugstyles my dear friend i am very sorry to see you here  i am very sorry to be here sir said mr pugstyles but your conduct mr gregsbury has rendered this deputation from your constituents imperatively necessary  my conduct pugstyles said mr gregsbury looking round upon the deputation with gracious magnanimitymy conduct has been and ever will be regulated by a sincere regard for the true and real interests of this great and happy country whether i look at home or abroad whether i behold the peaceful industrious communities of our island home her rivers covered with steamboats her roads with locomotives her streets with cabs her skies with balloons of a power and magnitude hitherto unknown in the history of aeronautics in this or any other nationi say whether i look merely at home or stretching my eyes farther contemplate the boundless prospect of conquest and possessionachieved by british perseverance and british valourwhich is outspread before me i clasp my hands and turning my eyes to the broad expanse above my head exclaim thank heaven i am a briton  the time had been when this burst of enthusiasm would have been cheered to the very echo but now the deputation received it with chilling coldness the general impression seemed to be that as an explanation of mr gregsburys political conduct it did not enter quite enough into detail and one gentleman in the rear did not scruple to remark aloud that for his purpose it savoured rather too much of a gammon tendency  the meaning of that termgammon said mr gregsbury is unknown to me if it means that i grow a little too fervid or perhaps even hyperbolical in extolling my native land i admit the full justice of the remark i am proud of this free and happy country my form dilates my eye glistens my breast heaves my heart swells my bosom burns when i call to mind her greatness and her glory  we wish sir remarked mr pugstyles calmly to ask you a few questions  if you please gentlemen my time is yoursand my countrysand my countrys said mr gregsbury  this permission being conceded mr pugstyles put on his spectacles and referred to a written paper which he drew from his pocket whereupon nearly every other member of the deputation pulled a written paper from his pocket to check mr pugstyles off as he read the questions  this done mr pugstyles proceeded to business  question number onewhether sir you did not give a voluntary pledge previous to your election that in event of your being returned you would immediately put down the practice of coughing and groaning in the house of commons and whether you did not submit to be coughed and groaned down in the very first debate of the session and have since made no effort to effect a reform in this respect whether you did not also pledge yourself to astonish the government and make them shrink in their shoes and whether you have astonished them and made them shrink in their shoes or not  go on to the next one my dear pugstyles said mr gregsbury  have you any explanation to offer with reference to that question sir asked mr pugstyles  certainly not said mr gregsbury  the members of the deputation looked fiercely at each other and afterwards at the member dear pugstyles having taken a very long stare at mr gregsbury over the tops of his spectacles resumed his list of inquiries  question number twowhether sir you did not likewise give a voluntary pledge that you would support your colleague on every occasion and whether you did not the night before last desert him and vote upon the other side because the wife of a leader on that other side had invited mrs gregsbury to an evening party  go on said mr gregsbury  nothing to say on that either sir asked the spokesman  nothing whatever replied mr gregsbury the deputation who had only seen him at canvassing or election time were struck dumb by his coolness he didnt appear like the same man then he was all milk and honey now he was all starch and vinegar but men are so different at different times  question number threeand last said mr pugstyles emphatically whether sir you did not state upon the hustings that it was your firm and determined intention to oppose everything proposed to divide the house upon every question to move for returns on every subject to place a motion on the books every day and in short in your own memorable words to play the very devil with everything and everybody with this comprehensive inquiry mr pugstyles folded up his list of questions as did all his backers  mr gregsbury reflected blew his nose threw himself further back in his chair came forward again leaning his elbows on the table made a triangle with his two thumbs and his two forefingers and tapping his nose with the apex thereof replied smiling as he said it i deny everything  at this unexpected answer a hoarse murmur arose from the deputation and the same gentleman who had expressed an opinion relative to the gammoning nature of the introductory speech again made a monosyllabic demonstration by growling out resign which growl being taken up by his fellows swelled into a very earnest and general remonstrance  i am requested sir to express a hope said mr pugstyles with a distant bow that on receiving a requisition to that effect from a great majority of your constituents you will not object at once to resign your seat in favour of some candidate whom they think they can better trust  to this mr gregsbury read the following reply which anticipating the request he had composed in the form of a letter whereof copies had been made to send round to the newspapers  my dear mr pugstyles  next to the welfare of our beloved islandthis great and free and happy country whose powers and resources are i sincerely believe illimitablei value that noble independence which is an englishmans proudest boast and which i fondly hope to bequeath to my children untarnished and unsullied actuated by no personal motives but moved only by high and great constitutional considerations which i will not attempt to explain for they are really beneath the comprehension of those who have not made themselves masters as i have of the intricate and arduous study of politics i would rather keep my seat and intend doing so  will you do me the favour to present my compliments to the constituent body and acquaint them with this circumstance  with great esteem my dear mr pugstyles cc  then you will not resign under any circumstances asked the spokesman  mr gregsbury smiled and shook his head  then goodmorning sir said pugstyles angrily  heaven bless you said mr gregsbury and the deputation with many growls and scowls filed off as quickly as the narrowness of the staircase would allow of their getting down  the last man being gone mr gregsbury rubbed his hands and chuckled as merry fellows will when they think they have said or done a more than commonly good thing he was so engrossed in this selfcongratulation that he did not observe that nicholas had been left behind in the shadow of the windowcurtains until that young gentleman fearing he might otherwise overhear some soliloquy intended to have no listeners coughed twice or thrice to attract the members notice  whats that said mr gregsbury in sharp accents  nicholas stepped forward and bowed  what do you do here sir asked mr gregsbury a spy upon my privacy a concealed voter you have heard my answer sir pray follow the deputation  i should have done so if i had belonged to it but i do not said nicholas  then how came you here sir was the natural inquiry of mr gregsbury mp and where the devil have you come from sir was the question which followed it  i brought this card from the general agency office sir said nicholas wishing to offer myself as your secretary and understanding that you stood in need of one  thats all you have come for is it said mr gregsbury eyeing him in some doubt  nicholas replied in the affirmative  you have no connection with any of those rascally papers have you said mr gregsbury you didnt get into the room to hear what was going forward and put it in print eh  i have no connection i am sorry to say with anything at present rejoined nicholaspolitely enough but quite at his ease  oh said mr gregsbury how did you find your way up here then  nicholas related how he had been forced up by the deputation  that was the way was it said mr gregsbury sit down  nicholas took a chair and mr gregsbury stared at him for a long time as if to make certain before he asked any further questions that there were no objections to his outward appearance  you want to be my secretary do you he said at length  i wish to be employed in that capacity sir replied nicholas  well said mr gregsbury now what can you do  i suppose replied nicholas smiling that i can do what usually falls to the lot of other secretaries  whats that inquired mr gregsbury  what is it replied nicholas  ah what is it retorted the member looking shrewdly at him with his head on one side  a secretarys duties are rather difficult to define perhaps said nicholas considering they include i presume correspondence  good interposed mr gregsbury  the arrangement of papers and documents  very good  occasionally perhaps the writing from your dictation and possibly sir said nicholas with a halfsmile the copying of your speech for some public journal when you have made one of more than usual importance  certainly rejoined mr gregsbury what else  really said nicholas after a moments reflection i am not able at this instant to recapitulate any other duty of a secretary beyond the general one of making himself as agreeable and useful to his employer as he can consistently with his own respectability and without overstepping that line of duties which he undertakes to perform and which the designation of his office is usually understood to imply  mr gregsbury looked fixedly at nicholas for a short time and then glancing warily round the room said in a suppressed voice  this is all very well mrwhat is your name  nickleby  this is all very well mr nickleby and very proper so far as it goesso far as it goes but it doesnt go far enough there are other duties mr nickleby which a secretary to a parliamentary gentleman must never lose sight of i should require to be crammed sir  i beg your pardon interposed nicholas doubtful whether he had heard aright  to be crammed sir repeated mr gregsbury  may i beg your pardon again if i inquire what you mean sir said nicholas  my meaning sir is perfectly plain replied mr gregsbury with a solemn aspect my secretary would have to make himself master of the foreign policy of the world as it is mirrored in the newspapers to run his eye over all accounts of public meetings all leading articles and accounts of the proceedings of public bodies and to make notes of anything which it appeared to him might be made a point of in any little speech upon the question of some petition lying on the table or anything of that kind do you understand  i think i do sir replied nicholas  then said mr gregsbury it would be necessary for him to make himself acquainted from day to day with newspaper paragraphs on passing events such as mysterious disappearance and supposed suicide of a potboy or anything of that sort upon which i might found a question to the secretary of state for the home department then he would have to copy the question and as much as i remembered of the answer including a little compliment about independence and good sense and to send the manuscript in a frank to the local paper with perhaps halfadozen lines of leader to the effect that i was always to be found in my place in parliament and never shrunk from the responsible and arduous duties and so forth you see  nicholas bowed  besides which continued mr gregsbury i should expect him now and then to go through a few figures in the printed tables and to pick out a few results so that i might come out pretty well on timber duty questions and finance questions and so on and i should like him to get up a few little arguments about the disastrous effects of a return to cash payments and a metallic currency with a touch now and then about the exportation of bullion and the emperor of russia and bank notes and all that kind of thing which its only necessary to talk fluently about because nobody understands it do you take me  i think i understand said nicholas  with regard to such questions as are not political continued mr gregsbury warming and which one cant be expected to care a curse about beyond the natural care of not allowing inferior people to be as well off as ourselveselse where are our privilegesi should wish my secretary to get together a few little flourishing speeches of a patriotic cast for instance if any preposterous bill were brought forward for giving poor grubbing devils of authors a right to their own property i should like to say that i for one would never consent to opposing an insurmountable bar to the diffusion of literature among the peopleyou understandthat the creations of the pocket being mans might belong to one man or one family but that the creations of the brain being gods ought as a matter of course to belong to the people at largeand if i was pleasantly disposed i should like to make a joke about posterity and say that those who wrote for posterity should be content to be rewarded by the approbation of posterity it might take with the house and could never do me any harm because posterity cant be expected to know anything about me or my jokes eitherdo you see  i see that sir replied nicholas  you must always bear in mind in such cases as this where our interests are not affected said mr gregsbury to put it very strong about the people because it comes out very well at electiontime and you could be as funny as you liked about the authors because i believe the greater part of them live in lodgings and are not voters this is a hasty outline of the chief things youd have to do except waiting in the lobby every night in case i forgot anything and should want fresh cramming and now and then during great debates sitting in the front row of the gallery and saying to the people aboutyou see that gentleman with his hand to his face and his arm twisted round the pillarthats mr gregsburythe celebrated mr gregsburywith any other little eulogium that might strike you at the moment and for salary said mr gregsbury winding up with great rapidity for he was out of breathand for salary i dont mind saying at once in round numbers to prevent any dissatisfactionthough its more than ive been accustomed to givefifteen shillings a week and find yourself there  with this handsome offer mr gregsbury once more threw himself back in his chair and looked like a man who had been most profligately liberal but is determined not to repent of it notwithstanding  fifteen shillings a week is not much said nicholas mildly  not much fifteen shillings a week not much young man cried mr gregsbury fifteen shillings a  pray do not suppose that i quarrel with the sum sir replied nicholas for i am not ashamed to confess that whatever it may be in itself to me it is a great deal but the duties and responsibilities make the recompense small and they are so very heavy that i fear to undertake them  do you decline to undertake them sir inquired mr gregsbury with his hand on the bellrope  i fear they are too great for my powers however good my will may be sir replied nicholas  that is as much as to say that you had rather not accept the place and that you consider fifteen shillings a week too little said mr gregsbury ringing do you decline it sir  i have no alternative but to do so replied nicholas  door matthews said mr gregsbury as the boy appeared  i am sorry i have troubled you unnecessarily sir said nicholas  i am sorry you have rejoined mr gregsbury turning his back upon him door matthews  goodmorning sir said nicholas  door matthews cried mr gregsbury  the boy beckoned nicholas and tumbling lazily downstairs before him opened the door and ushered him into the street with a sad and pensive air he retraced his steps homewards  smike had scraped a meal together from the remnant of last nights supper and was anxiously awaiting his return the occurrences of the morning had not improved nicholass appetite and by him the dinner remained untasted he was sitting in a thoughtful attitude with the plate which the poor fellow had assiduously filled with the choicest morsels untouched by his side when newman noggs looked into the room  come back asked newman  yes replied nicholas tired to death and what is worse might have remained at home for all the good i have done  couldnt expect to do much in one morning said newman  maybe so but i am sanguine and did expect said nicholas and am proportionately disappointed saying which he gave newman an account of his proceedings  if i could do anything said nicholas anything however slight until ralph nickleby returns and i have eased my mind by confronting him i should feel happier i should think it no disgrace to work heaven knows lying indolently here like a halftamed sullen beast distracts me  i dont know said newman small things offerthey would pay the rent and morebut you wouldnt like them no you could hardly be expected to undergo itno no  what could i hardly be expected to undergo asked nicholas raising his eyes show me in this wide waste of london any honest means by which i could even defray the weekly hire of this poor room and see if i shrink from resorting to them undergo i have undergone too much my friend to feel pride or squeamishness now except added nicholas hastily after a short silence except such squeamishness as is common honesty and so much pride as constitutes selfrespect i see little to choose between assistant to a brutal pedagogue and toadeater to a mean and ignorant upstart be he member or no member  i hardly know whether i should tell you what i heard this morning or not said newman  has it reference to what you said just now asked nicholas  it has  then in heavens name my good friend tell it me said nicholas for gods sake consider my deplorable condition and while i promise to take no step without taking counsel with you give me at least a vote in my own behalf  moved by this entreaty newman stammered forth a variety of most unaccountable and entangled sentences the upshot of which was that mrs kenwigs had examined him at great length that morning touching the origin of his acquaintance with and the whole life adventures and pedigree of nicholas that newman had parried these questions as long as he could but being at length hard pressed and driven into a corner had gone so far as to admit that nicholas was a tutor of great accomplishments involved in some misfortunes which he was not at liberty to explain and bearing the name of johnson that mrs kenwigs impelled by gratitude or ambition or maternal pride or maternal love or all four powerful motives conjointly had taken secret conference with mr kenwigs and had finally returned to propose that mr johnson should instruct the four miss kenwigses in the french language as spoken by natives at the weekly stipend of five shillings current coin of the realm being at the rate of one shilling per week per each miss kenwigs and one shilling over until such time as the baby might be able to take it out in grammar  which unless i am very much mistaken observed mrs kenwigs in making the proposition will not be very long for such clever children mr noggs never were born into this world i do believe  there said newman thats all its beneath you i know but i thought that perhaps you might  might cried nicholas with great alacrity of course i shall i accept the offer at once tell the worthy mother so without delay my dear fellow and that i am ready to begin whenever she pleases  newman hastened with joyful steps to inform mrs kenwigs of his friends acquiescence and soon returning brought back word that they would be happy to see him in the first floor as soon as convenient that mrs kenwigs had upon the instant sent out to secure a secondhand french grammar and dialogues which had long been fluttering in the sixpenny box at the bookstall round the corner and that the family highly excited at the prospect of this addition to their gentility wished the initiatory lesson to come off immediately  and here it may be observed that nicholas was not in the ordinary sense of the word a young man of high spirit he would resent an affront to himself or interpose to redress a wrong offered to another as boldly and freely as any knight that ever set lance in rest but he lacked that peculiar excess of coolness and greatminded selfishness which invariably distinguish gentlemen of high spirit in truth for our own part we are disposed to look upon such gentleman as being rather incumbrances than otherwise in rising families happening to be acquainted with several whose spirit prevents their settling down to any grovelling occupation and only displays itself in a tendency to cultivate moustachios and look fierce and although moustachios and ferocity are both very pretty things in their way and very much to be commended we confess to a desire to see them bred at the owners proper cost rather than at the expense of lowspirited people  nicholas therefore not being a highspirited young man according to common parlance and deeming it a greater degradation to borrow for the supply of his necessities from newman noggs than to teach french to the little kenwigses for five shillings a week accepted the offer with the alacrity already described and betook himself to the first floor with all convenient speed  here he was received by mrs kenwigs with a genteel air kindly intended to assure him of her protection and support and here too he found mr lillyvick and miss petowker the four miss kenwigses on their form of audience and the baby in a dwarf porters chair with a deal tray before it amusing himself with a toy horse without a head the said horse being composed of a small wooden cylinder not unlike an italian iron supported on four crooked pegs and painted in ingenious resemblance of red wafers set in blacking  how do you do mr johnson said mrs kenwigs unclemr johnson  how do you do sir said mr lillyvickrather sharply for he had not known what nicholas was on the previous night and it was rather an aggravating circumstance if a tax collector had been too polite to a teacher  mr johnson is engaged as private master to the children uncle said mrs kenwigs  so you said just now my dear replied mr lillyvick  but i hope said mrs kenwigs drawing herself up that that will not make them proud but that they will bless their own good fortune which has born them superior to common peoples children do you hear morleena  yes ma replied miss kenwigs  and when you go out in the streets or elsewhere i desire that you dont boast of it to the other children said mrs kenwigs and that if you must say anything about it you dont say no more than weve got a private master comes to teach us at home but we aint proud because ma says its sinful do you hear morleena  yes ma replied miss kenwigs again  then mind you recollect and do as i tell you said mrs kenwigs shall mr johnson begin uncle  i am ready to hear if mr johnson is ready to commence my dear said the collector assuming the air of a profound critic what sort of language do you consider french sir  how do you mean asked nicholas  do you consider it a good language sir said the collector a pretty language a sensible language  a pretty language certainly replied nicholas and as it has a name for everything and admits of elegant conversation about everything i presume it is a sensible one  i dont know said mr lillyvick doubtfully do you call it a cheerful language now  yes replied nicholas i should say it was certainly  its very much changed since my time then said the collector very much  was it a dismal one in your time asked nicholas scarcely able to repress a smile  very replied mr lillyvick with some vehemence of manner its the war time that i speak of the last war it may be a cheerful language i should be sorry to contradict anybody but i can only say that ive heard the french prisoners who were natives and ought to know how to speak it talking in such a dismal manner that it made one miserable to hear them ay that i have fifty times sirfifty times  mr lillyvick was waxing so cross that mrs kenwigs thought it expedient to motion to nicholas not to say anything and it was not until miss petowker had practised several blandishments to soften the excellent old gentleman that he deigned to break silence by asking  whats the water in french sir  leau replied nicholas  ah said mr lillyvick shaking his head mournfully i thought as much lo eh i dont think anything of that languagenothing at all  i suppose the children may begin uncle said mrs kenwigs  oh yes they may begin my dear replied the collector discontentedly i have no wish to prevent them  this permission being conceded the four miss kenwigses sat in a row with their tails all one way and morleena at the top while nicholas taking the book began his preliminary explanations miss petowker and mrs kenwigs looked on in silent admiration broken only by the whispered assurances of the latter that morleena would have it all by heart in no time and mr lillyvick regarded the group with frowning and attentive eyes lying in wait for something upon which he could open a fresh discussion on the language    chapter 17  follows the fortunes of miss nickleby   it was with a heavy heart and many sad forebodings which no effort could banish that kate nickleby on the morning appointed for the commencement of her engagement with madame mantalini left the city when its clocks yet wanted a quarter of an hour of eight and threaded her way alone amid the noise and bustle of the streets towards the west end of london  at this early hour many sickly girls whose business like that of the poor worm is to produce with patient toil the finery that bedecks the thoughtless and luxurious traverse our streets making towards the scene of their daily labour and catching as if by stealth in their hurried walk the only gasp of wholesome air and glimpse of sunlight which cheer their monotonous existence during the long train of hours that make a working day as she drew nigh to the more fashionable quarter of the town kate marked many of this class as they passed by hurrying like herself to their painful occupation and saw in their unhealthy looks and feeble gait but too clear an evidence that her misgivings were not wholly groundless  she arrived at madame mantalinis some minutes before the appointed hour and after walking a few times up and down in the hope that some other female might arrive and spare her the embarrassment of stating her business to the servant knocked timidly at the door which after some delay was opened by the footman who had been putting on his striped jacket as he came upstairs and was now intent on fastening his apron  is madame mantalini in faltered kate  not often out at this time miss replied the man in a tone which rendered miss something more offensive than my dear  can i see her asked kate  eh replied the man holding the door in his hand and honouring the inquirer with a stare and a broad grin lord no  i came by her own appointment said kate i ami amto be employed here  oh you should have rung the workers bell said the footman touching the handle of one in the doorpost let me see though i forgotmiss nickleby is it  yes replied kate  youre to walk upstairs then please said the man madame mantalini wants to see youthis waytake care of these things on the floor  cautioning her in these terms not to trip over a heterogeneous litter of pastrycooks trays lamps waiters full of glasses and piles of rout seats which were strewn about the hall plainly bespeaking a late party on the previous night the man led the way to the second story and ushered kate into a backroom communicating by foldingdoors with the apartment in which she had first seen the mistress of the establishment  if youll wait here a minute said the man ill tell her presently having made this promise with much affability he retired and left kate alone  there was not much to amuse in the room of which the most attractive feature was a halflength portrait in oil of mr mantalini whom the artist had depicted scratching his head in an easy manner and thus displaying to advantage a diamond ring the gift of madame mantalini before her marriage there was however the sound of voices in conversation in the next room and as the conversation was loud and the partition thin kate could not help discovering that they belonged to mr and mrs mantalini  if you will be odiously demnebly outrigeously jealous my soul said mr mantalini you will be very miserablehorrid miserabledemnition miserable and then there was a sound as though mr mantalini were sipping his coffee  i am miserable returned madame mantalini evidently pouting  then you are an ungrateful unworthy demd unthankful little fairy said mr mantalini  i am not returned madame with a sob  do not put itself out of humour said mr mantalini breaking an egg it is a pretty bewitching little demd countenance and it should not be out of humour for it spoils its loveliness and makes it cross and gloomy like a frightful naughty demd hobgoblin  i am not to be brought round in that way always rejoined madame sulkily  it shall be brought round in any way it likes best and not brought round at all if it likes that better retorted mr mantalini with his eggspoon in his mouth  its very easy to talk said mrs mantalini  not so easy when one is eating a demnition egg replied mr mantalini for the yolk runs down the waistcoat and yolk of egg does not match any waistcoat but a yellow waistcoat demmit  you were flirting with her during the whole night said madame mantalini apparently desirous to lead the conversation back to the point from which it had strayed  no no my life  you were said madame i had my eye upon you all the time  bless the little winking twinkling eye was it on me all the time cried mantalini in a sort of lazy rapture oh demmit  and i say once more resumed madame that you ought not to waltz with anybody but your own wife and i will not bear it mantalini if i take poison first  she will not take poison and have horrid pains will she said mantalini who by the altered sound of his voice seemed to have moved his chair and taken up his position nearer to his wife she will not take poison because she had a demd fine husband who might have married two countesses and a dowager  two countesses interposed madame you told me one before  two cried mantalini two demd fine women real countesses and splendid fortunes demmit  and why didnt you asked madame playfully  why didnt i replied her husband had i not seen at a morning concert the demdest little fascinator in all the world and while that little fascinator is my wife may not all the countesses and dowagers in england be  mr mantalini did not finish the sentence but he gave madame mantalini a very loud kiss which madame mantalini returned after which there seemed to be some more kissing mixed up with the progress of the breakfast  and what about the cash my existences jewel said mantalini when these endearments ceased how much have we in hand  very little indeed replied madame  we must have some more said mantalini we must have some discount out of old nickleby to carry on the war with demmit  you cant want any more just now said madame coaxingly  my life and soul returned her husband there is a horse for sale at scrubbss which it would be a sin and a crime to losegoing my senses joy for nothing  for nothing cried madame i am glad of that  for actually nothing replied mantalini a hundred guineas down will buy him mane and crest and legs and tail all of the demdest beauty i will ride him in the park before the very chariots of the rejected countesses the demd old dowager will faint with grief and rage the other two will say he is married he has made away with himself it is a demd thing it is all up they will hate each other demnebly and wish you dead and buried ha ha demmit  madame mantalinis prudence if she had any was not proof against these triumphal pictures after a little jingling of keys she observed that she would see what her desk contained and rising for that purpose opened the foldingdoor and walked into the room where kate was seated  dear me child exclaimed madame mantalini recoiling in surprise how came you here  child cried mantalini hurrying in how cameehohdemmit how dye do  i have been waiting here some time maam said kate addressing madame mantalini the servant must have forgotten to let you know that i was here i think  you really must see to that man said madame turning to her husband he forgets everything  i will twist his demd nose off his countenance for leaving such a very pretty creature all alone by herself said her husband  mantalini cried madame you forget yourself  i dont forget you my soul and never shall and never can said mantalini kissing his wifes hand and grimacing aside to miss nickleby who turned away  appeased by this compliment the lady of the business took some papers from her desk which she handed over to mr mantalini who received them with great delight she then requested kate to follow her and after several feints on the part of mr mantalini to attract the young ladys attention they went away leaving that gentleman extended at full length on the sofa with his heels in the air and a newspaper in his hand  madame mantalini led the way down a flight of stairs and through a passage to a large room at the back of the premises where were a number of young women employed in sewing cutting out making up altering and various other processes known only to those who are cunning in the arts of millinery and dressmaking it was a close room with a skylight and as dull and quiet as a room need be  on madame mantalini calling aloud for miss knag a short bustling overdressed female full of importance presented herself and all the young ladies suspending their operations for the moment whispered to each other sundry criticisms upon the make and texture of miss nicklebys dress her complexion cast of features and personal appearance with as much good breeding as could have been displayed by the very best society in a crowded ballroom  oh miss knag said madame mantalini this is the young person i spoke to you about  miss knag bestowed a reverential smile upon madame mantalini which she dexterously transformed into a gracious one for kate and said that certainly although it was a great deal of trouble to have young people who were wholly unused to the business still she was sure the young person would try to do her bestimpressed with which conviction she miss knag felt an interest in her already  i think that for the present at all events it will be better for miss nickleby to come into the showroom with you and try things on for people said madame mantalini she will not be able for the present to be of much use in any other way and her appearance will  suit very well with mine madame mantalini interrupted miss knag so it will and to be sure i might have known that you would not be long in finding that out for you have so much taste in all those matters that really as i often say to the young ladies i do not know how when or where you possibly could have acquired all you knowhemmiss nickleby and i are quite a pair madame mantalini only i am a little darker than miss nickleby andhemi think my foot may be a little smaller miss nickleby i am sure will not be offended at my saying that when she hears that our family always have been celebrated for small feet ever sincehemever since our family had any feet at all indeed i think i had an uncle once madame mantalini who lived in cheltenham and had a most excellent business as a tobacconisthemwho had such small feet that they were no bigger than those which are usually joined to wooden legsthe most symmetrical feet madame mantalini that even you can imagine  they must have had something of the appearance of club feet miss knag said madame  well now that is so like you returned miss knag ha ha ha of club feet oh very good as i often remark to the young ladies well i must say and i do not care who knows it of all the ready humourhemi ever heard anywhereand i have heard a good deal for when my dear brother was alive i kept house for him miss nickleby we had to supper once a week two or three young men highly celebrated in those days for their humour madame mantaliniof all the ready humour i say to the young ladies i ever heard madame mantalinis is the most remarkablehem it is so gentle so sarcastic and yet so goodnatured as i was observing to miss simmonds only this morning that how or when or by what means she acquired it is to me a mystery indeed  here miss knag paused to take breath and while she pauses it may be observednot that she was marvellously loquacious and marvellously deferential to madame mantalini since these are facts which require no comment but that every now and then she was accustomed in the torrent of her discourse to introduce a loud shrill clear hem the import and meaning of which was variously interpreted by her acquaintance some holding that miss knag dealt in exaggeration and introduced the monosyllable when any fresh invention was in course of coinage in her brain others that when she wanted a word she threw it in to gain time and prevent anybody else from striking into the conversation it may be further remarked that miss knag still aimed at youth although she had shot beyond it years ago and that she was weak and vain and one of those people who are best described by the axiom that you may trust them as far as you can see them and no farther  youll take care that miss nickleby understands her hours and so forth said madame mantalini and so ill leave her with you youll not forget my directions miss knag  miss knag of course replied that to forget anything madame mantalini had directed was a moral impossibility and that lady dispensing a general goodmorning among her assistants sailed away  charming creature isnt she miss nickleby said miss knag rubbing her hands together  i have seen very little of her said kate i hardly know yet  have you seen mr mantalini inquired miss knag  yes i have seen him twice  isnt he a charming creature  indeed he does not strike me as being so by any means replied kate  no my dear cried miss knag elevating her hands why goodness gracious mercy wheres your taste such a fine tall fullwhiskered dashing gentlemanly man with such teeth and hair andhemwell now you do astonish me  i dare say i am very foolish replied kate laying aside her bonnet but as my opinion is of very little importance to him or anyone else i do not regret having formed it and shall be slow to change it i think  he is a very fine man dont you think so asked one of the young ladies  indeed he may be for anything i could say to the contrary replied kate  and drives very beautiful horses doesnt he inquired another  i dare say he may but i never saw them answered kate  never saw them interposed miss knag oh well there it is at once you know how can you possibly pronounce an opinion about a gentlemanhemif you dont see him as he turns out altogether  there was so much of the worldeven of the little world of the country girlin this idea of the old milliner that kate who was anxious for every reason to change the subject made no further remark and left miss knag in possession of the field  after a short silence during which most of the young people made a closer inspection of kates appearance and compared notes respecting it one of them offered to help her off with her shawl and the offer being accepted inquired whether she did not find black very uncomfortable wear  i do indeed replied kate with a bitter sigh  so dusty and hot observed the same speaker adjusting her dress for her  kate might have said that mourning is sometimes the coldest wear which mortals can assume that it not only chills the breasts of those it clothes but extending its influence to summer friends freezes up their sources of goodwill and kindness and withering all the buds of promise they once so liberally put forth leaves nothing but bared and rotten hearts exposed there are few who have lost a friend or relative constituting in life their sole dependence who have not keenly felt this chilling influence of their sable garb she had felt it acutely and feeling it at the moment could not quite restrain her tears  i am very sorry to have wounded you by my thoughtless speech said her companion i did not think of it you are in mourning for some near relation  for my father answered kate  for what relation miss simmonds asked miss knag in an audible voice  her father replied the other softly  her father eh said miss knag without the slightest depression of her voice ah a long illness miss simmonds  hush replied the girl i dont know  our misfortune was very sudden said kate turning away or i might perhaps at a time like this be enabled to support it better  there had existed not a little desire in the room according to invariable custom when any new young person came to know who kate was and what she was and all about her but although it might have been very naturally increased by her appearance and emotion the knowledge that it pained her to be questioned was sufficient to repress even this curiosity and miss knag finding it hopeless to attempt extracting any further particulars just then reluctantly commanded silence and bade the work proceed  in silence then the tasks were plied until halfpast one when a baked leg of mutton with potatoes to correspond were served in the kitchen the meal over and the young ladies having enjoyed the additional relaxation of washing their hands the work began again and was again performed in silence until the noise of carriages rattling through the streets and of loud double knocks at doors gave token that the days work of the more fortunate members of society was proceeding in its turn  one of these double knocks at madame mantalinis door announced the equipage of some great ladyor rather rich one for there is occasionally a distinction between riches and greatnesswho had come with her daughter to approve of some courtdresses which had been a long time preparing and upon whom kate was deputed to wait accompanied by miss knag and officered of course by madame mantalini  kates part in the pageant was humble enough her duties being limited to holding articles of costume until miss knag was ready to try them on and now and then tying a string or fastening a hookandeye she might not unreasonably have supposed herself beneath the reach of any arrogance or bad humour but it happened that the lady and daughter were both out of temper that day and the poor girl came in for her share of their revilings she was awkwardher hands were colddirtycoarseshe could do nothing right they wondered how madame mantalini could have such people about her requested they might see some other young woman the next time they came and so forth  so common an occurrence would be hardly deserving of mention but for its effect kate shed many bitter tears when these people were gone and felt for the first time humbled by her occupation she had it is true quailed at the prospect of drudgery and hard service but she had felt no degradation in working for her bread until she found herself exposed to insolence and pride philosophy would have taught her that the degradation was on the side of those who had sunk so low as to display such passions habitually and without cause but she was too young for such consolation and her honest feeling was hurt may not the complaint that common people are above their station often take its rise in the fact of uncommon people being below theirs  in such scenes and occupations the time wore on until nine oclock when kate jaded and dispirited with the occurrences of the day hastened from the confinement of the workroom to join her mother at the street corner and walk homethe more sadly from having to disguise her real feelings and feign to participate in all the sanguine visions of her companion  bless my soul kate said mrs nickleby ive been thinking all day what a delightful thing it would be for madame mantalini to take you into partnershipsuch a likely thing too you know why your poor dear papas cousins sisterinlawa miss browndockwas taken into partnership by a lady that kept a school at hammersmith and made her fortune in no time at all i forget bythebye whether that miss browndock was the same lady that got the ten thousand pounds prize in the lottery but i think she was indeed now i come to think of it i am sure she was mantalini and nickleby how well it would soundand if nicholas has any good fortune you might have doctor nickleby the headmaster of westminster school living in the same street  dear nicholas cried kate taking from her reticule her brothers letter from dotheboys hall in all our misfortunes how happy it makes me mama to hear he is doing well and to find him writing in such good spirits it consoles me for all we may undergo to think that he is comfortable and happy  poor kate she little thought how weak her consolation was and how soon she would be undeceived    chapter 18  miss knag after doting on kate nickleby for three whole days makes up her mind to hate her for evermore the causes which led miss knag to form this resolution   there are many lives of much pain hardship and suffering which having no stirring interest for any but those who lead them are disregarded by persons who do not want thought or feeling but who pamper their compassion and need high stimulants to rouse it  there are not a few among the disciples of charity who require in their vocation scarcely less excitement than the votaries of pleasure in theirs and hence it is that diseased sympathy and compassion are every day expended on outoftheway objects when only too many demands upon the legitimate exercise of the same virtues in a healthy state are constantly within the sight and hearing of the most unobservant person alive in short charity must have its romance as the novelist or playwright must have his a thief in fustian is a vulgar character scarcely to be thought of by persons of refinement but dress him in green velvet with a highcrowned hat and change the scene of his operations from a thicklypeopled city to a mountain road and you shall find in him the very soul of poetry and adventure so it is with the one great cardinal virtue which properly nourished and exercised leads to if it does not necessarily include all the others it must have its romance and the less of real hard struggling workaday life there is in that romance the better  the life to which poor kate nickleby was devoted in consequence of the unforeseen train of circumstances already developed in this narrative was a hard one but lest the very dulness unhealthy confinement and bodily fatigue which made up its sum and substance should deprive it of any interest with the mass of the charitable and sympathetic i would rather keep miss nickleby herself in view just now than chill them in the outset by a minute and lengthened description of the establishment presided over by madame mantalini  well now indeed madame mantalini said miss knag as kate was taking her weary way homewards on the first night of her novitiate that miss nickleby is a very creditable young persona very creditable young person indeedhemupon my word madame mantalini it does very extraordinary credit even to your discrimination that you should have found such a very excellent very wellbehaved veryhemvery unassuming young woman to assist in the fitting on i have seen some young women when they had the opportunity of displaying before their betters behave in such aoh dearwellbut youre always right madame mantalini always and as i very often tell the young ladies how you do contrive to be always right when so many people are so often wrong is to me a mystery indeed  beyond putting a very excellent client out of humour miss nickleby has not done anything very remarkable todaythat i am aware of at least said madame mantalini in reply  oh dear said miss knag but you must allow a great deal for inexperience you know  and youth inquired madame  oh i say nothing about that madame mantalini replied miss knag reddening because if youth were any excuse you wouldnt have  quite so good a forewoman as i have i suppose suggested madame  well i never did know anybody like you madame mantalini rejoined miss knag most complacently and thats the fact for you know what ones going to say before it has time to rise to ones lips oh very good ha ha ha  for myself observed madame mantalini glancing with affected carelessness at her assistant and laughing heartily in her sleeve i consider miss nickleby the most awkward girl i ever saw in my life  poor dear thing said miss knag its not her fault if it was we might hope to cure it but as its her misfortune madame mantalini why really you know as the man said about the blind horse we ought to respect it  her uncle told me she had been considered pretty remarked madame mantalini i think her one of the most ordinary girls i ever met with  ordinary cried miss knag with a countenance beaming delight and awkward well all i can say is madame mantalini that i quite love the poor girl and that if she was twice as indifferentlooking and twice as awkward as she is i should be only so much the more her friend and thats the truth of it  in fact miss knag had conceived an incipient affection for kate nickleby after witnessing her failure that morning and this short conversation with her superior increased the favourable prepossession to a most surprising extent which was the more remarkable as when she first scanned that young ladys face and figure she had entertained certain inward misgivings that they would never agree  but now said miss knag glancing at the reflection of herself in a mirror at no great distance i love heri quite love heri declare i do  of such a highly disinterested quality was this devoted friendship and so superior was it to the little weaknesses of flattery or illnature that the kindhearted miss knag candidly informed kate nickleby next day that she saw she would never do for the business but that she need not give herself the slightest uneasiness on this account for that she miss knag by increased exertions on her own part would keep her as much as possible in the background and that all she would have to do would be to remain perfectly quiet before company and to shrink from attracting notice by every means in her power this last suggestion was so much in accordance with the timid girls own feelings and wishes that she readily promised implicit reliance on the excellent spinsters advice without questioning or indeed bestowing a moments reflection upon the motives that dictated it  i take quite a lively interest in you my dear soul upon my word said miss knag a sisters interest actually its the most singular circumstance i ever knew  undoubtedly it was singular that if miss knag did feel a strong interest in kate nickleby it should not rather have been the interest of a maiden aunt or grandmother that being the conclusion to which the difference in their respective ages would have naturally tended but miss knag wore clothes of a very youthful pattern and perhaps her feelings took the same shape  bless you said miss knag bestowing a kiss upon kate at the conclusion of the second days work how very awkward you have been all day  i fear your kind and open communication which has rendered me more painfully conscious of my own defects has not improved me sighed kate  no no i dare say not rejoined miss knag in a most uncommon flow of good humour but how much better that you should know it at first and so be able to go on straight and comfortable which way are you walking my love  towards the city replied kate  the city cried miss knag regarding herself with great favour in the glass as she tied her bonnet goodness gracious me now do you really live in the city  is it so very unusual for anybody to live there asked kate half smiling  i couldnt have believed it possible that any young woman could have lived there under any circumstances whatever for three days together replied miss knag  reducedi should say poor people answered kate correcting herself hastily for she was afraid of appearing proud must live where they can  ah very true so they must very proper indeed rejoined miss knag with that sort of halfsigh which accompanied by two or three slight nods of the head is pitys small change in general society and thats what i very often tell my brother when our servants go away ill one after another and he thinks the backkitchens rather too damp for em to sleep in these sort of people i tell him are glad to sleep anywhere heaven suits the back to the burden what a nice thing it is to think that it should be so isnt it  very replied kate  ill walk with you part of the way my dear said miss knag for you must go very near our house and as its quite dark and our last servant went to the hospital a week ago with st anthonys fire in her face i shall be glad of your company  kate would willingly have excused herself from this flattering companionship but miss knag having adjusted her bonnet to her entire satisfaction took her arm with an air which plainly showed how much she felt the compliment she was conferring and they were in the street before she could say another word  i fear said kate hesitating that mamamy mother i meanis waiting for me  you neednt make the least apology my dear said miss knag smiling sweetly as she spoke i dare say she is a very respectable old person and i shall be quitehemquite pleased to know her  as poor mrs nickleby was coolingnot her heels alone but her limbs generally at the street corner kate had no alternative but to make her known to miss knag who doing the last new carriage customer at secondhand acknowledged the introduction with condescending politeness the three then walked away arm in arm with miss knag in the middle in a special state of amiability  i have taken such a fancy to your daughter mrs nickleby you cant think said miss knag after she had proceeded a little distance in dignified silence  i am delighted to hear it said mrs nickleby though it is nothing new to me that even strangers should like kate  hem cried miss knag  you will like her better when you know how good she is said mrs nickleby it is a great blessing to me in my misfortunes to have a child who knows neither pride nor vanity and whose bringingup might very well have excused a little of both at first you dont know what it is to lose a husband miss knag  as miss knag had never yet known what it was to gain one it followed very nearly as a matter of course that she didnt know what it was to lose one so she said in some haste no indeed i dont and said it with an air intending to signify that she should like to catch herself marrying anybodyno no she knew better than that  kate has improved even in this little time i have no doubt said mrs nickleby glancing proudly at her daughter  oh of course said miss knag  and will improve still more added mrs nickleby  that she will ill be bound replied miss knag squeezing kates arm in her own to point the joke  she always was clever said poor mrs nickleby brightening up always from a baby i recollect when she was only two years and a half old that a gentleman who used to visit very much at our housemr watkins you know kate my dear that your poor papa went bail for who afterwards ran away to the united states and sent us a pair of snow shoes with such an affectionate letter that it made your poor dear father cry for a week you remember the letter in which he said that he was very sorry he couldnt repay the fifty pounds just then because his capital was all out at interest and he was very busy making his fortune but that he didnt forget you were his goddaughter and he should take it very unkind if we didnt buy you a silver coral and put it down to his old account dear me yes my dear how stupid you are and spoke so affectionately of the old port wine that he used to drink a bottle and a half of every time he came you must remember kate  yes yes mama what of him  why that mr watkins my dear said mrs nickleby slowly as if she were making a tremendous effort to recollect something of paramount importance that mr watkinshe wasnt any relation miss knag will understand to the watkins who kept the old boar in the village bythebye i dont remember whether it was the old boar or the george the third but it was one of the two i know and its much the samethat mr watkins said when you were only two years and a half old that you were one of the most astonishing children he ever saw he did indeed miss knag and he wasnt at all fond of children and couldnt have had the slightest motive for doing it i know it was he who said so because i recollect as well as if it was only yesterday his borrowing twenty pounds of her poor dear papa the very moment afterwards  having quoted this extraordinary and most disinterested testimony to her daughters excellence mrs nickleby stopped to breathe and miss knag finding that the discourse was turning upon family greatness lost no time in striking in with a small reminiscence on her own account  dont talk of lending money mrs nickleby said miss knag or youll drive me crazy perfectly crazy my mamahemwas the most lovely and beautiful creature with the most striking and exquisitehemthe most exquisite nose that ever was put upon a human face i do believe mrs nickleby here miss knag rubbed her own nose sympathetically the most delightful and accomplished woman perhaps that ever was seen but she had that one failing of lending money and carried it to such an extent that she lenthemoh thousands of pounds all our little fortunes and whats more mrs nickleby i dont think if we were to live tilltillhemtill the very end of time that we should ever get them back again i dont indeed  after concluding this effort of invention without being interrupted miss knag fell into many more recollections no less interesting than true the full tide of which mrs nickleby in vain attempting to stem at length sailed smoothly down by adding an undercurrent of her own recollections and so both ladies went on talking together in perfect contentment the only difference between them being that whereas miss knag addressed herself to kate and talked very loud mrs nickleby kept on in one unbroken monotonous flow perfectly satisfied to be talking and caring very little whether anybody listened or not  in this manner they walked on very amicably until they arrived at miss knags brothers who was an ornamental stationer and small circulating library keeper in a bystreet off tottenham court road and who let out by the day week month or year the newest old novels whereof the titles were displayed in penandink characters on a sheet of pasteboard swinging at his doorpost as miss knag happened at the moment to be in the middle of an account of her twentysecond offer from a gentleman of large property she insisted upon their all going in to supper together and in they went  dont go away mortimer said miss knag as they entered the shop its only one of our young ladies and her mother mrs and miss nickleby  oh indeed said mr mortimer knag ah  having given utterance to these ejaculations with a very profound and thoughtful air mr knag slowly snuffed two kitchen candles on the counter and two more in the window and then snuffed himself from a box in his waistcoat pocket  there was something very impressive in the ghostly air with which all this was done and as mr knag was a tall lank gentleman of solemn features wearing spectacles and garnished with much less hair than a gentleman bordering on forty or thereabouts usually boasts mrs nickleby whispered her daughter that she thought he must be literary  past ten said mr knag consulting his watch thomas close the warehouse  thomas was a boy nearly half as tall as a shutter and the warehouse was a shop about the size of three hackney coaches  ah said mr knag once more heaving a deep sigh as he restored to its parent shelf the book he had been reading wellyesi believe supper is ready sister  with another sigh mr knag took up the kitchen candles from the counter and preceded the ladies with mournful steps to a backparlour where a charwoman employed in the absence of the sick servant and remunerated with certain eighteenpences to be deducted from her wages due was putting the supper out  mrs blockson said miss knag reproachfully how very often i have begged you not to come into the room with your bonnet on  i cant help it miss knag said the charwoman bridling up on the shortest notice theres been a deal ocleaning to do in this house and if you dont like it i must trouble you to look out for somebody else for it dont hardly pay me and thats the truth if i was to be hung this minute  i dont want any remarks if you please said miss knag with a strong emphasis on the personal pronoun is there any fire downstairs for some hot water presently  no there is not indeed miss knag replied the substitute and so i wont tell you no stories about it  then why isnt there said miss knag  because there arnt no coals left out and if i could make coals i would but as i cant i wont and so i make bold to tell you mem replied mrs blockson  will you hold your tonguefemale said mr mortimer knag plunging violently into this dialogue  by your leave mr knag retorted the charwoman turning sharp round im only too glad not to speak in this house excepting when and where im spoke to sir and with regard to being a female sir i should wish to know what you considered yourself  a miserable wretch exclaimed mr knag striking his forehead a miserable wretch  im very glad to find that you dont call yourself out of your name sir said mrs blockson and as i had two twin children the day before yesterday was only seven weeks and my little charley fell down a airy and put his elber out last monday i shall take it as a favour if youll send nine shillings for one weeks work to my house afore the clock strikes ten tomorrow  with these parting words the good woman quitted the room with great ease of manner leaving the door wide open mr knag at the same moment flung himself into the warehouse and groaned aloud  what is the matter with that gentleman pray inquired mrs nickleby greatly disturbed by the sound  is he ill inquired kate really alarmed  hush replied miss knag a most melancholy history he was once most devotedly attached tohemto madame mantalini  bless me exclaimed mrs nickleby  yes continued miss knag and received great encouragement too and confidently hoped to marry her he has a most romantic heart mrs nickleby as indeedhemas indeed all our family have and the disappointment was a dreadful blow he is a wonderfully accomplished manmost extraordinarily accomplishedreadshemreads every novel that comes out i mean every novel thathemthat has any fashion in it of course the fact is that he did find so much in the books he read applicable to his own misfortunes and did find himself in every respect so much like the heroesbecause of course he is conscious of his own superiority as we all are and very naturallythat he took to scorning everything and became a genius and i am quite sure that he is at this very present moment writing another book  another book repeated kate finding that a pause was left for somebody to say something  yes said miss knag nodding in great triumph another book in three volumes post octavo of course its a great advantage to him in all his little fashionable descriptions to have the benefit of myhemof my experience because of course few authors who write about such things can have such opportunities of knowing them as i have hes so wrapped up in high life that the least allusion to business or worldly matterslike that woman just now for instancequite distracts him but as i often say i think his disappointment a great thing for him because if he hadnt been disappointed he couldnt have written about blighted hopes and all that and the fact is if it hadnt happened as it has i dont believe his genius would ever have come out at all  how much more communicative miss knag might have become under more favourable circumstances it is impossible to divine but as the gloomy one was within earshot and the fire wanted making up her disclosures stopped here to judge from all appearances and the difficulty of making the water warm the last servant could not have been much accustomed to any other fire than st anthonys but a little brandy and water was made at last and the guests having been previously regaled with cold leg of mutton and bread and cheese soon afterwards took leave kate amusing herself all the way home with the recollection of her last glimpse of mr mortimer knag deeply abstracted in the shop and mrs nickleby by debating within herself whether the dressmaking firm would ultimately become mantalini knag and nickleby or mantalini nickleby and knag  at this high point miss knags friendship remained for three whole days much to the wonderment of madame mantalinis young ladies who had never beheld such constancy in that quarter before but on the fourth it received a check no less violent than sudden which thus occurred  it happened that an old lord of great family who was going to marry a young lady of no family in particular came with the young lady and the young ladys sister to witness the ceremony of trying on two nuptial bonnets which had been ordered the day before and madame mantalini announcing the fact in a shrill treble through the speakingpipe which communicated with the workroom miss knag darted hastily upstairs with a bonnet in each hand and presented herself in the showroom in a charming state of palpitation intended to demonstrate her enthusiasm in the cause the bonnets were no sooner fairly on than miss knag and madame mantalini fell into convulsions of admiration  a most elegant appearance said madame mantalini  i never saw anything so exquisite in all my life said miss knag  now the old lord who was a very old lord said nothing but mumbled and chuckled in a state of great delight no less with the nuptial bonnets and their wearers than with his own address in getting such a fine woman for his wife and the young lady who was a very lively young lady seeing the old lord in this rapturous condition chased the old lord behind a chevalglass and then and there kissed him while madame mantalini and the other young lady looked discreetly another way  but pending the salutation miss knag who was tinged with curiosity stepped accidentally behind the glass and encountered the lively young ladys eye just at the very moment when she kissed the old lord upon which the young lady in a pouting manner murmured something about an old thing and great impertinence and finished by darting a look of displeasure at miss knag and smiling contemptuously  madame mantalini said the young lady  maam said madame mantalini  pray have up that pretty young creature we saw yesterday  oh yes do said the sister  of all things in the world madame mantalini said the lords intended throwing herself languidly on a sofa i hate being waited upon by frights or elderly persons let me always see that young creature i beg whenever i come  by all means said the old lord the lovely young creature by all means  everybody is talking about her said the young lady in the same careless manner and my lord being a great admirer of beauty must positively see her  she is universally admired replied madame mantalini miss knag send up miss nickleby you neednt return  i beg your pardon madame mantalini what did you say last asked miss knag trembling  you neednt return repeated the superior sharply miss knag vanished without another word and in all reasonable time was replaced by kate who took off the new bonnets and put on the old ones blushing very much to find that the old lord and the two young ladies were staring her out of countenance all the time  why how you colour child said the lords chosen bride  she is not quite so accustomed to her business as she will be in a week or two interposed madame mantalini with a gracious smile  i am afraid you have been giving her some of your wicked looks my lord said the intended  no no no replied the old lord no no im going to be married and lead a new life ha ha ha a new life a new life ha ha ha  it was a satisfactory thing to hear that the old gentleman was going to lead a new life for it was pretty evident that his old one would not last him much longer the mere exertion of protracted chuckling reduced him to a fearful ebb of coughing and gasping it was some minutes before he could find breath to remark that the girl was too pretty for a milliner  i hope you dont think good looks a disqualification for the business my lord said madame mantalini simpering  not by any means replied the old lord or you would have left it long ago  you naughty creature said the lively lady poking the peer with her parasol i wont have you talk so how dare you  this playful inquiry was accompanied with another poke and another and then the old lord caught the parasol and wouldnt give it up again which induced the other lady to come to the rescue and some very pretty sportiveness ensued  you will see that those little alterations are made madame mantalini said the lady nay you bad man you positively shall go first i wouldnt leave you behind with that pretty girl not for half a second i know you too well jane my dear let him go first and we shall be quite sure of him  the old lord evidently much flattered by this suspicion bestowed a grotesque leer upon kate as he passed and receiving another tap with the parasol for his wickedness tottered downstairs to the door where his sprightly body was hoisted into the carriage by two stout footmen  foh said madame mantalini how he ever gets into a carriage without thinking of a hearse i cant think there take the things away my dear take them away  kate who had remained during the whole scene with her eyes modestly fixed upon the ground was only too happy to avail herself of the permission to retire and hasten joyfully downstairs to miss knags dominion  the circumstances of the little kingdom had greatly changed however during the short period of her absence in place of miss knag being stationed in her accustomed seat preserving all the dignity and greatness of madame mantalinis representative that worthy soul was reposing on a large box bathed in tears while three or four of the young ladies in close attendance upon her together with the presence of hartshorn vinegar and other restoratives would have borne ample testimony even without the derangement of the headdress and front row of curls to her having fainted desperately  bless me said kate stepping hastily forward what is the matter  this inquiry produced in miss knag violent symptoms of a relapse and several young ladies darting angry looks at kate applied more vinegar and hartshorn and said it was a shame  what is a shame demanded kate what is the matter what has happened tell me  matter cried miss knag coming all at once bolt upright to the great consternation of the assembled maidens matter fie upon you you nasty creature  gracious cried kate almost paralysed by the violence with which the adjective had been jerked out from between miss knags closed teeth have i offended you  you offended me retorted miss knag you a chit a child an upstart nobody oh indeed ha ha  now it was evident as miss knag laughed that something struck her as being exceedingly funny and as the young ladies took their tone from miss knagshe being the chiefthey all got up a laugh without a moments delay and nodded their heads a little and smiled sarcastically to each other as much as to say how very good that was  here she is continued miss knag getting off the box and introducing kate with much ceremony and many low curtseys to the delighted throng here she iseverybody is talking about herthe belle ladiesthe beauty theoh you boldfaced thing  at this crisis miss knag was unable to repress a virtuous shudder which immediately communicated itself to all the young ladies after which miss knag laughed and after that cried  for fifteen years exclaimed miss knag sobbing in a most affecting manner for fifteen years have i been the credit and ornament of this room and the one upstairs thank god said miss knag stamping first her right foot and then her left with remarkable energy i have never in all that time till now been exposed to the arts the vile arts of a creature who disgraces us with all her proceedings and makes proper people blush for themselves but i feel it i do feel it although i am disgusted  miss knag here relapsed into softness and the young ladies renewing their attentions murmured that she ought to be superior to such things and that for their part they despised them and considered them beneath their notice in witness whereof they called out more emphatically than before that it was a shame and that they felt so angry they did they hardly knew what to do with themselves  have i lived to this day to be called a fright cried miss knag suddenly becoming convulsive and making an effort to tear her front off  oh no no replied the chorus pray dont say so dont now  have i deserved to be called an elderly person screamed miss knag wrestling with the supernumeraries  dont think of such things dear answered the chorus  i hate her cried miss knag i detest and hate her never let her speak to me again never let anybody who is a friend of mine speak to her a slut a hussy an impudent artful hussy having denounced the object of her wrath in these terms miss knag screamed once hiccuped thrice gurgled in her throat several times slumbered shivered woke came to composed her headdress and declared herself quite well again  poor kate had regarded these proceedings at first in perfect bewilderment she had then turned red and pale by turns and once or twice essayed to speak but as the true motives of this altered behaviour developed themselves she retired a few paces and looked calmly on without deigning a reply nevertheless although she walked proudly to her seat and turned her back upon the group of little satellites who clustered round their ruling planet in the remotest corner of the room she gave way in secret to some such bitter tears as would have gladdened miss knags inmost soul if she could have seen them fall    chapter 19  descriptive of a dinner at mr ralph nicklebys and of the manner in which the company entertained themselves before dinner at dinner and after dinner   the bile and rancour of the worthy miss knag undergoing no diminution during the remainder of the week but rather augmenting with every successive hour and the honest ire of all the young ladies rising or seeming to rise in exact proportion to the good spinsters indignation and both waxing very hot every time miss nickleby was called upstairs it will be readily imagined that that young ladys daily life was none of the most cheerful or enviable kind she hailed the arrival of saturday night as a prisoner would a few delicious hours respite from slow and wearing torture and felt that the poor pittance for her first weeks labour would have been dearly and hardly earned had its amount been trebled  when she joined her mother as usual at the street corner she was not a little surprised to find her in conversation with mr ralph nickleby but her surprise was soon redoubled no less by the matter of their conversation than by the smoothed and altered manner of mr nickleby himself  ah my dear said ralph we were at that moment talking about you  indeed replied kate shrinking though she scarce knew why from her uncles cold glistening eye  that instant said ralph i was coming to call for you making sure to catch you before you left but your mother and i have been talking over family affairs and the time has slipped away so rapidly  well now hasnt it interposed mrs nickleby quite insensible to the sarcastic tone of ralphs last remark upon my word i couldnt have believed it possible that such akate my dear youre to dine with your uncle at halfpast six oclock tomorrow  triumphing in having been the first to communicate this extraordinary intelligence mrs nickleby nodded and smiled a great many times to impress its full magnificence on kates wondering mind and then flew off at an acute angle to a committee of ways and means  let me see said the good lady your black silk frock will be quite dress enough my dear with that pretty little scarf and a plain band in your hair and a pair of black silk stockdear dear cried mrs nickleby flying off at another angle if i had but those unfortunate amethysts of mineyou recollect them kate my lovehow they used to sparkle you knowbut your papa your poor dear papaah there never was anything so cruelly sacrificed as those jewels were never overpowered by this agonising thought mrs nickleby shook her head in a melancholy manner and applied her handkerchief to her eyes  i dont want them mama indeed said kate forget that you ever had them  lord kate my dear rejoined mrs nickleby pettishly how like a child you talk fourandtwenty silver teaspoons brotherinlaw two gravies four salts all the amethystsnecklace brooch and earringsall made away with at the same time and i saying almost on my bended knees to that poor good soul why dont you do something nicholas why dont you make some arrangement i am sure that anybody who was about us at that time will do me the justice to own that if i said that once i said it fifty times a day didnt i kate my dear did i ever lose an opportunity of impressing it on your poor papa  no no mama never replied kate and to do mrs nickleby justice she never had lostand to do married ladies as a body justice they seldom do loseany occasion of inculcating similar golden percepts whose only blemish is the slight degree of vagueness and uncertainty in which they are usually enveloped  ah said mrs nickleby with great fervour if my advice had been taken at the beginningwell i have always done my duty and thats some comfort  when she had arrived at this reflection mrs nickleby sighed rubbed her hands cast up her eyes and finally assumed a look of meek composure thus importing that she was a persecuted saint but that she wouldnt trouble her hearers by mentioning a circumstance which must be so obvious to everybody  now said ralph with a smile which in common with all other tokens of emotion seemed to skulk under his face rather than play boldly over itto return to the point from which we have strayed i have a little party ofofgentlemen with whom i am connected in business just now at my house tomorrow and your mother has promised that you shall keep house for me i am not much used to parties but this is one of business and such fooleries are an important part of it sometimes you dont mind obliging me  mind cried mrs nickleby my dear kate why  pray interrupted ralph motioning her to be silent i spoke to my niece  i shall be very glad of course uncle replied kate but i am afraid you will find me awkward and embarrassed  oh no said ralph come when you like in a hackney coachill pay for it goodnightaagod bless you  the blessing seemed to stick in mr ralph nicklebys throat as if it were not used to the thoroughfare and didnt know the way out but it got out somehow though awkwardly enough and having disposed of it he shook hands with his two relatives and abruptly left them  what a very strongly marked countenance your uncle has said mrs nickleby quite struck with his parting look i dont see the slightest resemblance to his poor brother  mama said kate reprovingly to think of such a thing  no said mrs nickleby musing there certainly is none but its a very honest face  the worthy matron made this remark with great emphasis and elocution as if it comprised no small quantity of ingenuity and research and in truth it was not unworthy of being classed among the extraordinary discoveries of the age kate looked up hastily and as hastily looked down again  what has come over you my dear in the name of goodness asked mrs nickleby when they had walked on for some time in silence  i was only thinking mama answered kate  thinking repeated mrs nickleby ay and indeed plenty to think about too your uncle has taken a strong fancy to you thats quite clear and if some extraordinary good fortune doesnt come to you after this i shall be a little surprised thats all  with this she launched out into sundry anecdotes of young ladies who had had thousandpound notes given them in reticules by eccentric uncles and of young ladies who had accidentally met amiable gentlemen of enormous wealth at their uncles houses and married them after short but ardent courtships and kate listening first in apathy and afterwards in amusement felt as they walked home something of her mothers sanguine complexion gradually awakening in her own bosom and began to think that her prospects might be brightening and that better days might be dawning upon them such is hope heavens own gift to struggling mortals pervading like some subtle essence from the skies all things both good and bad as universal as death and more infectious than disease  the feeble winters sunand winters suns in the city are very feeble indeedmight have brightened up as he shone through the dim windows of the large old house on witnessing the unusual sight which one halffurnished room displayed in a gloomy corner where for years had stood a silent dusty pile of merchandise sheltering its colony of mice and frowning a dull and lifeless mass upon the panelled room save when responding to the roll of heavy waggons in the street without it quaked with sturdy tremblings and caused the bright eyes of its tiny citizens to grow brighter still with fear and struck them motionless with attentive ear and palpitating heart until the alarm had passed awayin this dark corner was arranged with scrupulous care all kates little finery for the day each article of dress partaking of that indescribable air of jauntiness and individuality which empty garmentswhether by association or that they become moulded as it were to the owners formwill take in eyes accustomed to or picturing the wearers smartness in place of a bale of musty goods there lay the black silk dress the neatest possible figure in itself the small shoes with toes delicately turned out stood upon the very pressure of some old iron weight and a pile of harsh discoloured leather had unconsciously given place to the very same little pair of black silk stockings which had been the objects of mrs nicklebys peculiar care rats and mice and such small gear had long ago been starved or had emigrated to better quarters and in their stead appeared gloves bands scarfs hairpins and many other little devices almost as ingenious in their way as rats and mice themselves for the tantalisation of mankind about and among them all moved kate herself not the least beautiful or unwonted relief to the stern old gloomy building  in good time or in bad time as the reader likes to take itfor mrs nicklebys impatience went a great deal faster than the clocks at that end of the town and kate was dressed to the very last hairpin a full hour and a half before it was at all necessary to begin to think about itin good time or in bad time the toilet was completed and it being at length the hour agreed upon for starting the milkman fetched a coach from the nearest stand and kate with many adieux to her mother and many kind messages to miss la creevy who was to come to tea seated herself in it and went away in state if ever anybody went away in state in a hackney coach yet and the coach and the coachman and the horses rattled and jangled and whipped and cursed and swore and tumbled on together until they came to golden square  the coachman gave a tremendous double knock at the door which was opened long before he had done as quickly as if there had been a man behind it with his hand tied to the latch kate who had expected no more uncommon appearance than newman noggs in a clean shirt was not a little astonished to see that the opener was a man in handsome livery and that there were two or three others in the hall there was no doubt about its being the right house however for there was the name upon the door so she accepted the laced coatsleeve which was tendered her and entering the house was ushered upstairs into a back drawingroom where she was left alone  if she had been surprised at the apparition of the footman she was perfectly absorbed in amazement at the richness and splendour of the furniture the softest and most elegant carpets the most exquisite pictures the costliest mirrors articles of richest ornament quite dazzling from their beauty and perplexing from the prodigality with which they were scattered around encountered her on every side the very staircase nearly down to the halldoor was crammed with beautiful and luxurious things as though the house were brimful of riches which with a very trifling addition would fairly run over into the street  presently she heard a series of loud double knocks at the streetdoor and after every knock some new voice in the next room the tones of mr ralph nickleby were easily distinguishable at first but by degrees they merged into the general buzz of conversation and all she could ascertain was that there were several gentlemen with no very musical voices who talked very loud laughed very heartily and swore more than she would have thought quite necessary but this was a question of taste  at length the door opened and ralph himself divested of his boots and ceremoniously embellished with black silks and shoes presented his crafty face  i couldnt see you before my dear he said in a low tone and pointing as he spoke to the next room i was engaged in receiving them nowshall i take you in  pray uncle said kate a little flurried as people much more conversant with society often are when they are about to enter a room full of strangers and have had time to think of it previously are there any ladies here  no said ralph shortly i dont know any  must i go in immediately asked kate drawing back a little  as you please said ralph shrugging his shoulders they are all come and dinner will be announced directly afterwardsthats all  kate would have entreated a few minutes respite but reflecting that her uncle might consider the payment of the hackneycoach fare a sort of bargain for her punctuality she suffered him to draw her arm through his and to lead her away  seven or eight gentlemen were standing round the fire when they went in and as they were talking very loud were not aware of their entrance until mr ralph nickleby touching one on the coatsleeve said in a harsh emphatic voice as if to attract general attention  lord frederick verisopht my niece miss nickleby  the group dispersed as if in great surprise and the gentleman addressed turning round exhibited a suit of clothes of the most superlative cut a pair of whiskers of similar quality a moustache a head of hair and a young face  eh said the gentleman whatthedeyvle  with which broken ejaculations he fixed his glass in his eye and stared at miss nickleby in great surprise  my niece my lord said ralph  then my ears did not deceive me and its not waax work said his lordship how de do im very happy and then his lordship turned to another superlative gentleman something older something stouter something redder in the face and something longer upon town and said in a loud whisper that the girl was deyvlish pitty  introduce me nickleby said this second gentleman who was lounging with his back to the fire and both elbows on the chimneypiece  sir mulberry hawk said ralph  otherwise the most knowing card in the paack miss nickleby said lord frederick verisopht  dont leave me out nickleby cried a sharpfaced gentleman who was sitting on a low chair with a high back reading the paper  mr pyke said ralph  nor me nickleby cried a gentleman with a flushed face and a flash air from the elbow of sir mulberry hawk  mr pluck said ralph then wheeling about again towards a gentleman with the neck of a stork and the legs of no animal in particular ralph introduced him as the honourable mr snobb and a whiteheaded person at the table as colonel chowser the colonel was in conversation with somebody who appeared to be a makeweight and was not introduced at all  there were two circumstances which in this early stage of the party struck home to kates bosom and brought the blood tingling to her face one was the flippant contempt with which the guests evidently regarded her uncle and the other the easy insolence of their manner towards herself that the first symptom was very likely to lead to the aggravation of the second it needed no great penetration to foresee and here mr ralph nickleby had reckoned without his host for however fresh from the country a young lady by nature may be and however unacquainted with conventional behaviour the chances are that she will have quite as strong an innate sense of the decencies and proprieties of life as if she had run the gauntlet of a dozen london seasonspossibly a stronger one for such senses have been known to blunt in this improving process  when ralph had completed the ceremonial of introduction he led his blushing niece to a seat as he did so he glanced warily round as though to assure himself of the impression which her unlookedfor appearance had created  an unexpected playsure nickleby said lord frederick verisopht taking his glass out of his right eye where it had until now done duty on kate and fixing it in his left to bring it to bear on ralph  designed to surprise you lord frederick said mr pluck  not a bad idea said his lordship and one that would almost warrant the addition of an extra two and a half per cent  nickleby said sir mulberry hawk in a thick coarse voice take the hint and tack it on the other fiveandtwenty or whatever it is and give me half for the advice  sir mulberry garnished this speech with a hoarse laugh and terminated it with a pleasant oath regarding mr nicklebys limbs whereat messrs pyke and pluck laughed consumedly  these gentlemen had not yet quite recovered the jest when dinner was announced and then they were thrown into fresh ecstasies by a similar cause for sir mulberry hawk in an excess of humour shot dexterously past lord frederick verisopht who was about to lead kate downstairs and drew her arm through his up to the elbow  no damn it verisopht said sir mulberry fair plays a jewel and miss nickleby and i settled the matter with our eyes ten minutes ago  ha ha ha laughed the honourable mr snobb very good very good  rendered additionally witty by this applause sir mulberry hawk leered upon his friends most facetiously and led kate downstairs with an air of familiarity which roused in her gentle breast such burning indignation as she felt it almost impossible to repress nor was the intensity of these feelings at all diminished when she found herself placed at the top of the table with sir mulberry hawk and lord frederick verisopht on either side  oh youve found your way into our neighbourhood have you said sir mulberry as his lordship sat down  of course replied lord frederick fixing his eyes on miss nickleby how can you aask me  well you attend to your dinner said sir mulberry and dont mind miss nickleby and me for we shall prove very indifferent company i dare say  i wish youd interfere here nickleby said lord frederick  what is the matter my lord demanded ralph from the bottom of the table where he was supported by messrs pyke and pluck  this fellow hawk is monopolising your niece said lord frederick  he has a tolerable share of everything that you lay claim to my lord said ralph with a sneer  gad so he has replied the young man deyvle take me if i know which is master in my house he or i  i know muttered ralph  i think i shall cut him off with a shilling said the young nobleman jocosely  no no curse it said sir mulberry when you come to the shillingthe last shillingill cut you fast enough but till then ill never leave youyou may take your oath of it  this sally which was strictly founded on fact was received with a general roar above which was plainly distinguishable the laughter of mr pyke and mr pluck who were evidently sir mulberrys toads in ordinary indeed it was not difficult to see that the majority of the company preyed upon the unfortunate young lord who weak and silly as he was appeared by far the least vicious of the party sir mulberry hawk was remarkable for his tact in ruining by himself and his creatures young gentlemen of fortunea genteel and elegant profession of which he had undoubtedly gained the head with all the boldness of an original genius he had struck out an entirely new course of treatment quite opposed to the usual method his custom being when he had gained the ascendancy over those he took in hand rather to keep them down than to give them their own way and to exercise his vivacity upon them openly and without reserve thus he made them butts in a double sense and while he emptied them with great address caused them to ring with sundry welladministered taps for the diversion of society  the dinner was as remarkable for the splendour and completeness of its appointments as the mansion itself and the company were remarkable for doing it ample justice in which respect messrs pyke and pluck particularly signalised themselves these two gentlemen eating of every dish and drinking of every bottle with a capacity and perseverance truly astonishing they were remarkably fresh too notwithstanding their great exertions for on the appearance of the dessert they broke out again as if nothing serious had taken place since breakfast  well said lord frederick sipping his first glass of port if this is a discounting dinner all i have to say is deyvle take me if it wouldnt be a good plaan to get discount every day  youll have plenty of it in your time returned sir mulberry hawk nickleby will tell you that  what do you say nickleby inquired the young man am i to be a good customer  it depends entirely on circumstances my lord replied ralph  on your lordships circumstances interposed colonel chowser of the militiaand the racecourses  the gallant colonel glanced at messrs pyke and pluck as if he thought they ought to laugh at his joke but those gentlemen being only engaged to laugh for sir mulberry hawk were to his signal discomfiture as grave as a pair of undertakers to add to his defeat sir mulberry considering any such efforts an invasion of his peculiar privilege eyed the offender steadily through his glass as if astonished at his presumption and audibly stated his impression that it was an infernal liberty which being a hint to lord frederick he put up his glass and surveyed the object of censure as if he were some extraordinary wild animal then exhibiting for the first time as a matter of course messrs pyke and pluck stared at the individual whom sir mulberry hawk stared at so the poor colonel to hide his confusion was reduced to the necessity of holding his port before his right eye and affecting to scrutinise its colour with the most lively interest  all this while kate had sat as silently as she could scarcely daring to raise her eyes lest they should encounter the admiring gaze of lord frederick verisopht or what was still more embarrassing the bold looks of his friend sir mulberry the latter gentleman was obliging enough to direct general attention towards her  here is miss nickleby observed sir mulberry wondering why the deuce somebody doesnt make love to her  no indeed said kate looking hastily up i and then she stopped feeling it would have been better to have said nothing at all  ill hold any man fifty pounds said sir mulberry that miss nickleby cant look in my face and tell me she wasnt thinking so  done cried the noble gull within ten minutes  done responded sir mulberry the money was produced on both sides and the honourable mr snobb was elected to the double office of stakeholder and timekeeper  pray said kate in great confusion while these preliminaries were in course of completion pray do not make me the subject of any bets uncle i cannot really  why not my dear replied ralph in whose grating voice however there was an unusual huskiness as though he spoke unwillingly and would rather that the proposition had not been broached it is done in a moment there is nothing in it if the gentlemen insist on it  i dont insist on it said sir mulberry with a loud laugh that is i by no means insist upon miss nicklebys making the denial for if she does i lose but i shall be glad to see her bright eyes especially as she favours the mahogany so much  so she does and its too baad of you miss nickleby said the noble youth  quite cruel said mr pyke  horrid cruel said mr pluck  i dont care if i do lose said sir mulberry for one tolerable look at miss nicklebys eyes is worth double the money  more said mr pyke  far more said mr pluck  how goes the enemy snobb asked sir mulberry hawk  four minutes gone  bravo  wont you maake one effort for me miss nickleby asked lord frederick after a short interval  you neednt trouble yourself to inquire my buck said sir mulberry miss nickleby and i understand each other she declares on my side and shows her taste you havent a chance old fellow time snobb  eight minutes gone  get the money ready said sir mulberry youll soon hand over  ha ha ha laughed mr pyke  mr pluck who always came second and topped his companion if he could screamed outright  the poor girl who was so overwhelmed with confusion that she scarcely knew what she did had determined to remain perfectly quiet but fearing that by so doing she might seem to countenance sir mulberrys boast which had been uttered with great coarseness and vulgarity of manner raised her eyes and looked him in the face there was something so odious so insolent so repulsive in the look which met her that without the power to stammer forth a syllable she rose and hurried from the room she restrained her tears by a great effort until she was alone upstairs and then gave them vent  capital said sir mulberry hawk putting the stakes in his pocket  thats a girl of spirit and well drink her health  it is needless to say that pyke and co responded with great warmth of manner to this proposal or that the toast was drunk with many little insinuations from the firm relative to the completeness of sir mulberrys conquest ralph who while the attention of the other guests was attracted to the principals in the preceding scene had eyed them like a wolf appeared to breathe more freely now his niece was gone the decanters passing quickly round he leaned back in his chair and turned his eyes from speaker to speaker as they warmed with wine with looks that seemed to search their hearts and lay bare for his distempered sport every idle thought within them  meanwhile kate left wholly to herself had in some degree recovered her composure she had learnt from a female attendant that her uncle wished to see her before she left and had also gleaned the satisfactory intelligence that the gentlemen would take coffee at table the prospect of seeing them no more contributed greatly to calm her agitation and taking up a book she composed herself to read  she started sometimes when the sudden opening of the diningroom door let loose a wild shout of noisy revelry and more than once rose in great alarm as a fancied footstep on the staircase impressed her with the fear that some stray member of the party was returning alone nothing occurring however to realise her apprehensions she endeavoured to fix her attention more closely on her book in which by degrees she became so much interested that she had read on through several chapters without heed of time or place when she was terrified by suddenly hearing her name pronounced by a mans voice close at her ear  the book fell from her hand lounging on an ottoman close beside her was sir mulberry hawk evidently the worseif a man be a ruffian at heart he is never the betterfor wine  what a delightful studiousness said this accomplished gentleman was it real now or only to display the eyelashes  kate looking anxiously towards the door made no reply  i have looked at em for five minutes said sir mulberry upon my soul theyre perfect why did i speak and destroy such a pretty little picture  do me the favour to be silent now sir replied kate  no dont said sir mulberry folding his crushed hat to lay his elbow on and bringing himself still closer to the young lady upon my life you oughtnt to such a devoted slave of yours miss nicklebyits an infernal thing to treat him so harshly upon my soul it is  i wish you to understand sir said kate trembling in spite of herself but speaking with great indignation that your behaviour offends and disgusts me if you have a spark of gentlemanly feeling remaining you will leave me  now why said sir mulberry why will you keep up this appearance of excessive rigour my sweet creature now be more naturalmy dear miss nickleby be more naturaldo  kate hastily rose but as she rose sir mulberry caught her dress and forcibly detained her  let me go sir she cried her heart swelling with anger do you hear instantlythis moment  sit down sit down said sir mulberry i want to talk to you  unhand me sir this instant cried kate  not for the world rejoined sir mulberry thus speaking he leaned over as if to replace her in her chair but the young lady making a violent effort to disengage herself he lost his balance and measured his length upon the ground as kate sprung forward to leave the room mr ralph nickleby appeared in the doorway and confronted her  what is this said ralph  it is this sir replied kate violently agitated that beneath the roof where i a helpless girl your dead brothers child should most have found protection i have been exposed to insult which should make you shrink to look upon me let me pass you  ralph did shrink as the indignant girl fixed her kindling eye upon him but he did not comply with her injunction nevertheless for he led her to a distant seat and returning and approaching sir mulberry hawk who had by this time risen motioned towards the door  your way lies there sir said ralph in a suppressed voice that some devil might have owned with pride  what do you mean by that demanded his friend fiercely  the swoln veins stood out like sinews on ralphs wrinkled forehead and the nerves about his mouth worked as though some unendurable emotion wrung them but he smiled disdainfully and again pointed to the door  do you know me you old madman asked sir mulberry  well said ralph the fashionable vagabond for the moment quite quailed under the steady look of the older sinner and walked towards the door muttering as he went  you wanted the lord did you he said stopping short when he reached the door as if a new light had broken in upon him and confronting ralph again damme i was in the way was i  ralph smiled again but made no answer  who brought him to you first pursued sir mulberry and how without me could you ever have wound him in your net as you have  the net is a large one and rather full said ralph take care that it chokes nobody in the meshes  you would sell your flesh and blood for money yourself if you have not already made a bargain with the devil retorted the other do you mean to tell me that your pretty niece was not brought here as a decoy for the drunken boy downstairs  although this hurried dialogue was carried on in a suppressed tone on both sides ralph looked involuntarily round to ascertain that kate had not moved her position so as to be within hearing his adversary saw the advantage he had gained and followed it up  do you mean to tell me he asked again that it is not so do you mean to say that if he had found his way up here instead of me you wouldnt have been a little more blind and a little more deaf and a little less flourishing than you have been come nickleby answer me that  i tell you this replied ralph that if i brought her here as a matter of business  ay thats the word interposed sir mulberry with a laugh youre coming to yourself again now  as a matter of business pursued ralph speaking slowly and firmly as a man who has made up his mind to say no more because i thought she might make some impression on the silly youth you have taken in hand and are lending good help to ruin i knewknowing himthat it would be long before he outraged her girls feelings and that unless he offended by mere puppyism and emptiness he would with a little management respect the sex and conduct even of his usurers niece but if i thought to draw him on more gently by this device i did not think of subjecting the girl to the licentiousness and brutality of so old a hand as you and now we understand each other  especially as there was nothing to be got by iteh sneered sir mulberry  exactly so said ralph he had turned away and looked over his shoulder to make this last reply the eyes of the two worthies met with an expression as if each rascal felt that there was no disguising himself from the other and sir mulberry hawk shrugged his shoulders and walked slowly out  his friend closed the door and looked restlessly towards the spot where his niece still remained in the attitude in which he had left her she had flung herself heavily upon the couch and with her head drooping over the cushion and her face hidden in her hands seemed to be still weeping in an agony of shame and grief  ralph would have walked into any povertystricken debtors house and pointed him out to a bailiff though in attendance upon a young childs deathbed without the smallest concern because it would have been a matter quite in the ordinary course of business and the man would have been an offender against his only code of morality but here was a young girl who had done no wrong save that of coming into the world alive who had patiently yielded to all his wishes who had tried hard to please himabove all who didnt owe him moneyand he felt awkward and nervous  ralph took a chair at some distance then another chair a little nearer then moved a little nearer still then nearer again and finally sat himself on the same sofa and laid his hand on kates arm  hush my dear he said as she drew it back and her sobs burst out afresh hush hush dont mind it now dont think of it  oh for pitys sake let me go home cried kate let me leave this house and go home  yes yes said ralph you shall but you must dry your eyes first and compose yourself let me raise your head therethere  oh uncle exclaimed kate clasping her hands what have i donewhat have i donethat you should subject me to this if i had wronged you in thought or word or deed it would have been most cruel to me and the memory of one you must have loved in some old time but  only listen to me for a moment interrupted ralph seriously alarmed by the violence of her emotions i didnt know it would be so it was impossible for me to foresee it i did all i couldcome let us walk about you are faint with the closeness of the room and the heat of these lamps you will be better now if you make the slightest effort  i will do anything replied kate if you will only send me home  well well i will said ralph but you must get back your own looks for those you have will frighten them and nobody must know of this but you and i now let us walk the other way there you look better even now  with such encouragements as these ralph nickleby walked to and fro with his niece leaning on his arm actually trembling beneath her touch  in the same manner when he judged it prudent to allow her to depart he supported her downstairs after adjusting her shawl and performing such little offices most probably for the first time in his life across the hall and down the steps ralph led her too nor did he withdraw his hand until she was seated in the coach  as the door of the vehicle was roughly closed a comb fell from kates hair close at her uncles feet and as he picked it up and returned it into her hand the light from a neighbouring lamp shone upon her face the lock of hair that had escaped and curled loosely over her brow the traces of tears yet scarcely dry the flushed cheek the look of sorrow all fired some dormant train of recollection in the old mans breast and the face of his dead brother seemed present before him with the very look it bore on some occasion of boyish grief of which every minutest circumstance flashed upon his mind with the distinctness of a scene of yesterday  ralph nickleby who was proof against all appeals of blood and kindredwho was steeled against every tale of sorrow and distressstaggered while he looked and went back into his house as a man who had seen a spirit from some world beyond the grave    chapter 20  wherein nicholas at length encounters his uncle to whom he expresses his sentiments with much candour his resolution   little miss la creevy trotted briskly through divers streets at the west end of the town early on monday morningthe day after the dinnercharged with the important commission of acquainting madame mantalini that miss nickleby was too unwell to attend that day but hoped to be enabled to resume her duties on the morrow and as miss la creevy walked along revolving in her mind various genteel forms and elegant turns of expression with a view to the selection of the very best in which to couch her communication she cogitated a good deal upon the probable causes of her young friends indisposition  i dont know what to make of it said miss la creevy her eyes were decidedly red last night she said she had a headache headaches dont occasion red eyes she must have been crying  arriving at this conclusion which indeed she had established to her perfect satisfaction on the previous evening miss la creevy went on to consideras she had done nearly all nightwhat new cause of unhappiness her young friend could possibly have had  i cant think of anything said the little portrait painter nothing at all unless it was the behaviour of that old bear cross to her i suppose unpleasant brute  relieved by this expression of opinion albeit it was vented upon empty air miss la creevy trotted on to madame mantalinis and being informed that the governing power was not yet out of bed requested an interview with the second in command whereupon miss knag appeared  so far as i am concerned said miss knag when the message had been delivered with many ornaments of speech i could spare miss nickleby for evermore  oh indeed maam rejoined miss la creevy highly offended but you see you are not mistress of the business and therefore its of no great consequence  very good maam said miss knag have you any further commands for me  no i have not maam rejoined miss la creevy  then goodmorning maam said miss knag  goodmorning to you maam and many obligations for your extreme politeness and good breeding rejoined miss la creevy  thus terminating the interview during which both ladies had trembled very much and been marvellously politecertain indications that they were within an inch of a very desperate quarrelmiss la creevy bounced out of the room and into the street  i wonder who that is said the queer little soul a nice person to know i should think i wish i had the painting of her id do her justice so feeling quite satisfied that she had said a very cutting thing at miss knags expense miss la creevy had a hearty laugh and went home to breakfast in great good humour  here was one of the advantages of having lived alone so long the little bustling active cheerful creature existed entirely within herself talked to herself made a confidante of herself was as sarcastic as she could be on people who offended her by herself pleased herself and did no harm if she indulged in scandal nobodys reputation suffered and if she enjoyed a little bit of revenge no living soul was one atom the worse one of the many to whom from straitened circumstances a consequent inability to form the associations they would wish and a disinclination to mix with the society they could obtain london is as complete a solitude as the plains of syria the humble artist had pursued her lonely but contented way for many years and until the peculiar misfortunes of the nickleby family attracted her attention had made no friends though brimful of the friendliest feelings to all mankind there are many warm hearts in the same solitary guise as poor little miss la creevys  however thats neither here nor there just now she went home to breakfast and had scarcely caught the full flavour of her first sip of tea when the servant announced a gentleman whereat miss la creevy at once imagining a new sitter transfixed by admiration at the streetdoor case was in unspeakable consternation at the presence of the teathings  here take em away run with em into the bedroom anywhere said miss la creevy dear dear to think that i should be late on this particular morning of all others after being ready for three weeks by halfpast eight oclock and not a soul coming near the place  dont let me put you out of the way said a voice miss la creevy knew i told the servant not to mention my name because i wished to surprise you  mr nicholas cried miss la creevy starting in great astonishment you have not forgotten me i see replied nicholas extending his hand  why i think i should even have known you if i had met you in the street said miss la creevy with a smile hannah another cup and saucer now ill tell you what young man ill trouble you not to repeat the impertinence you were guilty of on the morning you went away  you would not be very angry would you asked nicholas  wouldnt i said miss la creevy you had better try thats all  nicholas with becoming gallantry immediately took miss la creevy at her word who uttered a faint scream and slapped his face but it was not a very hard slap and thats the truth  i never saw such a rude creature exclaimed miss la creevy  you told me to try said nicholas  well but i was speaking ironically rejoined miss la creevy  oh thats another thing said nicholas you should have told me that too  i dare say you didnt know indeed retorted miss la creevy but now i look at you again you seem thinner than when i saw you last and your face is haggard and pale and how come you to have left yorkshire  she stopped here for there was so much heart in her altered tone and manner that nicholas was quite moved  i need look somewhat changed he said after a short silence for i have undergone some suffering both of mind and body since i left london i have been very poor too and have even suffered from want  good heaven mr nicholas exclaimed miss la creevy what are you telling me  nothing which need distress you quite so much answered nicholas with a more sprightly air neither did i come here to bewail my lot but on matter more to the purpose i wish to meet my uncle face to face i should tell you that first  then all i have to say about that is interposed miss la creevy that i dont envy you your taste and that sitting in the same room with his very boots would put me out of humour for a fortnight  in the main said nicholas there may be no great difference of opinion between you and me so far but you will understand that i desire to confront him to justify myself and to cast his duplicity and malice in his throat  thats quite another matter rejoined miss la creevy heaven forgive me but i shouldnt cry my eyes quite out of my head if they choked him well  to this end i called upon him this morning said nicholas he only returned to town on saturday and i knew nothing of his arrival until late last night  and did you see him asked miss la creevy  no replied nicholas he had gone out  hah said miss la creevy on some kind charitable business i dare say  i have reason to believe pursued nicholas from what has been told me by a friend of mine who is acquainted with his movements that he intends seeing my mother and sister today and giving them his version of the occurrences that have befallen me i will meet him there  thats right said miss la creevy rubbing her hands and yet i dont know she added there is much to be thought ofothers to be considered  i have considered others rejoined nicholas but as honesty and honour are both at issue nothing shall deter me  you should know best said miss la creevy  in this case i hope so answered nicholas and all i want you to do for me is to prepare them for my coming they think me a long way off and if i went wholly unexpected i should frighten them if you can spare time to tell them that you have seen me and that i shall be with them in a quarter of an hour afterwards you will do me a great service  i wish i could do you or any of you a greater said miss la creevy but the power to serve is as seldom joined with the will as the will is with the power i think  talking on very fast and very much miss la creevy finished her breakfast with great expedition put away the teacaddy and hid the key under the fender resumed her bonnet and taking nicholass arm sallied forth at once to the city nicholas left her near the door of his mothers house and promised to return within a quarter of an hour  it so chanced that ralph nickleby at length seeing fit for his own purposes to communicate the atrocities of which nicholas had been guilty had instead of first proceeding to another quarter of the town on business as newman noggs supposed he would gone straight to his sisterinlaw hence when miss la creevy admitted by a girl who was cleaning the house made her way to the sittingroom she found mrs nickleby and kate in tears and ralph just concluding his statement of his nephews misdemeanours kate beckoned her not to retire and miss la creevy took a seat in silence  you are here already are you my gentleman thought the little woman then he shall announce himself and see what effect that has on you  this is pretty said ralph folding up miss squeerss note very pretty i recommend himagainst all my previous conviction for i knew he would never do any goodto a man with whom behaving himself properly he might have remained in comfort for years what is the result conduct for which he might hold up his hand at the old bailey  i never will believe it said kate indignantly never it is some base conspiracy which carries its own falsehood with it  my dear said ralph you wrong the worthy man these are not inventions the man is assaulted your brother is not to be found this boy of whom they speak goes with himremember remember  it is impossible said kate nicholasand a thief too mama how can you sit and hear such statements  poor mrs nickleby who had at no time been remarkable for the possession of a very clear understanding and who had been reduced by the late changes in her affairs to a most complicated state of perplexity made no other reply to this earnest remonstrance than exclaiming from behind a mass of pockethandkerchief that she never could have believed itthereby most ingeniously leaving her hearers to suppose that she did believe it  it would be my duty if he came in my way to deliver him up to justice said ralph my bounden duty i should have no other course as a man of the world and a man of business to pursue and yet said ralph speaking in a very marked manner and looking furtively but fixedly at kate and yet i would not i would spare the feelings of hisof his sister and his mother of course added ralph as though by an afterthought and with far less emphasis  kate very well understood that this was held out as an additional inducement to her to preserve the strictest silence regarding the events of the preceding night she looked involuntarily towards ralph as he ceased to speak but he had turned his eyes another way and seemed for the moment quite unconscious of her presence  everything said ralph after a long silence broken only by mrs nicklebys sobs everything combines to prove the truth of this letter if indeed there were any possibility of disputing it do innocent men steal away from the sight of honest folks and skulk in hidingplaces like outlaws do innocent men inveigle nameless vagabonds and prowl with them about the country as idle robbers do assault riot theft what do you call these  a lie cried a voice as the door was dashed open and nicholas came into the room  in the first moment of surprise and possibly of alarm ralph rose from his seat and fell back a few paces quite taken off his guard by this unexpected apparition in another moment he stood fixed and immovable with folded arms regarding his nephew with a scowl while kate and miss la creevy threw themselves between the two to prevent the personal violence which the fierce excitement of nicholas appeared to threaten  dear nicholas cried his sister clinging to him be calm consider  consider kate cried nicholas clasping her hand so tight in the tumult of his anger that she could scarcely bear the pain when i consider all and think of what has passed i need be made of iron to stand before him  or bronze said ralph quietly there is not hardihood enough in flesh and blood to face it out  oh dear dear cried mrs nickleby that things should have come to such a pass as this  who speaks in a tone as if i had done wrong and brought disgrace on them said nicholas looking round  your mother sir replied ralph motioning towards her  whose ears have been poisoned by you said nicholas by youwho under pretence of deserving the thanks she poured upon you heaped every insult wrong and indignity upon my head you who sent me to a den where sordid cruelty worthy of yourself runs wanton and youthful misery stalks precocious where the lightness of childhood shrinks into the heaviness of age and its every promise blights and withers as it grows i call heaven to witness said nicholas looking eagerly round that i have seen all this and that he knows it  refute these calumnies said kate and be more patient so that you may give them no advantage tell us what you really did and show that they are untrue  of what do theyor of what does heaccuse me said nicholas  first of attacking your master and being within an ace of qualifying yourself to be tried for murder interposed ralph i speak plainly young man bluster as you will  i interfered said nicholas to save a miserable creature from the vilest cruelty in so doing i inflicted such punishment upon a wretch as he will not readily forget though far less than he deserved from me if the same scene were renewed before me now i would take the same part but i would strike harder and heavier and brand him with such marks as he should carry to his grave go to it when he would  you hear said ralph turning to mrs nickleby penitence this  oh dear me cried mrs nickleby i dont know what to think i really dont  do not speak just now mama i entreat you said kate dear nicholas i only tell you that you may know what wickedness can prompt but they accuse you ofa ring is missing and they dare to say that  the woman said nicholas haughtily the wife of the fellow from whom these charges come droppedas i supposea worthless ring among some clothes of mine early in the morning on which i left the house at least i know that she was in the bedroom where they lay struggling with an unhappy child and that i found it when i opened my bundle on the road i returned it at once by coach and they have it now  i knew i knew said kate looking towards her uncle about this boy love in whose company they say you left  the boy a silly helpless creature from brutality and hard usage is with me now rejoined nicholas  you hear said ralph appealing to the mother again everything proved even upon his own confession do you choose to restore that boy sir  no i do not replied nicholas  you do not sneered ralph  no repeated nicholas not to the man with whom i found him i would that i knew on whom he has the claim of birth i might wring something from his sense of shame if he were dead to every tie of nature  indeed said ralph now sir will you hear a word or two from me  you can speak when and what you please replied nicholas embracing his sister i take little heed of what you say or threaten  mighty well sir retorted ralph but perhaps it may concern others who may think it worth their while to listen and consider what i tell them i will address your mother sir who knows the world  ah and i only too dearly wish i didnt sobbed mrs nickleby  there really was no necessity for the good lady to be much distressed upon this particular head the extent of her worldly knowledge being to say the least very questionable and so ralph seemed to think for he smiled as she spoke he then glanced steadily at her and nicholas by turns as he delivered himself in these words  of what i have done or what i meant to do for you maam and my niece i say not one syllable i held out no promise and leave you to judge for yourself i hold out no threat now but i say that this boy headstrong wilful and disorderly as he is should not have one penny of my money or one crust of my bread or one grasp of my hand to save him from the loftiest gallows in all europe i will not meet him come where he comes or hear his name i will not help him or those who help him with a full knowledge of what he brought upon you by so doing he has come back in his selfish sloth to be an aggravation of your wants and a burden upon his sisters scanty wages i regret to leave you and more to leave her now but i will not encourage this compound of meanness and cruelty and as i will not ask you to renounce him i see you no more  if ralph had not known and felt his power in wounding those he hated his glances at nicholas would have shown it him in all its force as he proceeded in the above address innocent as the young man was of all wrong every artful insinuation stung every wellconsidered sarcasm cut him to the quick and when ralph noted his pale face and quivering lip he hugged himself to mark how well he had chosen the taunts best calculated to strike deep into a young and ardent spirit  i cant help it cried mrs nickleby i know you have been very good to us and meant to do a good deal for my dear daughter i am quite sure of that i know you did and it was very kind of you having her at your house and alland of course it would have been a great thing for her and for me too but i cant you know brotherinlaw i cant renounce my own son even if he has done all you say he hasits not possible i couldnt do it so we must go to rack and ruin kate my dear i can bear it i dare say pouring forth these and a perfectly wonderful train of other disjointed expressions of regret which no mortal power but mrs nicklebys could ever have strung together that lady wrung her hands and her tears fell faster  why do you say if nicholas has done what they say he has mama asked kate with honest anger you know he has not  i dont know what to think one way or other my dear said mrs nickleby nicholas is so violent and your uncle has so much composure that i can only hear what he says and not what nicholas does never mind dont let us talk any more about it we can go to the workhouse or the refuge for the destitute or the magdalen hospital i dare say and the sooner we go the better with this extraordinary jumble of charitable institutions mrs nickleby again gave way to her tears  stay said nicholas as ralph turned to go you need not leave this place sir for it will be relieved of my presence in one minute and it will be long very long before i darken these doors again  nicholas cried kate throwing herself on her brothers shoulder do not say so my dear brother you will break my heart mama speak to him do not mind her nicholas she does not mean it you should know her better uncle somebody for heavens sake speak to him  i never meant kate said nicholas tenderly i never meant to stay among you think better of me than to suppose it possible i may turn my back on this town a few hours sooner than i intended but what of that we shall not forget each other apart and better days will come when we shall part no more be a woman kate he whispered proudly and do not make me one while he looks on  no no i will not said kate eagerly but you will not leave us oh think of all the happy days we have had together before these terrible misfortunes came upon us of all the comfort and happiness of home and the trials we have to bear now of our having no protector under all the slights and wrongs that poverty so much favours and you cannot leave us to bear them alone without one hand to help us  you will be helped when i am away replied nicholas hurriedly i am no help to you no protector i should bring you nothing but sorrow and want and suffering my own mother sees it and her fondness and fears for you point to the course that i should take and so all good angels bless you kate till i can carry you to some home of mine where we may revive the happiness denied to us now and talk of these trials as of things gone by do not keep me here but let me go at once there dear girldear girl  the grasp which had detained him relaxed and kate swooned in his arms nicholas stooped over her for a few seconds and placing her gently in a chair confided her to their honest friend  i need not entreat your sympathy he said wringing her hand for i know your nature you will never forget them  he stepped up to ralph who remained in the same attitude which he had preserved throughout the interview and moved not a finger  whatever step you take sir he said in a voice inaudible beyond themselves i shall keep a strict account of i leave them to you at your desire there will be a day of reckoning sooner or later and it will be a heavy one for you if they are wronged  ralph did not allow a muscle of his face to indicate that he heard one word of this parting address he hardly knew that it was concluded and mrs nickleby had scarcely made up her mind to detain her son by force if necessary when nicholas was gone  as he hurried through the streets to his obscure lodging seeking to keep pace as it were with the rapidity of the thoughts which crowded upon him many doubts and hesitations arose in his mind and almost tempted him to return but what would they gain by this supposing he were to put ralph nickleby at defiance and were even fortunate enough to obtain some small employment his being with them could only render their present condition worse and might greatly impair their future prospects for his mother had spoken of some new kindnesses towards kate which she had not denied no thought nicholas i have acted for the best  but before he had gone five hundred yards some other and different feeling would come upon him and then he would lag again and pulling his hat over his eyes give way to the melancholy reflections which pressed thickly upon him to have committed no fault and yet to be so entirely alone in the world to be separated from the only persons he loved and to be proscribed like a criminal when six months ago he had been surrounded by every comfort and looked up to as the chief hope of his familythis was hard to bear he had not deserved it either well there was comfort in that and poor nicholas would brighten up again to be again depressed as his quickly shifting thoughts presented every variety of light and shade before him  undergoing these alternations of hope and misgiving which no one placed in a situation of ordinary trial can fail to have experienced nicholas at length reached his poor room where no longer borne up by the excitement which had hitherto sustained him but depressed by the revulsion of feeling it left behind he threw himself on the bed and turning his face to the wall gave free vent to the emotions he had so long stifled  he had not heard anybody enter and was unconscious of the presence of smike until happening to raise his head he saw him standing at the upper end of the room looking wistfully towards him he withdrew his eyes when he saw that he was observed and affected to be busied with some scanty preparations for dinner  well smike said nicholas as cheerfully as he could speak let me hear what new acquaintances you have made this morning or what new wonder you have found out in the compass of this street and the next one  no said smike shaking his head mournfully i must talk of something else today  of what you like replied nicholas goodhumouredly  of this said smike i know you are unhappy and have got into great trouble by bringing me away i ought to have known that and stopped behindi would indeed if i had thought it then youyouare not rich you have not enough for yourself and i should not be here you grow said the lad laying his hand timidly on that of nicholas you grow thinner every day your cheek is paler and your eye more sunk indeed i cannot bear to see you so and think how i am burdening you i tried to go away today but the thought of your kind face drew me back i could not leave you without a word the poor fellow could say no more for his eyes filled with tears and his voice was gone  the word which separates us said nicholas grasping him heartily by the shoulder shall never be said by me for you are my only comfort and stay i would not lose you now smike for all the world could give the thought of you has upheld me through all i have endured today and shall through fifty times such trouble give me your hand my heart is linked to yours we will journey from this place together before the week is out what if i am steeped in poverty you lighten it and we will be poor together    chapter 21  madam mantalini finds herself in a situation of some difficulty and miss nickleby finds herself in no situation at all   the agitation she had undergone rendered kate nickleby unable to resume her duties at the dressmakers for three days at the expiration of which interval she betook herself at the accustomed hour and with languid steps to the temple of fashion where madame mantalini reigned paramount and supreme  the illwill of miss knag had lost nothing of its virulence in the interval the young ladies still scrupulously shrunk from all companionship with their denounced associate and when that exemplary female arrived a few minutes afterwards she was at no pains to conceal the displeasure with which she regarded kates return  upon my word said miss knag as the satellites flocked round to relieve her of her bonnet and shawl i should have thought some people would have had spirit enough to stop away altogether when they know what an incumbrance their presence is to rightminded persons but its a queer world oh its a queer world  miss knag having passed this comment on the world in the tone in which most people do pass comments on the world when they are out of temper that is to say as if they by no means belonged to it concluded by heaving a sigh wherewith she seemed meekly to compassionate the wickedness of mankind  the attendants were not slow to echo the sigh and miss knag was apparently on the eve of favouring them with some further moral reflections when the voice of madame mantalini conveyed through the speakingtube ordered miss nickleby upstairs to assist in the arrangement of the showroom a distinction which caused miss knag to toss her head so much and bite her lips so hard that her powers of conversation were for the time annihilated  well miss nickleby child said madame mantalini when kate presented herself are you quite well again  a great deal better thank you replied kate  i wish i could say the same remarked madame mantalini seating herself with an air of weariness  are you ill asked kate i am very sorry for that  not exactly ill but worried childworried rejoined madame  i am still more sorry to hear that said kate gently bodily illness is more easy to bear than mental  ah and its much easier to talk than to bear either said madame rubbing her nose with much irritability of manner there get to your work child and put the things in order do  while kate was wondering within herself what these symptoms of unusual vexation portended mr mantalini put the tips of his whiskers and by degrees his head through the halfopened door and cried in a soft voice  is my life and soul there  no replied his wife  how can it say so when it is blooming in the front room like a little rose in a demnition flowerpot urged mantalini may its poppet come in and talk  certainly not replied madame you know i never allow you here go along  the poppet however encouraged perhaps by the relenting tone of this reply ventured to rebel and stealing into the room made towards madame mantalini on tiptoe blowing her a kiss as he came along  why will it vex itself and twist its little face into bewitching nutcrackers said mantalini putting his left arm round the waist of his life and soul and drawing her towards him with his right  oh i cant bear you replied his wife  noteh not bear me exclaimed mantalini fibs fibs it couldnt be theres not a woman alive that could tell me such a thing to my faceto my own face mr mantalini stroked his chin as he said this and glanced complacently at an opposite mirror  such destructive extravagance reasoned his wife in a low tone  all in its joy at having gained such a lovely creature such a little venus such a demd enchanting bewitching engrossing captivating little venus said mantalini  see what a situation you have placed me in urged madame  no harm will come no harm shall come to its own darling rejoined mr mantalini it is all over there will be nothing the matter money shall be got in and if it dont come in fast enough old nickleby shall stump up again or have his jugular separated if he dares to vex and hurt the little  hush interposed madame dont you see  mr mantalini who in his eagerness to make up matters with his wife had overlooked or feigned to overlook miss nickleby hitherto took the hint and laying his finger on his lip sunk his voice still lower there was then a great deal of whispering during which madame mantalini appeared to make reference more than once to certain debts incurred by mr mantalini previous to her coverture and also to an unexpected outlay of money in payment of the aforesaid debts and furthermore to certain agreeable weaknesses on that gentlemans part such as gaming wasting idling and a tendency to horseflesh each of which matters of accusation mr mantalini disposed of by one kiss or more as its relative importance demanded the upshot of it all was that madame mantalini was in raptures with him and that they went upstairs to breakfast  kate busied herself in what she had to do and was silently arranging the various articles of decoration in the best taste she could display when she started to hear a strange mans voice in the room and started again to observe on looking round that a white hat and a red neckerchief and a broad round face and a large head and part of a green coat were in the room too  dont alarm yourself miss said the proprietor of these appearances i say this heres the mantiemaking consarn ant it  yes rejoined kate greatly astonished what did you want  the stranger answered not but first looking back as though to beckon to some unseen person outside came very deliberately into the room and was closely followed by a little man in brown very much the worse for wear who brought with him a mingled fumigation of stale tobacco and fresh onions the clothes of this gentleman were much bespeckled with flue and his shoes stockings and nether garments from his heels to the waist buttons of his coat inclusive were profusely embroidered with splashes of mud caught a fortnight previouslybefore the settingin of the fine weather  kates very natural impression was that these engaging individuals had called with the view of possessing themselves unlawfully of any portable articles that chanced to strike their fancy she did not attempt to disguise her apprehensions and made a move towards the door  wait a minnit said the man in the green coat closing it softly and standing with his back against it this is a unpleasant bisness veres your govvernor  my whatdid you say asked kate trembling for she thought governor might be slang for watch or money  mister muntlehiney said the man wots come on him is he at home  he is above stairs i believe replied kate a little reassured by this inquiry do you want him  no replied the visitor i dont ezactly want him if its made a favour on you can jist give him that ere card and tell him if he wants to speak to me and save trouble here i am thats all  with these words the stranger put a thick square card into kates hand and turning to his friend remarked with an easy air that the rooms was a good high pitch to which the friend assented adding by way of illustration that there was lots of room for a little boy to grow up a man in either on em vithout much fear of his ever bringing his head into contract vith the ceiling  after ringing the bell which would summon madame mantalini kate glanced at the card and saw that it displayed the name of scaley together with some other information to which she had not had time to refer when her attention was attracted by mr scaley himself who walking up to one of the chevalglasses gave it a hard poke in the centre with his stick as coolly as if it had been made of cast iron  good plate this here tix said mr scaley to his friend  ah rejoined mr tix placing the marks of his four fingers and a duplicate impression of his thumb on a piece of skyblue silk and this here article warnt made for nothing mind you  from the silk mr tix transferred his admiration to some elegant articles of wearing apparel while mr scaley adjusted his neckcloth at leisure before the glass and afterwards aided by its reflection proceeded to the minute consideration of a pimple on his chin in which absorbing occupation he was yet engaged when madame mantalini entering the room uttered an exclamation of surprise which roused him  oh is this the missis inquired scaley  it is madame mantalini said kate  then said mr scaley producing a small document from his pocket and unfolding it very slowly this is a writ of execution and if its not conwenient to settle well go over the house at wunst please and take the inwentory  poor madame mantalini wrung her hands for grief and rung the bell for her husband which done she fell into a chair and a fainting fit simultaneously the professional gentlemen however were not at all discomposed by this event for mr scaley leaning upon a stand on which a handsome dress was displayed so that his shoulders appeared above it in nearly the same manner as the shoulders of the lady for whom it was designed would have done if she had had it on pushed his hat on one side and scratched his head with perfect unconcern while his friend mr tix taking that opportunity for a general survey of the apartment preparatory to entering on business stood with his inventorybook under his arm and his hat in his hand mentally occupied in putting a price upon every object within his range of vision  such was the posture of affairs when mr mantalini hurried in and as that distinguished specimen had had a pretty extensive intercourse with mr scaleys fraternity in his bachelor days and was besides very far from being taken by surprise on the present agitating occasion he merely shrugged his shoulders thrust his hands down to the bottom of his pockets elevated his eyebrows whistled a bar or two swore an oath or two and sitting astride upon a chair put the best face upon the matter with great composure and decency  whats the demd total was the first question he asked  fifteen hundred and twentyseven pound four and ninepence hapenny replied mr scaley without moving a limb  the halfpenny be demd said mr mantalini impatiently  by all means if you vish it retorted mr scaley and the ninepence  it dont matter to us if the fifteen hundred and twentyseven pound went along with it that i know on observed mr tix  not a button said scaley  well said the same gentleman after a pause wots to be doneanything is it only a small crack or a outandout smash a breakup of the constitootion is itwerry good then mr tom tix eskvire you must inform your angel wife and lovely family as you wont sleep at home for three nights to come along of being in possession here wots the good of the lady a fretting herself continued mr scaley as madame mantalini sobbed a good half of wots here isnt paid for i dessay and wot a consolation oughtnt that to be to her feelings  with these remarks combining great pleasantry with sound moral encouragement under difficulties mr scaley proceeded to take the inventory in which delicate task he was materially assisted by the uncommon tact and experience of mr tix the broker  my cup of happinesss sweetener said mantalini approaching his wife with a penitent air will you listen to me for two minutes  oh dont speak to me replied his wife sobbing you have ruined me and thats enough  mr mantalini who had doubtless well considered his part no sooner heard these words pronounced in a tone of grief and severity than he recoiled several paces assumed an expression of consuming mental agony rushed headlong from the room and was soon afterwards heard to slam the door of an upstairs dressingroom with great violence  miss nickleby cried madame mantalini when this sound met her ear make haste for heavens sake he will destroy himself i spoke unkindly to him and he cannot bear it from me alfred my darling alfred  with such exclamations she hurried upstairs followed by kate who although she did not quite participate in the fond wifes apprehensions was a little flurried nevertheless the dressingroom door being hastily flung open mr mantalini was disclosed to view with his shirtcollar symmetrically thrown back putting a fine edge to a breakfast knife by means of his razor strop  ah cried mr mantalini interrupted and whisk went the breakfast knife into mr mantalinis dressinggown pocket while mr mantalinis eyes rolled wildly and his hair floating in wild disorder mingled with his whiskers  alfred cried his wife flinging her arms about him i didnt mean to say it i didnt mean to say it  ruined cried mr mantalini have i brought ruin upon the best and purest creature that ever blessed a demnition vagabond demmit let me go at this crisis of his ravings mr mantalini made a pluck at the breakfast knife and being restrained by his wifes grasp attempted to dash his head against the walltaking very good care to be at least six feet from it  compose yourself my own angel said madame it was nobodys fault it was mine as much as yours we shall do very well yet come alfred come  mr mantalini did not think proper to come to all at once but after calling several times for poison and requesting some lady or gentleman to blow his brains out gentler feelings came upon him and he wept pathetically in this softened frame of mind he did not oppose the capture of the knifewhich to tell the truth he was rather glad to be rid of as an inconvenient and dangerous article for a skirt pocketand finally he suffered himself to be led away by his affectionate partner  after a delay of two or three hours the young ladies were informed that their services would be dispensed with until further notice and at the expiration of two days the name of mantalini appeared in the list of bankrupts miss nickleby received an intimation per post on the same morning that the business would be in future carried on under the name of miss knag and that her assistance would no longer be requireda piece of intelligence with which mrs nickleby was no sooner made acquainted than that good lady declared she had expected it all along and cited divers unknown occasions on which she had prophesied to that precise effect  and i say again remarked mrs nickleby who it is scarcely necessary to observe had never said so before i say again that a milliners and dressmakers is the very last description of business kate that you should have thought of attaching yourself to i dont make it a reproach to you my love but still i will say that if you had consulted your own mother  well well mama said kate mildly what would you recommend now  recommend cried mrs nickleby isnt it obvious my dear that of all occupations in this world for a young lady situated as you are that of companion to some amiable lady is the very thing for which your education and manners and personal appearance and everything else exactly qualify you did you never hear your poor dear papa speak of the young lady who was the daughter of the old lady who boarded in the same house that he boarded in once when he was a bachelorwhat was her name again i know it began with a b and ended with g but whether it was waters orno it couldnt have been that either but whatever her name was dont you know that that young lady went as companion to a married lady who died soon afterwards and that she married the husband and had one of the finest little boys that the medical man had ever seenall within eighteen months  kate knew perfectly well that this torrent of favourable recollection was occasioned by some opening real or imaginary which her mother had discovered in the companionship walk of life she therefore waited very patiently until all reminiscences and anecdotes bearing or not bearing upon the subject had been exhausted and at last ventured to inquire what discovery had been made the truth then came out mrs nickleby had that morning had a yesterdays newspaper of the very first respectability from the publichouse where the porter came from and in this yesterdays newspaper was an advertisement couched in the purest and most grammatical english announcing that a married lady was in want of a genteel young person as companion and that the married ladys name and address were to be known on application at a certain library at the west end of the town therein mentioned  and i say exclaimed mrs nickleby laying the paper down in triumph that if your uncle dont object its well worth the trial  kate was too sick at heart after the rough jostling she had already had with the world and really cared too little at the moment what fate was reserved for her to make any objection mr ralph nickleby offered none but on the contrary highly approved of the suggestion neither did he express any great surprise at madame mantalinis sudden failure indeed it would have been strange if he had inasmuch as it had been procured and brought about chiefly by himself so the name and address were obtained without loss of time and miss nickleby and her mama went off in quest of mrs wititterly of cadogan place sloane street that same forenoon  cadogan place is the one slight bond that joins two great extremes it is the connecting link between the aristocratic pavements of belgrave square and the barbarism of chelsea it is in sloane street but not of it the people in cadogan place look down upon sloane street and think brompton low they affect fashion too and wonder where the new road is not that they claim to be on precisely the same footing as the high folks of belgrave square and grosvenor place but that they stand with reference to them rather in the light of those illegitimate children of the great who are content to boast of their connections although their connections disavow them wearing as much as they can of the airs and semblances of loftiest rank the people of cadogan place have the realities of middle station it is the conductor which communicates to the inhabitants of regions beyond its limit the shock of pride of birth and rank which it has not within itself but derives from a fountainhead beyond or like the ligament which unites the siamese twins it contains something of the life and essence of two distinct bodies and yet belongs to neither  upon this doubtful ground lived mrs wititterly and at mrs wititterlys door kate nickleby knocked with trembling hand the door was opened by a big footman with his head floured or chalked or painted in some way it didnt look genuine powder and the big footman receiving the card of introduction gave it to a little page so little indeed that his body would not hold in ordinary array the number of small buttons which are indispensable to a pages costume and they were consequently obliged to be stuck on four abreast this young gentleman took the card upstairs on a salver and pending his return kate and her mother were shown into a diningroom of rather dirty and shabby aspect and so comfortably arranged as to be adapted to almost any purpose rather than eating and drinking  now in the ordinary course of things and according to all authentic descriptions of high life as set forth in books mrs wititterly ought to have been in her boudoir but whether it was that mr wititterly was at that moment shaving himself in the boudoir or what not certain it is that mrs wititterly gave audience in the drawingroom where was everything proper and necessary including curtains and furniture coverings of a roseate hue to shed a delicate bloom on mrs wititterlys complexion and a little dog to snap at strangers legs for mrs wititterlys amusement and the aforementioned page to hand chocolate for mrs wititterlys refreshment  the lady had an air of sweet insipidity and a face of engaging paleness there was a faded look about her and about the furniture and about the house she was reclining on a sofa in such a very unstudied attitude that she might have been taken for an actress all ready for the first scene in a ballet and only waiting for the drop curtain to go up  place chairs  the page placed them  leave the room alphonse  the page left it but if ever an alphonse carried plain bill in his face and figure that page was the boy  i have ventured to call maam said kate after a few seconds of awkward silence from having seen your advertisement  yes replied mrs wititterly one of my people put it in the paperyes  i thought perhaps said kate modestly that if you had not already made a final choice you would forgive my troubling you with an application  yes drawled mrs wititterly again  if you have already made a selection  oh dear no interrupted the lady i am not so easily suited i really dont know what to say you have never been a companion before have you  mrs nickleby who had been eagerly watching her opportunity came dexterously in before kate could reply not to any stranger maam said the good lady but she has been a companion to me for some years i am her mother maam  oh said mrs wititterly i apprehend you  i assure you maam said mrs nickleby that i very little thought at one time that it would be necessary for my daughter to go out into the world at all for her poor dear papa was an independent gentleman and would have been at this moment if he had but listened in time to my constant entreaties and  dear mama said kate in a low voice  my dear kate if you will allow me to speak said mrs nickleby i shall take the liberty of explaining to this lady  i think it is almost unnecessary mama  and notwithstanding all the frowns and winks with which mrs nickleby intimated that she was going to say something which would clench the business at once kate maintained her point by an expressive look and for once mrs nickleby was stopped upon the very brink of an oration  what are your accomplishments asked mrs wititterly with her eyes shut  kate blushed as she mentioned her principal acquirements and mrs nickleby checked them all off one by one on her fingers having calculated the number before she came out luckily the two calculations agreed so mrs nickleby had no excuse for talking  you are a good temper asked mrs wititterly opening her eyes for an instant and shutting them again  i hope so rejoined kate  and have a highly respectable reference for everything have you  kate replied that she had and laid her uncles card upon the table  have the goodness to draw your chair a little nearer and let me look at you said mrs wititterly i am so very nearsighted that i cant quite discern your features  kate complied though not without some embarrassment with this request and mrs wititterly took a languid survey of her countenance which lasted some two or three minutes  i like your appearance said that lady ringing a little bell alphonse request your master to come here  the page disappeared on this errand and after a short interval during which not a word was spoken on either side opened the door for an important gentleman of about eightandthirty of rather plebeian countenance and with a very light head of hair who leant over mrs wititterly for a little time and conversed with her in whispers  oh he said turning round yes this is a most important matter mrs wititterly is of a very excitable nature very delicate very fragile a hothouse plant an exotic  oh henry my dear interposed mrs wititterly  you are my love you know you are one breath said mr w blowing an imaginary feather away pho youre gone  the lady sighed  your soul is too large for your body said mr wititterly your intellect wears you out all the medical men say so you know that there is not a physician who is not proud of being called in to you what is their unanimous declaration my dear doctor said i to sir tumley snuffim in this very room the very last time he came my dear doctor what is my wifes complaint tell me all i can bear it is it nerves my dear fellow he said be proud of that woman make much of her she is an ornament to the fashionable world and to you her complaint is soul it swells expands dilatesthe blood fires the pulse quickens the excitement increaseswhew here mr wititterly who in the ardour of his description had flourished his right hand to within something less than an inch of mrs nicklebys bonnet drew it hastily back again and blew his nose as fiercely as if it had been done by some violent machinery  you make me out worse than i am henry said mrs wititterly with a faint smile  i do not julia i do not said mr w the society in which you movenecessarily move from your station connection and endowmentsis one vortex and whirlpool of the most frightful excitement bless my heart and body can i ever forget the night you danced with the baronets nephew at the election ball at exeter it was tremendous  i always suffer for these triumphs afterwards said mrs wititterly  and for that very reason rejoined her husband you must have a companion in whom there is great gentleness great sweetness excessive sympathy and perfect repose  here both mr and mrs wititterly who had talked rather at the nicklebys than to each other left off speaking and looked at their two hearers with an expression of countenance which seemed to say what do you think of all this  mrs wititterly said her husband addressing himself to mrs nickleby is sought after and courted by glittering crowds and brilliant circles she is excited by the opera the drama the fine arts thethethe  the nobility my love interposed mrs wititterly  the nobility of course said mr wititterly and the military she forms and expresses an immense variety of opinions on an immense variety of subjects if some people in public life were acquainted with mrs wititterlys real opinion of them they would not hold their heads perhaps quite as high as they do  hush henry said the lady this is scarcely fair  i mention no names julia replied mr wititterly and nobody is injured i merely mention the circumstance to show that you are no ordinary person that there is a constant friction perpetually going on between your mind and your body and that you must be soothed and tended now let me hear dispassionately and calmly what are this young ladys qualifications for the office  in obedience to this request the qualifications were all gone through again with the addition of many interruptions and crossquestionings from mr wititterly it was finally arranged that inquiries should be made and a decisive answer addressed to miss nickleby under cover of her uncle within two days these conditions agreed upon the page showed them down as far as the staircase window and the big footman relieving guard at that point piloted them in perfect safety to the streetdoor  they are very distinguished people evidently said mrs nickleby as she took her daughters arm what a superior person mrs wititterly is  do you think so mama was all kates reply  why who can help thinking so kate my love rejoined her mother she is pale though and looks much exhausted i hope she may not be wearing herself out but i am very much afraid  these considerations led the deepsighted lady into a calculation of the probable duration of mrs wititterlys life and the chances of the disconsolate widower bestowing his hand on her daughter before reaching home she had freed mrs wititterlys soul from all bodily restraint married kate with great splendour at st georges hanover square and only left undecided the minor question whether a splendid frenchpolished mahogany bedstead should be erected for herself in the twopair back of the house in cadogan place or in the threepair front between which apartments she could not quite balance the advantages and therefore adjusted the question at last by determining to leave it to the decision of her soninlaw  the inquiries were made the answernot to kates very great joywas favourable and at the expiration of a week she betook herself with all her movables and valuables to mrs wititterlys mansion where for the present we will leave her    chapter 22  nicholas accompanied by smike sallies forth to seek his fortune he encounters mr vincent crummles and who he was is herein made manifest   the whole capital which nicholas found himself entitled to either in possession reversion remainder or expectancy after paying his rent and settling with the broker from whom he had hired his poor furniture did not exceed by more than a few halfpence the sum of twenty shillings and yet he hailed the morning on which he had resolved to quit london with a light heart and sprang from his bed with an elasticity of spirit which is happily the lot of young persons or the world would never be stocked with old ones  it was a cold dry foggy morning in early spring a few meagre shadows flitted to and fro in the misty streets and occasionally there loomed through the dull vapour the heavy outline of some hackney coach wending homewards which drawing slowly nearer rolled jangling by scattering the thin crust of frost from its whitened roof and soon was lost again in the cloud at intervals were heard the tread of slipshod feet and the chilly cry of the poor sweep as he crept shivering to his early toil the heavy footfall of the official watcher of the night pacing slowly up and down and cursing the tardy hours that still intervened between him and sleep the rambling of ponderous carts and waggons the roll of the lighter vehicles which carried buyers and sellers to the different markets the sound of ineffectual knocking at the doors of heavy sleepersall these noises fell upon the ear from time to time but all seemed muffled by the fog and to be rendered almost as indistinct to the ear as was every object to the sight the sluggish darkness thickened as the day came on and those who had the courage to rise and peep at the gloomy street from their curtained windows crept back to bed again and coiled themselves up to sleep  before even these indications of approaching morning were rife in busy london nicholas had made his way alone to the city and stood beneath the windows of his mothers house it was dull and bare to see but it had light and life for him for there was at least one heart within its old walls to which insult or dishonour would bring the same blood rushing that flowed in his own veins  he crossed the road and raised his eyes to the window of the room where he knew his sister slept it was closed and dark poor girl thought nicholas she little thinks who lingers here  he looked again and felt for the moment almost vexed that kate was not there to exchange one word at parting good god he thought suddenly correcting himself what a boy i am  it is better as it is said nicholas after he had lounged on a few paces and returned to the same spot when i left them before and could have said goodbye a thousand times if i had chosen i spared them the pain of leavetaking and why not now as he spoke some fancied motion of the curtain almost persuaded him for the instant that kate was at the window and by one of those strange contradictions of feeling which are common to us all he shrunk involuntarily into a doorway that she might not see him he smiled at his own weakness said god bless them and walked away with a lighter step  smike was anxiously expecting him when he reached his old lodgings and so was newman who had expended a days income in a can of rum and milk to prepare them for the journey they had tied up the luggage smike shouldered it and away they went with newman noggs in company for he had insisted on walking as far as he could with them overnight  which way asked newman wistfully  to kingston first replied nicholas  and where afterwards asked newman why wont you tell me  because i scarcely know myself good friend rejoined nicholas laying his hand upon his shoulder and if i did i have neither plan nor prospect yet and might shift my quarters a hundred times before you could possibly communicate with me  i am afraid you have some deep scheme in your head said newman doubtfully  so deep replied his young friend that even i cant fathom it whatever i resolve upon depend upon it i will write you soon  you wont forget said newman  i am not very likely to rejoined nicholas i have not so many friends that i shall grow confused among the number and forget my best one  occupied in such discourse they walked on for a couple of hours as they might have done for a couple of days if nicholas had not sat himself down on a stone by the wayside and resolutely declared his intention of not moving another step until newman noggs turned back having pleaded ineffectually first for another halfmile and afterwards for another quarter newman was fain to comply and to shape his course towards golden square after interchanging many hearty and affectionate farewells and many times turning back to wave his hat to the two wayfarers when they had become mere specks in the distance  now listen to me smike said nicholas as they trudged with stout hearts onwards we are bound for portsmouth  smike nodded his head and smiled but expressed no other emotion for whether they had been bound for portsmouth or port royal would have been alike to him so they had been bound together  i dont know much of these matters resumed nicholas but portsmouth is a seaport town and if no other employment is to be obtained i should think we might get on board some ship i am young and active and could be useful in many ways so could you  i hope so replied smike when i was at thatyou know where i mean  yes i know said nicholas you neednt name the place  well when i was there resumed smike his eyes sparkling at the prospect of displaying his abilities i could milk a cow and groom a horse with anybody  ha said nicholas gravely i am afraid they dont keep many animals of either kind on board ship smike and even when they have horses that they are not very particular about rubbing them down still you can learn to do something else you know where theres a will theres a way  and i am very willing said smike brightening up again  god knows you are rejoined nicholas and if you fail it shall go hard but ill do enough for us both  do we go all the way today asked smike after a short silence  that would be too severe a trial even for your willing legs said nicholas with a goodhumoured smile no godalming is some thirty and odd miles from londonas i found from a map i borrowedand i purpose to rest there we must push on again tomorrow for we are not rich enough to loiter let me relieve you of that bundle come  no no rejoined smike falling back a few steps dont ask me to give it up to you  why not asked nicholas  let me do something for you at least said smike you will never let me serve you as i ought you will never know how i think day and night of ways to please you  you are a foolish fellow to say it for i know it well and see it or i should be a blind and senseless beast rejoined nicholas let me ask you a question while i think of it and there is no one by he added looking him steadily in the face have you a good memory  i dont know said smike shaking his head sorrowfully i think i had once but its all gone nowall gone  why do you think you had once asked nicholas turning quickly upon him as though the answer in some way helped out the purport of his question  because i could remember when i was a child said smike but that is very very long ago or at least it seems so i was always confused and giddy at that place you took me from and could never remember and sometimes couldnt even understand what they said to me ilet me seelet me see  you are wandering now said nicholas touching him on the arm  no replied his companion with a vacant look i was only thinking how he shivered involuntarily as he spoke  think no more of that place for it is all over retorted nicholas fixing his eyes full upon that of his companion which was fast settling into an unmeaning stupefied gaze once habitual to him and common even then what of the first day you went to yorkshire  eh cried the lad  that was before you began to lose your recollection you know said nicholas quietly was the weather hot or cold  wet replied the boy very wet i have always said when it has rained hard that it was like the night i came and they used to crowd round and laugh to see me cry when the rain fell heavily it was like a child they said and that made me think of it more i turned cold all over sometimes for i could see myself as i was then coming in at the very same door  as you were then repeated nicholas with assumed carelessness how was that  such a little creature said smike that they might have had pity and mercy upon me only to remember it  you didnt find your way there alone remarked nicholas  no rejoined smike oh no  who was with you  a mana dark withered man i have heard them say so at the school and i remembered that before i was glad to leave him i was afraid of him but they made me more afraid of them and used me harder too  look at me said nicholas wishing to attract his full attention there dont turn away do you remember no woman no kind woman who hung over you once and kissed your lips and called you her child  no said the poor creature shaking his head no never  nor any house but that house in yorkshire  no rejoined the youth with a melancholy look a roomi remember i slept in a room a large lonesome room at the top of a house where there was a trapdoor in the ceiling i have covered my head with the clothes often not to see it for it frightened me a young child with no one near at night and i used to wonder what was on the other side there was a clock too an old clock in one corner i remember that i have never forgotten that room for when i have terrible dreams it comes back just as it was i see things and people in it that i had never seen then but there is the room just as it used to be that never changes  will you let me take the bundle now asked nicholas abruptly changing the theme  no said smike no come let us walk on  he quickened his pace as he said this apparently under the impression that they had been standing still during the whole of the previous dialogue nicholas marked him closely and every word of this conversation remained upon his memory  it was by this time within an hour of noon and although a dense vapour still enveloped the city they had left as if the very breath of its busy people hung over their schemes of gain and profit and found greater attraction there than in the quiet region above in the open country it was clear and fair occasionally in some low spots they came upon patches of mist which the sun had not yet driven from their strongholds but these were soon passed and as they laboured up the hills beyond it was pleasant to look down and see how the sluggish mass rolled heavily off before the cheering influence of day a broad fine honest sun lighted up the green pastures and dimpled water with the semblance of summer while it left the travellers all the invigorating freshness of that early time of year the ground seemed elastic under their feet the sheepbells were music to their ears and exhilarated by exercise and stimulated by hope they pushed onward with the strength of lions  the day wore on and all these bright colours subsided and assumed a quieter tint like young hopes softened down by time or youthful features by degrees resolving into the calm and serenity of age but they were scarcely less beautiful in their slow decline than they had been in their prime for nature gives to every time and season some beauties of its own and from morning to night as from the cradle to the grave is but a succession of changes so gentle and easy that we can scarcely mark their progress  to godalming they came at last and here they bargained for two humble beds and slept soundly in the morning they were astir though not quite so early as the sun and again afoot if not with all the freshness of yesterday still with enough of hope and spirit to bear them cheerily on  it was a harder days journey than yesterdays for there were long and weary hills to climb and in journeys as in life it is a great deal easier to go down hill than up however they kept on with unabated perseverance and the hill has not yet lifted its face to heaven that perseverance will not gain the summit of at last  they walked upon the rim of the devils punch bowl and smike listened with greedy interest as nicholas read the inscription upon the stone which reared upon that wild spot tells of a murder committed there by night the grass on which they stood had once been dyed with gore and the blood of the murdered man had run down drop by drop into the hollow which gives the place its name the devils bowl thought nicholas as he looked into the void never held fitter liquor than that  onward they kept with steady purpose and entered at length upon a wide and spacious tract of downs with every variety of little hill and plain to change their verdant surface here there shot up almost perpendicularly into the sky a height so steep as to be hardly accessible to any but the sheep and goats that fed upon its sides and there stood a mound of green sloping and tapering off so delicately and merging so gently into the level ground that you could scarce define its limits hills swelling above each other and undulations shapely and uncouth smooth and rugged graceful and grotesque thrown negligently side by side bounded the view in each direction while frequently with unexpected noise there uprose from the ground a flight of crows who cawing and wheeling round the nearest hills as if uncertain of their course suddenly poised themselves upon the wing and skimmed down the long vista of some opening valley with the speed of light itself  by degrees the prospect receded more and more on either hand and as they had been shut out from rich and extensive scenery so they emerged once again upon the open country the knowledge that they were drawing near their place of destination gave them fresh courage to proceed but the way had been difficult and they had loitered on the road and smike was tired thus twilight had already closed in when they turned off the path to the door of a roadside inn yet twelve miles short of portsmouth  twelve miles said nicholas leaning with both hands on his stick and looking doubtfully at smike  twelve long miles repeated the landlord  is it a good road inquired nicholas  very bad said the landlord as of course being a landlord he would say  i want to get on observed nicholas hesitating i scarcely know what to do  dont let me influence you rejoined the landlord i wouldnt go on if it was me  wouldnt you asked nicholas with the same uncertainty  not if i knew when i was well off said the landlord and having said it he pulled up his apron put his hands into his pockets and taking a step or two outside the door looked down the dark road with an assumption of great indifference  a glance at the toilworn face of smike determined nicholas so without any further consideration he made up his mind to stay where he was  the landlord led them into the kitchen and as there was a good fire he remarked that it was very cold if there had happened to be a bad one he would have observed that it was very warm  what can you give us for supper was nicholass natural question  whywhat would you like was the landlords no less natural answer  nicholas suggested cold meat but there was no cold meatpoached eggs but there were no eggsmutton chops but there wasnt a mutton chop within three miles though there had been more last week than they knew what to do with and would be an extraordinary supply the day after tomorrow  then said nicholas i must leave it entirely to you as i would have done at first if you had allowed me  why then ill tell you what rejoined the landlord theres a gentleman in the parlour thats ordered a hot beefsteak pudding and potatoes at nine theres more of it than he can manage and i have very little doubt that if i ask leave you can sup with him ill do that in a minute  no no said nicholas detaining him i would rather not iat leastpshaw why cannot i speak out here you see that i am travelling in a very humble manner and have made my way hither on foot it is more than probable i think that the gentleman may not relish my company and although i am the dusty figure you see i am too proud to thrust myself into his  lord love you said the landlord its only mr crummles he isnt particular  is he not asked nicholas on whose mind to tell the truth the prospect of the savoury pudding was making some impression  not he replied the landlord hell like your way of talking i know but well soon see all about that just wait a minute  the landlord hurried into the parlour without staying for further permission nor did nicholas strive to prevent him wisely considering that supper under the circumstances was too serious a matter to be trifled with it was not long before the host returned in a condition of much excitement  all right he said in a low voice i knew he would youll see something rather worth seeing in there ecod how they are agoing of it  there was no time to inquire to what this exclamation which was delivered in a very rapturous tone referred for he had already thrown open the door of the room into which nicholas followed by smike with the bundle on his shoulder he carried it about with him as vigilantly as if it had been a sack of gold straightway repaired  nicholas was prepared for something odd but not for something quite so odd as the sight he encountered at the upper end of the room were a couple of boys one of them very tall and the other very short both dressed as sailorsor at least as theatrical sailors with belts buckles pigtails and pistols completefighting what is called in playbills a terrific combat with two of those short broadswords with basket hilts which are commonly used at our minor theatres the short boy had gained a great advantage over the tall boy who was reduced to mortal strait and both were overlooked by a large heavy man perched against the corner of a table who emphatically adjured them to strike a little more fire out of the swords and they couldnt fail to bring the house down on the very first night  mr vincent crummles said the landlord with an air of great deference this is the young gentleman  mr vincent crummles received nicholas with an inclination of the head something between the courtesy of a roman emperor and the nod of a pot companion and bade the landlord shut the door and begone  theres a picture said mr crummles motioning nicholas not to advance and spoil it the little un has him if the big un doesnt knock under in three seconds hes a dead man do that again boys  the two combatants went to work afresh and chopped away until the swords emitted a shower of sparks to the great satisfaction of mr crummles who appeared to consider this a very great point indeed the engagement commenced with about two hundred chops administered by the short sailor and the tall sailor alternately without producing any particular result until the short sailor was chopped down on one knee but this was nothing to him for he worked himself about on the one knee with the assistance of his left hand and fought most desperately until the tall sailor chopped his sword out of his grasp now the inference was that the short sailor reduced to this extremity would give in at once and cry quarter but instead of that he all of a sudden drew a large pistol from his belt and presented it at the face of the tall sailor who was so overcome at this not expecting it that he let the short sailor pick up his sword and begin again then the chopping recommenced and a variety of fancy chops were administered on both sides such as chops dealt with the left hand and under the leg and over the right shoulder and over the left and when the short sailor made a vigorous cut at the tall sailors legs which would have shaved them clean off if it had taken effect the tall sailor jumped over the short sailors sword wherefore to balance the matter and make it all fair the tall sailor administered the same cut and the short sailor jumped over his sword after this there was a good deal of dodging about and hitching up of the inexpressibles in the absence of braces and then the short sailor who was the moral character evidently for he always had the best of it made a violent demonstration and closed with the tall sailor who after a few unavailing struggles went down and expired in great torture as the short sailor put his foot upon his breast and bored a hole in him through and through  thatll be a double encore if you take care boys said mr crummles you had better get your wind now and change your clothes  having addressed these words to the combatants he saluted nicholas who then observed that the face of mr crummles was quite proportionate in size to his body that he had a very full underlip a hoarse voice as though he were in the habit of shouting very much and very short black hair shaved off nearly to the crown of his headto admit as he afterwards learnt of his more easily wearing character wigs of any shape or pattern  what did you think of that sir inquired mr crummles  very good indeedcapital answered nicholas  you wont see such boys as those very often i think said mr crummles  nicholas assentedobserving that if they were a little better match  match cried mr crummles  i mean if they were a little more of a size said nicholas explaining himself  size repeated mr crummles why its the essence of the combat that there should be a foot or two between them how are you to get up the sympathies of the audience in a legitimate manner if there isnt a little man contending against a big oneunless theres at least five to one and we havent hands enough for that business in our company  i see replied nicholas i beg your pardon that didnt occur to me i confess  its the main point said mr crummles i open at portsmouth the day after tomorrow if youre going there look into the theatre and see how thatll tell  nicholas promised to do so if he could and drawing a chair near the fire fell into conversation with the manager at once he was very talkative and communicative stimulated perhaps not only by his natural disposition but by the spirits and water he sipped very plentifully or the snuff he took in large quantities from a piece of whiteybrown paper in his waistcoat pocket he laid open his affairs without the smallest reserve and descanted at some length upon the merits of his company and the acquirements of his family of both of which the two broadsword boys formed an honourable portion there was to be a gathering it seemed of the different ladies and gentlemen at portsmouth on the morrow whither the father and sons were proceeding not for the regular season but in the course of a wandering speculation after fulfilling an engagement at guildford with the greatest applause  you are going that way asked the manager  yeyes said nicholas yes i am  do you know the town at all inquired the manager who seemed to consider himself entitled to the same degree of confidence as he had himself exhibited  no replied nicholas  never there  never  mr vincent crummles gave a short dry cough as much as to say if you wont be communicative you wont and took so many pinches of snuff from the piece of paper one after another that nicholas quite wondered where it all went to  while he was thus engaged mr crummles looked from time to time with great interest at smike with whom he had appeared considerably struck from the first he had now fallen asleep and was nodding in his chair  excuse my saying so said the manager leaning over to nicholas and sinking his voice but what a capital countenance your friend has got  poor fellow said nicholas with a halfsmile i wish it were a little more plump and less haggard  plump exclaimed the manager quite horrified youd spoil it for ever  do you think so  think so sir why as he is now said the manager striking his knee emphatically without a pad upon his body and hardly a touch of paint upon his face hed make such an actor for the starved business as was never seen in this country only let him be tolerably well up in the apothecary in romeo and juliet with the slightest possible dab of red on the tip of his nose and hed be certain of three rounds the moment he put his head out of the practicable door in the front grooves op  you view him with a professional eye said nicholas laughing  and well i may rejoined the manager i never saw a young fellow so regularly cut out for that line since ive been in the profession and i played the heavy children when i was eighteen months old  the appearance of the beefsteak pudding which came in simultaneously with the junior vincent crummleses turned the conversation to other matters and indeed for a time stopped it altogether these two young gentlemen wielded their knives and forks with scarcely less address than their broadswords and as the whole party were quite as sharp set as either class of weapons there was no time for talking until the supper had been disposed of  the master crummleses had no sooner swallowed the last procurable morsel of food than they evinced by various halfsuppressed yawns and stretchings of their limbs an obvious inclination to retire for the night which smike had betrayed still more strongly he having in the course of the meal fallen asleep several times while in the very act of eating nicholas therefore proposed that they should break up at once but the manager would by no means hear of it vowing that he had promised himself the pleasure of inviting his new acquaintance to share a bowl of punch and that if he declined he should deem it very unhandsome behaviour  let them go said mr vincent crummles and well have it snugly and cosily together by the fire  nicholas was not much disposed to sleepbeing in truth too anxiousso after a little demur he accepted the offer and having exchanged a shake of the hand with the young crummleses and the manager having on his part bestowed a most affectionate benediction on smike he sat himself down opposite to that gentleman by the fireside to assist in emptying the bowl which soon afterwards appeared steaming in a manner which was quite exhilarating to behold and sending forth a most grateful and inviting fragrance  but despite the punch and the manager who told a variety of stories and smoked tobacco from a pipe and inhaled it in the shape of snuff with a most astonishing power nicholas was absent and dispirited his thoughts were in his old home and when they reverted to his present condition the uncertainty of the morrow cast a gloom upon him which his utmost efforts were unable to dispel his attention wandered although he heard the managers voice he was deaf to what he said and when mr vincent crummles concluded the history of some long adventure with a loud laugh and an inquiry what nicholas would have done under the same circumstances he was obliged to make the best apology in his power and to confess his entire ignorance of all he had been talking about  why so i saw observed mr crummles youre uneasy in your mind whats the matter  nicholas could not refrain from smiling at the abruptness of the question but thinking it scarcely worth while to parry it owned that he was under some apprehensions lest he might not succeed in the object which had brought him to that part of the country  and whats that asked the manager  getting something to do which will keep me and my poor fellowtraveller in the common necessaries of life said nicholas thats the truth you guessed it long ago i dare say so i may as well have the credit of telling it you with a good grace  whats to be got to do at portsmouth more than anywhere else asked mr vincent crummles melting the sealingwax on the stem of his pipe in the candle and rolling it out afresh with his little finger  there are many vessels leaving the port i suppose replied nicholas i shall try for a berth in some ship or other there is meat and drink there at all events  salt meat and new rum peasepudding and chaffbiscuits said the manager taking a whiff at his pipe to keep it alight and returning to his work of embellishment  one may do worse than that said nicholas i can rough it i believe as well as most young men of my age and previous habits  you need be able to said the manager if you go on board ship but you wont  why not  because theres not a skipper or mate that would think you worth your salt when he could get a practised hand replied the manager and they as plentiful there as the oysters in the streets  what do you mean asked nicholas alarmed by this prediction and the confident tone in which it had been uttered men are not born able seamen they must be reared i suppose  mr vincent crummles nodded his head they must but not at your age or from young gentlemen like you  there was a pause the countenance of nicholas fell and he gazed ruefully at the fire  does no other profession occur to you which a young man of your figure and address could take up easily and see the world to advantage in asked the manager  no said nicholas shaking his head  why then ill tell you one said mr crummles throwing his pipe into the fire and raising his voice the stage  the stage cried nicholas in a voice almost as loud  the theatrical profession said mr vincent crummles i am in the theatrical profession myself my wife is in the theatrical profession my children are in the theatrical profession i had a dog that lived and died in it from a puppy and my chaisepony goes on in timour the tartar ill bring you out and your friend too say the word i want a novelty  i dont know anything about it rejoined nicholas whose breath had been almost taken away by this sudden proposal i never acted a part in my life except at school  theres genteel comedy in your walk and manner juvenile tragedy in your eye and touchandgo farce in your laugh said mr vincent crummles youll do as well as if you had thought of nothing else but the lamps from your birth downwards  nicholas thought of the small amount of small change that would remain in his pocket after paying the tavern bill and he hesitated  you can be useful to us in a hundred ways said mr crummles think what capital bills a man of your education could write for the shopwindows  well i think i could manage that department said nicholas  to be sure you could replied mr crummles for further particulars see small handbillswe might have half a volume in every one of em pieces too why you could write us a piece to bring out the whole strength of the company whenever we wanted one  i am not quite so confident about that replied nicholas but i dare say i could scribble something now and then that would suit you  well have a new showpiece out directly said the manager let me seepeculiar resources of this establishmentnew and splendid sceneryyou must manage to introduce a real pump and two washingtubs  into the piece said nicholas  yes replied the manager i bought em cheap at a sale the other day and theyll come in admirably thats the london plan they look up some dresses and properties and have a piece written to fit em most of the theatres keep an author on purpose  indeed cried nicholas  oh yes said the manager a common thing itll look very well in the bills in separate linesreal pumpsplendid tubsgreat attraction you dont happen to be anything of an artist do you  that is not one of my accomplishments rejoined nicholas  ah then it cant be helped said the manager if you had been we might have had a large woodcut of the last scene for the posters showing the whole depth of the stage with the pump and tubs in the middle but however if youre not it cant be helped  what should i get for all this inquired nicholas after a few moments reflection could i live by it  live by it said the manager like a prince with your own salary and your friends and your writings youd makeah youd make a pound a week  you dont say so  i do indeed and if we had a run of good houses nearly double the money  nicholas shrugged his shoulders but sheer destitution was before him and if he could summon fortitude to undergo the extremes of want and hardship for what had he rescued his helpless charge if it were only to bear as hard a fate as that from which he had wrested him it was easy to think of seventy miles as nothing when he was in the same town with the man who had treated him so ill and roused his bitterest thoughts but now it seemed far enough what if he went abroad and his mother or kate were to die the while  without more deliberation he hastily declared that it was a bargain and gave mr vincent crummles his hand upon it    chapter 23  treats of the company of mr vincent crummles and of his affairs domestic and theatrical   as mr crummles had a strange fourlegged animal in the inn stables which he called a pony and a vehicle of unknown design on which he bestowed the appellation of a fourwheeled phaeton nicholas proceeded on his journey next morning with greater ease than he had expected the manager and himself occupying the front seat and the master crummleses and smike being packed together behind in company with a wicker basket defended from wet by a stout oilskin in which were the broadswords pistols pigtails nautical costumes and other professional necessaries of the aforesaid young gentlemen  the pony took his time upon the road andpossibly in consequence of his theatrical educationevinced every now and then a strong inclination to lie down however mr vincent crummles kept him up pretty well by jerking the rein and plying the whip and when these means failed and the animal came to a stand the elder master crummles got out and kicked him by dint of these encouragements he was persuaded to move from time to time and they jogged on as mr crummles truly observed very comfortably for all parties  hes a good pony at bottom said mr crummles turning to nicholas  he might have been at bottom but he certainly was not at top seeing that his coat was of the roughest and most illfavoured kind so nicholas merely observed that he shouldnt wonder if he was  many and many is the circuit this pony has gone said mr crummles flicking him skilfully on the eyelid for old acquaintance sake he is quite one of us his mother was on the stage  was she rejoined nicholas  she ate applepie at a circus for upwards of fourteen years said the manager fired pistols and went to bed in a nightcap and in short took the low comedy entirely his father was a dancer  was he at all distinguished  not very said the manager he was rather a low sort of pony the fact is he had been originally jobbed out by the day and he never quite got over his old habits he was clever in melodrama too but too broadtoo broad when the mother died he took the portwine business  the portwine business cried nicholas  drinking portwine with the clown said the manager but he was greedy and one night bit off the bowl of the glass and choked himself so his vulgarity was the death of him at last  the descendant of this illstarred animal requiring increased attention from mr crummles as he progressed in his days work that gentleman had very little time for conversation nicholas was thus left at leisure to entertain himself with his own thoughts until they arrived at the drawbridge at portsmouth when mr crummles pulled up  well get down here said the manager and the boys will take him round to the stable and call at my lodgings with the luggage you had better let yours be taken there for the present  thanking mr vincent crummles for his obliging offer nicholas jumped out and giving smike his arm accompanied the manager up high street on their way to the theatre feeling nervous and uncomfortable enough at the prospect of an immediate introduction to a scene so new to him  they passed a great many bills pasted against the walls and displayed in windows wherein the names of mr vincent crummles mrs vincent crummles master crummles master p crummles and miss crummles were printed in very large letters and everything else in very small ones and turning at length into an entry in which was a strong smell of orangepeel and lampoil with an undercurrent of sawdust groped their way through a dark passage and descending a step or two threaded a little maze of canvas screens and paint pots and emerged upon the stage of the portsmouth theatre  here we are said mr crummles  it was not very light but nicholas found himself close to the first entrance on the prompt side among bare walls dusty scenes mildewed clouds heavily daubed draperies and dirty floors he looked about him ceiling pit boxes gallery orchestra fittings and decorations of every kindall looked coarse cold gloomy and wretched  is this a theatre whispered smike in amazement i thought it was a blaze of light and finery  why so it is replied nicholas hardly less surprised but not by day smikenot by day  the managers voice recalled him from a more careful inspection of the building to the opposite side of the proscenium where at a small mahogany table with rickety legs and of an oblong shape sat a stout portly female apparently between forty and fifty in a tarnished silk cloak with her bonnet dangling by the strings in her hand and her hair of which she had a great quantity braided in a large festoon over each temple  mr johnson said the manager for nicholas had given the name which newman noggs had bestowed upon him in his conversation with mrs kenwigs let me introduce mrs vincent crummles  i am glad to see you sir said mrs vincent crummles in a sepulchral voice i am very glad to see you and still more happy to hail you as a promising member of our corps  the lady shook nicholas by the hand as she addressed him in these terms he saw it was a large one but had not expected quite such an iron grip as that with which she honoured him  and this said the lady crossing to smike as tragic actresses cross when they obey a stage direction and this is the other you too are welcome sir  hell do i think my dear said the manager taking a pinch of snuff  he is admirable replied the lady an acquisition indeed  as mrs vincent crummles recrossed back to the table there bounded on to the stage from some mysterious inlet a little girl in a dirty white frock with tucks up to the knees short trousers sandaled shoes white spencer pink gauze bonnet green veil and curl papers who turned a pirouette cut twice in the air turned another pirouette then looking off at the opposite wing shrieked bounded forward to within six inches of the footlights and fell into a beautiful attitude of terror as a shabby gentleman in an old pair of buff slippers came in at one powerful slide and chattering his teeth fiercely brandished a walkingstick  they are going through the indian savage and the maiden said mrs crummles  oh said the manager the little ballet interlude very good go on a little this way if you please mr johnson thatll do now  the manager clapped his hands as a signal to proceed and the savage becoming ferocious made a slide towards the maiden but the maiden avoided him in six twirls and came down at the end of the last one upon the very points of her toes this seemed to make some impression upon the savage for after a little more ferocity and chasing of the maiden into corners he began to relent and stroked his face several times with his right thumb and four fingers thereby intimating that he was struck with admiration of the maidens beauty acting upon the impulse of this passion he the savage began to hit himself severe thumps in the chest and to exhibit other indications of being desperately in love which being rather a prosy proceeding was very likely the cause of the maidens falling asleep whether it was or no asleep she did fall sound as a church on a sloping bank and the savage perceiving it leant his left ear on his left hand and nodded sideways to intimate to all whom it might concern that she was asleep and no shamming being left to himself the savage had a dance all alone just as he left off the maiden woke up rubbed her eyes got off the bank and had a dance all alone toosuch a dance that the savage looked on in ecstasy all the while and when it was done plucked from a neighbouring tree some botanical curiosity resembling a small pickled cabbage and offered it to the maiden who at first wouldnt have it but on the savage shedding tears relented then the savage jumped for joy then the maiden jumped for rapture at the sweet smell of the pickled cabbage then the savage and the maiden danced violently together and finally the savage dropped down on one knee and the maiden stood on one leg upon his other knee thus concluding the ballet and leaving the spectators in a state of pleasing uncertainty whether she would ultimately marry the savage or return to her friends  very well indeed said mr crummles bravo  bravo cried nicholas resolved to make the best of everything beautiful  this sir said mr vincent crummles bringing the maiden forward this is the infant phenomenonmiss ninetta crummles  your daughter inquired nicholas  my daughtermy daughter replied mr vincent crummles the idol of every place we go into sir we have had complimentary letters about this girl sir from the nobility and gentry of almost every town in england  i am not surprised at that said nicholas she must be quite a natural genius  quite a mr crummles stopped language was not powerful enough to describe the infant phenomenon ill tell you what sir he said the talent of this child is not to be imagined she must be seen sirseento be ever so faintly appreciated there go to your mother my dear  may i ask how old she is inquired nicholas  you may sir replied mr crummles looking steadily in his questioners face as some men do when they have doubts about being implicitly believed in what they are going to say she is ten years of age sir  not more  not a day  dear me said nicholas its extraordinary  it was for the infant phenomenon though of short stature had a comparatively aged countenance and had moreover been precisely the same agenot perhaps to the full extent of the memory of the oldest inhabitant but certainly for five good years but she had been kept up late every night and put upon an unlimited allowance of ginandwater from infancy to prevent her growing tall and perhaps this system of training had produced in the infant phenomenon these additional phenomena  while this short dialogue was going on the gentleman who had enacted the savage came up with his walking shoes on his feet and his slippers in his hand to within a few paces as if desirous to join in the conversation deeming this a good opportunity he put in his word  talent there sir said the savage nodding towards miss crummles  nicholas assented  ah said the actor setting his teeth together and drawing in his breath with a hissing sound she oughtnt to be in the provinces she oughtnt  what do you mean asked the manager  i mean to say replied the other warmly that she is too good for country boards and that she ought to be in one of the large houses in london or nowhere and i tell you more without mincing the matter that if it wasnt for envy and jealousy in some quarter that you know of she would be perhaps youll introduce me here mr crummles  mr folair said the manager presenting him to nicholas  happy to know you sir mr folair touched the brim of his hat with his forefinger and then shook hands a recruit sir i understand  an unworthy one replied nicholas  did you ever see such a setout as that whispered the actor drawing him away as crummles left them to speak to his wife  as what  mr folair made a funny face from his pantomime collection and pointed over his shoulder  you dont mean the infant phenomenon  infant humbug sir replied mr folair there isnt a female child of common sharpness in a charity school that couldnt do better than that she may thank her stars she was born a managers daughter  you seem to take it to heart observed nicholas with a smile  yes by jove and well i may said mr folair drawing his arm through his and walking him up and down the stage isnt it enough to make a man crusty to see that little sprawler put up in the best business every night and actually keeping money out of the house by being forced down the peoples throats while other people are passed over isnt it extraordinary to see a mans confounded family conceit blinding him even to his own interest why i know of fifteen and sixpence that came to southampton one night last month to see me dance the highland fling and whats the consequence ive never been put up in it sincenever oncewhile the infant phenomenon has been grinning through artificial flowers at five people and a baby in the pit and two boys in the gallery every night  if i may judge from what i have seen of you said nicholas you must be a valuable member of the company  oh replied mr folair beating his slippers together to knock the dust out i can come it pretty wellnobody better perhaps in my own linebut having such business as one gets here is like putting lead on ones feet instead of chalk and dancing in fetters without the credit of it holloa old fellow how are you  the gentleman addressed in these latter words was a darkcomplexioned man inclining indeed to sallow with long thick black hair and very evident inclinations although he was close shaved of a stiff beard and whiskers of the same deep shade his age did not appear to exceed thirty though many at first sight would have considered him much older as his face was long and very pale from the constant application of stage paint he wore a checked shirt an old green coat with new gilt buttons a neckerchief of broad red and green stripes and full blue trousers he carried too a common ash walkingstick apparently more for show than use as he flourished it about with the hooked end downwards except when he raised it for a few seconds and throwing himself into a fencing attitude made a pass or two at the sidescenes or at any other object animate or inanimate that chanced to afford him a pretty good mark at the moment  well tommy said this gentleman making a thrust at his friend who parried it dexterously with his slipper whats the news  a new appearance thats all replied mr folair looking at nicholas  do the honours tommy do the honours said the other gentleman tapping him reproachfully on the crown of the hat with his stick  this is mr lenville who does our first tragedy mr johnson said the pantomimist  except when old bricks and mortar takes it into his head to do it himself you should add tommy remarked mr lenville you know who bricks and mortar is i suppose sir  i do not indeed replied nicholas  we call crummles that because his style of acting is rather in the heavy and ponderous way said mr lenville i mustnt be cracking jokes though for ive got a part of twelve lengths here which i must be up in tomorrow night and i havent had time to look at it yet im a confounded quick study thats one comfort  consoling himself with this reflection mr lenville drew from his coat pocket a greasy and crumpled manuscript and having made another pass at his friend proceeded to walk to and fro conning it to himself and indulging occasionally in such appropriate action as his imagination and the text suggested  a pretty general muster of the company had by this time taken place for besides mr lenville and his friend tommy there were present a slim young gentleman with weak eyes who played the lowspirited lovers and sang tenor songs and who had come arminarm with the comic countrymana man with a turnedup nose large mouth broad face and staring eyes making himself very amiable to the infant phenomenon was an inebriated elderly gentleman in the last depths of shabbiness who played the calm and virtuous old men and paying especial court to mrs crummles was another elderly gentleman a shade more respectable who played the irascible old menthose funny fellows who have nephews in the army and perpetually run about with thick sticks to compel them to marry heiresses besides these there was a rovinglooking person in a rough greatcoat who strode up and down in front of the lamps flourishing a dress cane and rattling away in an undertone with great vivacity for the amusement of an ideal audience he was not quite so young as he had been and his figure was rather running to seed but there was an air of exaggerated gentility about him which bespoke the hero of swaggering comedy there was also a little group of three or four young men with lantern jaws and thick eyebrows who were conversing in one corner but they seemed to be of secondary importance and laughed and talked together without attracting any attention  the ladies were gathered in a little knot by themselves round the rickety table before mentioned there was miss snevellicciwho could do anything from a medley dance to lady macbeth and also always played some part in blue silk kneesmalls at her benefitglancing from the depths of her coalscuttle straw bonnet at nicholas and affecting to be absorbed in the recital of a diverting story to her friend miss ledrook who had brought her work and was making up a ruff in the most natural manner possible there was miss belvawneywho seldom aspired to speaking parts and usually went on as a page in white silk hose to stand with one leg bent and contemplate the audience or to go in and out after mr crummles in stately tragedytwisting up the ringlets of the beautiful miss bravassa who had once had her likeness taken in character by an engravers apprentice whereof impressions were hung up for sale in the pastrycooks window and the greengrocers and at the circulating library and the boxoffice whenever the announce bills came out for her annual night there was mrs lenville in a very limp bonnet and veil decidedly in that way in which she would wish to be if she truly loved mr lenville there was miss gazingi with an imitation ermine boa tied in a loose knot round her neck flogging mr crummles junior with both ends in fun lastly there was mrs grudden in a brown cloth pelisse and a beaver bonnet who assisted mrs crummles in her domestic affairs and took money at the doors and dressed the ladies and swept the house and held the prompt book when everybody else was on for the last scene and acted any kind of part on any emergency without ever learning it and was put down in the bills under any name or names whatever that occurred to mr crummles as looking well in print  mr folair having obligingly confided these particulars to nicholas left him to mingle with his fellows the work of personal introduction was completed by mr vincent crummles who publicly heralded the new actor as a prodigy of genius and learning  i beg your pardon said miss snevellicci sidling towards nicholas but did you ever play at canterbury  i never did replied nicholas  i recollect meeting a gentleman at canterbury said miss snevellicci only for a few moments for i was leaving the company as he joined it so like you that i felt almost certain it was the same  i see you now for the first time rejoined nicholas with all due gallantry i am sure i never saw you before i couldnt have forgotten it  oh im sureits very flattering of you to say so retorted miss snevellicci with a graceful bend now i look at you again i see that the gentleman at canterbury hadnt the same eyes as youyoull think me very foolish for taking notice of such things wont you  not at all said nicholas how can i feel otherwise than flattered by your notice in any way  oh you men are such vain creatures cried miss snevellicci whereupon she became charmingly confused and pulling out her pockethandkerchief from a faded pink silk reticule with a gilt clasp called to miss ledrook  led my dear said miss snevellicci  well what is the matter said miss ledrook  its not the same  not the same what  canterburyyou know what i mean come here i want to speak to you  but miss ledrook wouldnt come to miss snevellicci so miss snevellicci was obliged to go to miss ledrook which she did in a skipping manner that was quite fascinating and miss ledrook evidently joked miss snevellicci about being struck with nicholas for after some playful whispering miss snevellicci hit miss ledrook very hard on the backs of her hands and retired up in a state of pleasing confusion  ladies and gentlemen said mr vincent crummles who had been writing on a piece of paper well call the mortal struggle tomorrow at ten everybody for the procession intrigue and ways and means youre all up in so we shall only want one rehearsal everybody at ten if you please  everybody at ten repeated mrs grudden looking about her  on monday morning we shall read a new piece said mr crummles the names not known yet but everybody will have a good part mr johnson will take care of that  hallo said nicholas starting i  on monday morning repeated mr crummles raising his voice to drown the unfortunate mr johnsons remonstrance thatll do ladies and gentlemen  the ladies and gentlemen required no second notice to quit and in a few minutes the theatre was deserted save by the crummles family nicholas and smike  upon my word said nicholas taking the manager aside i dont think i can be ready by monday  pooh pooh replied mr crummles  but really i cant returned nicholas my invention is not accustomed to these demands or possibly i might produce  invention what the devils that got to do with it cried the manager hastily  everything my dear sir  nothing my dear sir retorted the manager with evident impatience do you understand french  perfectly well  very good said the manager opening the table drawer and giving a roll of paper from it to nicholas there just turn that into english and put your name on the titlepage damn me said mr crummles angrily if i havent often said that i wouldnt have a man or woman in my company that wasnt master of the language so that they might learn it from the original and play it in english and save all this trouble and expense  nicholas smiled and pocketed the play  what are you going to do about your lodgings said mr crummles  nicholas could not help thinking that for the first week it would be an uncommon convenience to have a turnup bedstead in the pit but he merely remarked that he had not turned his thoughts that way  come home with me then said mr crummles and my boys shall go with you after dinner and show you the most likely place  the offer was not to be refused nicholas and mr crummles gave mrs crummles an arm each and walked up the street in stately array smike the boys and the phenomenon went home by a shorter cut and mrs grudden remained behind to take some cold irish stew and a pint of porter in the boxoffice  mrs crummles trod the pavement as if she were going to immediate execution with an animating consciousness of innocence and that heroic fortitude which virtue alone inspires mr crummles on the other hand assumed the look and gait of a hardened despot but they both attracted some notice from many of the passersby and when they heard a whisper of mr and mrs crummles or saw a little boy run back to stare them in the face the severe expression of their countenances relaxed for they felt it was popularity  mr crummles lived in st thomass street at the house of one bulph a pilot who sported a boatgreen door with windowframes of the same colour and had the little finger of a drowned man on his parlour mantelshelf with other maritime and natural curiosities he displayed also a brass knocker a brass plate and a brass bellhandle all very bright and shining and had a mast with a vane on the top of it in his back yard  you are welcome said mrs crummles turning round to nicholas when they reached the bowwindowed front room on the first floor  nicholas bowed his acknowledgments and was unfeignedly glad to see the cloth laid  we have but a shoulder of mutton with onion sauce said mrs crummles in the same charnelhouse voice but such as our dinner is we beg you to partake of it  you are very good replied nicholas i shall do it ample justice  vincent said mrs crummles what is the hour  five minutes past dinnertime said mr crummles  mrs crummles rang the bell let the mutton and onion sauce appear  the slave who attended upon mr bulphs lodgers disappeared and after a short interval reappeared with the festive banquet nicholas and the infant phenomenon opposed each other at the pembroketable and smike and the master crummleses dined on the sofa bedstead  are they very theatrical people here asked nicholas  no replied mr crummles shaking his head far from itfar from it  i pity them observed mrs crummles  so do i said nicholas if they have no relish for theatrical entertainments properly conducted  then they have none sir rejoined mr crummles to the infants benefit last year on which occasion she repeated three of her most popular characters and also appeared in the fairy porcupine as originally performed by her there was a house of no more than four pound twelve  is it possible cried nicholas  and two pound of that was trust pa said the phenomenon  and two pound of that was trust repeated mr crummles mrs crummles herself has played to mere handfuls  but they are always a taking audience vincent said the managers wife  most audiences are when they have good actingreal good actingthe regular thing replied mr crummles forcibly  do you give lessons maam inquired nicholas  i do said mrs crummles  there is no teaching here i suppose  there has been said mrs crummles i have received pupils here i imparted tuition to the daughter of a dealer in ships provision but it afterwards appeared that she was insane when she first came to me it was very extraordinary that she should come under such circumstances  not feeling quite so sure of that nicholas thought it best to hold his peace  let me see said the manager cogitating after dinner would you like some nice little part with the infant  you are very good replied nicholas hastily but i think perhaps it would be better if i had somebody of my own size at first in case i should turn out awkward i should feel more at home perhaps  true said the manager perhaps you would and you could play up to the infant in time you know  certainly replied nicholas devoutly hoping that it would be a very long time before he was honoured with this distinction  then ill tell you what well do said mr crummles you shall study romeo when youve done that piecedont forget to throw the pump and tubs in bythebyejuliet miss snevellicci old grudden the nurseyes thatll do very well rover tooyou might get up rover while you were about it and cassio and jeremy diddler you can easily knock them off one part helps the other so much here they are cues and all  with these hasty general directions mr crummles thrust a number of little books into the faltering hands of nicholas and bidding his eldest son go with him and show where lodgings were to be had shook him by the hand and wished him good night  there is no lack of comfortable furnished apartments in portsmouth and no difficulty in finding some that are proportionate to very slender finances but the former were too good and the latter too bad and they went into so many houses and came out unsuited that nicholas seriously began to think he should be obliged to ask permission to spend the night in the theatre after all  eventually however they stumbled upon two small rooms up three pair of stairs or rather two pair and a ladder at a tobacconists shop on the common hard a dirty street leading down to the dockyard these nicholas engaged only too happy to have escaped any request for payment of a weeks rent beforehand  there lay down our personal property smike he said after showing young crummles downstairs we have fallen upon strange times and heaven only knows the end of them but i am tired with the events of these three days and will postpone reflection till tomorrowif i can    chapter 24  of the great bespeak for miss snevellicci and the first appearance of nicholas upon any stage   nicholas was up betimes in the morning but he had scarcely begun to dress notwithstanding when he heard footsteps ascending the stairs and was presently saluted by the voices of mr folair the pantomimist and mr lenville the tragedian  house house house cried mr folair  what ho within there said mr lenville in a deep voice  confound these fellows thought nicholas they have come to breakfast i suppose ill open the door directly if youll wait an instant  the gentlemen entreated him not to hurry himself and to beguile the interval had a fencing bout with their walkingsticks on the very small landingplace to the unspeakable discomposure of all the other lodgers downstairs  here come in said nicholas when he had completed his toilet in the name of all thats horrible dont make that noise outside  an uncommon snug little box this said mr lenville stepping into the front room and taking his hat off before he could get in at all pernicious snug  for a man at all particular in such matters it might be a trifle too snug said nicholas for although it is undoubtedly a great convenience to be able to reach anything you want from the ceiling or the floor or either side of the room without having to move from your chair still these advantages can only be had in an apartment of the most limited size  it isnt a bit too confined for a single man returned mr lenville that reminds memy wife mr johnsoni hope shell have some good part in this piece of yours  i glanced at the french copy last night said nicholas it looks very good i think  what do you mean to do for me old fellow asked mr lenville poking the struggling fire with his walkingstick and afterwards wiping it on the skirt of his coat anything in the gruff and grumble way  you turn your wife and child out of doors said nicholas and in a fit of rage and jealousy stab your eldest son in the library  do i though exclaimed mr lenville thats very good business  after which said nicholas you are troubled with remorse till the last act and then you make up your mind to destroy yourself but just as you are raising the pistol to your head a clock strikesten  i see cried mr lenville very good  you pause said nicholas you recollect to have heard a clock strike ten in your infancy the pistol falls from your handyou are overcomeyou burst into tears and become a virtuous and exemplary character for ever afterwards  capital said mr lenville thats a sure card a sure card get the curtain down with a touch of nature like that and itll be a triumphant success  is there anything good for me inquired mr folair anxiously  let me see said nicholas you play the faithful and attached servant you are turned out of doors with the wife and child  always coupled with that infernal phenomenon sighed mr folair and we go into poor lodgings where i wont take any wages and talk sentiment i suppose  whyyes replied nicholas that is the course of the piece  i must have a dance of some kind you know said mr folair youll have to introduce one for the phenomenon so youd better make a pas de deux and save time  theres nothing easier than that said mr lenville observing the disturbed looks of the young dramatist  upon my word i dont see how its to be done rejoined nicholas  why isnt it obvious reasoned mr lenville gadzooks who can help seeing the way to do ityou astonish me you get the distressed lady and the little child and the attached servant into the poor lodgings dont youwell look here the distressed lady sinks into a chair and buries her face in her pockethandkerchief what makes you weep mama says the child dont weep mama or youll make me weep tooand me says the favourite servant rubbing his eyes with his arm what can we do to raise your spirits dear mama says the little child ay what can we do says the faithful servant oh pierre says the distressed lady would that i could shake off these painful thoughtstry maam try says the faithful servant rouse yourself maam be amusedi will says the lady i will learn to suffer with fortitude do you remember that dance my honest friend which in happier days you practised with this sweet angel it never failed to calm my spirits then oh let me see it once again before i diethere it iscue for the band before i dieand off they go thats the regular thing isnt it tommy  thats it replied mr folair the distressed lady overpowered by old recollections faints at the end of the dance and you close in with a picture  profiting by these and other lessons which were the result of the personal experience of the two actors nicholas willingly gave them the best breakfast he could and when he at length got rid of them applied himself to his task by no means displeased to find that it was so much easier than he had at first supposed he worked very hard all day and did not leave his room until the evening when he went down to the theatre whither smike had repaired before him to go on with another gentleman as a general rebellion  here all the people were so much changed that he scarcely knew them false hair false colour false calves false musclesthey had become different beings mr lenville was a blooming warrior of most exquisite proportions mr crummles his large face shaded by a profusion of black hair a highland outlaw of most majestic bearing one of the old gentlemen a jailer and the other a venerable patriarch the comic countryman a fightingman of great valour relieved by a touch of humour each of the master crummleses a prince in his own right and the lowspirited lover a desponding captive there was a gorgeous banquet ready spread for the third act consisting of two pasteboard vases one plate of biscuits a black bottle and a vinegar cruet and in short everything was on a scale of the utmost splendour and preparation  nicholas was standing with his back to the curtain now contemplating the first scene which was a gothic archway about two feet shorter than mr crummles through which that gentleman was to make his first entrance and now listening to a couple of people who were cracking nuts in the gallery wondering whether they made the whole audience when the manager himself walked familiarly up and accosted him  been in front tonight said mr crummles  no replied nicholas not yet i am going to see the play  weve had a pretty good let said mr crummles four front places in the centre and the whole of the stagebox  oh indeed said nicholas a family i suppose  yes replied mr crummles yes its an affecting thing there are six children and they never come unless the phenomenon plays  it would have been difficult for any party family or otherwise to have visited the theatre on a night when the phenomenon did not play inasmuch as she always sustained one and not uncommonly two or three characters every night but nicholas sympathising with the feelings of a father refrained from hinting at this trifling circumstance and mr crummles continued to talk uninterrupted by him  six said that gentleman pa and ma eight aunt nine governess ten grandfather and grandmother twelve then theres the footman who stands outside with a bag of oranges and a jug of toastandwater and sees the play for nothing through the little pane of glass in the boxdoorits cheap at a guinea they gain by taking a box  i wonder you allow so many observed nicholas  theres no help for it replied mr crummles its always expected in the country if there are six children six people come to hold them in their laps a familybox carries double always ring in the orchestra grudden  that useful lady did as she was requested and shortly afterwards the tuning of three fiddles was heard which process having been protracted as long as it was supposed that the patience of the audience could possibly bear it was put a stop to by another jerk of the bell which being the signal to begin in earnest set the orchestra playing a variety of popular airs with involuntary variations  if nicholas had been astonished at the alteration for the better which the gentlemen displayed the transformation of the ladies was still more extraordinary when from a snug corner of the managers box he beheld miss snevellicci in all the glories of white muslin with a golden hem and mrs crummles in all the dignity of the outlaws wife and miss bravassa in all the sweetness of miss snevelliccis confidential friend and miss belvawney in the white silks of a page doing duty everywhere and swearing to live and die in the service of everybody he could scarcely contain his admiration which testified itself in great applause and the closest possible attention to the business of the scene the plot was most interesting it belonged to no particular age people or country and was perhaps the more delightful on that account as nobodys previous information could afford the remotest glimmering of what would ever come of it an outlaw had been very successful in doing something somewhere and came home in triumph to the sound of shouts and fiddles to greet his wifea lady of masculine mind who talked a good deal about her fathers bones which it seemed were unburied though whether from a peculiar taste on the part of the old gentleman himself or the reprehensible neglect of his relations did not appear this outlaws wife was somehow or other mixed up with a patriarch living in a castle a long way off and this patriarch was the father of several of the characters but he didnt exactly know which and was uncertain whether he had brought up the right ones in his castle or the wrong ones he rather inclined to the latter opinion and being uneasy relieved his mind with a banquet during which solemnity somebody in a cloak said beware which somebody was known by nobody except the audience to be the outlaw himself who had come there for reasons unexplained but possibly with an eye to the spoons there was an agreeable little surprise in the way of certain love passages between the desponding captive and miss snevellicci and the comic fightingman and miss bravassa besides which mr lenville had several very tragic scenes in the dark while on throatcutting expeditions which were all baffled by the skill and bravery of the comic fightingman who overheard whatever was said all through the piece and the intrepidity of miss snevellicci who adopted tights and therein repaired to the prison of her captive lover with a small basket of refreshments and a dark lantern at last it came out that the patriarch was the man who had treated the bones of the outlaws fatherinlaw with so much disrespect for which cause and reason the outlaws wife repaired to his castle to kill him and so got into a dark room where after a good deal of groping in the dark everybody got hold of everybody else and took them for somebody besides which occasioned a vast quantity of confusion with some pistolling loss of life and torchlight after which the patriarch came forward and observing with a knowing look that he knew all about his children now and would tell them when they got inside said that there could not be a more appropriate occasion for marrying the young people than that and therefore he joined their hands with the full consent of the indefatigable page who being the only other person surviving pointed with his cap into the clouds and his right hand to the ground thereby invoking a blessing and giving the cue for the curtain to come down which it did amidst general applause  what did you think of that asked mr crummles when nicholas went round to the stage again mr crummles was very red and hot for your outlaws are desperate fellows to shout  i think it was very capital indeed replied nicholas miss snevellicci in particular was uncommonly good  shes a genius said mr crummles quite a genius that girl bythebye ive been thinking of bringing out that piece of yours on her bespeak night  when asked nicholas  the night of her bespeak her benefit night when her friends and patrons bespeak the play said mr crummles  oh i understand replied nicholas  you see said mr crummles its sure to go on such an occasion and even if it should not work up quite as well as we expect why it will be her risk you know and not ours  yours you mean said nicholas  i said mine didnt i returned mr crummles next monday week what do you say youll have done it and are sure to be up in the lovers part long before that time  i dont know about long before replied nicholas but by that time i think i can undertake to be ready  very good pursued mr crummles then well call that settled now i want to ask you something else theres a littlewhat shall i call ita little canvassing takes place on these occasions  among the patrons i suppose said nicholas  among the patrons and the fact is that snevellicci has had so many bespeaks in this place that she wants an attraction she had a bespeak when her motherinlaw died and a bespeak when her uncle died and mrs crummles and myself have had bespeaks on the anniversary of the phenomenons birthday and our weddingday and occasions of that description so that in fact theres some difficulty in getting a good one now wont you help this poor girl mr johnson said crummles sitting himself down on a drum and taking a great pinch of snuff as he looked him steadily in the face  how do you mean rejoined nicholas  dont you think you could spare half an hour tomorrow morning to call with her at the houses of one or two of the principal people murmured the manager in a persuasive tone  oh dear me said nicholas with an air of very strong objection i shouldnt like to do that  the infant will accompany her said mr crummles the moment it was suggested to me i gave permission for the infant to go there will not be the smallest improprietymiss snevellicci sir is the very soul of honour it would be of material servicethe gentleman from londonauthor of the new pieceactor in the new piecefirst appearance on any boardsit would lead to a great bespeak mr johnson  i am very sorry to throw a damp upon the prospects of anybody and more especially a lady replied nicholas but really i must decidedly object to making one of the canvassing party  what does mr johnson say vincent inquired a voice close to his ear and looking round he found mrs crummles and miss snevellicci herself standing behind him  he has some objection my dear replied mr crummles looking at nicholas  objection exclaimed mrs crummles can it be possible  oh i hope not cried miss snevellicci you surely are not so crueloh dear mewell ito think of that now after all ones looking forward to it  mr johnson will not persist my dear said mrs crummles think better of him than to suppose it gallantry humanity all the best feelings of his nature must be enlisted in this interesting cause  which moves even a manager said mr crummles smiling  and a managers wife added mrs crummles in her accustomed tragedy tones come come you will relent i know you will  it is not in my nature said nicholas moved by these appeals to resist any entreaty unless it is to do something positively wrong and beyond a feeling of pride i know nothing which should prevent my doing this i know nobody here and nobody knows me so be it then i yield  miss snevellicci was at once overwhelmed with blushes and expressions of gratitude of which latter commodity neither mr nor mrs crummles was by any means sparing it was arranged that nicholas should call upon her at her lodgings at eleven next morning and soon after they parted he to return home to his authorship miss snevellicci to dress for the afterpiece and the disinterested manager and his wife to discuss the probable gains of the forthcoming bespeak of which they were to have twothirds of the profits by solemn treaty of agreement  at the stipulated hour next morning nicholas repaired to the lodgings of miss snevellicci which were in a place called lombard street at the house of a tailor a strong smell of ironing pervaded the little passage and the tailors daughter who opened the door appeared in that flutter of spirits which is so often attendant upon the periodical getting up of a familys linen  miss snevellicci lives here i believe said nicholas when the door was opened  the tailors daughter replied in the affirmative  will you have the goodness to let her know that mr johnson is here said nicholas  oh if you please youre to come upstairs replied the tailors daughter with a smile  nicholas followed the young lady and was shown into a small apartment on the first floor communicating with a backroom in which as he judged from a certain halfsubdued clinking sound as of cups and saucers miss snevellicci was then taking her breakfast in bed  youre to wait if you please said the tailors daughter after a short period of absence during which the clinking in the backroom had ceased and been succeeded by whisperingshe wont be long  as she spoke she pulled up the windowblind and having by this means as she thought diverted mr johnsons attention from the room to the street caught up some articles which were airing on the fender and had very much the appearance of stockings and darted off  as there were not many objects of interest outside the window nicholas looked about the room with more curiosity than he might otherwise have bestowed upon it on the sofa lay an old guitar several thumbed pieces of music and a scattered litter of curlpapers together with a confused heap of playbills and a pair of soiled white satin shoes with large blue rosettes hanging over the back of a chair was a halffinished muslin apron with little pockets ornamented with red ribbons such as waitingwomen wear on the stage and by consequence are never seen with anywhere else in one corner stood the diminutive pair of topboots in which miss snevellicci was accustomed to enact the little jockey and folded on a chair hard by was a small parcel which bore a very suspicious resemblance to the companion smalls  but the most interesting object of all was perhaps the open scrapbook displayed in the midst of some theatrical duodecimos that were strewn upon the table and pasted into which scrapbook were various critical notices of miss snevelliccis acting extracted from different provincial journals together with one poetic address in her honour commencing       sing god of love and tell me in what dearth      thricegifted snevellicci came on earth      to thrill us with her smile her tear her eye      sing god of love and tell me quickly why  besides this effusion there were innumerable complimentary allusions also extracted from newspapers such aswe observe from an advertisement in another part of our paper of today that the charming and highlytalented miss snevellicci takes her benefit on wednesday for which occasion she has put forth a bill of fare that might kindle exhilaration in the breast of a misanthrope in the confidence that our fellowtownsmen have not lost that high appreciation of public utility and private worth for which they have long been so preeminently distinguished we predict that this charming actress will be greeted with a bumper to correspondentsjs is misinformed when he supposes that the highlygifted and beautiful miss snevellicci nightly captivating all hearts at our pretty and commodious little theatre is not the same lady to whom the young gentleman of immense fortune residing within a hundred miles of the good city of york lately made honourable proposals we have reason to know that miss snevellicci is the lady who was implicated in that mysterious and romantic affair and whose conduct on that occasion did no less honour to her head and heart than do her histrionic triumphs to her brilliant genius a copious assortment of such paragraphs as these with long bills of benefits all ending with come early in large capitals formed the principal contents of miss snevelliccis scrapbook  nicholas had read a great many of these scraps and was absorbed in a circumstantial and melancholy account of the train of events which had led to miss snevelliccis spraining her ankle by slipping on a piece of orangepeel flung by a monster in human form so the paper said upon the stage at winchesterwhen that young lady herself attired in the coalscuttle bonnet and walkingdress complete tripped into the room with a thousand apologies for having detained him so long after the appointed time  but really said miss snevellicci my darling led who lives with me here was taken so very ill in the night that i thought she would have expired in my arms  such a fate is almost to be envied returned nicholas but i am very sorry to hear it nevertheless  what a creature you are to flatter said miss snevellicci buttoning her glove in much confusion  if it be flattery to admire your charms and accomplishments rejoined nicholas laying his hand upon the scrapbook you have better specimens of it here  oh you cruel creature to read such things as those im almost ashamed to look you in the face afterwards positively i am said miss snevellicci seizing the book and putting it away in a closet how careless of led how could she be so naughty  i thought you had kindly left it here on purpose for me to read said nicholas and really it did seem possible  i wouldnt have had you see it for the world rejoined miss snevellicci i never was so vexednever but she is such a careless thing theres no trusting her  the conversation was here interrupted by the entrance of the phenomenon who had discreetly remained in the bedroom up to this moment and now presented herself with much grace and lightness bearing in her hand a very little green parasol with a broad fringe border and no handle after a few words of course they sallied into the street  the phenomenon was rather a troublesome companion for first the right sandal came down and then the left and these mischances being repaired one leg of the little white trousers was discovered to be longer than the other besides these accidents the green parasol was dropped down an iron grating and only fished up again with great difficulty and by dint of much exertion however it was impossible to scold her as she was the managers daughter so nicholas took it all in perfect good humour and walked on with miss snevellicci arminarm on one side and the offending infant on the other  the first house to which they bent their steps was situated in a terrace of respectable appearance miss snevelliccis modest doubleknock was answered by a footboy who in reply to her inquiry whether mrs curdle was at home opened his eyes very wide grinned very much and said he didnt know but hed inquire with this he showed them into a parlour where he kept them waiting until the two womenservants had repaired thither under false pretences to see the playactors and having compared notes with them in the passage and joined in a vast quantity of whispering and giggling he at length went upstairs with miss snevelliccis name  now mrs curdle was supposed by those who were best informed on such points to possess quite the london taste in matters relating to literature and the drama and as to mr curdle he had written a pamphlet of sixtyfour pages post octavo on the character of the nurses deceased husband in romeo and juliet with an inquiry whether he really had been a merry man in his lifetime or whether it was merely his widows affectionate partiality that induced her so to report him he had likewise proved that by altering the received mode of punctuation any one of shakespeares plays could be made quite different and the sense completely changed it is needless to say therefore that he was a great critic and a very profound and most original thinker  well miss snevellicci said mrs curdle entering the parlour and how do you do  miss snevellicci made a graceful obeisance and hoped mrs curdle was well as also mr curdle who at the same time appeared mrs curdle was dressed in a morning wrapper with a little cap stuck upon the top of her head mr curdle wore a loose robe on his back and his right forefinger on his forehead after the portraits of sterne to whom somebody or other had once said he bore a striking resemblance  i venture to call for the purpose of asking whether you would put your name to my bespeak maam said miss snevellicci producing documents  oh i really dont know what to say replied mrs curdle its not as if the theatre was in its high and palmy daysyou neednt stand miss snevelliccithe drama is gone perfectly gone  as an exquisite embodiment of the poets visions and a realisation of human intellectuality gilding with refulgent light our dreamy moments and laying open a new and magic world before the mental eye the drama is gone perfectly gone said mr curdle  what man is there now living who can present before us all those changing and prismatic colours with which the character of hamlet is invested exclaimed mrs curdle  what man indeedupon the stage said mr curdle with a small reservation in favour of himself hamlet pooh ridiculous hamlet is gone perfectly gone  quite overcome by these dismal reflections mr and mrs curdle sighed and sat for some short time without speaking at length the lady turning to miss snevellicci inquired what play she proposed to have  quite a new one said miss snevellicci of which this gentleman is the author and in which he plays being his first appearance on any stage mr johnson is the gentlemans name  i hope you have preserved the unities sir said mr curdle  the original piece is a french one said nicholas there is abundance of incident sprightly dialogue stronglymarked characters  all unavailing without a strict observance of the unities sir returned mr curdle the unities of the drama before everything  might i ask you said nicholas hesitating between the respect he ought to assume and his love of the whimsical might i ask you what the unities are  mr curdle coughed and considered the unities sir he said are a completenessa kind of universal dovetailedness with regard to place and timea sort of a general oneness if i may be allowed to use so strong an expression i take those to be the dramatic unities so far as i have been enabled to bestow attention upon them and i have read much upon the subject and thought much i find running through the performances of this child said mr curdle turning to the phenomenon a unity of feeling a breadth a light and shade a warmth of colouring a tone a harmony a glow an artistical development of original conceptions which i look for in vain among older performersi dont know whether i make myself understood  perfectly replied nicholas  just so said mr curdle pulling up his neckcloth that is my definition of the unities of the drama  mrs curdle had sat listening to this lucid explanation with great complacency it being finished she inquired what mr curdle thought about putting down their names  i dont know my dear upon my word i dont know said mr curdle if we do it must be distinctly understood that we do not pledge ourselves to the quality of the performances let it go forth to the world that we do not give them the sanction of our names but that we confer the distinction merely upon miss snevellicci that being clearly stated i take it to be as it were a duty that we should extend our patronage to a degraded stage even for the sake of the associations with which it is entwined have you got twoandsixpence for halfacrown miss snevellicci said mr curdle turning over four of those pieces of money  miss snevellicci felt in all the corners of the pink reticule but there was nothing in any of them nicholas murmured a jest about his being an author and thought it best not to go through the form of feeling in his own pockets at all  let me see said mr curdle twice fours eightfour shillings apiece to the boxes miss snevellicci is exceedingly dear in the present state of the dramathree halfcrowns is sevenandsix we shall not differ about sixpence i suppose sixpence will not part us miss snevellicci  poor miss snevellicci took the three halfcrowns with many smiles and bends and mrs curdle adding several supplementary directions relative to keeping the places for them and dusting the seat and sending two clean bills as soon as they came out rang the bell as a signal for breaking up the conference  odd people those said nicholas when they got clear of the house  i assure you said miss snevellicci taking his arm that i think myself very lucky they did not owe all the money instead of being sixpence short now if you were to succeed they would give people to understand that they had always patronised you and if you were to fail they would have been quite certain of that from the very beginning  at the next house they visited they were in great glory for there resided the six children who were so enraptured with the public actions of the phenomenon and who being called down from the nursery to be treated with a private view of that young lady proceeded to poke their fingers into her eyes and tread upon her toes and show her many other little attentions peculiar to their time of life  i shall certainly persuade mr borum to take a private box said the lady of the house after a most gracious reception i shall only take two of the children and will make up the rest of the party of gentlemenyour admirers miss snevellicci augustus you naughty boy leave the little girl alone  this was addressed to a young gentleman who was pinching the phenomenon behind apparently with a view of ascertaining whether she was real  i am sure you must be very tired said the mama turning to miss snevellicci i cannot think of allowing you to go without first taking a glass of wine fie charlotte i am ashamed of you miss lane my dear pray see to the children  miss lane was the governess and this entreaty was rendered necessary by the abrupt behaviour of the youngest miss borum who having filched the phenomenons little green parasol was now carrying it bodily off while the distracted infant looked helplessly on  i am sure where you ever learnt to act as you do said goodnatured mrs borum turning again to miss snevellicci i cannot understand emma dont stare so laughing in one piece and crying in the next and so natural in alloh dear  i am very happy to hear you express so favourable an opinion said miss snevellicci its quite delightful to think you like it  like it cried mrs borum who can help liking it i would go to the play twice a week if i could i dote upon itonly youre too affecting sometimes you do put me in such a stateinto such fits of crying goodness gracious me miss lane how can you let them torment that poor child so  the phenomenon was really in a fair way of being torn limb from limb for two strong little boys one holding on by each of her hands were dragging her in different directions as a trial of strength however miss lane who had herself been too much occupied in contemplating the grownup actors to pay the necessary attention to these proceedings rescued the unhappy infant at this juncture who being recruited with a glass of wine was shortly afterwards taken away by her friends after sustaining no more serious damage than a flattening of the pink gauze bonnet and a rather extensive creasing of the white frock and trousers  it was a trying morning for there were a great many calls to make and everybody wanted a different thing some wanted tragedies and others comedies some objected to dancing some wanted scarcely anything else some thought the comic singer decidedly low and others hoped he would have more to do than he usually had some people wouldnt promise to go because other people wouldnt promise to go and other people wouldnt go at all because other people went at length and by little and little omitting something in this place and adding something in that miss snevellicci pledged herself to a bill of fare which was comprehensive enough if it had no other merit it included among other trifles four pieces divers songs a few combats and several dances and they returned home pretty well exhausted with the business of the day  nicholas worked away at the piece which was speedily put into rehearsal and then worked away at his own part which he studied with great perseverance and actedas the whole company saidto perfection and at length the great day arrived the crier was sent round in the morning to proclaim the entertainments with the sound of bell in all the thoroughfares and extra bills of three feet long by nine inches wide were dispersed in all directions flung down all the areas thrust under all the knockers and developed in all the shops they were placarded on all the walls too though not with complete success for an illiterate person having undertaken this office during the indisposition of the regular billsticker a part were posted sideways and the remainder upside down  at halfpast five there was a rush of four people to the gallerydoor at a quarter before six there were at least a dozen at six oclock the kicks were terrific and when the elder master crummles opened the door he was obliged to run behind it for his life fifteen shillings were taken by mrs grudden in the first ten minutes  behind the scenes the same unwonted excitement prevailed miss snevellicci was in such a perspiration that the paint would scarcely stay on her face mrs crummles was so nervous that she could hardly remember her part miss bravassas ringlets came out of curl with the heat and anxiety even mr crummles himself kept peeping through the hole in the curtain and running back every now and then to announce that another man had come into the pit  at last the orchestra left off and the curtain rose upon the new piece the first scene in which there was nobody particular passed off calmly enough but when miss snevellicci went on in the second accompanied by the phenomenon as child what a roar of applause broke out the people in the borum box rose as one man waving their hats and handkerchiefs and uttering shouts of bravo mrs borum and the governess cast wreaths upon the stage of which some fluttered into the lamps and one crowned the temples of a fat gentleman in the pit who looking eagerly towards the scene remained unconscious of the honour the tailor and his family kicked at the panels of the upper boxes till they threatened to come out altogether the very gingerbeer boy remained transfixed in the centre of the house a young officer supposed to entertain a passion for miss snevellicci stuck his glass in his eye as though to hide a tear again and again miss snevellicci curtseyed lower and lower and again and again the applause came down louder and louder at length when the phenomenon picked up one of the smoking wreaths and put it on sideways over miss snevelliccis eye it reached its climax and the play proceeded  but when nicholas came on for his crack scene with mrs crummles what a clapping of hands there was when mrs crummles who was his unworthy mother sneered and called him presumptuous boy and he defied her what a tumult of applause came on when he quarrelled with the other gentleman about the young lady and producing a case of pistols said that if he was a gentleman he would fight him in that drawingroom until the furniture was sprinkled with the blood of one if not of twohow boxes pit and gallery joined in one most vigorous cheer when he called his mother names because she wouldnt give up the young ladys property and she relenting caused him to relent likewise and fall down on one knee and ask her blessing how the ladies in the audience sobbed when he was hid behind the curtain in the dark and the wicked relation poked a sharp sword in every direction save where his legs were plainly visible what a thrill of anxious fear ran through the house his air his figure his walk his look everything he said or did was the subject of commendation there was a round of applause every time he spoke and when at last in the pumpandtub scene mrs grudden lighted the blue fire and all the unemployed members of the company came in and tumbled down in various directionsnot because that had anything to do with the plot but in order to finish off with a tableauthe audience who had by this time increased considerably gave vent to such a shout of enthusiasm as had not been heard in those walls for many and many a day  in short the success both of new piece and new actor was complete and when miss snevellicci was called for at the end of the play nicholas led her on and divided the applause    chapter 25  concerning a young lady from london who joins the company and an elderly admirer who follows in her train with an affecting ceremony consequent on their arrival   the new piece being a decided hit was announced for every evening of performance until further notice and the evenings when the theatre was closed were reduced from three in the week to two nor were these the only tokens of extraordinary success for on the succeeding saturday nicholas received by favour of the indefatigable mrs grudden no less a sum than thirty shillings besides which substantial reward he enjoyed considerable fame and honour having a presentation copy of mr curdles pamphlet forwarded to the theatre with that gentlemans own autograph in itself an inestimable treasure on the flyleaf accompanied with a note containing many expressions of approval and an unsolicited assurance that mr curdle would be very happy to read shakespeare to him for three hours every morning before breakfast during his stay in the town  ive got another novelty johnson said mr crummles one morning in great glee  whats that rejoined nicholas the pony  no no we never come to the pony till everything else has failed said mr crummles i dont think we shall come to the pony at all this season no no not the pony  a boy phenomenon perhaps suggested nicholas  there is only one phenomenon sir replied mr crummles impressively and thats a girl  very true said nicholas i beg your pardon then i dont know what it is i am sure  what should you say to a young lady from london inquired mr crummles miss soandso of the theatre royal drury lane  i should say she would look very well in the bills said nicholas  youre about right there said mr crummles and if you had said she would look very well upon the stage too you wouldnt have been far out look here what do you think of this  with this inquiry mr crummles unfolded a red poster and a blue poster and a yellow poster at the top of each of which public notification was inscribed in enormous charactersfirst appearance of the unrivalled miss petowker of the theatre royal drury lane  dear me said nicholas i know that lady  then you are acquainted with as much talent as was ever compressed into one young persons body retorted mr crummles rolling up the bills again that is talent of a certain sortof a certain sort the blood drinker added mr crummles with a prophetic sigh the blood drinker will die with that girl and shes the only sylph i ever saw who could stand upon one leg and play the tambourine on her other knee like a sylph  when does she come down asked nicholas  we expect her today replied mr crummles she is an old friend of mrs crummless mrs crummles saw what she could doalways knew it from the first she taught her indeed nearly all she knows mrs crummles was the original blood drinker  was she indeed  yes she was obliged to give it up though  did it disagree with her asked nicholas  not so much with her as with her audiences replied mr crummles nobody could stand it it was too tremendous you dont quite know what mrs crummles is yet  nicholas ventured to insinuate that he thought he did  no no you dont said mr crummles you dont indeed i dont and thats a fact i dont think her country will till she is dead some new proof of talent bursts from that astonishing woman every year of her life look at hermother of six childrenthree of em alive and all upon the stage  extraordinary cried nicholas  ah extraordinary indeed rejoined mr crummles taking a complacent pinch of snuff and shaking his head gravely i pledge you my professional word i didnt even know she could dance till her last benefit and then she played juliet and helen macgregor and did the skippingrope hornpipe between the pieces the very first time i saw that admirable woman johnson said mr crummles drawing a little nearer and speaking in the tone of confidential friendship she stood upon her head on the buttend of a spear surrounded with blazing fireworks  you astonish me said nicholas  she astonished me returned mr crummles with a very serious countenance such grace coupled with such dignity i adored her from that moment  the arrival of the gifted subject of these remarks put an abrupt termination to mr crummless eulogium almost immediately afterwards master percy crummles entered with a letter which had arrived by the general post and was directed to his gracious mother at sight of the superscription whereof mrs crummles exclaimed from henrietta petowker i do declare and instantly became absorbed in the contents  is it inquired mr crummles hesitating  oh yes its all right replied mrs crummles anticipating the question what an excellent thing for her to be sure  its the best thing altogether that i ever heard of i think said mr crummles and then mr crummles mrs crummles and master percy crummles all fell to laughing violently nicholas left them to enjoy their mirth together and walked to his lodgings wondering very much what mystery connected with miss petowker could provoke such merriment and pondering still more on the extreme surprise with which that lady would regard his sudden enlistment in a profession of which she was such a distinguished and brilliant ornament  but in this latter respect he was mistaken forwhether mr vincent crummles had paved the way or miss petowker had some special reason for treating him with even more than her usual amiabilitytheir meeting at the theatre next day was more like that of two dear friends who had been inseparable from infancy than a recognition passing between a lady and gentleman who had only met some halfdozen times and then by mere chance nay miss petowker even whispered that she had wholly dropped the kenwigses in her conversations with the managers family and had represented herself as having encountered mr johnson in the very first and most fashionable circles and on nicholas receiving this intelligence with unfeigned surprise she added with a sweet glance that she had a claim on his good nature now and might tax it before long  nicholas had the honour of playing in a slight piece with miss petowker that night and could not but observe that the warmth of her reception was mainly attributable to a most persevering umbrella in the upper boxes he saw too that the enchanting actress cast many sweet looks towards the quarter whence these sounds proceeded and that every time she did so the umbrella broke out afresh once he thought that a peculiarly shaped hat in the same corner was not wholly unknown to him but being occupied with his share of the stage business he bestowed no great attention upon this circumstance and it had quite vanished from his memory by the time he reached home  he had just sat down to supper with smike when one of the people of the house came outside the door and announced that a gentleman below stairs wished to speak to mr johnson  well if he does you must tell him to come up thats all i know replied nicholas one of our hungry brethren i suppose smike  his fellowlodger looked at the cold meat in silent calculation of the quantity that would be left for dinner next day and put back a slice he had cut for himself in order that the visitors encroachments might be less formidable in their effects  it is not anybody who has been here before said nicholas for he is tumbling up every stair come in come in in the name of wonder mr lillyvick  it was indeed the collector of waterrates who regarding nicholas with a fixed look and immovable countenance shook hands with most portentous solemnity and sat himself down in a seat by the chimneycorner  why when did you come here asked nicholas  this morning sir replied mr lillyvick  oh i see then you were at the theatre tonight and it was your umb  this umbrella said mr lillyvick producing a fat green cotton one with a battered ferrule what did you think of that performance  so far as i could judge being on the stage replied nicholas i thought it very agreeable  agreeable cried the collector i mean to say sir that it was delicious  mr lillyvick bent forward to pronounce the last word with greater emphasis and having done so drew himself up and frowned and nodded a great many times  i say delicious repeated mr lillyvick absorbing fairylike toomultuous and again mr lillyvick drew himself up and again he frowned and nodded  ah said nicholas a little surprised at these symptoms of ecstatic approbation yesshe is a clever girl  she is a divinity returned mr lillyvick giving a collectors double knock on the ground with the umbrella beforementioned i have known divine actresses before now sir i used to collectat least i used to call forand very often call forthe waterrate at the house of a divine actress who lived in my beat for upwards of four year but neverno never sir of all divine creatures actresses or no actresses did i see a diviner one than is henrietta petowker  nicholas had much ado to prevent himself from laughing not trusting himself to speak he merely nodded in accordance with mr lillyvicks nods and remained silent  let me speak a word with you in private said mr lillyvick  nicholas looked goodhumouredly at smike who taking the hint disappeared  a bachelor is a miserable wretch sir said mr lillyvick  is he asked nicholas  he is rejoined the collector i have lived in the world for nigh sixty year and i ought to know what it is  you ought to know certainly thought nicholas but whether you do or not is another question  if a bachelor happens to have saved a little matter of money said mr lillyvick his sisters and brothers and nephews and nieces look to that money and not to him even if by being a public character he is the head of the family or as it may be the main from which all the other little branches are turned on they still wish him dead all the while and get lowspirited every time they see him looking in good health because they want to come into his little property you see that  oh yes replied nicholas its very true no doubt  the great reason for not being married resumed mr lillyvick is the expense thats whats kept me off or elselord said mr lillyvick snapping his fingers i might have had fifty women  fine women asked nicholas  fine women sir replied the collector ay not so fine as henrietta petowker for she is an uncommon specimen but such women as dont fall into every mans way i can tell you now suppose a man can get a fortune in a wife instead of with hereh  why then hes a lucky fellow replied nicholas  thats what i say retorted the collector patting him benignantly on the side of the head with his umbrella just what i say henrietta petowker the talented henrietta petowker has a fortune in herself and i am going to  to make her mrs lillyvick suggested nicholas  no sir not to make her mrs lillyvick replied the collector actresses sir always keep their maiden namesthats the regular thingbut im going to marry her and the day after tomorrow too  i congratulate you sir said nicholas  thank you sir replied the collector buttoning his waistcoat i shall draw her salary of course and i hope after all that its nearly as cheap to keep two as it is to keep one thats a consolation  surely you dont want any consolation at such a moment observed nicholas  no replied mr lillyvick shaking his head nervously noof course not  but how come you both here if youre going to be married mr lillyvick asked nicholas  why thats what i came to explain to you replied the collector of waterrate the fact is we have thought it best to keep it secret from the family  family said nicholas what family  the kenwigses of course rejoined mr lillyvick if my niece and the children had known a word about it before i came away theyd have gone into fits at my feet and never have come out of em till i took an oath not to marry anybodyor theyd have got out a commission of lunacy or some dreadful thing said the collector quite trembling as he spoke  to be sure said nicholas yes they would have been jealous no doubt  to prevent which said mr lillyvick henrietta petowker it was settled between us should come down here to her friends the crummleses under pretence of this engagement and i should go down to guildford the day before and join her on the coach there which i did and we came down from guildford yesterday together now for fear you should be writing to mr noggs and might say anything about us we have thought it best to let you into the secret we shall be married from the crummleses lodgings and shall be delighted to see youeither before church or at breakfasttime which you like it wont be expensive you know said the collector highly anxious to prevent any misunderstanding on this point just muffins and coffee with perhaps a shrimp or something of that sort for a relish you know  yes yes i understand replied nicholas oh i shall be most happy to come it will give me the greatest pleasure wheres the lady stoppingwith mrs crummles  why no said the collector they couldnt very well dispose of her at night and so she is staying with an acquaintance of hers and another young lady they both belong to the theatre  miss snevellicci i suppose said nicholas  yes thats the name  and theyll be bridesmaids i presume said nicholas  why said the collector with a rueful face they will have four bridesmaids im afraid theyll make it rather theatrical  oh no not at all replied nicholas with an awkward attempt to convert a laugh into a cough who may the four be miss snevellicci of coursemiss ledrook  thethe phenomenon groaned the collector  ha ha cried nicholas i beg your pardon i dont know what im laughing atyes thatll be very prettythe phenomenonwho else  some young woman or other replied the collector rising some other friend of henrietta petowkers well youll be careful not to say anything about it will you  you may safely depend upon me replied nicholas wont you take anything to eat or drink  no said the collector i havent any appetite i should think it was a very pleasant life the married one eh  i have not the least doubt of it rejoined nicholas  yes said the collector certainly oh yes no doubt good night  with these words mr lillyvick whose manner had exhibited through the whole of this interview a most extraordinary compound of precipitation hesitation confidence and doubt fondness misgiving meanness and selfimportance turned his back upon the room and left nicholas to enjoy a laugh by himself if he felt so disposed  without stopping to inquire whether the intervening day appeared to nicholas to consist of the usual number of hours of the ordinary length it may be remarked that to the parties more directly interested in the forthcoming ceremony it passed with great rapidity insomuch that when miss petowker awoke on the succeeding morning in the chamber of miss snevellicci she declared that nothing should ever persuade her that that really was the day which was to behold a change in her condition  i never will believe it said miss petowker i cannot really its of no use talking i never can make up my mind to go through with such a trial  on hearing this miss snevellicci and miss ledrook who knew perfectly well that their fair friends mind had been made up for three or four years at any period of which time she would have cheerfully undergone the desperate trial now approaching if she could have found any eligible gentleman disposed for the venture began to preach comfort and firmness and to say how very proud she ought to feel that it was in her power to confer lasting bliss on a deserving object and how necessary it was for the happiness of mankind in general that women should possess fortitude and resignation on such occasions and that although for their parts they held true happiness to consist in a single life which they would not willingly exchangeno not for any worldly considerationstill thank god if ever the time should come they hoped they knew their duty too well to repine but would the rather submit with meekness and humility of spirit to a fate for which providence had clearly designed them with a view to the contentment and reward of their fellowcreatures  i might feel it was a great blow said miss snevellicci to break up old associations and whatdoyoucallems of that kind but i would submit my dear i would indeed  so would i said miss ledrook i would rather court the yoke than shun it i have broken hearts before now and im very sorry for it for its a terrible thing to reflect upon  it is indeed said miss snevellicci now led my dear we must positively get her ready or we shall be too late we shall indeed  this pious reasoning and perhaps the fear of being too late supported the bride through the ceremony of robing after which strong tea and brandy were administered in alternate doses as a means of strengthening her feeble limbs and causing her to walk steadier  how do you feel now my love inquired miss snevellicci  oh lillyvick cried the bride if you knew what i am undergoing for you  of course he knows it love and will never forget it said miss ledrook  do you think he wont cried miss petowker really showing great capability for the stage oh do you think he wont do you think lillyvick will always remember italways always always  there is no knowing in what this burst of feeling might have ended if miss snevellicci had not at that moment proclaimed the arrival of the fly which so astounded the bride that she shook off divers alarming symptoms which were coming on very strong and running to the glass adjusted her dress and calmly declared that she was ready for the sacrifice  she was accordingly supported into the coach and there kept up as miss snevellicci said with perpetual sniffs of sal volatile and sips of brandy and other gentle stimulants until they reached the managers door which was already opened by the two master crummleses who wore white cockades and were decorated with the choicest and most resplendent waistcoats in the theatrical wardrobe by the combined exertions of these young gentlemen and the bridesmaids assisted by the coachman miss petowker was at length supported in a condition of much exhaustion to the first floor where she no sooner encountered the youthful bridegroom than she fainted with great decorum  henrietta petowker said the collector cheer up my lovely one  miss petowker grasped the collectors hand but emotion choked her utterance  is the sight of me so dreadful henrietta petowker said the collector  oh no no no rejoined the bride but all the friendsthe darling friendsof my youthful daysto leave them allit is such a shock  with such expressions of sorrow miss petowker went on to enumerate the dear friends of her youthful days one by one and to call upon such of them as were present to come and embrace her this done she remembered that mrs crummles had been more than a mother to her and after that that mr crummles had been more than a father to her and after that that the master crummleses and miss ninetta crummles had been more than brothers and sisters to her these various remembrances being each accompanied with a series of hugs occupied a long time and they were obliged to drive to church very fast for fear they should be too late  the procession consisted of two flys in the first of which were miss bravassa the fourth bridesmaid mrs crummles the collector and mr folair who had been chosen as his second on the occasion in the other were the bride mr crummles miss snevellicci miss ledrook and the phenomenon the costumes were beautiful the bridesmaids were quite covered with artificial flowers and the phenomenon in particular was rendered almost invisible by the portable arbour in which she was enshrined miss ledrook who was of a romantic turn wore in her breast the miniature of some fieldofficer unknown which she had purchased a great bargain not very long before the other ladies displayed several dazzling articles of imitative jewellery almost equal to real and mrs crummles came out in a stern and gloomy majesty which attracted the admiration of all beholders  but perhaps the appearance of mr crummles was more striking and appropriate than that of any member of the party this gentleman who personated the brides father had in pursuance of a happy and original conception made up for the part by arraying himself in a theatrical wig of a style and pattern commonly known as a brown george and moreover assuming a snuffcoloured suit of the previous century with grey silk stockings and buckles to his shoes the better to support his assumed character he had determined to be greatly overcome and consequently when they entered the church the sobs of the affectionate parent were so heartrending that the pewopener suggested the propriety of his retiring to the vestry and comforting himself with a glass of water before the ceremony began  the procession up the aisle was beautiful the bride with the four bridesmaids forming a group previously arranged and rehearsed the collector followed by his second imitating his walk and gestures to the indescribable amusement of some theatrical friends in the gallery mr crummles with an infirm and feeble gait mrs crummles advancing with that stage walk which consists of a stride and a stop alternatelyit was the completest thing ever witnessed the ceremony was very quickly disposed of and all parties present having signed the register for which purpose when it came to his turn mr crummles carefully wiped and put on an immense pair of spectacles they went back to breakfast in high spirits and here they found nicholas awaiting their arrival  now then said crummles who had been assisting mrs grudden in the preparations which were on a more extensive scale than was quite agreeable to the collector breakfast breakfast  no second invitation was required the company crowded and squeezed themselves at the table as well as they could and fell to immediately miss petowker blushing very much when anybody was looking and eating very much when anybody was not looking and mr lillyvick going to work as though with the cool resolve that since the good things must be paid for by him he would leave as little as possible for the crummleses to eat up afterwards  its very soon done sir isnt it inquired mr folair of the collector leaning over the table to address him  what is soon done sir returned mr lillyvick  the tying upthe fixing oneself with a wife replied mr folair it dont take long does it  no sir replied mr lillyvick colouring it does not take long and what then sir  oh nothing said the actor it dont take a man long to hang himself either eh ha ha  mr lillyvick laid down his knife and fork and looked round the table with indignant astonishment  to hang himself repeated mr lillyvick  a profound silence came upon all for mr lillyvick was dignified beyond expression  to hang himself cried mr lillyvick again is any parallel attempted to be drawn in this company between matrimony and hanging  the noose you know said mr folair a little crestfallen  the noose sir retorted mr lillyvick does any man dare to speak to me of a noose and henrietta pe  lillyvick suggested mr crummles  and henrietta lillyvick in the same breath said the collector in this house in the presence of mr and mrs crummles who have brought up a talented and virtuous family to be blessings and phenomenons and what not are we to hear talk of nooses  folair said mr crummles deeming it a matter of decency to be affected by this allusion to himself and partner im astonished at you  what are you going on in this way at me for urged the unfortunate actor what have i done  done sir cried mr lillyvick aimed a blow at the whole framework of society  and the best and tenderest feelings added crummles relapsing into the old man  and the highest and most estimable of social ties said the collector noose as if one was caught trapped into the married state pinned by the leg instead of going into it of ones own accord and glorying in the act  i didnt mean to make it out that you were caught and trapped and pinned by the leg replied the actor im sorry for it i cant say any more  so you ought to be sir returned mr lillyvick and i am glad to hear that you have enough of feeling left to be so  the quarrel appearing to terminate with this reply mrs lillyvick considered that the fittest occasion the attention of the company being no longer distracted to burst into tears and require the assistance of all four bridesmaids which was immediately rendered though not without some confusion for the room being small and the tablecloth long a whole detachment of plates were swept off the board at the very first move regardless of this circumstance however mrs lillyvick refused to be comforted until the belligerents had passed their words that the dispute should be carried no further which after a sufficient show of reluctance they did and from that time mr folair sat in moody silence contenting himself with pinching nicholass leg when anything was said and so expressing his contempt both for the speaker and the sentiments to which he gave utterance  there were a great number of speeches made some by nicholas and some by crummles and some by the collector two by the master crummleses in returning thanks for themselves and one by the phenomenon on behalf of the bridesmaids at which mrs crummles shed tears there was some singing too from miss ledrook and miss bravassa and very likely there might have been more if the flydriver who stopped to drive the happy pair to the spot where they proposed to take steamboat to ryde had not sent in a peremptory message intimating that if they didnt come directly he should infallibly demand eighteenpence over and above his agreement  this desperate threat effectually broke up the party after a most pathetic leavetaking mr lillyvick and his bride departed for ryde where they were to spend the next two days in profound retirement and whither they were accompanied by the infant who had been appointed travelling bridesmaid on mr lillyvicks express stipulation as the steamboat people deceived by her size would he had previously ascertained transport her at halfprice  as there was no performance that night mr crummles declared his intention of keeping it up till everything to drink was disposed of but nicholas having to play romeo for the first time on the ensuing evening contrived to slip away in the midst of a temporary confusion occasioned by the unexpected development of strong symptoms of inebriety in the conduct of mrs grudden  to this act of desertion he was led not only by his own inclinations but by his anxiety on account of smike who having to sustain the character of the apothecary had been as yet wholly unable to get any more of the part into his head than the general idea that he was very hungry whichperhaps from old recollectionshe had acquired with great aptitude  i dont know whats to be done smike said nicholas laying down the book i am afraid you cant learn it my poor fellow  i am afraid not said smike shaking his head i think if youbut that would give you so much trouble  what inquired nicholas never mind me  i think said smike if you were to keep saying it to me in little bits over and over again i should be able to recollect it from hearing you  do you think so exclaimed nicholas well said let us see who tires first not i smike trust me now then who calls so loud  who calls so loud said smike  who calls so loud repeated nicholas  who calls so loud cried smike  thus they continued to ask each other who called so loud over and over again and when smike had that by heart nicholas went to another sentence and then to two at a time and then to three and so on until at midnight poor smike found to his unspeakable joy that he really began to remember something about the text  early in the morning they went to it again and smike rendered more confident by the progress he had already made got on faster and with better heart as soon as he began to acquire the words pretty freely nicholas showed him how he must come in with both hands spread out upon his stomach and how he must occasionally rub it in compliance with the established form by which people on the stage always denote that they want something to eat after the mornings rehearsal they went to work again nor did they stop except for a hasty dinner until it was time to repair to the theatre at night  never had master a more anxious humble docile pupil never had pupil a more patient unwearying considerate kindhearted master  as soon as they were dressed and at every interval when he was not upon the stage nicholas renewed his instructions they prospered well the romeo was received with hearty plaudits and unbounded favour and smike was pronounced unanimously alike by audience and actors the very prince and prodigy of apothecaries    chapter 26  is fraught with some danger to miss nicklebys peace of mind   the place was a handsome suite of private apartments in regent street the time was three oclock in the afternoon to the dull and plodding and the first hour of morning to the gay and spirited the persons were lord frederick verisopht and his friend sir mulberry hawk  these distinguished gentlemen were reclining listlessly on a couple of sofas with a table between them on which were scattered in rich confusion the materials of an untasted breakfast newspapers lay strewn about the room but these like the meal were neglected and unnoticed not however because any flow of conversation prevented the attractions of the journals from being called into request for not a word was exchanged between the two nor was any sound uttered save when one in tossing about to find an easier restingplace for his aching head uttered an exclamation of impatience and seemed for a moment to communicate a new restlessness to his companion  these appearances would in themselves have furnished a pretty strong clue to the extent of the debauch of the previous night even if there had not been other indications of the amusements in which it had been passed a couple of billiard balls all mud and dirt two battered hats a champagne bottle with a soiled glove twisted round the neck to allow of its being grasped more surely in its capacity of an offensive weapon a broken cane a cardcase without the top an empty purse a watchguard snapped asunder a handful of silver mingled with fragments of halfsmoked cigars and their stale and crumbled ashesthese and many other tokens of riot and disorder hinted very intelligibly at the nature of last nights gentlemanly frolics  lord frederick verisopht was the first to speak dropping his slippered foot on the ground and yawning heavily he struggled into a sitting posture and turned his dull languid eyes towards his friend to whom he called in a drowsy voice  hallo replied sir mulberry turning round  are we going to lie here all daay said the lord  i dont know that were fit for anything else replied sir mulberry yet awhile at least i havent a grain of life in me this morning  life cried lord verisopht i feel as if there would be nothing so snug and comfortable as to die at once  then why dont you die said sir mulberry  with which inquiry he turned his face away and seemed to occupy himself in an attempt to fall asleep  his hopeful friend and pupil drew a chair to the breakfasttable and essayed to eat but finding that impossible lounged to the window then loitered up and down the room with his hand to his fevered head and finally threw himself again on his sofa and roused his friend once more  what the devils the matter groaned sir mulberry sitting upright on the couch  although sir mulberry said this with sufficient illhumour he did not seem to feel himself quite at liberty to remain silent for after stretching himself very often and declaring with a shiver that it was infernal cold he made an experiment at the breakfasttable and proving more successful in it than his lessseasoned friend remained there  suppose said sir mulberry pausing with a morsel on the point of his fork suppose we go back to the subject of little nickleby eh  which little nickleby the moneylender or the gaal asked lord verisopht  you take me i see replied sir mulberry the girl of course  you promised me youd find her out said lord verisopht  so i did rejoined his friend but i have thought further of the matter since then you distrust me in the businessyou shall find her out yourself  naay remonstrated lord verisopht  but i say yes returned his friend you shall find her out yourself dont think that i mean when you cani know as well as you that if i did you could never get sight of her without me no i say you shall find her outshalland ill put you in the way  now curse me if you aint a real deyvlish downright thoroughpaced friend said the young lord on whom this speech had produced a most reviving effect  ill tell you how said sir mulberry she was at that dinner as a bait for you  no cried the young lord what the dey  as a bait for you repeated his friend old nickleby told me so himself  what a fine old cock it is exclaimed lord verisopht a noble rascal  yes said sir mulberry he knew she was a smart little creature  smart interposed the young lord upon my soul hawk shes a perfect beautyaa picture a statue aaupon my soul she is  well replied sir mulberry shrugging his shoulders and manifesting an indifference whether he felt it or not thats a matter of taste if mine doesnt agree with yours so much the better  confound it reasoned the lord you were thick enough with her that day anyhow i could hardly get in a word  well enough for once well enough for once replied sir mulberry but not worth the trouble of being agreeable to again if you seriously want to follow up the niece tell the uncle that you must know where she lives and how she lives and with whom or you are no longer a customer of his hell tell you fast enough  why didnt you say this before asked lord verisopht instead of letting me go on burning consuming dragging out a miserable existence for an aage  i didnt know it in the first place answered sir mulberry carelessly and in the second i didnt believe you were so very much in earnest  now the truth was that in the interval which had elapsed since the dinner at ralph nicklebys sir mulberry hawk had been furtively trying by every means in his power to discover whence kate had so suddenly appeared and whither she had disappeared unassisted by ralph however with whom he had held no communication since their angry parting on that occasion all his efforts were wholly unavailing and he had therefore arrived at the determination of communicating to the young lord the substance of the admission he had gleaned from that worthy to this he was impelled by various considerations among which the certainty of knowing whatever the weak young man knew was decidedly not the least as the desire of encountering the usurers niece again and using his utmost arts to reduce her pride and revenge himself for her contempt was uppermost in his thoughts it was a politic course of proceeding and one which could not fail to redound to his advantage in every point of view since the very circumstance of his having extorted from ralph nickleby his real design in introducing his niece to such society coupled with his extreme disinterestedness in communicating it so freely to his friend could not but advance his interests in that quarter and greatly facilitate the passage of coin pretty frequent and speedy already from the pockets of lord frederick verisopht to those of sir mulberry hawk  thus reasoned sir mulberry and in pursuance of this reasoning he and his friend soon afterwards repaired to ralph nicklebys there to execute a plan of operations concerted by sir mulberry himself avowedly to promote his friends object and really to attain his own  they found ralph at home and alone as he led them into the drawingroom the recollection of the scene which had taken place there seemed to occur to him for he cast a curious look at sir mulberry who bestowed upon it no other acknowledgment than a careless smile  they had a short conference upon some money matters then in progress which were scarcely disposed of when the lordly dupe in pursuance of his friends instructions requested with some embarrassment to speak to ralph alone  alone eh cried sir mulberry affecting surprise oh very good ill walk into the next room here dont keep me long thats all  so saying sir mulberry took up his hat and humming a fragment of a song disappeared through the door of communication between the two drawingrooms and closed it after him  now my lord said ralph what is it  nickleby said his client throwing himself along the sofa on which he had been previously seated so as to bring his lips nearer to the old mans ear what a pretty creature your niece is  is she my lord replied ralph maybemaybei dont trouble my head with such matters  you know shes a deyvlish fine girl said the client you must know that nickleby come dont deny that  yes i believe she is considered so replied ralph indeed i know she is if i did not you are an authority on such points and your taste my lordon all points indeedis undeniable  nobody but the young man to whom these words were addressed could have been deaf to the sneering tone in which they were spoken or blind to the look of contempt by which they were accompanied but lord frederick verisopht was both and took them to be complimentary  well he said praps youre a little right and praps youre a little wronga little of both nickleby i want to know where this beauty lives that i may have another peep at her nickleby  really ralph began in his usual tones  dont talk so loud cried the other achieving the great point of his lesson to a miracle i dont want hawk to hear  you know he is your rival do you said ralph looking sharply at him  he always is daamn him replied the client and i want to steal a march upon him ha ha ha hell cut up so rough nickleby at our talking together without him where does she live nickleby thats all only tell me where she lives nickleby  he bites thought ralph he bites  eh nickleby eh pursued the client where does she live  really my lord said ralph rubbing his hands slowly over each other i must think before i tell you  no not a bit of it nickleby you mustnt think at all replied verisopht where is it  no good can come of your knowing replied ralph she has been virtuously and well brought up to be sure she is handsome poor unprotected poor girl poor girl  ralph ran over this brief summary of kates condition as if it were merely passing through his own mind and he had no intention to speak aloud but the shrewd sly look which he directed at his companion as he delivered it gave this poor assumption the lie  i tell you i only want to see her cried his client a maan may look at a pretty woman without harm maynt he now where does she live you know youre making a fortune out of me nickleby and upon my soul nobody shall ever take me to anybody else if you only tell me this  as you promise that my lord said ralph with feigned reluctance and as i am most anxious to oblige you and as theres no harm in itno harmill tell you but you had better keep it to yourself my lord strictly to yourself ralph pointed to the adjoining room as he spoke and nodded expressively  the young lord feigning to be equally impressed with the necessity of this precaution ralph disclosed the present address and occupation of his niece observing that from what he heard of the family they appeared very ambitious to have distinguished acquaintances and that a lord could doubtless introduce himself with great ease if he felt disposed  your object being only to see her again said ralph you could effect it at any time you chose by that means  lord verisopht acknowledged the hint with a great many squeezes of ralphs hard horny hand and whispering that they would now do well to close the conversation called to sir mulberry hawk that he might come back  i thought you had gone to sleep said sir mulberry reappearing with an illtempered air  sorry to detain you replied the gull but nickleby has been so amaazingly funny that i couldnt tear myself away  no no said ralph it was all his lordship you know what a witty humorous elegant accomplished man lord frederick is mind the step my lordsir mulberry pray give way  with such courtesies as these and many low bows and the same cold sneer upon his face all the while ralph busied himself in showing his visitors downstairs and otherwise than by the slightest possible motion about the corners of his mouth returned no show of answer to the look of admiration with which sir mulberry hawk seemed to compliment him on being such an accomplished and most consummate scoundrel  there had been a ring at the bell a few minutes before which was answered by newman noggs just as they reached the hall in the ordinary course of business newman would have either admitted the newcomer in silence or have requested him or her to stand aside while the gentlemen passed out but he no sooner saw who it was than as if for some private reason of his own he boldly departed from the established custom of ralphs mansion in business hours and looking towards the respectable trio who were approaching cried in a loud and sonorous voice mrs nickleby  mrs nickleby cried sir mulberry hawk as his friend looked back and stared him in the face  it was indeed that wellintentioned lady who having received an offer for the empty house in the city directed to the landlord had brought it posthaste to mr nickleby without delay  nobody you know said ralph step into the office mymydear ill be with you directly  nobody i know cried sir mulberry hawk advancing to the astonished lady is this mrs nicklebythe mother of miss nicklebythe delightful creature that i had the happiness of meeting in this house the very last time i dined here but no said sir mulberry stopping short no it cant be there is the same cast of features the same indescribable air ofbut no no this lady is too young for that  i think you can tell the gentleman brotherinlaw if it concerns him to know said mrs nickleby acknowledging the compliment with a graceful bend that kate nickleby is my daughter  her daughter my lord cried sir mulberry turning to his friend this ladys daughter my lord  my lord thought mrs nickleby well i never did  this then my lord said sir mulberry is the lady to whose obliging marriage we owe so much happiness this lady is the mother of sweet miss nickleby do you observe the extraordinary likeness my lord nicklebyintroduce us  ralph did so in a kind of desperation  upon my soul its a most delightful thing said lord frederick pressing forward how de do  mrs nickleby was too much flurried by these uncommonly kind salutations and her regrets at not having on her other bonnet to make any immediate reply so she merely continued to bend and smile and betray great agitation  aand how is miss nickleby said lord frederick well i hope  she is quite well im obliged to you my lord returned mrs nickleby recovering quite well she wasnt well for some days after that day she dined here and i cant help thinking that she caught cold in that hackney coach coming home hackney coaches my lord are such nasty things that its almost better to walk at any time for although i believe a hackney coachman can be transported for life if he has a broken window still they are so reckless that they nearly all have broken windows i once had a swelled face for six weeks my lord from riding in a hackney coachi think it was a hackney coach said mrs nickleby reflecting though im not quite certain whether it wasnt a chariot at all events i know it was a dark green with a very long number beginning with a nought and ending with a nineno beginning with a nine and ending with a nought that was it and of course the stampoffice people would know at once whether it was a coach or a chariot if any inquiries were made therehowever that was there it was with a broken window and there was i for six weeks with a swelled facei think that was the very same hackney coach that we found out afterwards had the top open all the time and we should never even have known it if they hadnt charged us a shilling an hour extra for having it open which it seems is the law or was then and a most shameful law it appears to bei dont understand the subject but i should say the corn laws could be nothing to that act of parliament  having pretty well run herself out by this time mrs nickleby stopped as suddenly as she had started off and repeated that kate was quite well indeed said mrs nickleby i dont think she ever was better since she had the hoopingcough scarletfever and measles all at the same time and thats the fact  is that letter for me growled ralph pointing to the little packet mrs nickleby held in her hand  for you brotherinlaw replied mrs nickleby and i walked all the way up here on purpose to give it you  all the way up here cried sir mulberry seizing upon the chance of discovering where mrs nickleby had come from what a confounded distance how far do you call it now  how far do i call it said mrs nickleby let me see its just a mile from our door to the old bailey  no no not so much as that urged sir mulberry  oh it is indeed said mrs nickleby i appeal to his lordship  i should decidedly say it was a mile remarked lord frederick with a solemn aspect  it must be it cant be a yard less said mrs nickleby all down newgate street all down cheapside all up lombard street down gracechurch street and along thames street as far as spigwiffins wharf oh its a mile  yes on second thoughts i should say it was replied sir mulberry but you dont surely mean to walk all the way back  oh no rejoined mrs nickleby i shall go back in an omnibus i didnt travel about in omnibuses when my poor dear nicholas was alive brotherinlaw but as it is you know  yes yes replied ralph impatiently and you had better get back before dark  thank you brotherinlaw so i had returned mrs nickleby i think i had better say goodbye at once  not stop andrest said ralph who seldom offered refreshments unless something was to be got by it  oh dear me no returned mrs nickleby glancing at the dial  lord frederick said sir mulberry we are going mrs nicklebys way well see her safe to the omnibus  by all means yees  oh i really couldnt think of it said mrs nickleby  but sir mulberry hawk and lord verisopht were peremptory in their politeness and leaving ralph who seemed to think not unwisely that he looked less ridiculous as a mere spectator than he would have done if he had taken any part in these proceedings they quitted the house with mrs nickleby between them that good lady in a perfect ecstasy of satisfaction no less with the attentions shown her by two titled gentlemen than with the conviction that kate might now pick and choose at least between two large fortunes and most unexceptionable husbands  as she was carried away for the moment by an irresistible train of thought all connected with her daughters future greatness sir mulberry hawk and his friend exchanged glances over the top of the bonnet which the poor lady so much regretted not having left at home and proceeded to dilate with great rapture but much respect on the manifold perfections of miss nickleby  what a delight what a comfort what a happiness this amiable creature must be to you said sir mulberry throwing into his voice an indication of the warmest feeling  she is indeed sir replied mrs nickleby she is the sweetesttempered kindesthearted creatureand so clever  she looks clayver said lord verisopht with the air of a judge of cleverness  i assure you she is my lord returned mrs nickleby when she was at school in devonshire she was universally allowed to be beyond all exception the very cleverest girl there and there were a great many very clever ones too and thats the truthtwentyfive young ladies fifty guineas a year without the etceteras both the miss dowdles the most accomplished elegant fascinating creaturesoh dear me said mrs nickleby i never shall forget what pleasure she used to give me and her poor dear papa when she was at that school neversuch a delightful letter every halfyear telling us that she was the first pupil in the whole establishment and had made more progress than anybody else i can scarcely bear to think of it even now the girls wrote all the letters themselves added mrs nickleby and the writingmaster touched them up afterwards with a magnifying glass and a silver pen at least i think they wrote them though kate was never quite certain about that because she didnt know the handwriting of hers again but anyway i know it was a circular which they all copied and of course it was a very gratifying thingvery gratifying  with similar recollections mrs nickleby beguiled the tediousness of the way until they reached the omnibus which the extreme politeness of her new friends would not allow them to leave until it actually started when they took their hats as mrs nickleby solemnly assured her hearers on many subsequent occasions completely off and kissed their strawcoloured kid gloves till they were no longer visible  mrs nickleby leant back in the furthest corner of the conveyance and closing her eyes resigned herself to a host of most pleasing meditations kate had never said a word about having met either of these gentlemen that she thought argues that she is strongly prepossessed in favour of one of them then the question arose which one could it be the lord was the youngest and his title was certainly the grandest still kate was not the girl to be swayed by such considerations as these i will never put any constraint upon her inclinations said mrs nickleby to herself but upon my word i think theres no comparison between his lordship and sir mulberrysir mulberry is such an attentive gentlemanly creature so much manner such a fine man and has so much to say for himself i hope its sir mulberryi think it must be sir mulberry and then her thoughts flew back to her old predictions and the number of times she had said that kate with no fortune would marry better than other peoples daughters with thousands and as she pictured with the brightness of a mothers fancy all the beauty and grace of the poor girl who had struggled so cheerfully with her new life of hardship and trial her heart grew too full and the tears trickled down her face  meanwhile ralph walked to and fro in his little backoffice troubled in mind by what had just occurred to say that ralph loved or cared forin the most ordinary acceptation of those termsany one of gods creatures would be the wildest fiction still there had somehow stolen upon him from time to time a thought of his niece which was tinged with compassion and pity breaking through the dull cloud of dislike or indifference which darkened men and women in his eyes there was in her case the faintest gleam of lighta most feeble and sickly ray at the best of timesbut there it was and it showed the poor girl in a better and purer aspect than any in which he had looked on human nature yet  i wish thought ralph i had never done this and yet it will keep this boy to me while there is money to be made selling a girlthrowing her in the way of temptation and insult and coarse speech nearly two thousand pounds profit from him already though pshaw matchmaking mothers do the same thing every day  he sat down and told the chances for and against on his fingers  if i had not put them in the right track today thought ralph this foolish woman would have done so well if her daughter is as true to herself as she should be from what i have seen what harm ensues a little teasing a little humbling a few tears yes said ralph aloud as he locked his iron safe she must take her chance she must take her chance    chapter 27  mrs nickleby becomes acquainted with messrs pyke and pluck whose affection and interest are beyond all bounds   mrs nickleby had not felt so proud and important for many a day as when on reaching home she gave herself wholly up to the pleasant visions which had accompanied her on her way thither lady mulberry hawkthat was the prevalent idea lady mulberry hawkon tuesday last at st georges hanover square by the right reverend the bishop of llandaff sir mulberry hawk of mulberry castle north wales to catherine only daughter of the late nicholas nickleby esquire of devonshire upon my word cried mrs nicholas nickleby it sounds very well  having dispatched the ceremony with its attendant festivities to the perfect satisfaction of her own mind the sanguine mother pictured to her imagination a long train of honours and distinctions which could not fail to accompany kate in her new and brilliant sphere she would be presented at court of course on the anniversary of her birthday which was upon the nineteenth of july at ten minutes past three oclock in the morning thought mrs nickleby in a parenthesis for i recollect asking what oclock it was sir mulberry would give a great feast to all his tenants and would return them three and a half per cent on the amount of their last halfyears rent as would be fully described and recorded in the fashionable intelligence to the immeasurable delight and admiration of all the readers thereof kates picture too would be in at least halfadozen of the annuals and on the opposite page would appear in delicate type lines on contemplating the portrait of lady mulberry hawk by sir dingleby dabber perhaps some one annual of more comprehensive design than its fellows might even contain a portrait of the mother of lady mulberry hawk with lines by the father of sir dingleby dabber more unlikely things had come to pass less interesting portraits had appeared as this thought occurred to the good lady her countenance unconsciously assumed that compound expression of simpering and sleepiness which being common to all such portraits is perhaps one reason why they are always so charming and agreeable  with such triumphs of aerial architecture did mrs nickleby occupy the whole evening after her accidental introduction to ralphs titled friends and dreams no less prophetic and equally promising haunted her sleep that night she was preparing for her frugal dinner next day still occupied with the same ideasa little softened down perhaps by sleep and daylightwhen the girl who attended her partly for company and partly to assist in the household affairs rushed into the room in unwonted agitation and announced that two gentlemen were waiting in the passage for permission to walk upstairs  bless my heart cried mrs nickleby hastily arranging her cap and front if it should bedear me standing in the passage all this timewhy dont you go and ask them to walk up you stupid thing  while the girl was gone on this errand mrs nickleby hastily swept into a cupboard all vestiges of eating and drinking which she had scarcely done and seated herself with looks as collected as she could assume when two gentlemen both perfect strangers presented themselves  how do you do said one gentleman laying great stress on the last word of the inquiry  how do you do said the other gentleman altering the emphasis as if to give variety to the salutation  mrs nickleby curtseyed and smiled and curtseyed again and remarked rubbing her hands as she did so that she hadnt thereallythe honour to  to know us said the first gentleman the loss has been ours mrs nickleby has the loss been ours pyke  it has pluck answered the other gentleman  we have regretted it very often i believe pyke said the first gentleman  very often pluck answered the second  but now said the first gentleman now we have the happiness we have pined and languished for have we pined and languished for this happiness pyke or have we not  you know we have pluck said pyke reproachfully  you hear him maam said mr pluck looking round you hear the unimpeachable testimony of my friend pykethat reminds meformalities formalities must not be neglected in civilised society pykemrs nickleby  mr pyke laid his hand upon his heart and bowed low  whether i shall introduce myself with the same formality said mr pluckwhether i shall say myself that my name is pluck or whether i shall ask my friend pyke who being now regularly introduced is competent to the office to state for me mrs nickleby that my name is pluck whether i shall claim your acquaintance on the plain ground of the strong interest i take in your welfare or whether i shall make myself known to you as the friend of sir mulberry hawkthese mrs nickleby are considerations which i leave to you to determine  any friend of sir mulberry hawks requires no better introduction to me observed mrs nickleby graciously  it is delightful to hear you say so said mr pluck drawing a chair close to mrs nickleby and sitting himself down it is refreshing to know that you hold my excellent friend sir mulberry in such high esteem a word in your ear mrs nickleby when sir mulberry knows it he will be a happy mani say mrs nickleby a happy man pyke be seated  my good opinion said mrs nickleby and the poor lady exulted in the idea that she was marvellously slymy good opinion can be of very little consequence to a gentleman like sir mulberry  of little consequence exclaimed mr pluck pyke of what consequence to our friend sir mulberry is the good opinion of mrs nickleby  of what consequence echoed pyke  ay repeated pluck is it of the greatest consequence  of the very greatest consequence replied pyke  mrs nickleby cannot be ignorant said mr pluck of the immense impression which that sweet girl has  pluck said his friend beware  pyke is right muttered mr pluck after a short pause i was not to mention it pyke is very right thank you pyke  well now really thought mrs nickleby within herself such delicacy as that i never saw  mr pluck after feigning to be in a condition of great embarrassment for some minutes resumed the conversation by entreating mrs nickleby to take no heed of what he had inadvertently saidto consider him imprudent rash injudicious the only stipulation he would make in his own favour was that she should give him credit for the best intentions  but when said mr pluck when i see so much sweetness and beauty on the one hand and so much ardour and devotion on the other ipardon me pyke i didnt intend to resume that theme change the subject pyke  we promised sir mulberry and lord frederick said pyke that wed call this morning and inquire whether you took any cold last night  not the least in the world last night sir replied mrs nickleby with many thanks to his lordship and sir mulberry for doing me the honour to inquire not the leastwhich is the more singular as i really am very subject to colds indeedvery subject i had a cold once said mrs nickleby i think it was in the year eighteen hundred and seventeen let me see four and five are nine andyes eighteen hundred and seventeen that i thought i never should get rid of actually and seriously that i thought i never should get rid of i was only cured at last by a remedy that i dont know whether you ever happened to hear of mr pluck you have a gallon of water as hot as you can possibly bear it with a pound of salt and sixpenorth of the finest bran and sit with your head in it for twenty minutes every night just before going to bed at least i dont mean your headyour feet its a most extraordinary curea most extraordinary cure i used it for the first time i recollect the day after christmas day and by the middle of april following the cold was gone it seems quite a miracle when you come to think of it for i had it ever since the beginning of september  what an afflicting calamity said mr pyke  perfectly horrid exclaimed mr pluck  but its worth the pain of hearing only to know that mrs nickleby recovered it isnt it pluck cried mr pyke  that is the circumstance which gives it such a thrilling interest replied mr pluck  but come said pyke as if suddenly recollecting himself we must not forget our mission in the pleasure of this interview we come on a mission mrs nickleby  on a mission exclaimed that good lady to whose mind a definite proposal of marriage for kate at once presented itself in lively colours  from sir mulberry replied pyke you must be very dull here  rather dull i confess said mrs nickleby  we bring the compliments of sir mulberry hawk and a thousand entreaties that youll take a seat in a private box at the play tonight said mr pluck  oh dear said mrs nickleby i never go out at all never  and that is the very reason my dear mrs nickleby why you should go out tonight retorted mr pluck pyke entreat mrs nickleby  oh pray do said pyke  you positively must urged pluck  you are very kind said mrs nickleby hesitating but  theres not a but in the case my dear mrs nickleby remonstrated mr pluck not such a word in the vocabulary your brotherinlaw joins us lord frederick joins us sir mulberry joins us pyke joins usa refusal is out of the question sir mulberry sends a carriage for youtwenty minutes before seven to the momentyoull not be so cruel as to disappoint the whole party mrs nickleby  you are so very pressing that i scarcely know what to say replied the worthy lady  say nothing not a word not a word my dearest madam urged mr pluck mrs nickleby said that excellent gentleman lowering his voice there is the most trifling the most excusable breach of confidence in what i am about to say and yet if my friend pyke there overheard itsuch is that mans delicate sense of honour mrs nicklebyhed have me out before dinnertime  mrs nickleby cast an apprehensive glance at the warlike pyke who had walked to the window and mr pluck squeezing her hand went on  your daughter has made a conquesta conquest on which i may congratulate you sir mulberry my dear maam sir mulberry is her devoted slave hem  hah cried mr pyke at this juncture snatching something from the chimneypiece with a theatrical air what is this what do i behold  what do you behold my dear fellow asked mr pluck  it is the face the countenance the expression cried mr pyke falling into his chair with a miniature in his hand feebly portrayed imperfectly caught but still the face the countenance the expression  i recognise it at this distance exclaimed mr pluck in a fit of enthusiasm is it not my dear madam the faint similitude of  it is my daughters portrait said mrs nickleby with great pride and so it was and little miss la creevy had brought it home for inspection only two nights before  mr pyke no sooner ascertained that he was quite right in his conjecture than he launched into the most extravagant encomiums of the divine original and in the warmth of his enthusiasm kissed the picture a thousand times while mr pluck pressed mrs nicklebys hand to his heart and congratulated her on the possession of such a daughter with so much earnestness and affection that the tears stood or seemed to stand in his eyes poor mrs nickleby who had listened in a state of enviable complacency at first became at length quite overpowered by these tokens of regard for and attachment to the family and even the servant girl who had peeped in at the door remained rooted to the spot in astonishment at the ecstasies of the two friendly visitors  by degrees these raptures subsided and mrs nickleby went on to entertain her guests with a lament over her fallen fortunes and a picturesque account of her old house in the country comprising a full description of the different apartments not forgetting the little storeroom and a lively recollection of how many steps you went down to get into the garden and which way you turned when you came out at the parlour door and what capital fixtures there were in the kitchen this last reflection naturally conducted her into the washhouse where she stumbled upon the brewing utensils among which she might have wandered for an hour if the mere mention of those implements had not by an association of ideas instantly reminded mr pyke that he was amazing thirsty  and ill tell you what said mr pyke if youll send round to the publichouse for a pot of milk halfandhalf positively and actually ill drink it  and positively and actually mr pyke did drink it and mr pluck helped him while mrs nickleby looked on in divided admiration of the condescension of the two and the aptitude with which they accommodated themselves to the pewterpot in explanation of which seeming marvel it may be here observed that gentlemen who like messrs pyke and pluck live upon their wits or not so much perhaps upon the presence of their own wits as upon the absence of wits in other people are occasionally reduced to very narrow shifts and straits and are at such periods accustomed to regale themselves in a very simple and primitive manner  at twenty minutes before seven then said mr pyke rising the coach will be here one more lookone little lookat that sweet face ah here it is unmoved unchanged this by the way was a very remarkable circumstance miniatures being liable to so many changes of expressionoh pluck pluck  mr pluck made no other reply than kissing mrs nicklebys hand with a great show of feeling and attachment mr pyke having done the same both gentlemen hastily withdrew  mrs nickleby was commonly in the habit of giving herself credit for a pretty tolerable share of penetration and acuteness but she had never felt so satisfied with her own sharpsightedness as she did that day she had found it all out the night before she had never seen sir mulberry and kate togethernever even heard sir mulberrys nameand yet hadnt she said to herself from the very first that she saw how the case stood and what a triumph it was for there was now no doubt about it if these flattering attentions to herself were not sufficient proofs sir mulberrys confidential friend had suffered the secret to escape him in so many words i am quite in love with that dear mr pluck i declare i am said mrs nickleby  there was one great source of uneasiness in the midst of this good fortune and that was the having nobody by to whom she could confide it once or twice she almost resolved to walk straight to miss la creevys and tell it all to her but i dont know thought mrs nickleby she is a very worthy person but i am afraid too much beneath sir mulberrys station for us to make a companion of poor thing acting upon this grave consideration she rejected the idea of taking the little portrait painter into her confidence and contented herself with holding out sundry vague and mysterious hopes of preferment to the servant girl who received these obscure hints of dawning greatness with much veneration and respect  punctual to its time came the promised vehicle which was no hackney coach but a private chariot having behind it a footman whose legs although somewhat large for his body might as mere abstract legs have set themselves up for models at the royal academy it was quite exhilarating to hear the clash and bustle with which he banged the door and jumped up behind after mrs nickleby was in and as that good lady was perfectly unconscious that he applied the goldheaded end of his long stick to his nose and so telegraphed most disrespectfully to the coachman over her very head she sat in a state of much stiffness and dignity not a little proud of her position  at the theatre entrance there was more banging and more bustle and there were also messrs pyke and pluck waiting to escort her to her box and so polite were they that mr pyke threatened with many oaths to smifligate a very old man with a lantern who accidentally stumbled in her wayto the great terror of mrs nickleby who conjecturing more from mr pykes excitement than any previous acquaintance with the etymology of the word that smifligation and bloodshed must be in the main one and the same thing was alarmed beyond expression lest something should occur fortunately however mr pyke confined himself to mere verbal smifligation and they reached their box with no more serious interruption by the way than a desire on the part of the same pugnacious gentleman to smash the assistant boxkeeper for happening to mistake the number  mrs nickleby had scarcely been put away behind the curtain of the box in an armchair when sir mulberry and lord verisopht arrived arrayed from the crowns of their heads to the tips of their gloves and from the tips of their gloves to the toes of their boots in the most elegant and costly manner sir mulberry was a little hoarser than on the previous day and lord verisopht looked rather sleepy and queer from which tokens as well as from the circumstance of their both being to a trifling extent unsteady upon their legs mrs nickleby justly concluded that they had taken dinner  we have beenwe have beentoasting your lovely daughter mrs nickleby whispered sir mulberry sitting down behind her  oh ho thought that knowing lady wine in truth outyou are very kind sir mulberry  no no upon my soul replied sir mulberry hawk its you thats kind upon my soul it is it was so kind of you to come tonight  so very kind of you to invite me you mean sir mulberry replied mrs nickleby tossing her head and looking prodigiously sly  i am so anxious to know you so anxious to cultivate your good opinion so desirous that there should be a delicious kind of harmonious family understanding between us said sir mulberry that you mustnt think im disinterested in what i do im infernal selfish i amupon my soul i am  i am sure you cant be selfish sir mulberry replied mrs nickleby you have much too open and generous a countenance for that  what an extraordinary observer you are said sir mulberry hawk  oh no indeed i dont see very far into things sir mulberry replied mrs nickleby in a tone of voice which left the baronet to infer that she saw very far indeed  i am quite afraid of you said the baronet upon my soul repeated sir mulberry looking round to his companions i am afraid of mrs nickleby she is so immensely sharp  messrs pyke and pluck shook their heads mysteriously and observed together that they had found that out long ago upon which mrs nickleby tittered and sir mulberry laughed and pyke and pluck roared  but wheres my brotherinlaw sir mulberry inquired mrs nickleby i shouldnt be here without him i hope hes coming  pyke said sir mulberry taking out his toothpick and lolling back in his chair as if he were too lazy to invent a reply to this question wheres ralph nickleby  pluck said pyke imitating the baronets action and turning the lie over to his friend wheres ralph nickleby  mr pluck was about to return some evasive reply when the hustle caused by a party entering the next box seemed to attract the attention of all four gentlemen who exchanged glances of much meaning the new party beginning to converse together sir mulberry suddenly assumed the character of a most attentive listener and implored his friends not to breathenot to breathe  why not said mrs nickleby what is the matter  hush replied sir mulberry laying his hand on her arm lord frederick do you recognise the tones of that voice  deyvle take me if i didnt think it was the voice of miss nickleby  lor my lord cried miss nicklebys mama thrusting her head round the curtain why actuallykate my dear kate  you here mama is it possible  possible my dear yes  why whowho on earth is that you have with you mama said kate shrinking back as she caught sight of a man smiling and kissing his hand  who do you suppose my dear replied mrs nickleby bending towards mrs wititterly and speaking a little louder for that ladys edification theres mr pyke mr pluck sir mulberry hawk and lord frederick verisopht  gracious heaven thought kate hurriedly how comes she in such society  now kate thought thus so hurriedly and the surprise was so great and moreover brought back so forcibly the recollection of what had passed at ralphs delectable dinner that she turned extremely pale and appeared greatly agitated which symptoms being observed by mrs nickleby were at once set down by that acute lady as being caused and occasioned by violent love but although she was in no small degree delighted by this discovery which reflected so much credit on her own quickness of perception it did not lessen her motherly anxiety in kates behalf and accordingly with a vast quantity of trepidation she quitted her own box to hasten into that of mrs wititterly mrs wititterly keenly alive to the glory of having a lord and a baronet among her visiting acquaintance lost no time in signing to mr wititterly to open the door and thus it was that in less than thirty seconds mrs nicklebys party had made an irruption into mrs wititterlys box which it filled to the very door there being in fact only room for messrs pyke and pluck to get in their heads and waistcoats  my dear kate said mrs nickleby kissing her daughter affectionately how ill you looked a moment ago you quite frightened me i declare  it was mere fancy mamathethereflection of the lights perhaps replied kate glancing nervously round and finding it impossible to whisper any caution or explanation  dont you see sir mulberry hawk my dear  kate bowed slightly and biting her lip turned her head towards the stage  but sir mulberry hawk was not to be so easily repulsed for he advanced with extended hand and mrs nickleby officiously informing kate of this circumstance she was obliged to extend her own sir mulberry detained it while he murmured a profusion of compliments which kate remembering what had passed between them rightly considered as so many aggravations of the insult he had already put upon her then followed the recognition of lord verisopht and then the greeting of mr pyke and then that of mr pluck and finally to complete the young ladys mortification she was compelled at mrs wititterlys request to perform the ceremony of introducing the odious persons whom she regarded with the utmost indignation and abhorrence  mrs wititterly is delighted said mr wititterly rubbing his hands delighted my lord i am sure with this opportunity of contracting an acquaintance which i trust my lord we shall improve julia my dear you must not allow yourself to be too much excited you must not indeed you must not mrs wititterly is of a most excitable nature sir mulberry the snuff of a candle the wick of a lamp the bloom on a peach the down on a butterfly you might blow her away my lord you might blow her away  sir mulberry seemed to think that it would be a great convenience if the lady could be blown away he said however that the delight was mutual and lord verisopht added that it was mutual whereupon messrs pyke and pluck were heard to murmur from the distance that it was very mutual indeed  i take an interest my lord said mrs wititterly with a faint smile such an interest in the drama  yees its very interesting replied lord verisopht  im always ill after shakespeare said mrs wititterly i scarcely exist the next day i find the reaction so very great after a tragedy my lord and shakespeare is such a delicious creature  yees replied lord verisopht he was a clayver man  do you know my lord said mrs wititterly after a long silence i find i take so much more interest in his plays after having been to that dear little dull house he was born in were you ever there my lord  no nayver replied verisopht  then really you ought to go my lord returned mrs wititterly in very languid and drawling accents i dont know how it is but after youve seen the place and written your name in the little book somehow or other you seem to be inspired it kindles up quite a fire within one  yees replied lord verisopht i shall certainly go there  julia my life interposed mr wititterly you are deceiving his lordshipunintentionally my lord she is deceiving you it is your poetical temperament my dearyour ethereal soulyour fervid imagination which throws you into a glow of genius and excitement there is nothing in the place my dearnothing nothing  i think there must be something in the place said mrs nickleby who had been listening in silence for soon after i was married i went to stratford with my poor dear mr nickleby in a postchaise from birminghamwas it a postchaise though said mrs nickleby considering yes it must have been a postchaise because i recollect remarking at the time that the driver had a green shade over his left eyein a postchaise from birmingham and after we had seen shakespeares tomb and birthplace we went back to the inn there where we slept that night and i recollect that all night long i dreamt of nothing but a black gentleman at full length in plasterofparis with a laydown collar tied with two tassels leaning against a post and thinking and when i woke in the morning and described him to mr nickleby he said it was shakespeare just as he had been when he was alive which was very curious indeed stratfordstratford continued mrs nickleby considering yes i am positive about that because i recollect i was in the family way with my son nicholas at the time and i had been very much frightened by an italian image boy that very morning in fact it was quite a mercy maam added mrs nickleby in a whisper to mrs wititterly that my son didnt turn out to be a shakespeare and what a dreadful thing that would have been  when mrs nickleby had brought this interesting anecdote to a close pyke and pluck ever zealous in their patrons cause proposed the adjournment of a detachment of the party into the next box and with so much skill were the preliminaries adjusted that kate despite all she could say or do to the contrary had no alternative but to suffer herself to be led away by sir mulberry hawk her mother and mr pluck accompanied them but the worthy lady pluming herself upon her discretion took particular care not so much as to look at her daughter during the whole evening and to seem wholly absorbed in the jokes and conversation of mr pluck who having been appointed sentry over mrs nickleby for that especial purpose neglected on his side no possible opportunity of engrossing her attention  lord frederick verisopht remained in the next box to be talked to by mrs wititterly and mr pyke was in attendance to throw in a word or two when necessary as to mr wititterly he was sufficiently busy in the body of the house informing such of his friends and acquaintance as happened to be there that those two gentlemen upstairs whom they had seen in conversation with mrs w were the distinguished lord frederick verisopht and his most intimate friend the gay sir mulberry hawka communication which inflamed several respectable housekeepers with the utmost jealousy and rage and reduced sixteen unmarried daughters to the very brink of despair  the evening came to an end at last but kate had yet to be handed downstairs by the detested sir mulberry and so skilfully were the manoeuvres of messrs pyke and pluck conducted that she and the baronet were the last of the party and were evenwithout an appearance of effort or designleft at some little distance behind  dont hurry dont hurry said sir mulberry as kate hastened on and attempted to release her arm  she made no reply but still pressed forward  nay then coolly observed sir mulberry stopping her outright  you had best not seek to detain me sir said kate angrily  and why not retorted sir mulberry my dear creature now why do you keep up this show of displeasure  show repeated kate indignantly how dare you presume to speak to me sirto address meto come into my presence  you look prettier in a passion miss nickleby said sir mulberry hawk stooping down the better to see her face  i hold you in the bitterest detestation and contempt sir said kate if you find any attraction in looks of disgust and aversion youlet me rejoin my friends sir instantly whatever considerations may have withheld me thus far i will disregard them all and take a course that even you might feel if you do not immediately suffer me to proceed  sir mulberry smiled and still looking in her face and retaining her arm walked towards the door  if no regard for my sex or helpless situation will induce you to desist from this coarse and unmanly persecution said kate scarcely knowing in the tumult of her passions what she saidi have a brother who will resent it dearly one day  upon my soul exclaimed sir mulberry as though quietly communing with himself passing his arm round her waist as he spoke she looks more beautiful and i like her better in this mood than when her eyes are cast down and she is in perfect repose  how kate reached the lobby where her friends were waiting she never knew but she hurried across it without at all regarding them and disengaged herself suddenly from her companion sprang into the coach and throwing herself into its darkest corner burst into tears  messrs pyke and pluck knowing their cue at once threw the party into great commotion by shouting for the carriages and getting up a violent quarrel with sundry inoffensive bystanders in the midst of which tumult they put the affrighted mrs nickleby in her chariot and having got her safely off turned their thoughts to mrs wititterly whose attention also they had now effectually distracted from the young lady by throwing her into a state of the utmost bewilderment and consternation at length the conveyance in which she had come rolled off too with its load and the four worthies being left alone under the portico enjoyed a hearty laugh together  there said sir mulberry turning to his noble friend didnt i tell you last night that if we could find where they were going by bribing a servant through my fellow and then established ourselves close by with the mother these peoples honour would be our own why here it is done in fourandtwenty hours  yees replied the dupe but i have been tied to the old woman all niight  hear him said sir mulberry turning to his two friends hear this discontented grumbler isnt it enough to make a man swear never to help him in his plots and schemes again isnt it an infernal shame  pyke asked pluck whether it was not an infernal shame and pluck asked pyke but neither answered  isnt it the truth demanded verisopht wasnt it so  wasnt it so repeated sir mulberry how would you have had it how could we have got a general invitation at first sightcome when you like go when you like stop as long as you like do what you likeif you the lord had not made yourself agreeable to the foolish mistress of the house do i care for this girl except as your friend havent i been sounding your praises in her ears and bearing her pretty sulks and peevishness all night for you what sort of stuff do you think im made of would i do this for every man dont i deserve even gratitude in return  youre a deyvlish good fellow said the poor young lord taking his friends arm upon my life youre a deyvlish good fellow hawk  and i have done right have i demanded sir mulberry  quite right  and like a poor silly goodnatured friendly dog as i am eh  yees yees like a friend replied the other  well then replied sir mulberry im satisfied and now lets go and have our revenge on the german baron and the frenchman who cleaned you out so handsomely last night  with these words the friendly creature took his companions arm and led him away turning half round as he did so and bestowing a wink and a contemptuous smile on messrs pyke and pluck who cramming their handkerchiefs into their mouths to denote their silent enjoyment of the whole proceedings followed their patron and his victim at a little distance    chapter 28  miss nickleby rendered desperate by the persecution of sir mulberry hawk and the complicated difficulties and distresses which surround her appeals as a last resource to her uncle for protection   the ensuing morning brought reflection with it as morning usually does but widely different was the train of thought it awakened in the different persons who had been so unexpectedly brought together on the preceding evening by the active agency of messrs pyke and pluck  the reflections of sir mulberry hawkif such a term can be applied to the thoughts of the systematic and calculating man of dissipation whose joys regrets pains and pleasures are all of self and who would seem to retain nothing of the intellectual faculty but the power to debase himself and to degrade the very nature whose outward semblance he wearsthe reflections of sir mulberry hawk turned upon kate nickleby and were in brief that she was undoubtedly handsome that her coyness must be easily conquerable by a man of his address and experience and that the pursuit was one which could not fail to redound to his credit and greatly to enhance his reputation with the world and lest this last considerationno mean or secondary one with sir mulberryshould sound strangely in the ears of some let it be remembered that most men live in a world of their own and that in that limited circle alone are they ambitious for distinction and applause sir mulberrys world was peopled with profligates and he acted accordingly  thus cases of injustice and oppression and tyranny and the most extravagant bigotry are in constant occurrence among us every day it is the custom to trumpet forth much wonder and astonishment at the chief actors therein setting at defiance so completely the opinion of the world but there is no greater fallacy it is precisely because they do consult the opinion of their own little world that such things take place at all and strike the great world dumb with amazement  the reflections of mrs nickleby were of the proudest and most complacent kind and under the influence of her very agreeable delusion she straightway sat down and indited a long letter to kate in which she expressed her entire approval of the admirable choice she had made and extolled sir mulberry to the skies asserting for the more complete satisfaction of her daughters feelings that he was precisely the individual whom she mrs nickleby would have chosen for her soninlaw if she had had the picking and choosing from all mankind the good lady then with the preliminary observation that she might be fairly supposed not to have lived in the world so long without knowing its ways communicated a great many subtle precepts applicable to the state of courtship and confirmed in their wisdom by her own personal experience above all things she commended a strict maidenly reserve as being not only a very laudable thing in itself but as tending materially to strengthen and increase a lovers ardour and i never added mrs nickleby was more delighted in my life than to observe last night my dear that your good sense had already told you this with which sentiment and various hints of the pleasure she derived from the knowledge that her daughter inherited so large an instalment of her own excellent sense and discretion to nearly the full measure of which she might hope with care to succeed in time mrs nickleby concluded a very long and rather illegible letter  poor kate was wellnigh distracted on the receipt of four closelywritten and closelycrossed sides of congratulation on the very subject which had prevented her closing her eyes all night and kept her weeping and watching in her chamber still worse and more trying was the necessity of rendering herself agreeable to mrs wititterly who being in low spirits after the fatigue of the preceding night of course expected her companion else wherefore had she board and salary to be in the best spirits possible as to mr wititterly he went about all day in a tremor of delight at having shaken hands with a lord and having actually asked him to come and see him in his own house the lord himself not being troubled to any inconvenient extent with the power of thinking regaled himself with the conversation of messrs pyke and pluck who sharpened their wit by a plentiful indulgence in various costly stimulants at his expense  it was four in the afternoonthat is the vulgar afternoon of the sun and the clockand mrs wititterly reclined according to custom on the drawingroom sofa while kate read aloud a new novel in three volumes entitled the lady flabella which alphonse the doubtful had procured from the library that very morning and it was a production admirably suited to a lady labouring under mrs wititterlys complaint seeing that there was not a line in it from beginning to end which could by the most remote contingency awaken the smallest excitement in any person breathing  kate read on  cherizette said the lady flabella inserting her mouselike feet in the blue satin slippers which had unwittingly occasioned the halfplayful halfangry altercation between herself and the youthful colonel befillaire in the duke of mincefenilles salon de danse on the previous night cherizette ma chere donnezmoi de leaudecologne sil vous plait mon enfant  merciethank you said the lady flabella as the lively but devoted cherizette plentifully besprinkled with the fragrant compound the lady flabellas mouchoir of finest cambric edged with richest lace and emblazoned at the four corners with the flabella crest and gorgeous heraldic bearings of that noble family merciethat will do  at this instant while the lady flabella yet inhaled that delicious fragrance by holding the mouchoir to her exquisite but thoughtfullychiselled nose the door of the boudoir artfully concealed by rich hangings of silken damask the hue of italys firmament was thrown open and with noiseless tread two valetsdechambre clad in sumptuous liveries of peachblossom and gold advanced into the room followed by a page in bas de soiesilk stockingswho while they remained at some distance making the most graceful obeisances advanced to the feet of his lovely mistress and dropping on one knee presented on a golden salver gorgeously chased a scented billet  the lady flabella with an agitation she could not repress hastily tore off the envelope and broke the scented seal it was from befillairethe young the slim the lowvoicedher own befillaire  oh charming interrupted kates patroness who was sometimes taken literary poetic really read that description again miss nickleby  kate complied  sweet indeed said mrs wititterly with a sigh so voluptuous is it notso soft  yes i think it is replied kate gently very soft  close the book miss nickleby said mrs wititterly i can hear nothing more today i should be sorry to disturb the impression of that sweet description close the book  kate complied not unwillingly and as she did so mrs wititterly raising her glass with a languid hand remarked that she looked pale  it was the fright of thatthat noise and confusion last night said kate  how very odd exclaimed mrs wititterly with a look of surprise and certainly when one comes to think of it it was very odd that anything should have disturbed a companion a steamengine or other ingenious piece of mechanism out of order would have been nothing to it  how did you come to know lord frederick and those other delightful creatures child asked mrs wititterly still eyeing kate through her glass  i met them at my uncles said kate vexed to feel that she was colouring deeply but unable to keep down the blood which rushed to her face whenever she thought of that man  have you known them long  no rejoined kate not long  i was very glad of the opportunity which that respectable person your mother gave us of being known to them said mrs wititterly in a lofty manner some friends of ours were on the very point of introducing us which makes it quite remarkable  this was said lest miss nickleby should grow conceited on the honour and dignity of having known four great people for pyke and pluck were included among the delightful creatures whom mrs wititterly did not know but as the circumstance had made no impression one way or other upon kates mind the force of the observation was quite lost upon her  they asked permission to call said mrs wititterly i gave it them of course  do you expect them today kate ventured to inquire  mrs wititterlys answer was lost in the noise of a tremendous rapping at the streetdoor and before it had ceased to vibrate there drove up a handsome cabriolet out of which leaped sir mulberry hawk and his friend lord verisopht  they are here now said kate rising and hurrying away  miss nickleby cried mrs wititterly perfectly aghast at a companions attempting to quit the room without her permission first had and obtained pray dont think of going  you are very good replied kate but  for goodness sake dont agitate me by making me speak so much said mrs wititterly with great sharpness dear me miss nickleby i beg  it was in vain for kate to protest that she was unwell for the footsteps of the knockers whoever they were were already on the stairs she resumed her seat and had scarcely done so when the doubtful page darted into the room and announced mr pyke and mr pluck and lord verisopht and sir mulberry hawk all at one burst  the most extraordinary thing in the world said mr pluck saluting both ladies with the utmost cordiality the most extraordinary thing as lord frederick and sir mulberry drove up to the door pyke and i had that instant knocked  that instant knocked said pyke  no matter how you came so that you are here said mrs wititterly who by dint of lying on the same sofa for three years and a half had got up quite a little pantomime of graceful attitudes and now threw herself into the most striking of the whole series to astonish the visitors i am delighted i am sure  and how is miss nickleby said sir mulberry hawk accosting kate in a low voicenot so low however but that it reached the ears of mrs wititterly  why she complains of suffering from the fright of last night said the lady i am sure i dont wonder at it for my nerves are quite torn to pieces  and yet you look observed sir mulberry turning round and yet you look  beyond everything said mr pyke coming to his patrons assistance of course mr pluck said the same  i am afraid sir mulberry is a flatterer my lord said mrs wititterly turning to that young gentleman who had been sucking the head of his cane in silence and staring at kate  oh deyvlish replied verisopht having given utterance to which remarkable sentiment he occupied himself as before  neither does miss nickleby look the worse said sir mulberry bending his bold gaze upon her she was always handsome but upon my soul maam you seem to have imparted some of your own good looks to her besides  to judge from the glow which suffused the poor girls countenance after this speech mrs wititterly might with some show of reason have been supposed to have imparted to it some of that artificial bloom which decorated her own mrs wititterly admitted though not with the best grace in the world that kate did look pretty she began to think too that sir mulberry was not quite so agreeable a creature as she had at first supposed him for although a skilful flatterer is a most delightful companion if you can keep him all to yourself his taste becomes very doubtful when he takes to complimenting other people  pyke said the watchful mr pluck observing the effect which the praise of miss nickleby had produced  well pluck said pyke  is there anybody demanded mr pluck mysteriously anybody you know that mrs wititterlys profile reminds you of  reminds me of answered pyke of course there is  who do you mean said pluck in the same mysterious manner the d of b  the c of b replied pyke with the faintest trace of a grin lingering in his countenance the beautiful sister is the countess not the duchess  true said pluck the c of b the resemblance is wonderful  perfectly startling said mr pyke  here was a state of things mrs wititterly was declared upon the testimony of two veracious and competent witnesses to be the very picture of a countess this was one of the consequences of getting into good society why she might have moved among grovelling people for twenty years and never heard of it how could she indeed what did they know about countesses  the two gentlemen having by the greediness with which this little bait was swallowed tested the extent of mrs wititterlys appetite for adulation proceeded to administer that commodity in very large doses thus affording to sir mulberry hawk an opportunity of pestering miss nickleby with questions and remarks to which she was absolutely obliged to make some reply meanwhile lord verisopht enjoyed unmolested the full flavour of the gold knob at the top of his cane as he would have done to the end of the interview if mr wititterly had not come home and caused the conversation to turn to his favourite topic  my lord said mr wititterly i am delightedhonouredproud be seated again my lord pray i am proud indeedmost proud  it was to the secret annoyance of his wife that mr wititterly said all this for although she was bursting with pride and arrogance she would have had the illustrious guests believe that their visit was quite a common occurrence and that they had lords and baronets to see them every day in the week but mr wititterlys feelings were beyond the power of suppression  it is an honour indeed said mr wititterly julia my soul you will suffer for this tomorrow  suffer cried lord verisopht  the reaction my lord the reaction said mr wititterly this violent strain upon the nervous system over my lord what ensues a sinking a depression a lowness a lassitude a debility my lord if sir tumley snuffim was to see that delicate creature at this moment he would not give aathis for her life in illustration of which remark mr wititterly took a pinch of snuff from his box and jerked it lightly into the air as an emblem of instability  not that said mr wititterly looking about him with a serious countenance sir tumley snuffim would not give that for mrs wititterlys existence  mr wititterly told this with a kind of sober exultation as if it were no trifling distinction for a man to have a wife in such a desperate state and mrs wititterly sighed and looked on as if she felt the honour but had determined to bear it as meekly as might be  mrs wititterly said her husband is sir tumley snuffims favourite patient i believe i may venture to say that mrs wititterly is the first person who took the new medicine which is supposed to have destroyed a family at kensington gravel pits i believe she was if i am wrong julia my dear you will correct me  i believe i was said mrs wititterly in a faint voice  as there appeared to be some doubt in the mind of his patron how he could best join in this conversation the indefatigable mr pyke threw himself into the breach and by way of saying something to the point inquiredwith reference to the aforesaid medicinewhether it was nice  no sir it was not it had not even that recommendation said mr w  mrs wititterly is quite a martyr observed pyke with a complimentary bow  i think i am said mrs wititterly smiling  i think you are my dear julia replied her husband in a tone which seemed to say that he was not vain but still must insist upon their privileges if anybody my lord added mr wititterly wheeling round to the nobleman will produce to me a greater martyr than mrs wititterly all i can say is that i shall be glad to see that martyr whether male or femalethats all my lord  pyke and pluck promptly remarked that certainly nothing could be fairer than that and the call having been by this time protracted to a very great length they obeyed sir mulberrys look and rose to go this brought sir mulberry himself and lord verisopht on their legs also many protestations of friendship and expressions anticipative of the pleasure which must inevitably flow from so happy an acquaintance were exchanged and the visitors departed with renewed assurances that at all times and seasons the mansion of the wititterlys would be honoured by receiving them beneath its roof  that they came at all times and seasonsthat they dined there one day supped the next dined again on the next and were constantly to and fro on allthat they made parties to visit public places and met by accident at loungesthat upon all these occasions miss nickleby was exposed to the constant and unremitting persecution of sir mulberry hawk who now began to feel his character even in the estimation of his two dependants involved in the successful reduction of her pridethat she had no intervals of peace or rest except at those hours when she could sit in her solitary room and weep over the trials of the dayall these were consequences naturally flowing from the welllaid plans of sir mulberry and their able execution by the auxiliaries pyke and pluck  and thus for a fortnight matters went on that any but the weakest and silliest of people could have seen in one interview that lord verisopht though he was a lord and sir mulberry hawk though he was a baronet were not persons accustomed to be the best possible companions and were certainly not calculated by habits manners tastes or conversation to shine with any very great lustre in the society of ladies need scarcely be remarked but with mrs wititterly the two titles were all sufficient coarseness became humour vulgarity softened itself down into the most charming eccentricity insolence took the guise of an easy absence of reserve attainable only by those who had had the good fortune to mix with high folks  if the mistress put such a construction upon the behaviour of her new friends what could the companion urge against them if they accustomed themselves to very little restraint before the lady of the house with how much more freedom could they address her paid dependent nor was even this the worst as the odious sir mulberry hawk attached himself to kate with less and less of disguise mrs wititterly began to grow jealous of the superior attractions of miss nickleby if this feeling had led to her banishment from the drawingroom when such company was there kate would have been only too happy and willing that it should have existed but unfortunately for her she possessed that native grace and true gentility of manner and those thousand nameless accomplishments which give to female society its greatest charm if these be valuable anywhere they were especially so where the lady of the house was a mere animated doll the consequence was that kate had the double mortification of being an indispensable part of the circle when sir mulberry and his friends were there and of being exposed on that very account to all mrs wititterlys illhumours and caprices when they were gone she became utterly and completely miserable  mrs wititterly had never thrown off the mask with regard to sir mulberry but when she was more than usually out of temper attributed the circumstance as ladies sometimes do to nervous indisposition however as the dreadful idea that lord verisopht also was somewhat taken with kate and that she mrs wititterly was quite a secondary person dawned upon that ladys mind and gradually developed itself she became possessed with a large quantity of highly proper and most virtuous indignation and felt it her duty as a married lady and a moral member of society to mention the circumstance to the young person without delay  accordingly mrs wititterly broke ground next morning during a pause in the novelreading  miss nickleby said mrs wititterly i wish to speak to you very gravely i am sorry to have to do it upon my word i am very sorry but you leave me no alternative miss nickleby here mrs wititterly tossed her headnot passionately only virtuouslyand remarked with some appearance of excitement that she feared that palpitation of the heart was coming on again  your behaviour miss nickleby resumed the lady is very far from pleasing mevery far i am very anxious indeed that you should do well but you may depend upon it miss nickleby you will not if you go on as you do  maam exclaimed kate proudly  dont agitate me by speaking in that way miss nickleby dont said mrs wititterly with some violence or youll compel me to ring the bell  kate looked at her but said nothing  you neednt suppose resumed mrs wititterly that your looking at me in that way miss nickleby will prevent my saying what i am going to say which i feel to be a religious duty you neednt direct your glances towards me said mrs wititterly with a sudden burst of spite i am not sir mulberry no nor lord frederick verisopht miss nickleby nor am i mr pyke nor mr pluck either  kate looked at her again but less steadily than before and resting her elbow on the table covered her eyes with her hand  if such things had been done when i was a young girl said mrs wititterly this by the way must have been some little time before i dont suppose anybody would have believed it  i dont think they would murmured kate i do not think anybody would believe without actually knowing it what i seem doomed to undergo  dont talk to me of being doomed to undergo miss nickleby if you please said mrs wititterly with a shrillness of tone quite surprising in so great an invalid i will not be answered miss nickleby i am not accustomed to be answered nor will i permit it for an instant do you hear she added waiting with some apparent inconsistency for an answer  i do hear you maam replied kate with surprisewith greater surprise than i can express  i have always considered you a particularly wellbehaved young person for your station in life said mrs wititterly and as you are a person of healthy appearance and neat in your dress and so forth i have taken an interest in you as i do still considering that i owe a sort of duty to that respectable old female your mother for these reasons miss nickleby i must tell you once for all and begging you to mind what i say that i must insist upon your immediately altering your very forward behaviour to the gentleman who visit at this house it really is not becoming said mrs wititterly closing her chaste eyes as she spoke it is improperquite improper  oh cried kate looking upwards and clasping her hands is not this is not this too cruel too hard to bear is it not enough that i should have suffered as i have night and day that i should almost have sunk in my own estimation from very shame of having been brought into contact with such people but must i also be exposed to this unjust and most unfounded charge  you will have the goodness to recollect miss nickleby said mrs wititterly that when you use such terms as unjust and unfounded you charge me in effect with stating that which is untrue  i do said kate with honest indignation whether you make this accusation of yourself or at the prompting of others is alike to me i say it is vilely grossly wilfully untrue is it possible cried kate that anyone of my own sex can have sat by and not have seen the misery these men have caused me is it possible that you maam can have been present and failed to mark the insulting freedom that their every look bespoke is it possible that you can have avoided seeing that these libertines in their utter disrespect for you and utter disregard of all gentlemanly behaviour and almost of decency have had but one object in introducing themselves here and that the furtherance of their designs upon a friendless helpless girl who without this humiliating confession might have hoped to receive from one so much her senior something like womanly aid and sympathy i do noti cannot believe it  if poor kate had possessed the slightest knowledge of the world she certainly would not have ventured even in the excitement into which she had been lashed upon such an injudicious speech as this its effect was precisely what a more experienced observer would have foreseen mrs wititterly received the attack upon her veracity with exemplary calmness and listened with the most heroic fortitude to kates account of her own sufferings but allusion being made to her being held in disregard by the gentlemen she evinced violent emotion and this blow was no sooner followed up by the remark concerning her seniority than she fell back upon the sofa uttering dismal screams  what is the matter cried mr wititterly bouncing into the room heavens what do i see julia julia look up my life look up  but julia looked down most perseveringly and screamed still louder so mr wititterly rang the bell and danced in a frenzied manner round the sofa on which mrs wititterly lay uttering perpetual cries for sir tumley snuffim and never once leaving off to ask for any explanation of the scene before him  run for sir tumley cried mr wititterly menacing the page with both fists i knew it miss nickleby he said looking round with an air of melancholy triumph that society has been too much for her this is all soul you know every bit of it with this assurance mr wititterly took up the prostrate form of mrs wititterly and carried her bodily off to bed  kate waited until sir tumley snuffim had paid his visit and looked in with a report that through the special interposition of a merciful providence thus spake sir tumley mrs wititterly had gone to sleep she then hastily attired herself for walking and leaving word that she should return within a couple of hours hurried away towards her uncles house  it had been a good day with ralph nicklebyquite a lucky day and as he walked to and fro in his little backroom with his hands clasped behind him adding up in his own mind all the sums that had been or would be netted from the business done since morning his mouth was drawn into a hard stern smile while the firmness of the lines and curves that made it up as well as the cunning glance of his cold bright eye seemed to tell that if any resolution or cunning would increase the profits they would not fail to be excited for the purpose  very good said ralph in allusion no doubt to some proceeding of the day he defies the usurer does he well we shall see honesty is the best policy is it well try that too  he stopped and then walked on again  he is content said ralph relaxing into a smile to set his known character and conduct against the power of moneydross as he calls it why what a dull blockhead this fellow must be dross to dross whos that  me said newman noggs looking in your niece  what of her asked ralph sharply  shes here  here  newman jerked his head towards his little room to signify that she was waiting there  what does she want asked ralph  i dont know rejoined newman shall i ask he added quickly  no replied ralph show her in stay he hastily put away a padlocked cashbox that was on the table and substituted in its stead an empty purse there said ralph now she may come in  newman with a grim smile at this manoeuvre beckoned the young lady to advance and having placed a chair for her retired looking stealthily over his shoulder at ralph as he limped slowly out  well said ralph roughly enough but still with something more of kindness in his manner than he would have exhibited towards anybody else well mydear what now  kate raised her eyes which were filled with tears and with an effort to master her emotion strove to speak but in vain so drooping her head again she remained silent her face was hidden from his view but ralph could see that she was weeping  i can guess the cause of this thought ralph after looking at her for some time in silence i cani canguess the cause well well thought ralphfor the moment quite disconcerted as he watched the anguish of his beautiful niece where is the harm only a few tears and its an excellent lesson for her an excellent lesson  what is the matter asked ralph drawing a chair opposite and sitting down  he was rather taken aback by the sudden firmness with which kate looked up and answered him  the matter which brings me to you sir she said is one which should call the blood up into your cheeks and make you burn to hear as it does me to tell i have been wronged my feelings have been outraged insulted wounded past all healing and by your friends  friends cried ralph sternly i have no friends girl  by the men i saw here then returned kate quickly if they were no friends of yours and you knew what they wereoh the more shame on you uncle for bringing me among them to have subjected me to what i was exposed to here through any misplaced confidence or imperfect knowledge of your guests would have required some strong excuse but if you did itas i now believe you didknowing them well it was most dastardly and cruel  ralph drew back in utter amazement at this plain speaking and regarded kate with the sternest look but she met his gaze proudly and firmly and although her face was very pale it looked more noble and handsome lighted up as it was than it had ever appeared before  there is some of that boys blood in you i see said ralph speaking in his harshest tones as something in the flashing eye reminded him of nicholas at their last meeting  i hope there is replied kate i should be proud to know it i am young uncle and all the difficulties and miseries of my situation have kept it down but i have been roused today beyond all endurance and come what may i will not as i am your brothers child bear these insults longer  what insults girl demanded ralph sharply  remember what took place here and ask yourself replied kate colouring deeply uncle you musti am sure you willrelease me from such vile and degrading companionship as i am exposed to now i do not mean said kate hurrying to the old man and laying her arm upon his shoulder i do not mean to be angry and violenti beg your pardon if i have seemed so dear unclebut you do not know what i have suffered you do not indeed you cannot tell what the heart of a young girl isi have no right to expect you should but when i tell you that i am wretched and that my heart is breaking i am sure you will help me i am sure i am sure you will  ralph looked at her for an instant then turned away his head and beat his foot nervously upon the ground  i have gone on day after day said kate bending over him and timidly placing her little hand in his in the hope that this persecution would cease i have gone on day after day compelled to assume the appearance of cheerfulness when i was most unhappy i have had no counsellor no adviser no one to protect me mama supposes that these are honourable men rich and distinguished and how can ihow can i undeceive herwhen she is so happy in these little delusions which are the only happiness she has the lady with whom you placed me is not the person to whom i could confide matters of so much delicacy and i have come at last to you the only friend i have at handalmost the only friend i have at allto entreat and implore you to assist me  how can i assist you child said ralph rising from his chair and pacing up and down the room in his old attitude  you have influence with one of these men i know rejoined kate emphatically would not a word from you induce them to desist from this unmanly course  no said ralph suddenly turning at leastthati cant say it if it would  cant say it  no said ralph coming to a dead stop and clasping his hands more tightly behind him i cant say it  kate fell back a step or two and looked at him as if in doubt whether she had heard aright  we are connected in business said ralph poising himself alternately on his toes and heels and looking coolly in his nieces face in business and i cant afford to offend them what is it after all we have all our trials and this is one of yours some girls would be proud to have such gallants at their feet  proud cried kate  i dont say rejoined ralph raising his forefinger but that you do right to despise them no you show your good sense in that as indeed i knew from the first you would well in all other respects you are comfortably bestowed its not much to bear if this young lord does dog your footsteps and whisper his drivelling inanities in your ears what of it its a dishonourable passion so be it it wont last long some other novelty will spring up one day and you will be released in the mean time  in the mean time interrupted kate with becoming pride and indignation i am to be the scorn of my own sex and the toy of the other justly condemned by all women of right feeling and despised by all honest and honourable men sunken in my own esteem and degraded in every eye that looks upon me no not if i work my fingers to the bone not if i am driven to the roughest and hardest labour do not mistake me i will not disgrace your recommendation i will remain in the house in which it placed me until i am entitled to leave it by the terms of my engagement though mind i see these men no more when i quit it i will hide myself from them and you and striving to support my mother by hard service i will live at least in peace and trust in god to help me  with these words she waved her hand and quitted the room leaving ralph nickleby motionless as a statue  the surprise with which kate as she closed the roomdoor beheld close beside it newman noggs standing bolt upright in a little niche in the wall like some scarecrow or guy faux laid up in winter quarters almost occasioned her to call aloud but newman laying his finger upon his lips she had the presence of mind to refrain  dont said newman gliding out of his recess and accompanying her across the hall dont cry dont cry two very large tears bythebye were running down newmans face as he spoke  i see how it is said poor noggs drawing from his pocket what seemed to be a very old duster and wiping kates eyes with it as gently as if she were an infant youre giving way now yes yes very good thats right i like that it was right not to give way before him yes yes ha ha ha oh yes poor thing  with these disjointed exclamations newman wiped his own eyes with the aforementioned duster and limping to the streetdoor opened it to let her out  dont cry any more whispered newman i shall see you soon ha ha ha and so shall somebody else too yes yes ho ho  god bless you answered kate hurrying out god bless you  same to you rejoined newman opening the door again a little way to say so ha ha ha ho ho ho  and newman noggs opened the door once again to nod cheerfully and laughand shut it to shake his head mournfully and cry  ralph remained in the same attitude till he heard the noise of the closing door when he shrugged his shoulders and after a few turns about the roomhasty at first but gradually becoming slower as he relapsed into himselfsat down before his desk  it is one of those problems of human nature which may be noted down but not solvedalthough ralph felt no remorse at that moment for his conduct towards the innocent truehearted girl although his libertine clients had done precisely what he had expected precisely what he most wished and precisely what would tend most to his advantage still he hated them for doing it from the very bottom of his soul  ugh said ralph scowling round and shaking his clenched hand as the faces of the two profligates rose up before his mind you shall pay for this oh you shall pay for this  as the usurer turned for consolation to his books and papers a performance was going on outside his office door which would have occasioned him no small surprise if he could by any means have become acquainted with it  newman noggs was the sole actor he stood at a little distance from the door with his face towards it and with the sleeves of his coat turned back at the wrists was occupied in bestowing the most vigorous scientific and straightforward blows upon the empty air  at first sight this would have appeared merely a wise precaution in a man of sedentary habits with the view of opening the chest and strengthening the muscles of the arms but the intense eagerness and joy depicted in the face of newman noggs which was suffused with perspiration the surprising energy with which he directed a constant succession of blows towards a particular panel about five feet eight from the ground and still worked away in the most untiring and persevering manner would have sufficiently explained to the attentive observer that his imagination was thrashing to within an inch of his life his bodys most active employer mr ralph nickleby    chapter 29  of the proceedings of nicholas and certain internal divisions in the company of mr vincent crummles   the unexpected success and favour with which his experiment at portsmouth had been received induced mr crummles to prolong his stay in that town for a fortnight beyond the period he had originally assigned for the duration of his visit during which time nicholas personated a vast variety of characters with undiminished success and attracted so many people to the theatre who had never been seen there before that a benefit was considered by the manager a very promising speculation nicholas assenting to the terms proposed the benefit was had and by it he realised no less a sum than twenty pounds  possessed of this unexpected wealth his first act was to enclose to honest john browdie the amount of his friendly loan which he accompanied with many expressions of gratitude and esteem and many cordial wishes for his matrimonial happiness to newman noggs he forwarded one half of the sum he had realised entreating him to take an opportunity of handing it to kate in secret and conveying to her the warmest assurances of his love and affection he made no mention of the way in which he had employed himself merely informing newman that a letter addressed to him under his assumed name at the post office portsmouth would readily find him and entreating that worthy friend to write full particulars of the situation of his mother and sister and an account of all the grand things that ralph nickleby had done for them since his departure from london  you are out of spirits said smike on the night after the letter had been dispatched  not i rejoined nicholas with assumed gaiety for the confession would have made the boy miserable all night i was thinking about my sister smike  sister  ay  is she like you inquired smike  why so they say replied nicholas laughing only a great deal handsomer  she must be very beautiful said smike after thinking a little while with his hands folded together and his eyes bent upon his friend  anybody who didnt know you as well as i do my dear fellow would say you were an accomplished courtier said nicholas  i dont even know what that is replied smike shaking his head shall i ever see your sister  to be sure cried nicholas we shall all be together one of these dayswhen we are rich smike  how is it that you who are so kind and good to me have nobody to be kind to you asked smike i cannot make that out  why it is a long story replied nicholas and one you would have some difficulty in comprehending i fear i have an enemyyou understand what that is  oh yes i understand that said smike  well it is owing to him returned nicholas he is rich and not so easily punished as your old enemy mr squeers he is my uncle but he is a villain and has done me wrong  has he though asked smike bending eagerly forward what is his name tell me his name  ralphralph nickleby  ralph nickleby repeated smike ralph ill get that name by heart  he had muttered it over to himself some twenty times when a loud knock at the door disturbed him from his occupation before he could open it mr folair the pantomimist thrust in his head  mr folairs head was usually decorated with a very round hat unusually high in the crown and curled up quite tight in the brims on the present occasion he wore it very much on one side with the back part forward in consequence of its being the least rusty round his neck he wore a flaming red worsted comforter whereof the straggling ends peeped out beneath his threadbare newmarket coat which was very tight and buttoned all the way up he carried in his hand one very dirty glove and a cheap dress cane with a glass handle in short his whole appearance was unusually dashing and demonstrated a far more scrupulous attention to his toilet than he was in the habit of bestowing upon it  goodevening sir said mr folair taking off the tall hat and running his fingers through his hair i bring a communication hem  from whom and what about inquired nicholas you are unusually mysterious tonight  cold perhaps returned mr folair cold perhaps that is the fault of my positionnot of myself mr johnson my position as a mutual friend requires it sir mr folair paused with a most impressive look and diving into the hat before noticed drew from thence a small piece of whitybrown paper curiously folded whence he brought forth a note which it had served to keep clean and handing it over to nicholas said  have the goodness to read that sir  nicholas in a state of much amazement took the note and broke the seal glancing at mr folair as he did so who knitting his brow and pursing up his mouth with great dignity was sitting with his eyes steadily fixed upon the ceiling  it was directed to blank johnson esq by favour of augustus folair esq and the astonishment of nicholas was in no degree lessened when he found it to be couched in the following laconic terms  mr lenville presents his kind regards to mr johnson and will feel obliged if he will inform him at what hour tomorrow morning it will be most convenient to him to meet mr l at the theatre for the purpose of having his nose pulled in the presence of the company  mr lenville requests mr johnson not to neglect making an appointment as he has invited two or three professional friends to witness the ceremony and cannot disappoint them upon any account whatever  portsmouth tuesday night  indignant as he was at this impertinence there was something so exquisitely absurd in such a cartel of defiance that nicholas was obliged to bite his lip and read the note over two or three times before he could muster sufficient gravity and sternness to address the hostile messenger who had not taken his eyes from the ceiling nor altered the expression of his face in the slightest degree  do you know the contents of this note sir he asked at length  yes rejoined mr folair looking round for an instant and immediately carrying his eyes back again to the ceiling  and how dare you bring it here sir asked nicholas tearing it into very little pieces and jerking it in a shower towards the messenger had you no fear of being kicked downstairs sir  mr folair turned his headnow ornamented with several fragments of the notetowards nicholas and with the same imperturbable dignity briefly replied no  then said nicholas taking up the tall hat and tossing it towards the door you had better follow that article of your dress sir or you may find yourself very disagreeably deceived and that within a dozen seconds  i say johnson remonstrated mr folair suddenly losing all his dignity none of that you know no tricks with a gentlemans wardrobe  leave the room returned nicholas how could you presume to come here on such an errand you scoundrel  pooh pooh said mr folair unwinding his comforter and gradually getting himself out of it therethats enough  enough cried nicholas advancing towards him take yourself off sir  pooh pooh i tell you returned mr folair waving his hand in deprecation of any further wrath i wasnt in earnest i only brought it in joke  you had better be careful how you indulge in such jokes again said nicholas or you may find an allusion to pulling noses rather a dangerous reminder for the subject of your facetiousness was it written in joke too pray  no no thats the best of it returned the actor right down earnesthonour bright  nicholas could not repress a smile at the odd figure before him which at all times more calculated to provoke mirth than anger was especially so at that moment when with one knee upon the ground mr folair twirled his old hat round upon his hand and affected the extremest agony lest any of the nap should have been knocked offan ornament which it is almost superfluous to say it had not boasted for many months  come sir said nicholas laughing in spite of himself have the goodness to explain  why ill tell you how it is said mr folair sitting himself down in a chair with great coolness since you came here lenville has done nothing but second business and instead of having a reception every night as he used to have they have let him come on as if he was nobody  what do you mean by a reception asked nicholas  jupiter exclaimed mr folair what an unsophisticated shepherd you are johnson why applause from the house when you first come on so he has gone on night after night never getting a hand and you getting a couple of rounds at least and sometimes three till at length he got quite desperate and had half a mind last night to play tybalt with a real sword and pink younot dangerously but just enough to lay you up for a month or two  very considerate remarked nicholas  yes i think it was under the circumstances his professional reputation being at stake said mr folair quite seriously but his heart failed him and he cast about for some other way of annoying you and making himself popular at the same timefor thats the point notoriety notoriety is the thing bless you if he had pinked you said mr folair stopping to make a calculation in his mind it would have been worthah it would have been worth eight or ten shillings a week to him all the town would have come to see the actor who nearly killed a man by mistake i shouldnt wonder if it had got him an engagement in london however he was obliged to try some other mode of getting popular and this one occurred to him its clever idea really if you had shown the white feather and let him pull your nose hed have got it into the paper if you had sworn the peace against him it would have been in the paper too and hed have been just as much talked about as youdont you see  oh certainly rejoined nicholas but suppose i were to turn the tables and pull his nose what then would that make his fortune  why i dont think it would replied mr folair scratching his head because there wouldnt be any romance about it and he wouldnt be favourably known to tell you the truth though he didnt calculate much upon that for youre always so mildspoken and are so popular among the women that we didnt suspect you of showing fight if you did however he has a way of getting out of it easily depend upon that  has he rejoined nicholas we will try tomorrow morning in the meantime you can give whatever account of our interview you like best goodnight  as mr folair was pretty well known among his fellowactors for a man who delighted in mischief and was by no means scrupulous nicholas had not much doubt but that he had secretly prompted the tragedian in the course he had taken and moreover that he would have carried his mission with a very high hand if he had not been disconcerted by the very unexpected demonstrations with which it had been received it was not worth his while to be serious with him however so he dismissed the pantomimist with a gentle hint that if he offended again it would be under the penalty of a broken head and mr folair taking the caution in exceedingly good part walked away to confer with his principal and give such an account of his proceedings as he might think best calculated to carry on the joke  he had no doubt reported that nicholas was in a state of extreme bodily fear for when that young gentleman walked with much deliberation down to the theatre next morning at the usual hour he found all the company assembled in evident expectation and mr lenville with his severest stage face sitting majestically on a table whistling defiance  now the ladies were on the side of nicholas and the gentlemen being jealous were on the side of the disappointed tragedian so that the latter formed a little group about the redoubtable mr lenville and the former looked on at a little distance in some trepidation and anxiety on nicholas stopping to salute them mr lenville laughed a scornful laugh and made some general remark touching the natural history of puppies  oh said nicholas looking quietly round are you there  slave returned mr lenville flourishing his right arm and approaching nicholas with a theatrical stride but somehow he appeared just at that moment a little startled as if nicholas did not look quite so frightened as he had expected and came all at once to an awkward halt at which the assembled ladies burst into a shrill laugh  object of my scorn and hatred said mr lenville i hold ye in contempt  nicholas laughed in very unexpected enjoyment of this performance and the ladies by way of encouragement laughed louder than before whereat mr lenville assumed his bitterest smile and expressed his opinion that they were minions  but they shall not protect ye said the tragedian taking an upward look at nicholas beginning at his boots and ending at the crown of his head and then a downward one beginning at the crown of his head and ending at his bootswhich two looks as everybody knows express defiance on the stage they shall not protect yeboy  thus speaking mr lenville folded his arms and treated nicholas to that expression of face with which in melodramatic performances he was in the habit of regarding the tyrannical kings when they said away with him to the deepest dungeon beneath the castle moat and which accompanied with a little jingling of fetters had been known to produce great effects in its time  whether it was the absence of the fetters or not it made no very deep impression on mr lenvilles adversary however but rather seemed to increase the goodhumour expressed in his countenance in which stage of the contest one or two gentlemen who had come out expressly to witness the pulling of nicholass nose grew impatient murmuring that if it were to be done at all it had better be done at once and that if mr lenville didnt mean to do it he had better say so and not keep them waiting there thus urged the tragedian adjusted the cuff of his right coat sleeve for the performance of the operation and walked in a very stately manner up to nicholas who suffered him to approach to within the requisite distance and then without the smallest discomposure knocked him down  before the discomfited tragedian could raise his head from the boards mrs lenville who as has been before hinted was in an interesting state rushed from the rear rank of ladies and uttering a piercing scream threw herself upon the body  do you see this monster do you see this cried mr lenville sitting up and pointing to his prostrate lady who was holding him very tight round the waist  come said nicholas nodding his head apologise for the insolent note you wrote to me last night and waste no more time in talking  never cried mr lenville  yesyesyes screamed his wife for my sakefor mine lenvilleforego all idle forms unless you would see me a blighted corse at your feet  this is affecting said mr lenville looking round him and drawing the back of his hand across his eyes the ties of nature are strong the weak husband and the fatherthe father that is yet to berelents i apologise  humbly and submissively said nicholas  humbly and submissively returned the tragedian scowling upwards but only to save herfor a time will come  very good said nicholas i hope mrs lenville may have a good one and when it does come and you are a father you shall retract it if you have the courage there be careful sir to what lengths your jealousy carries you another time and be careful also before you venture too far to ascertain your rivals temper with this parting advice nicholas picked up mr lenvilles ash stick which had flown out of his hand and breaking it in half threw him the pieces and withdrew bowing slightly to the spectators as he walked out  the profoundest deference was paid to nicholas that night and the people who had been most anxious to have his nose pulled in the morning embraced occasions of taking him aside and telling him with great feeling how very friendly they took it that he should have treated that lenville so properly who was a most unbearable fellow and on whom they had all by a remarkable coincidence at one time or other contemplated the infliction of condign punishment which they had only been restrained from administering by considerations of mercy indeed to judge from the invariable termination of all these stories there never was such a charitable and kindhearted set of people as the male members of mr crummless company  nicholas bore his triumph as he had his success in the little world of the theatre with the utmost moderation and good humour the crestfallen mr lenville made an expiring effort to obtain revenge by sending a boy into the gallery to hiss but he fell a sacrifice to popular indignation and was promptly turned out without having his money back  well smike said nicholas when the first piece was over and he had almost finished dressing to go home is there any letter yet  yes replied smike i got this one from the postoffice  from newman noggs said nicholas casting his eye upon the cramped direction its no easy matter to make his writing out let me seelet me see  by dint of poring over the letter for half an hour he contrived to make himself master of the contents which were certainly not of a nature to set his mind at ease newman took upon himself to send back the ten pounds observing that he had ascertained that neither mrs nickleby nor kate was in actual want of money at the moment and that a time might shortly come when nicholas might want it more he entreated him not to be alarmed at what he was about to saythere was no bad newsthey were in good healthbut he thought circumstances might occur or were occurring which would render it absolutely necessary that kate should have her brothers protection and if so newman said he would write to him to that effect either by the next post or the next but one  nicholas read this passage very often and the more he thought of it the more he began to fear some treachery upon the part of ralph once or twice he felt tempted to repair to london at all hazards without an hours delay but a little reflection assured him that if such a step were necessary newman would have spoken out and told him so at once  at all events i should prepare them here for the possibility of my going away suddenly said nicholas i should lose no time in doing that as the thought occurred to him he took up his hat and hurried to the greenroom  well mr johnson said mrs crummles who was seated there in full regal costume with the phenomenon as the maiden in her maternal arms next week for ryde then for winchester then for  i have some reason to fear interrupted nicholas that before you leave here my career with you will have closed  closed cried mrs crummles raising her hands in astonishment  closed cried miss snevellicci trembling so much in her tights that she actually laid her hand upon the shoulder of the manageress for support  why he dont mean to say hes going exclaimed mrs grudden making her way towards mrs crummles hoity toity nonsense  the phenomenon being of an affectionate nature and moreover excitable raised a loud cry and miss belvawney and miss bravassa actually shed tears even the male performers stopped in their conversation and echoed the word going although some among them and they had been the loudest in their congratulations that day winked at each other as though they would not be sorry to lose such a favoured rival an opinion indeed which the honest mr folair who was ready dressed for the savage openly stated in so many words to a demon with whom he was sharing a pot of porter  nicholas briefly said that he feared it would be so although he could not yet speak with any degree of certainty and getting away as soon as he could went home to con newmans letter once more and speculate upon it afresh  how trifling all that had been occupying his time and thoughts for many weeks seemed to him during that sleepless night and how constantly and incessantly present to his imagination was the one idea that kate in the midst of some great trouble and distress might even then be lookingand vainly toofor him    chapter 30  festivities are held in honour of nicholas who suddenly withdraws himself from the society of mr vincent crummles and his theatrical companions   mr vincent crummles was no sooner acquainted with the public announcement which nicholas had made relative to the probability of his shortly ceasing to be a member of the company than he evinced many tokens of grief and consternation and in the extremity of his despair even held out certain vague promises of a speedy improvement not only in the amount of his regular salary but also in the contingent emoluments appertaining to his authorship finding nicholas bent upon quitting the societyfor he had now determined that even if no further tidings came from newman he would at all hazards ease his mind by repairing to london and ascertaining the exact position of his sistermr crummles was fain to content himself by calculating the chances of his coming back again and taking prompt and energetic measures to make the most of him before he went away  let me see said mr crummles taking off his outlaws wig the better to arrive at a coolheaded view of the whole case let me see this is wednesday night well have posters out the first thing in the morning announcing positively your last appearance for tomorrow  but perhaps it may not be my last appearance you know said nicholas unless i am summoned away i should be sorry to inconvenience you by leaving before the end of the week  so much the better returned mr crummles we can have positively your last appearance on thursdayreengagement for one night more on fridayand yielding to the wishes of numerous influential patrons who were disappointed in obtaining seats on saturday that ought to bring three very decent houses  then i am to make three last appearances am i inquired nicholas smiling  yes rejoined the manager scratching his head with an air of some vexation three is not enough and its very bungling and irregular not to have more but if we cant help it we cant so theres no use in talking a novelty would be very desirable you couldnt sing a comic song on the ponys back could you  no replied nicholas i couldnt indeed  it has drawn money before now said mr crummles with a look of disappointment what do you think of a brilliant display of fireworks  that it would be rather expensive replied nicholas drily  eighteenpence would do it said mr crummles you on the top of a pair of steps with the phenomenon in an attitude farewell on a transparency behind and nine people at the wings with a squib in each handall the dozen and a half going off at onceit would be very grandawful from the front quite awful  as nicholas appeared by no means impressed with the solemnity of the proposed effect but on the contrary received the proposition in a most irreverent manner and laughed at it very heartily mr crummles abandoned the project in its birth and gloomily observed that they must make up the best bill they could with combats and hornpipes and so stick to the legitimate drama  for the purpose of carrying this object into instant execution the manager at once repaired to a small dressingroom adjacent where mrs crummles was then occupied in exchanging the habiliments of a melodramatic empress for the ordinary attire of matrons in the nineteenth century and with the assistance of this lady and the accomplished mrs grudden who had quite a genius for making out bills being a great hand at throwing in the notes of admiration and knowing from long experience exactly where the largest capitals ought to go he seriously applied himself to the composition of the poster  heigho sighed nicholas as he threw himself back in the prompters chair after telegraphing the needful directions to smike who had been playing a meagre tailor in the interlude with one skirt to his coat and a little pockethandkerchief with a large hole in it and a woollen nightcap and a red nose and other distinctive marks peculiar to tailors on the stage heigho i wish all this were over  over mr johnson repeated a female voice behind him in a kind of plaintive surprise  it was an ungallant speech certainly said nicholas looking up to see who the speaker was and recognising miss snevellicci i would not have made it if i had known you had been within hearing  what a dear that mr digby is said miss snevellicci as the tailor went off on the opposite side at the end of the piece with great applause smikes theatrical name was digby  ill tell him presently for his gratification that you said so returned nicholas  oh you naughty thing rejoined miss snevellicci i dont know though that i should much mind his knowing my opinion of him with some other people indeed it might be here miss snevellicci stopped as though waiting to be questioned but no questioning came for nicholas was thinking about more serious matters  how kind it is of you resumed miss snevellicci after a short silence to sit waiting here for him night after night night after night no matter how tired you are and taking so much pains with him and doing it all with as much delight and readiness as if you were coining gold by it  he well deserves all the kindness i can show him and a great deal more said nicholas he is the most grateful singlehearted affectionate creature that ever breathed  so odd too remarked miss snevellicci isnt he  god help him and those who have made him so he is indeed rejoined nicholas shaking his head  he is such a devilish close chap said mr folair who had come up a little before and now joined in the conversation nobody can ever get anything out of him  what should they get out of him asked nicholas turning round with some abruptness  zooks what a fireeater you are johnson returned mr folair pulling up the heel of his dancing shoe im only talking of the natural curiosity of the people here to know what he has been about all his life  poor fellow it is pretty plain i should think that he has not the intellect to have been about anything of much importance to them or anybody else said nicholas  ay rejoined the actor contemplating the effect of his face in a lamp reflector but that involves the whole question you know  what question asked nicholas  why the who he is and what he is and how you two who are so different came to be such close companions replied mr folair delighted with the opportunity of saying something disagreeable thats in everybodys mouth  the everybody of the theatre i suppose said nicholas contemptuously  in it and out of it too replied the actor why you know lenville says  i thought i had silenced him effectually interrupted nicholas reddening  perhaps you have rejoined the immovable mr folair if you have he said this before he was silenced lenville says that youre a regular stick of an actor and that its only the mystery about you that has caused you to go down with the people here and that crummles keeps it up for his own sake though lenville says he dont believe theres anything at all in it except your having got into a scrape and run away from somewhere for doing something or other  oh said nicholas forcing a smile  thats a part of what he says added mr folair i mention it as the friend of both parties and in strict confidence i dont agree with him you know he says he takes digby to be more knave than fool and old fluggers who does the heavy business you know he says that when he delivered messages at covent garden the season before last there used to be a pickpocket hovering about the coachstand who had exactly the face of digby though as he very properly says digby may not be the same but only his brother or some near relation  oh cried nicholas again  yes said mr folair with undisturbed calmness thats what they say i thought id tell you because really you ought to know oh heres this blessed phenomenon at last ugh you little imposition i should like toquite ready my darlinghumbugring up mrs g and let the favourite wake em  uttering in a loud voice such of the latter allusions as were complimentary to the unconscious phenomenon and giving the rest in a confidential aside to nicholas mr folair followed the ascent of the curtain with his eyes regarded with a sneer the reception of miss crummles as the maiden and falling back a step or two to advance with the better effect uttered a preliminary howl and went on chattering his teeth and brandishing his tin tomahawk as the indian savage  so these are some of the stories they invent about us and bandy from mouth to mouth thought nicholas if a man would commit an inexpiable offence against any society large or small let him be successful they will forgive him any crime but that  you surely dont mind what that malicious creature says mr johnson observed miss snevellicci in her most winning tones  not i replied nicholas if i were going to remain here i might think it worth my while to embroil myself as it is let them talk till they are hoarse but here added nicholas as smike approached here comes the subject of a portion of their goodnature so let he and i say good night together  no i will not let either of you say anything of the kind returned miss snevellicci you must come home and see mama who only came to portsmouth today and is dying to behold you led my dear persuade mr johnson  oh im sure returned miss ledrook with considerable vivacity if you cant persuade him miss ledrook said no more but intimated by a dexterous playfulness that if miss snevellicci couldnt persuade him nobody could  mr and mrs lillyvick have taken lodgings in our house and share our sittingroom for the present said miss snevellicci wont that induce you  surely returned nicholas i can require no possible inducement beyond your invitation  oh no i dare say rejoined miss snevellicci and miss ledrook said upon my word upon which miss snevellicci said that miss ledrook was a giddy thing and miss ledrook said that miss snevellicci neednt colour up quite so much and miss snevellicci beat miss ledrook and miss ledrook beat miss snevellicci  come said miss ledrook its high time we were there or we shall have poor mrs snevellicci thinking that you have run away with her daughter mr johnson and then we should have a pretty todo  my dear led remonstrated miss snevellicci how you do talk  miss ledrook made no answer but taking smikes arm in hers left her friend and nicholas to follow at their pleasure which it pleased them or rather pleased nicholas who had no great fancy for a teteatete under the circumstances to do at once  there were not wanting matters of conversation when they reached the street for it turned out that miss snevellicci had a small basket to carry home and miss ledrook a small bandbox both containing such minor articles of theatrical costume as the lady performers usually carried to and fro every evening nicholas would insist upon carrying the basket and miss snevellicci would insist upon carrying it herself which gave rise to a struggle in which nicholas captured the basket and the bandbox likewise then nicholas said that he wondered what could possibly be inside the basket and attempted to peep in whereat miss snevellicci screamed and declared that if she thought he had seen she was sure she should faint away this declaration was followed by a similar attempt on the bandbox and similar demonstrations on the part of miss ledrook and then both ladies vowed that they wouldnt move a step further until nicholas had promised that he wouldnt offer to peep again at last nicholas pledged himself to betray no further curiosity and they walked on both ladies giggling very much and declaring that they never had seen such a wicked creature in all their born daysnever  lightening the way with such pleasantry as this they arrived at the tailors house in no time and here they made quite a little party there being present besides mr lillyvick and mrs lillyvick not only miss snevelliccis mama but her papa also and an uncommonly fine man miss snevelliccis papa was with a hook nose and a white forehead and curly black hair and high cheek bones and altogether quite a handsome face only a little pimply as though with drinking he had a very broad chest had miss snevelliccis papa and he wore a threadbare blue dresscoat buttoned with gilt buttons tight across it and he no sooner saw nicholas come into the room than he whipped the two forefingers of his right hand in between the two centre buttons and sticking his other arm gracefully akimbo seemed to say now here i am my buck and what have you got to say to me  such was and in such an attitude sat miss snevelliccis papa who had been in the profession ever since he had first played the tenyearold imps in the christmas pantomimes who could sing a little dance a little fence a little act a little and do everything a little but not much who had been sometimes in the ballet and sometimes in the chorus at every theatre in london who was always selected in virtue of his figure to play the military visitors and the speechless noblemen who always wore a smart dress and came on arminarm with a smart lady in short petticoatsand always did it too with such an air that people in the pit had been several times known to cry out bravo under the impression that he was somebody such was miss snevelliccis papa upon whom some envious persons cast the imputation that he occasionally beat miss snevelliccis mama who was still a dancer with a neat little figure and some remains of good looks and who now sat as she dancedbeing rather too old for the full glare of the footlightsin the background  to these good people nicholas was presented with much formality the introduction being completed miss snevelliccis papa who was scented with rumandwater said that he was delighted to make the acquaintance of a gentleman so highly talented and furthermore remarked that there hadnt been such a hit madeno not since the first appearance of his friend mr glavormelly at the coburg  you have seen him sir said miss snevelliccis papa  no really i never did replied nicholas  you never saw my friend glavormelly sir said miss snevelliccis papa then you have never seen acting yet if he had lived  oh he is dead is he interrupted nicholas  he is said mr snevellicci but he isnt in westminster abbey mores the shame he was a well no matter he is gone to that bourne from whence no traveller returns i hope he is appreciated there  so saying miss snevelliccis papa rubbed the tip of his nose with a very yellow silk handkerchief and gave the company to understand that these recollections overcame him  well mr lillyvick said nicholas and how are you  quite well sir replied the collector there is nothing like the married state sir depend upon it  indeed said nicholas laughing  ah nothing like it sir replied mr lillyvick solemnly how do you think whispered the collector drawing him aside how do you think she looks tonight  as handsome as ever replied nicholas glancing at the late miss petowker  why theres air about her sir whispered the collector that i never saw in anybody look at her now she moves to put the kettle on there isnt it fascination sir  youre a lucky man said nicholas  ha ha ha rejoined the collector no do you think i am though eh perhaps i may be perhaps i may be i say i couldnt have done much better if i had been a young man could i you couldnt have done much better yourself could youehcould you with such inquires and many more such mr lillyvick jerked his elbow into nicholass side and chuckled till his face became quite purple in the attempt to keep down his satisfaction  by this time the cloth had been laid under the joint superintendence of all the ladies upon two tables put together one being high and narrow and the other low and broad there were oysters at the top sausages at the bottom a pair of snuffers in the centre and baked potatoes wherever it was most convenient to put them two additional chairs were brought in from the bedroom miss snevellicci sat at the head of the table and mr lillyvick at the foot and nicholas had not only the honour of sitting next miss snevellicci but of having miss snevelliccis mama on his right hand and miss snevelliccis papa over the way in short he was the hero of the feast and when the table was cleared and something warm introduced miss snevelliccis papa got up and proposed his health in a speech containing such affecting allusions to his coming departure that miss snevellicci wept and was compelled to retire into the bedroom  hush dont take any notice of it said miss ledrook peeping in from the bedroom say when she comes back that she exerts herself too much  miss ledrook eked out this speech with so many mysterious nods and frowns before she shut the door again that a profound silence came upon all the company during which miss snevelliccis papa looked very big indeedseveral sizes larger than lifeat everybody in turn but particularly at nicholas and kept on perpetually emptying his tumbler and filling it again until the ladies returned in a cluster with miss snevellicci among them  you neednt alarm yourself a bit mr snevellicci said mrs lillyvick she is only a little weak and nervous she has been so ever since the morning  oh said mr snevellicci thats all is it  oh yes thats all dont make a fuss about it cried all the ladies together  now this was not exactly the kind of reply suited to mr snevelliccis importance as a man and a father so he picked out the unfortunate mrs snevellicci and asked her what the devil she meant by talking to him in that way  dear me my dear said mrs snevellicci  dont call me your dear maam said mr snevellicci if you please  pray pa dont interposed miss snevellicci  dont what my child  talk in that way  why not said mr snevellicci i hope you dont suppose theres anybody here who is to prevent my talking as i like  nobody wants to pa rejoined his daughter  nobody would if they did want to said mr snevellicci i am not ashamed of myself snevellicci is my name im to be found in broad court bow street when im in town if im not at home let any man ask for me at the stagedoor damme they know me at the stagedoor i suppose most men have seen my portrait at the cigar shop round the corner ive been mentioned in the newspapers before now havent i talk ill tell you what if i found out that any man had been tampering with the affections of my daughter i wouldnt talk id astonish him without talking thats my way  so saying mr snevellicci struck the palm of his left hand three smart blows with his clenched fist pulled a phantom nose with his right thumb and forefinger and swallowed another glassful at a draught thats my way repeated mr snevellicci  most public characters have their failings and the truth is that mr snevellicci was a little addicted to drinking or if the whole truth must be told that he was scarcely ever sober he knew in his cups three distinct stages of intoxicationthe dignifiedthe quarrelsomethe amorous when professionally engaged he never got beyond the dignified in private circles he went through all three passing from one to another with a rapidity of transition often rather perplexing to those who had not the honour of his acquaintance  thus mr snevellicci had no sooner swallowed another glassful than he smiled upon all present in happy forgetfulness of having exhibited symptoms of pugnacity and proposed the ladies bless their hearts in a most vivacious manner  i love em said mr snevellicci looking round the table i love em every one  not every one reasoned mr lillyvick mildly  yes every one repeated mr snevellicci  that would include the married ladies you know said mr lillyvick  i love them too sir said mr snevellicci  the collector looked into the surrounding faces with an aspect of grave astonishment seeming to say this is a nice man and appeared a little surprised that mrs lillyvicks manner yielded no evidences of horror and indignation  one good turn deserves another said mr snevellicci i love them and they love me and as if this avowal were not made in sufficient disregard and defiance of all moral obligations what did mr snevellicci do he winkedwinked openly and undisguisedly winked with his right eyeupon henrietta lillyvick  the collector fell back in his chair in the intensity of his astonishment if anybody had winked at her as henrietta petowker it would have been indecorous in the last degree but as mrs lillyvick while he thought of it in a cold perspiration and wondered whether it was possible that he could be dreaming mr snevellicci repeated the wink and drinking to mrs lillyvick in dumb show actually blew her a kiss mr lillyvick left his chair walked straight up to the other end of the table and fell upon himliterally fell upon himinstantaneously mr lillyvick was no light weight and consequently when he fell upon mr snevellicci mr snevellicci fell under the table mr lillyvick followed him and the ladies screamed  what is the matter with the men are they mad cried nicholas diving under the table dragging up the collector by main force and thrusting him all doubled up into a chair as if he had been a stuffed figure what do you mean to do what do you want to do what is the matter with you  while nicholas raised up the collector smike had performed the same office for mr snevellicci who now regarded his late adversary in tipsy amazement  look here sir replied mr lillyvick pointing to his astonished wife here is purity and elegance combined whose feelings have been outragedviolated sir  lor what nonsense he talks exclaimed mrs lillyvick in answer to the inquiring look of nicholas nobody has said anything to me  said henrietta cried the collector didnt i see him mr lillyvick couldnt bring himself to utter the word but he counterfeited the motion of the eye  well cried mrs lillyvick do you suppose nobody is ever to look at me a pretty thing to be married indeed if that was law  you didnt mind it cried the collector  mind it repeated mrs lillyvick contemptuously you ought to go down on your knees and beg everybodys pardon that you ought  pardon my dear said the dismayed collector  yes and mine first replied mrs lillyvick do you suppose i aint the best judge of whats proper and whats improper  to be sure cried all the ladies do you suppose we shouldnt be the first to speak if there was anything that ought to be taken notice of  do you suppose they dont know sir said miss snevelliccis papa pulling up his collar and muttering something about a punching of heads and being only withheld by considerations of age with which miss snevelliccis papa looked steadily and sternly at mr lillyvick for some seconds and then rising deliberately from his chair kissed the ladies all round beginning with mrs lillyvick  the unhappy collector looked piteously at his wife as if to see whether there was any one trait of miss petowker left in mrs lillyvick and finding too surely that there was not begged pardon of all the company with great humility and sat down such a crestfallen dispirited disenchanted man that despite all his selfishness and dotage he was quite an object of compassion  miss snevelliccis papa being greatly exalted by this triumph and incontestable proof of his popularity with the fair sex quickly grew convivial not to say uproarious volunteering more than one song of no inconsiderable length and regaling the social circle betweenwhiles with recollections of divers splendid women who had been supposed to entertain a passion for himself several of whom he toasted by name taking occasion to remark at the same time that if he had been a little more alive to his own interest he might have been rolling at that moment in his chariotandfour these reminiscences appeared to awaken no very torturing pangs in the breast of mrs snevellicci who was sufficiently occupied in descanting to nicholas upon the manifold accomplishments and merits of her daughter nor was the young lady herself at all behindhand in displaying her choicest allurements but these heightened as they were by the artifices of miss ledrook had no effect whatever in increasing the attentions of nicholas who with the precedent of miss squeers still fresh in his memory steadily resisted every fascination and placed so strict a guard upon his behaviour that when he had taken his leave the ladies were unanimous in pronouncing him quite a monster of insensibility  next day the posters appeared in due course and the public were informed in all the colours of the rainbow and in letters afflicted with every possible variation of spinal deformity how that mr johnson would have the honour of making his last appearance that evening and how that an early application for places was requested in consequence of the extraordinary overflow attendant on his performancesit being a remarkable fact in theatrical history but one long since established beyond dispute that it is a hopeless endeavour to attract people to a theatre unless they can be first brought to believe that they will never get into it  nicholas was somewhat at a loss on entering the theatre at night to account for the unusual perturbation and excitement visible in the countenances of all the company but he was not long in doubt as to the cause for before he could make any inquiry respecting it mr crummles approached and in an agitated tone of voice informed him that there was a london manager in the boxes  its the phenomenon depend upon it sir said crummles dragging nicholas to the little hole in the curtain that he might look through at the london manager i have not the smallest doubt its the fame of the phenomenonthats the man him in the greatcoat and no shirtcollar she shall have ten pound a week johnson she shall not appear on the london boards for a farthing less they shant engage her either unless they engage mrs crummles tootwenty pound a week for the pair or ill tell you what ill throw in myself and the two boys and they shall have the family for thirty i cant say fairer than that they must take us all if none of us will go without the others thats the way some of the london people do and it always answers thirty pound a weekits too cheap johnson its dirt cheap  nicholas replied that it certainly was and mr vincent crummles taking several huge pinches of snuff to compose his feelings hurried away to tell mrs crummles that he had quite settled the only terms that could be accepted and had resolved not to abate one single farthing  when everybody was dressed and the curtain went up the excitement occasioned by the presence of the london manager increased a thousandfold everybody happened to know that the london manager had come down specially to witness his or her own performance and all were in a flutter of anxiety and expectation some of those who were not on in the first scene hurried to the wings and there stretched their necks to have a peep at him others stole up into the two little private boxes over the stagedoors and from that position reconnoitred the london manager once the london manager was seen to smilehe smiled at the comic countrymans pretending to catch a bluebottle while mrs crummles was making her greatest effect very good my fine fellow said mr crummles shaking his fist at the comic countryman when he came off you leave this company next saturday night  in the same way everybody who was on the stage beheld no audience but one individual everybody played to the london manager when mr lenville in a sudden burst of passion called the emperor a miscreant and then biting his glove said but i must dissemble instead of looking gloomily at the boards and so waiting for his cue as is proper in such cases he kept his eye fixed upon the london manager when miss bravassa sang her song at her lover who according to custom stood ready to shake hands with her between the verses they looked not at each other but at the london manager mr crummles died point blank at him and when the two guards came in to take the body off after a very hard death it was seen to open its eyes and glance at the london manager at length the london manager was discovered to be asleep and shortly after that he woke up and went away whereupon all the company fell foul of the unhappy comic countryman declaring that his buffoonery was the sole cause and mr crummles said that he had put up with it a long time but that he really couldnt stand it any longer and therefore would feel obliged by his looking out for another engagement  all this was the occasion of much amusement to nicholas whose only feeling upon the subject was one of sincere satisfaction that the great man went away before he appeared he went through his part in the two last pieces as briskly as he could and having been received with unbounded favour and unprecedented applauseso said the bills for next day which had been printed an hour or two beforehe took smikes arm and walked home to bed  with the post next morning came a letter from newman noggs very inky very short very dirty very small and very mysterious urging nicholas to return to london instantly not to lose an instant to be there that night if possible  i will said nicholas heaven knows i have remained here for the best and sorely against my own will but even now i may have dallied too long what can have happened smike my good fellow heretake my purse put our things together and pay what little debts we owequick and we shall be in time for the morning coach i will only tell them that we are going and will return to you immediately  so saying he took his hat and hurrying away to the lodgings of mr crummles applied his hand to the knocker with such hearty goodwill that he awakened that gentleman who was still in bed and caused mr bulph the pilot to take his mornings pipe very nearly out of his mouth in the extremity of his surprise  the door being opened nicholas ran upstairs without any ceremony and bursting into the darkened sittingroom on the onepair front found that the two master crummleses had sprung out of the sofabedstead and were putting on their clothes with great rapidity under the impression that it was the middle of the night and the next house was on fire  before he could undeceive them mr crummles came down in a flannel gown and nightcap and to him nicholas briefly explained that circumstances had occurred which rendered it necessary for him to repair to london immediately  so goodbye said nicholas goodbye goodbye  he was halfway downstairs before mr crummles had sufficiently recovered his surprise to gasp out something about the posters  i cant help it replied nicholas set whatever i may have earned this week against them or if that will not repay you say at once what will quick quick  well cry quits about that returned crummles but cant we have one last night more  not an hournot a minute replied nicholas impatiently  wont you stop to say something to mrs crummles asked the manager following him down to the door  i couldnt stop if it were to prolong my life a score of years rejoined nicholas here take my hand and with it my hearty thanksoh that i should have been fooling here  accompanying these words with an impatient stamp upon the ground he tore himself from the managers detaining grasp and darting rapidly down the street was out of sight in an instant  dear me dear me said mr crummles looking wistfully towards the point at which he had just disappeared if he only acted like that what a deal of money hed draw he should have kept upon this circuit hed have been very useful to me but he dont know whats good for him he is an impetuous youth young men are rash very rash  mr crummles being in a moralising mood might possibly have moralised for some minutes longer if he had not mechanically put his hand towards his waistcoat pocket where he was accustomed to keep his snuff the absence of any pocket at all in the usual direction suddenly recalled to his recollection the fact that he had no waistcoat on and this leading him to a contemplation of the extreme scantiness of his attire he shut the door abruptly and retired upstairs with great precipitation  smike had made good speed while nicholas was absent and with his help everything was soon ready for their departure they scarcely stopped to take a morsel of breakfast and in less than half an hour arrived at the coachoffice quite out of breath with the haste they had made to reach it in time there were yet a few minutes to spare so having secured the places nicholas hurried into a slopsellers hard by and bought smike a greatcoat it would have been rather large for a substantial yeoman but the shopman averring and with considerable truth that it was a most uncommon fit nicholas would have purchased it in his impatience if it had been twice the size  as they hurried up to the coach which was now in the open street and all ready for starting nicholas was not a little astonished to find himself suddenly clutched in a close and violent embrace which nearly took him off his legs nor was his amazement at all lessened by hearing the voice of mr crummles exclaim it is hemy friend my friend  bless my heart cried nicholas struggling in the managers arms what are you about  the manager made no reply but strained him to his breast again exclaiming as he did so farewell my noble my lionhearted boy  in fact mr crummles who could never lose any opportunity for professional display had turned out for the express purpose of taking a public farewell of nicholas and to render it the more imposing he was now to that young gentlemans most profound annoyance inflicting upon him a rapid succession of stage embraces which as everybody knows are performed by the embracers laying his or her chin on the shoulder of the object of affection and looking over it this mr crummles did in the highest style of melodrama pouring forth at the same time all the most dismal forms of farewell he could think of out of the stock pieces nor was this all for the elder master crummles was going through a similar ceremony with smike while master percy crummles with a very little secondhand camlet cloak worn theatrically over his left shoulder stood by in the attitude of an attendant officer waiting to convey the two victims to the scaffold  the lookerson laughed very heartily and as it was as well to put a good face upon the matter nicholas laughed too when he had succeeded in disengaging himself and rescuing the astonished smike climbed up to the coach roof after him and kissed his hand in honour of the absent mrs crummles as they rolled away    chapter 31  of ralph nickleby and newman noggs and some wise precautions the success or failure of which will appear in the sequel   in blissful unconsciousness that his nephew was hastening at the utmost speed of four good horses towards his sphere of action and that every passing minute diminished the distance between them ralph nickleby sat that morning occupied in his customary avocations and yet unable to prevent his thoughts wandering from time to time back to the interview which had taken place between himself and his niece on the previous day at such intervals after a few moments of abstraction ralph would mutter some peevish interjection and apply himself with renewed steadiness of purpose to the ledger before him but again and again the same train of thought came back despite all his efforts to prevent it confusing him in his calculations and utterly distracting his attention from the figures over which he bent at length ralph laid down his pen and threw himself back in his chair as though he had made up his mind to allow the obtrusive current of reflection to take its own course and by giving it full scope to rid himself of it effectually  i am not a man to be moved by a pretty face muttered ralph sternly there is a grinning skull beneath it and men like me who look and work below the surface see that and not its delicate covering and yet i almost like the girl or should if she had been less proudly and squeamishly brought up if the boy were drowned or hanged and the mother dead this house should be her home i wish they were with all my soul  notwithstanding the deadly hatred which ralph felt towards nicholas and the bitter contempt with which he sneered at poor mrs nicklebynotwithstanding the baseness with which he had behaved and was then behaving and would behave again if his interest prompted him towards kate herselfstill there was strange though it may seem something humanising and even gentle in his thoughts at that moment he thought of what his home might be if kate were there he placed her in the empty chair looked upon her heard her speak he felt again upon his arm the gentle pressure of the trembling hand he strewed his costly rooms with the hundred silent tokens of feminine presence and occupation he came back again to the cold fireside and the silent dreary splendour and in that one glimpse of a better nature born as it was in selfish thoughts the rich man felt himself friendless childless and alone gold for the instant lost its lustre in his eyes for there were countless treasures of the heart which it could never purchase  a very slight circumstance was sufficient to banish such reflections from the mind of such a man as ralph looked vacantly out across the yard towards the window of the other office he became suddenly aware of the earnest observation of newman noggs who with his red nose almost touching the glass feigned to be mending a pen with a rusty fragment of a knife but was in reality staring at his employer with a countenance of the closest and most eager scrutiny  ralph exchanged his dreamy posture for his accustomed business attitude the face of newman disappeared and the train of thought took to flight all simultaneously and in an instant  after a few minutes ralph rang his bell newman answered the summons and ralph raised his eyes stealthily to his face as if he almost feared to read there a knowledge of his recent thoughts  there was not the smallest speculation however in the countenance of newman noggs if it be possible to imagine a man with two eyes in his head and both wide open looking in no direction whatever and seeing nothing newman appeared to be that man while ralph nickleby regarded him  how now growled ralph  oh said newman throwing some intelligence into his eyes all at once and dropping them on his master i thought you rang with which laconic remark newman turned round and hobbled away  stop said ralph  newman stopped not at all disconcerted  i did ring  i knew you did  then why do you offer to go if you know that  i thought you rang to say you didnt ring replied newman you often do  how dare you pry and peer and stare at me sirrah demanded ralph  stare cried newman at you ha ha which was all the explanation newman deigned to offer  be careful sir said ralph looking steadily at him let me have no drunken fooling here do you see this parcel  its big enough rejoined newman  carry it into the city to cross in broad street and leave it therequick do you hear  newman gave a dogged kind of nod to express an affirmative reply and leaving the room for a few seconds returned with his hat having made various ineffective attempts to fit the parcel which was some two feet square into the crown thereof newman took it under his arm and after putting on his fingerless gloves with great precision and nicety keeping his eyes fixed upon mr ralph nickleby all the time he adjusted his hat upon his head with as much care real or pretended as if it were a brannew one of the most expensive quality and at last departed on his errand  he executed his commission with great promptitude and dispatch only calling at one publichouse for half a minute and even that might be said to be in his way for he went in at one door and came out at the other but as he returned and had got so far homewards as the strand newman began to loiter with the uncertain air of a man who has not quite made up his mind whether to halt or go straight forwards after a very short consideration the former inclination prevailed and making towards the point he had had in his mind newman knocked a modest double knock or rather a nervous single one at miss la creevys door  it was opened by a strange servant on whom the odd figure of the visitor did not appear to make the most favourable impression possible inasmuch as she no sooner saw him than she very nearly closed it and placing herself in the narrow gap inquired what he wanted but newman merely uttering the monosyllable noggs as if it were some cabalistic word at sound of which bolts would fly back and doors open pushed briskly past and gained the door of miss la creevys sittingroom before the astonished servant could offer any opposition  walk in if you please said miss la creevy in reply to the sound of newmans knuckles and in he walked accordingly  bless us cried miss la creevy starting as newman bolted in what did you want sir  you have forgotten me said newman with an inclination of the head i wonder at that that nobody should remember me who knew me in other days is natural enough but there are few people who seeing me once forget me now he glanced as he spoke at his shabby clothes and paralytic limb and slightly shook his head  i did forget you i declare said miss la creevy rising to receive newman who met her halfway and i am ashamed of myself for doing so for you are a kind good creature mr noggs sit down and tell me all about miss nickleby poor dear thing i havent seen her for this many a week  hows that asked newman  why the truth is mr noggs said miss la creevy that i have been out on a visitthe first visit i have made for fifteen years  that is a long time said newman sadly  so it is a very long time to look back upon in years though somehow or other thank heaven the solitary days roll away peacefully and happily enough replied the miniature painter i have a brother mr noggsthe only relation i haveand all that time i never saw him once not that we ever quarrelled but he was apprenticed down in the country and he got married there and new ties and affections springing up about him he forgot a poor little woman like me as it was very reasonable he should you know dont suppose that i complain about that because i always said to myself it is very natural poor dear john is making his way in the world and has a wife to tell his cares and troubles to and children now to play about him so god bless him and them and send we may all meet together one day where we shall part no more but what do you think mr noggs said the miniature painter brightening up and clapping her hands of that very same brother coming up to london at last and never resting till he found me out what do you think of his coming here and sitting down in that very chair and crying like a child because he was so glad to see mewhat do you think of his insisting on taking me down all the way into the country to his own house quite a sumptuous place mr noggs with a large garden and i dont know how many fields and a man in livery waiting at table and cows and horses and pigs and i dont know what besides and making me stay a whole month and pressing me to stop there all my lifeyes all my lifeand so did his wife and so did the childrenand there were four of them and one the eldest girl of all theythey had named her after me eight good years before they had indeed i never was so happy in all my life i never was the worthy soul hid her face in her handkerchief and sobbed aloud for it was the first opportunity she had had of unburdening her heart and it would have its way  but bless my life said miss la creevy wiping her eyes after a short pause and cramming her handkerchief into her pocket with great bustle and dispatch what a foolish creature i must seem to you mr noggs i shouldnt have said anything about it only i wanted to explain to you how it was i hadnt seen miss nickleby  have you seen the old lady asked newman  you mean mrs nickleby said miss la creevy then i tell you what mr noggs if you want to keep in the good books in that quarter you had better not call her the old lady any more for i suspect she wouldnt be best pleased to hear you yes i went there the night before last but she was quite on the high ropes about something and was so grand and mysterious that i couldnt make anything of her so to tell you the truth i took it into my head to be grand too and came away in state i thought she would have come round again before this but she hasnt been here  about miss nickleby said newman  why she was here twice while i was away returned miss la creevy i was afraid she mightnt like to have me calling on her among those great folks in whatsitsname place so i thought id wait a day or two and if i didnt see her write  ah exclaimed newman cracking his fingers  however i want to hear all the news about them from you said miss la creevy how is the old rough and tough monster of golden square well of course such people always are i dont mean how is he in health but how is he going on how is he behaving himself  damn him cried newman dashing his cherished hat on the floor like a false hound  gracious mr noggs you quite terrify me exclaimed miss la creevy turning pale  i should have spoilt his features yesterday afternoon if i could have afforded it said newman moving restlessly about and shaking his fist at a portrait of mr canning over the mantelpiece i was very near it i was obliged to put my hands in my pockets and keep em there very tight i shall do it some day in that little backparlour i know i shall i should have done it before now if i hadnt been afraid of making bad worse i shall doublelock myself in with him and have it out before i die im quite certain of it  i shall scream if you dont compose yourself mr noggs said miss la creevy im sure i shant be able to help it  never mind rejoined newman darting violently to and fro hes coming up tonight i wrote to tell him he little thinks i know he little thinks i care cunning scoundrel he dont think that not he not he never mind ill thwart himi newman noggs ho ho the rascal  lashing himself up to an extravagant pitch of fury newman noggs jerked himself about the room with the most eccentric motion ever beheld in a human being now sparring at the little miniatures on the wall and now giving himself violent thumps on the head as if to heighten the delusion until he sank down in his former seat quite breathless and exhausted  there said newman picking up his hat thats done me good now im better and ill tell you all about it  it took some little time to reassure miss la creevy who had been almost frightened out of her senses by this remarkable demonstration but that done newman faithfully related all that had passed in the interview between kate and her uncle prefacing his narrative with a statement of his previous suspicions on the subject and his reasons for forming them and concluding with a communication of the step he had taken in secretly writing to nicholas  though little miss la creevys indignation was not so singularly displayed as newmans it was scarcely inferior in violence and intensity indeed if ralph nickleby had happened to make his appearance in the room at that moment there is some doubt whether he would not have found miss la creevy a more dangerous opponent than even newman noggs himself  god forgive me for saying so said miss la creevy as a windup to all her expressions of anger but i really feel as if i could stick this into him with pleasure  it was not a very awful weapon that miss la creevy held it being in fact nothing more nor less than a blacklead pencil but discovering her mistake the little portrait painter exchanged it for a motherofpearl fruit knife wherewith in proof of her desperate thoughts she made a lunge as she spoke which would have scarcely disturbed the crumb of a halfquartern loaf  she wont stop where she is after tonight said newman thats a comfort  stop cried miss la creevy she should have left there weeks ago  if we had known of this rejoined newman but we didnt nobody could properly interfere but her mother or brother the mothers weakpoor thingweak the dear young man will be here tonight  heart alive cried miss la creevy he will do something desperate mr noggs if you tell him all at once  newman left off rubbing his hands and assumed a thoughtful look  depend upon it said miss la creevy earnestly if you are not very careful in breaking out the truth to him he will do some violence upon his uncle or one of these men that will bring some terrible calamity upon his own head and grief and sorrow to us all  i never thought of that rejoined newman his countenance falling more and more i came to ask you to receive his sister in case he brought her here but  but this is a matter of much greater importance interrupted miss la creevy that you might have been sure of before you came but the end of this nobody can foresee unless you are very guarded and careful  what can i do cried newman scratching his head with an air of great vexation and perplexity if he was to talk of pistoling em all i should be obliged to say certainlyserve em right  miss la creevy could not suppress a small shriek on hearing this and instantly set about extorting a solemn pledge from newman that he would use his utmost endeavours to pacify the wrath of nicholas which after some demur was conceded they then consulted together on the safest and surest mode of communicating to him the circumstances which had rendered his presence necessary  he must have time to cool before he can possibly do anything said miss la creevy that is of the greatest consequence he must not be told until late at night  but hell be in town between six and seven this evening replied newman i cant keep it from him when he asks me  then you must go out mr noggs said miss la creevy you can easily have been kept away by business and must not return till nearly midnight  then he will come straight here retorted newman  so i suppose observed miss la creevy but he wont find me at home for ill go straight to the city the instant you leave me make up matters with mrs nickleby and take her away to the theatre so that he may not even know where his sister lives  upon further discussion this appeared the safest and most feasible mode of proceeding that could possibly be adopted therefore it was finally determined that matters should be so arranged and newman after listening to many supplementary cautions and entreaties took his leave of miss la creevy and trudged back to golden square ruminating as he went upon a vast number of possibilities and impossibilities which crowded upon his brain and arose out of the conversation that had just terminated    chapter 32  relating chiefly to some remarkable conversation and some remarkable proceedings to which it gives rise   london at last cried nicholas throwing back his greatcoat and rousing smike from a long nap it seemed to me as though we should never reach it  and yet you came along at a tidy pace too observed the coachman looking over his shoulder at nicholas with no very pleasant expression of countenance  ay i know that was the reply but i have been very anxious to be at my journeys end and that makes the way seem long  well remarked the coachman if the way seemed long with such cattle as youve sat behind you must have been most uncommon anxious and so saying he let out his whiplash and touched up a little boy on the calves of his legs by way of emphasis  they rattled on through the noisy bustling crowded street of london now displaying long double rows of brightlyburning lamps dotted here and there with the chemists glaring lights and illuminated besides with the brilliant flood that streamed from the windows of the shops where sparkling jewellery silks and velvets of the richest colours the most inviting delicacies and most sumptuous articles of luxurious ornament succeeded each other in rich and glittering profusion streams of people apparently without end poured on and on jostling each other in the crowd and hurrying forward scarcely seeming to notice the riches that surrounded them on every side while vehicles of all shapes and makes mingled up together in one moving mass like running water lent their ceaseless roar to swell the noise and tumult  as they dashed by the quicklychanging and evervarying objects it was curious to observe in what a strange procession they passed before the eye emporiums of splendid dresses the materials brought from every quarter of the world tempting stores of everything to stimulate and pamper the sated appetite and give new relish to the oftrepeated feast vessels of burnished gold and silver wrought into every exquisite form of vase and dish and goblet guns swords pistols and patent engines of destruction screws and irons for the crooked clothes for the newlyborn drugs for the sick coffins for the dead and churchyards for the buriedall these jumbled each with the other and flocking side by side seemed to flit by in motley dance like the fantastic groups of the old dutch painter and with the same stern moral for the unheeding restless crowd  nor were there wanting objects in the crowd itself to give new point and purpose to the shifting scene the rags of the squalid balladsinger fluttered in the rich light that showed the goldsmiths treasures pale and pinchedup faces hovered about the windows where was tempting food hungry eyes wandered over the profusion guarded by one thin sheet of brittle glassan iron wall to them halfnaked shivering figures stopped to gaze at chinese shawls and golden stuffs of india there was a christening party at the largest coffinmakers and a funeral hatchment had stopped some great improvements in the bravest mansion life and death went hand in hand wealth and poverty stood side by side repletion and starvation laid them down together  but it was london and the old country lady inside who had put her head out of the coachwindow a mile or two this side kingston and cried out to the driver that she was sure he must have passed it and forgotten to set her down was satisfied at last  nicholas engaged beds for himself and smike at the inn where the coach stopped and repaired without the delay of another moment to the lodgings of newman noggs for his anxiety and impatience had increased with every succeeding minute and were almost beyond control  there was a fire in newmans garret and a candle had been left burning the floor was cleanly swept the room was as comfortably arranged as such a room could be and meat and drink were placed in order upon the table everything bespoke the affectionate care and attention of newman noggs but newman himself was not there  do you know what time he will be home inquired nicholas tapping at the door of newmans front neighbour  ah mr johnson said crowl presenting himself welcome sir how well youre looking i never could have believed  pardon me interposed nicholas my questioni am extremely anxious to know  why he has a troublesome affair of business replied crowl and will not be home before twelve oclock he was very unwilling to go i can tell you but there was no help for it however he left word that you were to make yourself comfortable till he came back and that i was to entertain you which i shall be very glad to do  in proof of his extreme readiness to exert himself for the general entertainment mr crowl drew a chair to the table as he spoke and helping himself plentifully to the cold meat invited nicholas and smike to follow his example  disappointed and uneasy nicholas could touch no food so after he had seen smike comfortably established at the table he walked out despite a great many dissuasions uttered by mr crowl with his mouth full and left smike to detain newman in case he returned first  as miss la creevy had anticipated nicholas betook himself straight to her house finding her from home he debated within himself for some time whether he should go to his mothers residence and so compromise her with ralph nickleby fully persuaded however that newman would not have solicited him to return unless there was some strong reason which required his presence at home he resolved to go there and hastened eastwards with all speed  mrs nickleby would not be at home the girl said until past twelve or later she believed miss nickleby was well but she didnt live at home now nor did she come home except very seldom she couldnt say where she was stopping but it was not at madame mantalinis she was sure of that  with his heart beating violently and apprehending he knew not what disaster nicholas returned to where he had left smike newman had not been home he wouldnt be till twelve oclock there was no chance of it was there no possibility of sending to fetch him if it were only for an instant or forwarding to him one line of writing to which he might return a verbal reply that was quite impracticable he was not at golden square and probably had been sent to execute some commission at a distance  nicholas tried to remain quietly where he was but he felt so nervous and excited that he could not sit still he seemed to be losing time unless he was moving it was an absurd fancy he knew but he was wholly unable to resist it so he took up his hat and rambled out again  he strolled westward this time pacing the long streets with hurried footsteps and agitated by a thousand misgivings and apprehensions which he could not overcome he passed into hyde park now silent and deserted and increased his rate of walking as if in the hope of leaving his thoughts behind they crowded upon him more thickly however now there were no passing objects to attract his attention and the one idea was always uppermost that some stroke of illfortune must have occurred so calamitous in its nature that all were fearful of disclosing it to him the old question arose again and againwhat could it be nicholas walked till he was weary but was not one bit the wiser and indeed he came out of the park at last a great deal more confused and perplexed than when he went in  he had taken scarcely anything to eat or drink since early in the morning and felt quite worn out and exhausted as he returned languidly towards the point from which he had started along one of the thoroughfares which lie between park lane and bond street he passed a handsome hotel before which he stopped mechanically  an expensive place i dare say thought nicholas but a pint of wine and a biscuit are no great debauch wherever they are had and yet i dont know  he walked on a few steps but looking wistfully down the long vista of gaslamps before him and thinking how long it would take to reach the end of it and being besides in that kind of mood in which a man is most disposed to yield to his first impulseand being besides strongly attracted to the hotel in part by curiosity and in part by some odd mixture of feelings which he would have been troubled to definenicholas turned back again and walked into the coffeeroom  it was very handsomely furnished the walls were ornamented with the choicest specimens of french paper enriched with a gilded cornice of elegant design the floor was covered with a rich carpet and two superb mirrors one above the chimneypiece and one at the opposite end of the room reaching from floor to ceiling multiplied the other beauties and added new ones of their own to enhance the general effect there was a rather noisy party of four gentlemen in a box by the fireplace and only two other persons presentboth elderly gentlemen and both alone  observing all this in the first comprehensive glance with which a stranger surveys a place that is new to him nicholas sat himself down in the box next to the noisy party with his back towards them and postponing his order for a pint of claret until such time as the waiter and one of the elderly gentlemen should have settled a disputed question relative to the price of an item in the bill of fare took up a newspaper and began to read  he had not read twenty lines and was in truth himself dozing when he was startled by the mention of his sisters name little kate nickleby were the words that caught his ear he raised his head in amazement and as he did so saw by the reflection in the opposite glass that two of the party behind him had risen and were standing before the fire it must have come from one of them thought nicholas he waited to hear more with a countenance of some indignation for the tone of speech had been anything but respectful and the appearance of the individual whom he presumed to have been the speaker was coarse and swaggering  this personso nicholas observed in the same glance at the mirror which had enabled him to see his facewas standing with his back to the fire conversing with a younger man who stood with his back to the company wore his hat and was adjusting his shirtcollar by the aid of the glass they spoke in whispers now and then bursting into a loud laugh but nicholas could catch no repetition of the words nor anything sounding at all like the words which had attracted his attention  at length the two resumed their seats and more wine being ordered the party grew louder in their mirth still there was no reference made to anybody with whom he was acquainted and nicholas became persuaded that his excited fancy had either imagined the sounds altogether or converted some other words into the name which had been so much in his thoughts  it is remarkable too thought nicholas if it had been kate or kate nickleby i should not have been so much surprised but little kate nickleby  the wine coming at the moment prevented his finishing the sentence he swallowed a glassful and took up the paper again at that instant  little kate nickleby cried the voice behind him  i was right muttered nicholas as the paper fell from his hand and it was the man i supposed  as there was a proper objection to drinking her in heeltaps said the voice well give her the first glass in the new magnum little kate nickleby  little kate nickleby cried the other three and the glasses were set down empty  keenly alive to the tone and manner of this slight and careless mention of his sisters name in a public place nicholas fired at once but he kept himself quiet by a great effort and did not even turn his head  the jade said the same voice which had spoken before shes a true nicklebya worthy imitator of her old uncle ralphshe hangs back to be more sought afterso does he nothing to be got out of ralph unless you follow him up and then the money comes doubly welcome and the bargain doubly hard for youre impatient and he isnt oh infernal cunning  infernal cunning echoed two voices  nicholas was in a perfect agony as the two elderly gentlemen opposite rose one after the other and went away lest they should be the means of his losing one word of what was said but the conversation was suspended as they withdrew and resumed with even greater freedom when they had left the room  i am afraid said the younger gentleman that the old woman has grown jeaalous and locked her up upon my soul it looks like it  if they quarrel and little nickleby goes home to her mother so much the better said the first i can do anything with the old lady shell believe anything i tell her  egad thats true returned the other voice ha ha ha poor deyvle  the laugh was taken up by the two voices which always came in together and became general at mrs nicklebys expense nicholas turned burning hot with rage but he commanded himself for the moment and waited to hear more  what he heard need not be repeated here suffice it that as the wine went round he heard enough to acquaint him with the characters and designs of those whose conversation he overhead to possess him with the full extent of ralphs villainy and the real reason of his own presence being required in london he heard all this and more he heard his sisters sufferings derided and her virtuous conduct jeered at and brutally misconstrued he heard her name bandied from mouth to mouth and herself made the subject of coarse and insolent wagers free speech and licentious jesting  the man who had spoken first led the conversation and indeed almost engrossed it being only stimulated from time to time by some slight observation from one or other of his companions to him then nicholas addressed himself when he was sufficiently composed to stand before the party and force the words from his parched and scorching throat  let me have a word with you sir said nicholas  with me sir retorted sir mulberry hawk eyeing him in disdainful surprise  i said with you replied nicholas speaking with great difficulty for his passion choked him  a mysterious stranger upon my soul exclaimed sir mulberry raising his wineglass to his lips and looking round upon his friends  will you step apart with me for a few minutes or do you refuse said nicholas sternly  sir mulberry merely paused in the act of drinking and bade him either name his business or leave the table  nicholas drew a card from his pocket and threw it before him  there sir said nicholas my business you will guess  a momentary expression of astonishment not unmixed with some confusion appeared in the face of sir mulberry as he read the name but he subdued it in an instant and tossing the card to lord verisopht who sat opposite drew a toothpick from a glass before him and very leisurely applied it to his mouth  your name and address said nicholas turning paler as his passion kindled  i shall give you neither replied sir mulberry  if there is a gentleman in this party said nicholas looking round and scarcely able to make his white lips form the words he will acquaint me with the name and residence of this man  there was a dead silence  i am the brother of the young lady who has been the subject of conversation here said nicholas i denounce this person as a liar and impeach him as a coward if he has a friend here he will save him the disgrace of the paltry attempt to conceal his nameand utterly useless onefor i will find it out nor leave him until i have  sir mulberry looked at him contemptuously and addressing his companions said  let the fellow talk i have nothing serious to say to boys of his station and his pretty sister shall save him a broken head if he talks till midnight  you are a base and spiritless scoundrel said nicholas and shall be proclaimed so to the world i will know you i will follow you home if you walk the streets till morning  sir mulberrys hand involuntarily closed upon the decanter and he seemed for an instant about to launch it at the head of his challenger but he only filled his glass and laughed in derision  nicholas sat himself down directly opposite to the party and summoning the waiter paid his bill  do you know that persons name he inquired of the man in an audible voice pointing out sir mulberry as he put the question  sir mulberry laughed again and the two voices which had always spoken together echoed the laugh but rather feebly  that gentleman sir replied the waiter who no doubt knew his cue and answered with just as little respect and just as much impertinence as he could safely show no sir i do not sir  here you sir cried sir mulberry as the man was retiring do you know that persons name  name sir no sir  then youll find it there said sir mulberry throwing nicholass card towards him and when you have made yourself master of it put that piece of pasteboard in the firedo you hear me  the man grinned and looking doubtfully at nicholas compromised the matter by sticking the card in the chimneyglass having done this he retired  nicholas folded his arms and biting his lip sat perfectly quiet sufficiently expressing by his manner however a firm determination to carry his threat of following sir mulberry home into steady execution  it was evident from the tone in which the younger member of the party appeared to remonstrate with his friend that he objected to this course of proceeding and urged him to comply with the request which nicholas had made sir mulberry however who was not quite sober and who was in a sullen and dogged state of obstinacy soon silenced the representations of his weak young friend and further seemedas if to save himself from a repetition of themto insist on being left alone however this might have been the young gentleman and the two who had always spoken together actually rose to go after a short interval and presently retired leaving their friend alone with nicholas  it will be very readily supposed that to one in the condition of nicholas the minutes appeared to move with leaden wings indeed and that their progress did not seem the more rapid from the monotonous ticking of a french clock or the shrill sound of its little bell which told the quarters but there he sat and in his old seat on the opposite side of the room reclined sir mulberry hawk with his legs upon the cushion and his handkerchief thrown negligently over his knees finishing his magnum of claret with the utmost coolness and indifference  thus they remained in perfect silence for upwards of an hournicholas would have thought for three hours at least but that the little bell had only gone four times twice or thrice he looked angrily and impatiently round but there was sir mulberry in the same attitude putting his glass to his lips from time to time and looking vacantly at the wall as if he were wholly ignorant of the presence of any living person  at length he yawned stretched himself and rose walked coolly to the glass and having surveyed himself therein turned round and honoured nicholas with a long and contemptuous stare nicholas stared again with right goodwill sir mulberry shrugged his shoulders smiled slightly rang the bell and ordered the waiter to help him on with his greatcoat  the man did so and held the door open  dont wait said sir mulberry and they were alone again  sir mulberry took several turns up and down the room whistling carelessly all the time stopped to finish the last glass of claret which he had poured out a few minutes before walked again put on his hat adjusted it by the glass drew on his gloves and at last walked slowly out nicholas who had been fuming and chafing until he was nearly wild darted from his seat and followed him so closely that before the door had swung upon its hinges after sir mulberrys passing out they stood side by side in the street together  there was a private cabriolet in waiting the groom opened the apron and jumped out to the horses head  will you make yourself known to me asked nicholas in a suppressed voice  no replied the other fiercely and confirming the refusal with an oath no  if you trust to your horses speed you will find yourself mistaken said nicholas i will accompany you by heaven i will if i hang on to the footboard  you shall be horsewhipped if you do returned sir mulberry  you are a villain said nicholas  you are an errandboy for aught i know said sir mulberry hawk  i am the son of a country gentleman returned nicholas your equal in birth and education and your superior i trust in everything besides i tell you again miss nickleby is my sister will you or will you not answer for your unmanly and brutal conduct  to a proper championyes to youno returned sir mulberry taking the reins in his hand stand out of the way dog william let go her head  you had better not cried nicholas springing on the step as sir mulberry jumped in and catching at the reins he has no command over the horse mind you shall not goyou shall not i sweartill you have told me who you are  the groom hesitated for the mare who was a highspirited animal and thoroughbred plunged so violently that he could scarcely hold her  leave go i tell you thundered his master  the man obeyed the animal reared and plunged as though it would dash the carriage into a thousand pieces but nicholas blind to all sense of danger and conscious of nothing but his fury still maintained his place and his hold upon the reins  will you unclasp your hand  will you tell me who you are  no  no  in less time than the quickest tongue could tell it these words were exchanged and sir mulberry shortening his whip applied it furiously to the head and shoulders of nicholas it was broken in the struggle nicholas gained the heavy handle and with it laid open one side of his antagonists face from the eye to the lip he saw the gash knew that the mare had darted off at a wild mad gallop a hundred lights danced in his eyes and he felt himself flung violently upon the ground  he was giddy and sick but staggered to his feet directly roused by the loud shouts of the men who were tearing up the street and screaming to those ahead to clear the way he was conscious of a torrent of people rushing quickly bylooking up could discern the cabriolet whirled along the footpavement with frightful rapiditythen heard a loud cry the smashing of some heavy body and the breaking of glassand then the crowd closed in in the distance and he could see or hear no more  the general attention had been entirely directed from himself to the person in the carriage and he was quite alone rightly judging that under such circumstances it would be madness to follow he turned down a byestreet in search of the nearest coachstand finding after a minute or two that he was reeling like a drunken man and aware for the first time of a stream of blood that was trickling down his face and breast    chapter 33  in which mr ralph nickleby is relieved by a very expeditious process from all commerce with his relations   smike and newman noggs who in his impatience had returned home long before the time agreed upon sat before the fire listening anxiously to every footstep on the stairs and the slightest sound that stirred within the house for the approach of nicholas time had worn on and it was growing late he had promised to be back in an hour and his prolonged absence began to excite considerable alarm in the minds of both as was abundantly testified by the blank looks they cast upon each other at every new disappointment  at length a coach was heard to stop and newman ran out to light nicholas up the stairs beholding him in the trim described at the conclusion of the last chapter he stood aghast in wonder and consternation  dont be alarmed said nicholas hurrying him back into the room there is no harm done beyond what a basin of water can repair  no harm cried newman passing his hands hastily over the back and arms of nicholas as if to assure himself that he had broken no bones what have you been doing  i know all interrupted nicholas i have heard a part and guessed the rest but before i remove one jot of these stains i must hear the whole from you you see i am collected my resolution is taken now my good friend speak out for the time for any palliation or concealment is past and nothing will avail ralph nickleby now  your dress is torn in several places you walk lame and i am sure you are suffering pain said newman let me see to your hurts first  i have no hurts to see to beyond a little soreness and stiffness that will soon pass off said nicholas seating himself with some difficulty but if i had fractured every limb and still preserved my senses you should not bandage one till you had told me what i have the right to know come said nicholas giving his hand to noggs you had a sister of your own you told me once who died before you fell into misfortune now think of her and tell me newman  yes i will i will said noggs ill tell you the whole truth  newman did so nicholas nodded his head from time to time as it corroborated the particulars he had already gleaned but he fixed his eyes upon the fire and did not look round once  his recital ended newman insisted upon his young friends stripping off his coat and allowing whatever injuries he had received to be properly tended nicholas after some opposition at length consented and while some pretty severe bruises on his arms and shoulders were being rubbed with oil and vinegar and various other efficacious remedies which newman borrowed from the different lodgers related in what manner they had been received the recital made a strong impression on the warm imagination of newman for when nicholas came to the violent part of the quarrel he rubbed so hard as to occasion him the most exquisite pain which he would not have exhibited however for the world it being perfectly clear that for the moment newman was operating on sir mulberry hawk and had quite lost sight of his real patient  this martyrdom over nicholas arranged with newman that while he was otherwise occupied next morning arrangements should be made for his mothers immediately quitting her present residence and also for dispatching miss la creevy to break the intelligence to her he then wrapped himself in smikes greatcoat and repaired to the inn where they were to pass the night and where after writing a few lines to ralph the delivery of which was to be intrusted to newman next day he endeavoured to obtain the repose of which he stood so much in need  drunken men they say may roll down precipices and be quite unconscious of any serious personal inconvenience when their reason returns the remark may possibly apply to injuries received in other kinds of violent excitement certain it is that although nicholas experienced some pain on first awakening next morning he sprung out of bed as the clock struck seven with very little difficulty and was soon as much on the alert as if nothing had occurred  merely looking into smikes room and telling him that newman noggs would call for him very shortly nicholas descended into the street and calling a hackney coach bade the man drive to mrs wititterlys according to the direction which newman had given him on the previous night  it wanted a quarter to eight when they reached cadogan place nicholas began to fear that no one might be stirring at that early hour when he was relieved by the sight of a female servant employed in cleaning the doorsteps by this functionary he was referred to the doubtful page who appeared with dishevelled hair and a very warm and glossy face as of a page who had just got out of bed  by this young gentleman he was informed that miss nickleby was then taking her mornings walk in the gardens before the house on the question being propounded whether he could go and find her the page desponded and thought not but being stimulated with a shilling the page grew sanguine and thought he could  say to miss nickleby that her brother is here and in great haste to see her said nicholas  the plated buttons disappeared with an alacrity most unusual to them and nicholas paced the room in a state of feverish agitation which made the delay even of a minute insupportable he soon heard a light footstep which he well knew and before he could advance to meet her kate had fallen on his neck and burst into tears  my darling girl said nicholas as he embraced her how pale you are  i have been so unhappy here dear brother sobbed poor kate so very very miserable do not leave me here dear nicholas or i shall die of a broken heart  i will leave you nowhere answered nicholasnever again kate he cried moved in spite of himself as he folded her to his heart tell me that i acted for the best tell me that we parted because i feared to bring misfortune on your head that it was a trial to me no less than to yourself and that if i did wrong it was in ignorance of the world and unknowingly  why should i tell you what we know so well returned kate soothingly nicholasdear nicholashow can you give way thus  it is such bitter reproach to me to know what you have undergone returned her brother to see you so much altered and yet so kind and patientgod cried nicholas clenching his fist and suddenly changing his tone and manner it sets my whole blood on fire again you must leave here with me directly you should not have slept here last night but that i knew all this too late to whom can i speak before we drive away  this question was most opportunely put for at that instant mr wititterly walked in and to him kate introduced her brother who at once announced his purpose and the impossibility of deferring it  the quarters notice said mr wititterly with the gravity of a man on the right side is not yet half expired therefore  therefore interposed nicholas the quarters salary must be lost sir you will excuse this extreme haste but circumstances require that i should immediately remove my sister and i have not a moments time to lose whatever she brought here i will send for if you will allow me in the course of the day  mr wititterly bowed but offered no opposition to kates immediate departure with which indeed he was rather gratified than otherwise sir tumley snuffim having given it as his opinion that she rather disagreed with mrs wititterlys constitution  with regard to the trifle of salary that is due said mr wititterly i willhere he was interrupted by a violent fit of coughingi willowe it to miss nickleby  mr wititterly it should be observed was accustomed to owe small accounts and to leave them owing all men have some little pleasant way of their own and this was mr wititterlys  if you please said nicholas and once more offering a hurried apology for so sudden a departure he hurried kate into the vehicle and bade the man drive with all speed into the city  to the city they went accordingly with all the speed the hackney coach could make and as the horses happened to live at whitechapel and to be in the habit of taking their breakfast there when they breakfasted at all they performed the journey with greater expedition than could reasonably have been expected  nicholas sent kate upstairs a few minutes before him that his unlookedfor appearance might not alarm his mother and when the way had been paved presented himself with much duty and affection newman had not been idle for there was a little cart at the door and the effects were hurrying out already  now mrs nickleby was not the sort of person to be told anything in a hurry or rather to comprehend anything of peculiar delicacy or importance on a short notice wherefore although the good lady had been subjected to a full hours preparation by little miss la creevy and was now addressed in most lucid terms both by nicholas and his sister she was in a state of singular bewilderment and confusion and could by no means be made to comprehend the necessity of such hurried proceedings  why dont you ask your uncle my dear nicholas what he can possibly mean by it said mrs nickleby  my dear mother returned nicholas the time for talking has gone by there is but one step to take and that is to cast him off with the scorn and indignation he deserves your own honour and good name demand that after the discovery of his vile proceedings you should not be beholden to him one hour even for the shelter of these bare walls  to be sure said mrs nickleby crying bitterly he is a brute a monster and the walls are very bare and want painting too and i have had this ceiling whitewashed at the expense of eighteenpence which is a very distressing thing considering that it is so much gone into your uncles pocket i never could have believed itnever  nor i nor anybody else said nicholas  lord bless my life exclaimed mrs nickleby to think that that sir mulberry hawk should be such an abandoned wretch as miss la creevy says he is nicholas my dear when i was congratulating myself every day on his being an admirer of our dear kates and thinking what a thing it would be for the family if he was to become connected with us and use his interest to get you some profitable government place there are very good places to be got about the court i know for a friend of ours miss cropley at exeter my dear kate you recollect he had one and i know that it was the chief part of his duty to wear silk stockings and a bag wig like a black watchpocket and to think that it should come to this after alloh dear dear its enough to kill one that it is with which expressions of sorrow mrs nickleby gave fresh vent to her grief and wept piteously  as nicholas and his sister were by this time compelled to superintend the removal of the few articles of furniture miss la creevy devoted herself to the consolation of the matron and observed with great kindness of manner that she must really make an effort and cheer up  oh i dare say miss la creevy returned mrs nickleby with a petulance not unnatural in her unhappy circumstances its very easy to say cheer up but if you had as many occasions to cheer up as i have hadand there said mrs nickleby stopping short think of mr pyke and mr pluck two of the most perfect gentlemen that ever lived what am i too say to themwhat can i say to them why if i was to say to them im told your friend sir mulberry is a base wretch theyd laugh at me  they will laugh no more at us i take it said nicholas advancing come mother there is a coach at the door and until monday at all events we will return to our old quarters  where everything is ready and a hearty welcome into the bargain added miss la creevy now let me go with you downstairs  but mrs nickleby was not to be so easily moved for first she insisted on going upstairs to see that nothing had been left and then on going downstairs to see that everything had been taken away and when she was getting into the coach she had a vision of a forgotten coffeepot on the backkitchen hob and after she was shut in a dismal recollection of a green umbrella behind some unknown door at last nicholas in a condition of absolute despair ordered the coachman to drive away and in the unexpected jerk of a sudden starting mrs nickleby lost a shilling among the straw which fortunately confined her attention to the coach until it was too late to remember anything else  having seen everything safely out discharged the servant and locked the door nicholas jumped into a cabriolet and drove to a bye place near golden square where he had appointed to meet noggs and so quickly had everything been done that it was barely halfpast nine when he reached the place of meeting  here is the letter for ralph said nicholas and here the key when you come to me this evening not a word of last night ill news travels fast and they will know it soon enough have you heard if he was much hurt  newman shook his head  i will ascertain that myself without loss of time said nicholas  you had better take some rest returned newman you are fevered and ill  nicholas waved his hand carelessly and concealing the indisposition he really felt now that the excitement which had sustained him was over took a hurried farewell of newman noggs and left him  newman was not three minutes walk from golden square but in the course of that three minutes he took the letter out of his hat and put it in again twenty times at least first the front then the back then the sides then the superscription then the seal were objects of newmans admiration then he held it at arms length as if to take in the whole at one delicious survey and then he rubbed his hands in a perfect ecstasy with his commission  he reached the office hung his hat on its accustomed peg laid the letter and key upon the desk and waited impatiently until ralph nickleby should appear after a few minutes the wellknown creaking of his boots was heard on the stairs and then the bell rung  has the post come in  no  any other letters  one newman eyed him closely and laid it on the desk  whats this asked ralph taking up the key  left with the lettera boy brought themquarter of an hour ago or less  ralph glanced at the direction opened the letter and read as follows  you are known to me now there are no reproaches i could heap upon your head which would carry with them one thousandth part of the grovelling shame that this assurance will awaken even in your breast  your brothers widow and her orphan child spurn the shelter of your roof and shun you with disgust and loathing your kindred renounce you for they know no shame but the ties of blood which bind them in name with you  you are an old man and i leave you to the grave may every recollection of your life cling to your false heart and cast their darkness on your deathbed  ralph nickleby read this letter twice and frowning heavily fell into a fit of musing the paper fluttered from his hand and dropped upon the floor but he clasped his fingers as if he held it still  suddenly he started from his seat and thrusting it all crumpled into his pocket turned furiously to newman noggs as though to ask him why he lingered but newman stood unmoved with his back towards him following up with the worn and blackened stump of an old pen some figures in an interesttable which was pasted against the wall and apparently quite abstracted from every other object    chapter 34  wherein mr ralph nickleby is visited by persons with whom the reader has been already made acquainted   what a demnition long time you have kept me ringing at this confounded old cracked teakettle of a bell every tinkle of which is enough to throw a strong man into blue convulsions upon my life and soul oh demmitsaid mr mantalini to newman noggs scraping his boots as he spoke on ralph nicklebys scraper  i didnt hear the bell more than once replied newman  then you are most immensely and outrigeously deaf said mr mantalini as deaf as a demnition post  mr mantalini had got by this time into the passage and was making his way to the door of ralphs office with very little ceremony when newman interposed his body and hinting that mr nickleby was unwilling to be disturbed inquired whether the clients business was of a pressing nature  it is most demnebly particular said mr mantalini it is to melt some scraps of dirty paper into bright shining chinking tinkling demd mint sauce  newman uttered a significant grunt and taking mr mantalinis proffered card limped with it into his masters office as he thrust his head in at the door he saw that ralph had resumed the thoughtful posture into which he had fallen after perusing his nephews letter and that he seemed to have been reading it again as he once more held it open in his hand the glance was but momentary for ralph being disturbed turned to demand the cause of the interruption  as newman stated it the cause himself swaggered into the room and grasping ralphs horny hand with uncommon affection vowed that he had never seen him looking so well in all his life  there is quite a bloom upon your demd countenance said mr mantalini seating himself unbidden and arranging his hair and whiskers you look quite juvenile and jolly demmit  we are alone returned ralph tartly what do you want with me  good cried mr mantalini displaying his teeth what did i want yes ha ha very good what did i want ha ha oh dem  what do you want man demanded ralph sternly  demnition discount returned mr mantalini with a grin and shaking his head waggishly  money is scarce said ralph  demd scarce or i shouldnt want it interrupted mr mantalini  the times are bad and one scarcely knows whom to trust continued ralph i dont want to do business just now in fact i would rather not but as you are a friendhow many bills have you there  two returned mr mantalini  what is the gross amount  demd triflingfiveandseventy  and the dates  two months and four  ill do them for youmind for you i wouldnt for many peoplefor fiveandtwenty pounds said ralph deliberately  oh demmit cried mr mantalini whose face lengthened considerably at this handsome proposal  why that leaves you fifty retorted ralph what would you have let me see the names  you are so demd hard nickleby remonstrated mr mantalini  let me see the names replied ralph impatiently extending his hand for the bills well they are not sure but they are safe enough do you consent to the terms and will you take the money i dont want you to do so i would rather you didnt  demmit nickleby cant you began mr mantalini  no replied ralph interrupting him i cant will you take the moneydown mind no delay no going into the city and pretending to negotiate with some other party who has no existence and never had is it a bargain or is it not  ralph pushed some papers from him as he spoke and carelessly rattled his cashbox as though by mere accident the sound was too much for mr mantalini he closed the bargain directly it reached his ears and ralph told the money out upon the table  he had scarcely done so and mr mantalini had not yet gathered it all up when a ring was heard at the bell and immediately afterwards newman ushered in no less a person than madame mantalini at sight of whom mr mantalini evinced considerable discomposure and swept the cash into his pocket with remarkable alacrity  oh you are here said madame mantalini tossing her head  yes my life and soul i am replied her husband dropping on his knees and pouncing with kittenlike playfulness upon a stray sovereign i am here my souls delight upon tom tiddlers ground picking up the demnition gold and silver  i am ashamed of you said madame mantalini with much indignation  ashamedof me my joy it knows it is talking demd charming sweetness but naughty fibs returned mr mantalini it knows it is not ashamed of its own popolorum tibby  whatever were the circumstances which had led to such a result it certainly appeared as though the popolorum tibby had rather miscalculated for the nonce the extent of his ladys affection madame mantalini only looked scornful in reply and turning to ralph begged him to excuse her intrusion  which is entirely attributable said madame to the gross misconduct and most improper behaviour of mr mantalini  of me my essential juice of pineapple  of you returned his wife but i will not allow it i will not submit to be ruined by the extravagance and profligacy of any man i call mr nickleby to witness the course i intend to pursue with you  pray dont call me to witness anything maam said ralph settle it between yourselves settle it between yourselves  no but i must beg you as a favour said madame mantalini to hear me give him notice of what it is my fixed intention to domy fixed intention sir repeated madame mantalini darting an angry look at her husband  will she call me sir cried mantalini me who dote upon her with the demdest ardour she who coils her fascinations round me like a pure angelic rattlesnake it will be all up with my feelings she will throw me into a demd state  dont talk of feelings sir rejoined madame mantalini seating herself and turning her back upon him you dont consider mine  i do not consider yours my soul exclaimed mr mantalini  no replied his wife  and notwithstanding various blandishments on the part of mr mantalini madame mantalini still said no and said it too with such determined and resolute illtemper that mr mantalini was clearly taken aback  his extravagance mr nickleby said madame mantalini addressing herself to ralph who leant against his easychair with his hands behind him and regarded the amiable couple with a smile of the supremest and most unmitigated contempthis extravagance is beyond all bounds  i should scarcely have supposed it answered ralph sarcastically  i assure you mr nickleby however that it is returned madame mantalini it makes me miserable i am under constant apprehensions and in constant difficulty and even this said madame mantalini wiping her eyes is not the worst he took some papers of value out of my desk this morning without asking my permission  mr mantalini groaned slightly and buttoned his trousers pocket  i am obliged continued madame mantalini since our late misfortunes to pay miss knag a great deal of money for having her name in the business and i really cannot afford to encourage him in all his wastefulness as i have no doubt that he came straight here mr nickleby to convert the papers i have spoken of into money and as you have assisted us very often before and are very much connected with us in this kind of matters i wish you to know the determination at which his conduct has compelled me to arrive  mr mantalini groaned once more from behind his wifes bonnet and fitting a sovereign into one of his eyes winked with the other at ralph having achieved this performance with great dexterity he whipped the coin into his pocket and groaned again with increased penitence  i have made up my mind said madame mantalini as tokens of impatience manifested themselves in ralphs countenance to allowance him  to do that my joy inquired mr mantalini who did not seem to have caught the words  to put him said madame mantalini looking at ralph and prudently abstaining from the slightest glance at her husband lest his many graces should induce her to falter in her resolution to put him upon a fixed allowance and i say that if he has a hundred and twenty pounds a year for his clothes and pocketmoney he may consider himself a very fortunate man  mr mantalini waited with much decorum to hear the amount of the proposed stipend but when it reached his ears he cast his hat and cane upon the floor and drawing out his pockethandkerchief gave vent to his feelings in a dismal moan  demnition cried mr mantalini suddenly skipping out of his chair and as suddenly skipping into it again to the great discomposure of his ladys nerves but no it is a demd horrid dream it is not reality no  comforting himself with this assurance mr mantalini closed his eyes and waited patiently till such time as he should wake up  a very judicious arrangement observed ralph with a sneer if your husband will keep within it maamas no doubt he will  demmit exclaimed mr mantalini opening his eyes at the sound of ralphs voice it is a horrid reality she is sitting there before me there is the graceful outline of her form it cannot be mistakenthere is nothing like it the two countesses had no outlines at all and the dowagers was a demd outline why is she so excruciatingly beautiful that i cannot be angry with her even now  you have brought it upon yourself alfred returned madame mantalinistill reproachfully but in a softened tone  i am a demd villain cried mr mantalini smiting himself on the head i will fill my pockets with change for a sovereign in halfpence and drown myself in the thames but i will not be angry with her even then for i will put a note in the twopennypost as i go along to tell her where the body is she will be a lovely widow i shall be a body some handsome women will cry she will laugh demnebly  alfred you cruel cruel creature said madame mantalini sobbing at the dreadful picture  she calls me cruelmemewho for her sake will become a demd damp moist unpleasant body exclaimed mr mantalini  you know it almost breaks my heart even to hear you talk of such a thing replied madame mantalini  can i live to be mistrusted cried her husband have i cut my heart into a demd extraordinary number of little pieces and given them all away one after another to the same little engrossing demnition captivater and can i live to be suspected by her demmit no i cant  ask mr nickleby whether the sum i have mentioned is not a proper one reasoned madame mantalini  i dont want any sum replied her disconsolate husband i shall require no demd allowance i will be a body  on this repetition of mr mantalinis fatal threat madame mantalini wrung her hands and implored the interference of ralph nickleby and after a great quantity of tears and talking and several attempts on the part of mr mantalini to reach the door preparatory to straightway committing violence upon himself that gentleman was prevailed upon with difficulty to promise that he wouldnt be a body this great point attained madame mantalini argued the question of the allowance and mr mantalini did the same taking occasion to show that he could live with uncommon satisfaction upon bread and water and go clad in rags but that he could not support existence with the additional burden of being mistrusted by the object of his most devoted and disinterested affection this brought fresh tears into madame mantalinis eyes which having just begun to open to some few of the demerits of mr mantalini were only open a very little way and could be easily closed again the result was that without quite giving up the allowance question madame mantalini postponed its further consideration and ralph saw clearly enough that mr mantalini had gained a fresh lease of his easy life and that for some time longer at all events his degradation and downfall were postponed  but it will come soon enough thought ralph all lovebah that i should use the cant of boys and girlsis fleeting enough though that which has its sole root in the admiration of a whiskered face like that of yonder baboon perhaps lasts the longest as it originates in the greater blindness and is fed by vanity meantime the fools bring grist to my mill so let them live out their day and the longer it is the better  these agreeable reflections occurred to ralph nickleby as sundry small caresses and endearments supposed to be unseen were exchanged between the objects of his thoughts  if you have nothing more to say my dear to mr nickleby said madame mantalini we will take our leaves i am sure we have detained him much too long already  mr mantalini answered in the first instance by tapping madame mantalini several times on the nose and then by remarking in words that he had nothing more to say  demmit i have though he added almost immediately drawing ralph into a corner heres an affair about your friend sir mulberry such a demd extraordinary outoftheway kind of thing as never waseh  what do you mean asked ralph  dont you know demmit asked mr mantalini  i see by the paper that he was thrown from his cabriolet last night and severely injured and that his life is in some danger answered ralph with great composure but i see nothing extraordinary in thataccidents are not miraculous events when men live hard and drive after dinner  whew cried mr mantalini in a long shrill whistle then dont you know how it was  not unless it was as i have just supposed replied ralph shrugging his shoulders carelessly as if to give his questioner to understand that he had no curiosity upon the subject  demmit you amaze me cried mantalini  ralph shrugged his shoulders again as if it were no great feat to amaze mr mantalini and cast a wistful glance at the face of newman noggs which had several times appeared behind a couple of panes of glass in the room door it being a part of newmans duty when unimportant people called to make various feints of supposing that the bell had rung for him to show them out by way of a gentle hint to such visitors that it was time to go  dont you know said mr mantalini taking ralph by the button that it wasnt an accident at all but a demd furious manslaughtering attack made upon him by your nephew  what snarled ralph clenching his fists and turning a livid white  demmit nickleby youre as great a tiger as he is said mantalini alarmed at these demonstrations  go on cried ralph tell me what you mean what is this story who told you speak growled ralph do you hear me  gad nickleby said mr mantalini retreating towards his wife what a demneble fierce old evil genius you are youre enough to frighten the life and soul out of her little delicious witsflying all at once into such a blazing ravaging raging passion as never was demmit  pshaw rejoined ralph forcing a smile it is but manner  it is a demd uncomfortable privatemadhousesort of a manner said mr mantalini picking up his cane  ralph affected to smile and once more inquired from whom mr mantalini had derived his information  from pyke and a demd fine pleasant gentlemanly dog it is replied mantalini demnition pleasant and a tiptop sawyer  and what said he asked ralph knitting his brows  that it happened this waythat your nephew met him at a coffeehouse fell upon him with the most demneble ferocity followed him to his cab swore he would ride home with him if he rode upon the horses back or hooked himself on to the horses tail smashed his countenance which is a demd fine countenance in its natural state frightened the horse pitched out sir mulberry and himself and  and was killed interposed ralph with gleaming eyes was he is he dead  mantalini shook his head  ugh said ralph turning away then he has done nothing stay he added looking round again he broke a leg or an arm or put his shoulder out or fractured his collarbone or ground a rib or two his neck was saved for the halter but he got some painful and slowhealing injury for his trouble did he you must have heard that at least  no rejoined mantalini shaking his head again unless he was dashed into such little pieces that they blew away he wasnt hurt for he went off as quiet and comfortable asasas demnition said mr mantalini rather at a loss for a simile  and what said ralph hesitating a little what was the cause of quarrel  you are the demdest knowing hand replied mr mantalini in an admiring tone the cunningest rummest superlativest old foxoh demto pretend now not to know that it was the little brighteyed niecethe softest sweetest prettiest  alfred interposed madame mantalini  she is always right rejoined mr mantalini soothingly and when she says it is time to go it is time and go she shall and when she walks along the streets with her own tulip the women shall say with envy she has got a demd fine husband and the men shall say with rapture he has got a demd fine wife and they shall both be right and neither wrong upon my life and souloh demmit  with which remarks and many more no less intellectual and to the purpose mr mantalini kissed the fingers of his gloves to ralph nickleby and drawing his ladys arm through his led her mincingly away  so so muttered ralph dropping into his chair this devil is loose again and thwarting me as he was born to do at every turn he told me once there should be a day of reckoning between us sooner or later ill make him a true prophet for it shall surely come  are you at home asked newman suddenly popping in his head  no replied ralph with equal abruptness  newman withdrew his head but thrust it in again  youre quite sure youre not at home are you said newman  what does the idiot mean cried ralph testily  he has been waiting nearly ever since they first came in and may have heard your voicethats all said newman rubbing his hands  who has demanded ralph wrought by the intelligence he had just heard and his clerks provoking coolness to an intense pitch of irritation  the necessity of a reply was superseded by the unlookedfor entrance of a third partythe individual in questionwho bringing his one eye for he had but one to bear on ralph nickleby made a great many shambling bows and sat himself down in an armchair with his hands on his knees and his short black trousers drawn up so high in the legs by the exertion of seating himself that they scarcely reached below the tops of his wellington boots  why this is a surprise said ralph bending his gaze upon the visitor and half smiling as he scrutinised him attentively i should know your face mr squeers  ah replied that worthy and youd have knowd it better sir if it hadnt been for all that ive been agoing through just lift that little boy off the tall stool in the backoffice and tell him to come in here will you my man said squeers addressing himself to newman oh hes lifted hisself off my son sir little wackford what do you think of him sir for a specimen of the dotheboys hall feeding aint he fit to bust out of his clothes and start the seams and make the very buttons fly off with his fatness heres flesh cried squeers turning the boy about and indenting the plumpest parts of his figure with divers pokes and punches to the great discomposure of his son and heir heres firmness heres solidness why you can hardly get up enough of him between your finger and thumb to pinch him anywheres  in however good condition master squeers might have been he certainly did not present this remarkable compactness of person for on his fathers closing his finger and thumb in illustration of his remark he uttered a sharp cry and rubbed the place in the most natural manner possible  well remarked squeers a little disconcerted i had him there but thats because we breakfasted early this morning and he hasnt had his lunch yet why you couldnt shut a bit of him in a door when hes had his dinner look at them tears sir said squeers with a triumphant air as master wackford wiped his eyes with the cuff of his jacket theres oiliness  he looks well indeed returned ralph who for some purposes of his own seemed desirous to conciliate the schoolmaster but how is mrs squeers and how are you  mrs squeers sir replied the proprietor of dotheboys is as she always isa mother to them lads and a blessing and a comfort and a joy to all them as knows her one of our boysgorging hisself with vittles and then turning in thats their waygot a abscess on him last week to see how she operated upon him with a penknife oh lor said squeers heaving a sigh and nodding his head a great many times what a member of society that woman is  mr squeers indulged in a retrospective look for some quarter of a minute as if this allusion to his ladys excellences had naturally led his mind to the peaceful village of dotheboys near greta bridge in yorkshire and then looked at ralph as if waiting for him to say something  have you quite recovered that scoundrels attack asked ralph  ive only just done it if ive done it now replied squeers i was one blessed bruise sir said squeers touching first the roots of his hair and then the toes of his boots from here to there vinegar and brown paper vinegar and brown paper from morning to night i suppose there was a matter of half a ream of brown paper stuck upon me from first to last as i laid all of a heap in our kitchen plastered all over you might have thought i was a large brownpaper parcel chock full of nothing but groans did i groan loud wackford or did i groan soft asked mr squeers appealing to his son  loud replied wackford  was the boys sorry to see me in such a dreadful condition wackford or was they glad asked mr squeers in a sentimental manner  gl  eh cried squeers turning sharp round  sorry rejoined his son  oh said squeers catching him a smart box on the ear then take your hands out of your pockets and dont stammer when youre asked a question hold your noise sir in a gentlemans office or ill run away from my family and never come back any more and then what would become of all them precious and forlorn lads as would be let loose on the world without their best friend at their elbers  were you obliged to have medical attendance inquired ralph  ay was i rejoined squeers and a precious bill the medical attendant brought in too but i paid it though  ralph elevated his eyebrows in a manner which might be expressive of either sympathy or astonishmentjust as the beholder was pleased to take it  yes i paid it every farthing replied squeers who seemed to know the man he had to deal with too well to suppose that any blinking of the question would induce him to subscribe towards the expenses i wasnt out of pocket by it after all either  no said ralph  not a halfpenny replied squeers the fact is we have only one extra with our boys and that is for doctors when requiredand not then unless were sure of our customers do you see  i understand said ralph  very good rejoined squeers then after my bill was run up we picked out five little boys sons of small tradesmen as was sure pay that had never had the scarlet fever and we sent one to a cottage where theyd got it and he took it and then we put the four others to sleep with him and they took it and then the doctor came and attended em once all round and we divided my total among em and added it on to their little bills and the parents paid it ha ha ha  and a good plan too said ralph eyeing the schoolmaster stealthily  i believe you rejoined squeers we always do it why when mrs squeers was brought to bed with little wackford here we ran the hoopingcough through halfadozen boys and charged her expenses among em monthly nurse included ha ha ha  ralph never laughed but on this occasion he produced the nearest approach to it that he could and waiting until mr squeers had enjoyed the professional joke to his hearts content inquired what had brought him to town  some bothering law business replied squeers scratching his head connected with an action for what they call neglect of a boy i dont know what they would have he had as good grazing that boy had as there is about us  ralph looked as if he did not quite understand the observation  grazing said squeers raising his voice under the impression that as ralph failed to comprehend him he must be deaf when a boy gets weak and ill and dont relish his meals we give him a change of dietturn him out for an hour or so every day into a neighbours turnip field or sometimes if its a delicate case a turnip field and a piece of carrots alternately and let him eat as many as he likes there ant better land in the country than this perwerse lad grazed on and yet he goes and catches cold and indigestion and what not and then his friends brings a lawsuit against me now youd hardly suppose added squeers moving in his chair with the impatience of an illused man that peoples ingratitude would carry them quite as far as that would you  a hard case indeed observed ralph  you dont say more than the truth when you say that replied squeers i dont suppose theres a man going as possesses the fondness for youth that i do theres youth to the amount of eight hundred pound a year at dotheboys hall at this present time id take sixteen hundred pound worth if i could get em and be as fond of every individual twenty pound among em as nothing should equal it  are you stopping at your old quarters asked ralph  yes we are at the saracen replied squeers and as it dont want very long to the end of the halfyear we shall continney to stop there till ive collected the money and some new boys too i hope ive brought little wackford up on purpose to show to parents and guardians i shall put him in the advertisement this time look at that boyhimself a pupil why hes a miracle of high feeding that boy is  i should like to have a word with you said ralph who had both spoken and listened mechanically for some time and seemed to have been thinking  as many words as you like sir rejoined squeers wackford you go and play in the back office and dont move about too much or youll get thin and that wont do you havent got such a thing as twopence mr nickleby have you said squeers rattling a bunch of keys in his coat pocket and muttering something about its being all silver  ithink i have said ralph very slowly and producing after much rummaging in an old drawer a penny a halfpenny and two farthings  thankee said squeers bestowing it upon his son here you go and buy a tartmr nicklebys man will show you whereand mind you buy a rich one pastry added squeers closing the door on master wackford makes his flesh shine a good deal and parents thinks that a healthy sign  with this explanation and a peculiarly knowing look to eke it out mr squeers moved his chair so as to bring himself opposite to ralph nickleby at no great distance off and having planted it to his entire satisfaction sat down  attend to me said ralph bending forward a little  squeers nodded  i am not to suppose said ralph that you are dolt enough to forgive or forget very readily the violence that was committed upon you or the exposure which accompanied it  devil a bit replied squeers tartly  or to lose an opportunity of repaying it with interest if you could get one said ralph  show me one and try rejoined squeers  some such object it was that induced you to call on me said ralph raising his eyes to the schoolmasters face  nnno i dont know that replied squeers i thought that if it was in your power to make me besides the trifle of money you sent any compensation  ah cried ralph interrupting him you neednt go on  after a long pause during which ralph appeared absorbed in contemplation he again broke silence by asking  who is this boy that he took with him  squeers stated his name  was he young or old healthy or sickly tractable or rebellious speak out man retorted ralph  why he wasnt young answered squeers that is not young for a boy you know  that is he was not a boy at all i suppose interrupted ralph  well returned squeers briskly as if he felt relieved by the suggestion he might have been nigh twenty he wouldnt seem so old though to them as didnt know him for he was a little wanting here touching his forehead nobody at home you know if you knocked ever so often  and you did knock pretty often i dare say muttered ralph  pretty well returned squeers with a grin  when you wrote to acknowledge the receipt of this trifle of money as you call it said ralph you told me his friends had deserted him long ago and that you had not the faintest clue or trace to tell you who he was is that the truth  it is worse luck replied squeers becoming more and more easy and familiar in his manner as ralph pursued his inquiries with the less reserve its fourteen years ago by the entry in my book since a strange man brought him to my place one autumn night and left him there paying five pound five for his first quarter in advance he might have been five or six year old at that timenot more  what more do you know about him demanded ralph  devilish little im sorry to say replied squeers the money was paid for some six or eight year and then it stopped he had given an address in london had this chap but when it came to the point of course nobody knowed anything about him so i kept the lad out ofout of  charity suggested ralph drily  charity to be sure returned squeers rubbing his knees and when he begins to be useful in a certain sort of way this young scoundrel of a nickleby comes and carries him off but the most vexatious and aggeravating part of the whole affair is said squeers dropping his voice and drawing his chair still closer to ralph that some questions have been asked about him at lastnot of me but in a roundabout kind of way of people in our village so that just when i might have had all arrears paid up perhaps and perhapswho knows such things have happened in our business beforea present besides for putting him out to a farmer or sending him to sea so that he might never turn up to disgrace his parents supposing him to be a natural boy as many of our boys aredamme if that villain of a nickleby dont collar him in open day and commit as good as highway robbery upon my pocket  we will both cry quits with him before long said ralph laying his hand on the arm of the yorkshire schoolmaster  quits echoed squeers ah and i should like to leave a small balance in his favour to be settled when he can i only wish mrs squeers could catch hold of him bless her heart shed murder him mr nicklebyshe would as soon as eat her dinner  we will talk of this again said ralph i must have time to think of it to wound him through his own affections and fancies if i could strike him through this boy  strike him how you like sir interrupted squeers only hit him hard enough thats alland with that ill say goodmorning herejust chuck that little boys hat off that corner peg and lift him off the stool will you  bawling these requests to newman noggs mr squeers betook himself to the little backoffice and fitted on his childs hat with parental anxiety while newman with his pen behind his ear sat stiff and immovable on his stool regarding the father and son by turns with a broad stare  hes a fine boy ant he said squeers throwing his head a little on one side and falling back to the desk the better to estimate the proportions of little wackford  very said newman  pretty well swelled out ant he pursued squeers he has the fatness of twenty boys he has  ah replied newman suddenly thrusting his face into that of squeers he hasthe fatness of twentymore hes got it all god help that others ha ha oh lord  having uttered these fragmentary observations newman dropped upon his desk and began to write with most marvellous rapidity  why what does the man mean cried squeers colouring is he drunk  newman made no reply  is he mad said squeers  but still newman betrayed no consciousness of any presence save his own so mr squeers comforted himself by saying that he was both drunk and mad and with this parting observation he led his hopeful son away  in exact proportion as ralph nickleby became conscious of a struggling and lingering regard for kate had his detestation of nicholas augmented it might be that to atone for the weakness of inclining to any one person he held it necessary to hate some other more intensely than before but such had been the course of his feelings and now to be defied and spurned to be held up to her in the worst and most repulsive colours to know that she was taught to hate and despise him to feel that there was infection in his touch and taint in his companionshipto know all this and to know that the mover of it all was that same boyish poor relation who had twitted him in their very first interview and openly bearded and braved him since wrought his quiet and stealthy malignity to such a pitch that there was scarcely anything he would not have hazarded to gratify it if he could have seen his way to some immediate retaliation  but fortunately for nicholas ralph nickleby did not and although he cast about all that day and kept a corner of his brain working on the one anxious subject through all the round of schemes and business that came with it night found him at last still harping on the same theme and still pursuing the same unprofitable reflections  when my brother was such as he said ralph the first comparisons were drawn between usalways in my disfavour he was open liberal gallant gay i a crafty hunks of cold and stagnant blood with no passion but love of saving and no spirit beyond a thirst for gain i recollected it well when i first saw this whipster but i remember it better now  he had been occupied in tearing nicholass letter into atoms and as he spoke he scattered it in a tiny shower about him  recollections like these pursued ralph with a bitter smile flock upon mewhen i resign myself to themin crowds and from countless quarters as a portion of the world affect to despise the power of money i must try and show them what it is  and being by this time in a pleasant frame of mind for slumber ralph nickleby went to bed    chapter 35  smike becomes known to mrs nickleby and kate nicholas also meets with new acquaintances brighter days seem to dawn upon the family   having established his mother and sister in the apartments of the kindhearted miniature painter and ascertained that sir mulberry hawk was in no danger of losing his life nicholas turned his thoughts to poor smike who after breakfasting with newman noggs had remained in a disconsolate state at that worthy creatures lodgings waiting with much anxiety for further intelligence of his protector  as he will be one of our own little household wherever we live or whatever fortune is in reserve for us thought nicholas i must present the poor fellow in due form they will be kind to him for his own sake and if not on that account solely to the full extent i could wish they will stretch a point i am sure for mine  nicholas said they but his misgivings were confined to one person he was sure of kate but he knew his mothers peculiarities and was not quite so certain that smike would find favour in the eyes of mrs nickleby  however thought nicholas as he departed on his benevolent errand she cannot fail to become attached to him when she knows what a devoted creature he is and as she must quickly make the discovery his probation will be a short one  i was afraid said smike overjoyed to see his friend again that you had fallen into some fresh trouble the time seemed so long at last that i almost feared you were lost  lost replied nicholas gaily you will not be rid of me so easily i promise you i shall rise to the surface many thousand times yet and the harder the thrust that pushes me down the more quickly i shall rebound smike but come my errand here is to take you home  home faltered smike drawing timidly back  ay rejoined nicholas taking his arm why not  i had such hopes once said smike day and night day and night for many years i longed for home till i was weary and pined away with grief but now  and what now asked nicholas looking kindly in his face what now old friend  i could not part from you to go to any home on earth replied smike pressing his hand except one except one i shall never be an old man and if your hand placed me in the grave and i could think before i died that you would come and look upon it sometimes with one of your kind smiles and in the summer weather when everything was alivenot dead like mei could go to that home almost without a tear  why do you talk thus poor boy if your life is a happy one with me said nicholas  because i should change not those about me and if they forgot me i should never know it replied smike in the churchyard we are all alike but here there are none like me i am a poor creature but i know that  you are a foolish silly creature said nicholas cheerfully if that is what you mean i grant you that why heres a dismal face for ladies companymy pretty sister too whom you have so often asked me about is this your yorkshire gallantry for shame for shame  smike brightened up and smiled  when i talk of home pursued nicholas i talk of minewhich is yours of course if it were defined by any particular four walls and a roof god knows i should be sufficiently puzzled to say whereabouts it lay but that is not what i mean when i speak of home i speak of the place wherein default of a betterthose i love are gathered together and if that place were a gypsys tent or a barn i should call it by the same good name notwithstanding and now for what is my present home which however alarming your expectations may be will neither terrify you by its extent nor its magnificence  so saying nicholas took his companion by the arm and saying a great deal more to the same purpose and pointing out various things to amuse and interest him as they went along led the way to miss la creevys house  and this kate said nicholas entering the room where his sister sat alone is the faithful friend and affectionate fellowtraveller whom i prepared you to receive  poor smike was bashful and awkward and frightened enough at first but kate advanced towards him so kindly and said in such a sweet voice how anxious she had been to see him after all her brother had told her and how much she had to thank him for having comforted nicholas so greatly in their very trying reverses that he began to be very doubtful whether he should shed tears or not and became still more flurried however he managed to say in a broken voice that nicholas was his only friend and that he would lay down his life to help him and kate although she was so kind and considerate seemed to be so wholly unconscious of his distress and embarrassment that he recovered almost immediately and felt quite at home  then miss la creevy came in and to her smike had to be presented also and miss la creevy was very kind too and wonderfully talkative not to smike for that would have made him uneasy at first but to nicholas and his sister then after a time she would speak to smike himself now and then asking him whether he was a judge of likenesses and whether he thought that picture in the corner was like herself and whether he didnt think it would have looked better if she had made herself ten years younger and whether he didnt think as a matter of general observation that young ladies looked better not only in pictures but out of them too than old ones with many more small jokes and facetious remarks which were delivered with such goodhumour and merriment that smike thought within himself she was the nicest lady he had ever seen even nicer than mrs grudden of mr vincent crummless theatre and she was a nice lady too and talked perhaps more but certainly louder than miss la creevy  at length the door opened again and a lady in mourning came in and nicholas kissing the lady in mourning affectionately and calling her his mother led her towards the chair from which smike had risen when she entered the room  you are always kindhearted and anxious to help the oppressed my dear mother said nicholas so you will be favourably disposed towards him i know  i am sure my dear nicholas replied mrs nickleby looking very hard at her new friend and bending to him with something more of majesty than the occasion seemed to require i am sure any friend of yours has as indeed he naturally ought to have and must have of course you know a great claim upon me and of course it is a very great pleasure to me to be introduced to anybody you take an interest in there can be no doubt about that none at all not the least in the world said mrs nickleby at the same time i must say nicholas my dear as i used to say to your poor dear papa when he would bring gentlemen home to dinner and there was nothing in the house that if he had come the day before yesterdayno i dont mean the day before yesterday now i should have said perhaps the year before lastwe should have been better able to entertain him  with which remarks mrs nickleby turned to her daughter and inquired in an audible whisper whether the gentleman was going to stop all night  because if he is kate my dear said mrs nickleby i dont see that its possible for him to sleep anywhere and thats the truth  kate stepped gracefully forward and without any show of annoyance or irritation breathed a few words into her mothers ear  la kate my dear said mrs nickleby shrinking back how you do tickle one of course i understand that my love without your telling me and i said the same to nicholas and i am very much pleased you didnt tell me nicholas my dear added mrs nickleby turning round with an air of less reserve than she had before assumed what your friends name is  his name mother replied nicholas is smike  the effect of this communication was by no means anticipated but the name was no sooner pronounced than mrs nickleby dropped upon a chair and burst into a fit of crying  what is the matter exclaimed nicholas running to support her  its so like pyke cried mrs nickleby so exactly like pyke oh dont speak to mei shall be better presently  and after exhibiting every symptom of slow suffocation in all its stages and drinking about a teaspoonful of water from a full tumbler and spilling the remainder mrs nickleby was better and remarked with a feeble smile that she was very foolish she knew  its a weakness in our family said mrs nickleby so of course i cant be blamed for it your grandmama kate was exactly the sameprecisely the least excitement the slightest surpriseshe fainted away directly i have heard her say often and often that when she was a young lady and before she was married she was turning a corner into oxford street one day when she ran against her own hairdresser who it seems was escaping from a bearthe mere suddenness of the encounter made her faint away directly wait though added mrs nickleby pausing to consider let me be sure im right was it her hairdresser who had escaped from a bear or was it a bear who had escaped from her hairdressers i declare i cant remember just now but the hairdresser was a very handsome man i know and quite a gentleman in his manners so that it has nothing to do with the point of the story  mrs nickleby having fallen imperceptibly into one of her retrospective moods improved in temper from that moment and glided by an easy change of the conversation occasionally into various other anecdotes no less remarkable for their strict application to the subject in hand  mr smike is from yorkshire nicholas my dear said mrs nickleby after dinner and when she had been silent for some time  certainly mother replied nicholas i see you have not forgotten his melancholy history  o dear no cried mrs nickleby ah melancholy indeed you dont happen mr smike ever to have dined with the grimbles of grimble hall somewhere in the north riding do you said the good lady addressing herself to him a very proud man sir thomas grimble with six grownup and most lovely daughters and the finest park in the county  my dear mother reasoned nicholas do you suppose that the unfortunate outcast of a yorkshire school was likely to receive many cards of invitation from the nobility and gentry in the neighbourhood  really my dear i dont know why it should be so very extraordinary said mrs nickleby i know that when i was at school i always went at least twice every halfyear to the hawkinses at taunton vale and they are much richer than the grimbles and connected with them in marriage so you see its not so very unlikely after all  having put down nicholas in this triumphant manner mrs nickleby was suddenly seized with a forgetfulness of smikes real name and an irresistible tendency to call him mr slammons which circumstance she attributed to the remarkable similarity of the two names in point of sound both beginning with an s and moreover being spelt with an m but whatever doubt there might be on this point there was none as to his being a most excellent listener which circumstance had considerable influence in placing them on the very best terms and inducing mrs nickleby to express the highest opinion of his general deportment and disposition  thus the little circle remained on the most amicable and agreeable footing until the monday morning when nicholas withdrew himself from it for a short time seriously to reflect upon the state of his affairs and to determine if he could upon some course of life which would enable him to support those who were so entirely dependent upon his exertions  mr crummles occurred to him more than once but although kate was acquainted with the whole history of his connection with that gentleman his mother was not and he foresaw a thousand fretful objections on her part to his seeking a livelihood upon the stage there were graver reasons too against his returning to that mode of life independently of those arising out of its spare and precarious earnings and his own internal conviction that he could never hope to aspire to any great distinction even as a provincial actor how could he carry his sister from town to town and place to place and debar her from any other associates than those with whom he would be compelled almost without distinction to mingle it wont do said nicholas shaking his head i must try something else  it was much easier to make this resolution than to carry it into effect with no greater experience of the world than he had acquired for himself in his short trials with a sufficient share of headlong rashness and precipitation qualities not altogether unnatural at his time of life with a very slender stock of money and a still more scanty stock of friends what could he do egad said nicholas ill try that register office again  he smiled at himself as he walked away with a quick step for an instant before he had been internally blaming his own precipitation he did not laugh himself out of the intention however for on he went picturing to himself as he approached the place all kinds of splendid possibilities and impossibilities too for that matter and thinking himself perhaps with good reason very fortunate to be endowed with so buoyant and sanguine a temperament  the office looked just the same as when he had left it last and indeed with one or two exceptions there seemed to be the very same placards in the window that he had seen before there were the same unimpeachable masters and mistresses in want of virtuous servants and the same virtuous servants in want of unimpeachable masters and mistresses and the same magnificent estates for the investment of capital and the same enormous quantities of capital to be invested in estates and in short the same opportunities of all sorts for people who wanted to make their fortunes and a most extraordinary proof it was of the national prosperity that people had not been found to avail themselves of such advantages long ago  as nicholas stopped to look in at the window an old gentleman happened to stop too and nicholas carrying his eye along the windowpanes from left to right in search of some capitaltext placard which should be applicable to his own case caught sight of this old gentlemans figure and instinctively withdrew his eyes from the window to observe the same more closely  he was a sturdy old fellow in a broadskirted blue coat made pretty large to fit easily and with no particular waist his bulky legs clothed in drab breeches and high gaiters and his head protected by a lowcrowned broadbrimmed white hat such as a wealthy grazier might wear he wore his coat buttoned and his dimpled double chin rested in the folds of a white neckerchiefnot one of your stiffstarched apoplectic cravats but a good easy oldfashioned white neckcloth that a man might go to bed in and be none the worse for but what principally attracted the attention of nicholas was the old gentlemans eyenever was such a clear twinkling honest merry happy eye as that and there he stood looking a little upward with one hand thrust into the breast of his coat and the other playing with his oldfashioned gold watchchain his head thrown a little on one side and his hat a little more on one side than his head but that was evidently accident not his ordinary way of wearing it with such a pleasant smile playing about his mouth and such a comical expression of mingled slyness simplicity kindheartedness and goodhumour lighting up his jolly old face that nicholas would have been content to have stood there and looked at him until evening and to have forgotten meanwhile that there was such a thing as a soured mind or a crabbed countenance to be met with in the whole wide world  but even a very remote approach to this gratification was not to be made for although he seemed quite unconscious of having been the subject of observation he looked casually at nicholas and the latter fearful of giving offence resumed his scrutiny of the window instantly  still the old gentleman stood there glancing from placard to placard and nicholas could not forbear raising his eyes to his face again grafted upon the quaintness and oddity of his appearance was something so indescribably engaging and bespeaking so much worth and there were so many little lights hovering about the corners of his mouth and eyes that it was not a mere amusement but a positive pleasure and delight to look at him  this being the case it is no wonder that the old man caught nicholas in the fact more than once at such times nicholas coloured and looked embarrassed for the truth is that he had begun to wonder whether the stranger could by any possibility be looking for a clerk or secretary and thinking this he felt as if the old gentleman must know it  long as all this takes to tell it was not more than a couple of minutes in passing as the stranger was moving away nicholas caught his eye again and in the awkwardness of the moment stammered out an apology  no offence oh no offence said the old man  this was said in such a hearty tone and the voice was so exactly what it should have been from such a speaker and there was such a cordiality in the manner that nicholas was emboldened to speak again  a great many opportunities here sir he said half smiling as he motioned towards the window  a great many people willing and anxious to be employed have seriously thought so very often i dare say replied the old man poor fellows poor fellows  he moved away as he said this but seeing that nicholas was about to speak goodnaturedly slackened his pace as if he were unwilling to cut him short after a little of that hesitation which may be sometimes observed between two people in the street who have exchanged a nod and are both uncertain whether they shall turn back and speak or not nicholas found himself at the old mans side  you were about to speak young gentleman what were you going to say  merely that i almost hopedi mean to say thoughtyou had some object in consulting those advertisements said nicholas  ay ay what object nowwhat object returned the old man looking slyly at nicholas did you think i wanted a situation noweh did you think i did  nicholas shook his head  ha ha laughed the old gentleman rubbing his hands and wrists as if he were washing them a very natural thought at all events after seeing me gazing at those bills i thought the same of you at first upon my word i did  if you had thought so at last too sir you would not have been far from the truth rejoined nicholas  eh cried the old man surveying him from head to foot what dear me no no wellbehaved young gentleman reduced to such a necessity no no no no  nicholas bowed and bidding him goodmorning turned upon his heel  stay said the old man beckoning him into a bye street where they could converse with less interruption what dye mean eh  merely that your kind face and mannerboth so unlike any i have ever seentempted me into an avowal which to any other stranger in this wilderness of london i should not have dreamt of making returned nicholas  wilderness yes it is it is good it is a wilderness said the old man with much animation it was a wilderness to me once i came here barefoot i have never forgotten it thank god and he raised his hat from his head and looked very grave  whats the matter what is it how did it all come about said the old man laying his hand on the shoulder of nicholas and walking him up the street youreeh laying his finger on the sleeve of his black coat whos it for eh  my father replied nicholas  ah said the old gentleman quickly bad thing for a young man to lose his father widowed mother perhaps  nicholas sighed  brothers and sisters too eh  one sister rejoined nicholas  poor thing poor thing you are a scholar too i dare say said the old man looking wistfully into the face of the young one  i have been tolerably well educated said nicholas  fine thing said the old gentleman education a great thing a very great thing i never had any i admire it the more in others a very fine thing yes yes tell me more of your history let me hear it all no impertinent curiosityno no no  there was something so earnest and guileless in the way in which all this was said and such a complete disregard of all conventional restraints and coldnesses that nicholas could not resist it among men who have any sound and sterling qualities there is nothing so contagious as pure openness of heart nicholas took the infection instantly and ran over the main points of his little history without reserve merely suppressing names and touching as lightly as possible upon his uncles treatment of kate the old man listened with great attention and when he had concluded drew his arm eagerly through his own  dont say another word not another word said he come along with me we mustnt lose a minute  so saying the old gentleman dragged him back into oxford street and hailing an omnibus on its way to the city pushed nicholas in before him and followed himself  as he appeared in a most extraordinary condition of restless excitement and whenever nicholas offered to speak immediately interposed with dont say another word my dear sir on any accountnot another word the young man thought it better to attempt no further interruption into the city they journeyed accordingly without interchanging any conversation and the farther they went the more nicholas wondered what the end of the adventure could possibly be  the old gentleman got out with great alacrity when they reached the bank and once more taking nicholas by the arm hurried him along threadneedle street and through some lanes and passages on the right until they at length emerged in a quiet shady little square into the oldest and cleanestlooking house of business in the square he led the way the only inscription on the doorpost was cheeryble brothers but from a hasty glance at the directions of some packages which were lying about nicholas supposed that the brothers cheeryble were german merchants  passing through a warehouse which presented every indication of a thriving business mr cheeryble for such nicholas supposed him to be from the respect which had been shown him by the warehousemen and porters whom they passed led him into a little partitionedoff countinghouse like a large glass case in which countinghouse there satas free from dust and blemish as if he had been fixed into the glass case before the top was put on and had never come out sincea fat elderly largefaced clerk with silver spectacles and a powdered head  is my brother in his room tim said mr cheeryble with no less kindness of manner than he had shown to nicholas  yes he is sir replied the fat clerk turning his spectacleglasses towards his principal and his eyes towards nicholas but mr trimmers is with him  ay and what has he come about tim said mr cheeryble  he is getting up a subscription for the widow and family of a man who was killed in the east india docks this morning sir rejoined tim smashed sir by a cask of sugar  he is a good creature said mr cheeryble with great earnestness he is a kind soul i am very much obliged to trimmers trimmers is one of the best friends we have he makes a thousand cases known to us that we should never discover of ourselves i am very much obliged to trimmers saying which mr cheeryble rubbed his hands with infinite delight and mr trimmers happening to pass the door that instant on his way out shot out after him and caught him by the hand  i owe you a thousand thanks trimmers ten thousand thanks i take it very friendly of you very friendly indeed said mr cheeryble dragging him into a corner to get out of hearing how many children are there and what has my brother ned given trimmers  there are six children replied the gentleman and your brother has given us twenty pounds  my brother ned is a good fellow and youre a good fellow too trimmers said the old man shaking him by both hands with trembling eagerness put me down for another twentyorstop a minute stop a minute we mustnt look ostentatious put me down ten pound and tim linkinwater ten pound a cheque for twenty pound for mr trimmers tim god bless you trimmersand come and dine with us some day this week youll always find a knife and fork and we shall be delighted now my dear sircheque from mr linkinwater tim smashed by a cask of sugar and six poor childrenoh dear dear dear  talking on in this strain as fast as he could to prevent any friendly remonstrances from the collector of the subscription on the large amount of his donation mr cheeryble led nicholas equally astonished and affected by what he had seen and heard in this short space to the halfopened door of another room  brother ned said mr cheeryble tapping with his knuckles and stooping to listen are you busy my dear brother or can you spare time for a word or two with me  brother charles my dear fellow replied a voice from the inside so like in its tones to that which had just spoken that nicholas started and almost thought it was the same dont ask me such a question but come in directly  they went in without further parley what was the amazement of nicholas when his conductor advanced and exchanged a warm greeting with another old gentleman the very type and model of himselfthe same face the same figure the same coat waistcoat and neckcloth the same breeches and gaitersnay there was the very same white hat hanging against the wall  as they shook each other by the hand the face of each lighted up by beaming looks of affection which would have been most delightful to behold in infants and which in men so old was inexpressibly touching nicholas could observe that the last old gentleman was something stouter than his brother this and a slight additional shade of clumsiness in his gait and stature formed the only perceptible difference between them nobody could have doubted their being twin brothers  brother ned said nicholass friend closing the roomdoor here is a young friend of mine whom we must assist we must make proper inquiries into his statements in justice to him as well as to ourselves and if they are confirmedas i feel assured they will bewe must assist him we must assist him brother ned  it is enough my dear brother that you say we should returned the other when you say that no further inquiries are needed he shall be assisted what are his necessities and what does he require where is tim linkinwater let us have him here  both the brothers it may be here remarked had a very emphatic and earnest delivery both had lost nearly the same teeth which imparted the same peculiarity to their speech and both spoke as if besides possessing the utmost serenity of mind that the kindliest and most unsuspecting nature could bestow they had in collecting the plums from fortunes choicest pudding retained a few for present use and kept them in their mouths  where is tim linkinwater said brother ned  stop stop stop said brother charles taking the other aside ive a plan my dear brother ive a plan tim is getting old and tim has been a faithful servant brother ned and i dont think pensioning tims mother and sister and buying a little tomb for the family when his poor brother died was a sufficient recompense for his faithful services  no no no replied the other certainly not not half enough not half  if we could lighten tims duties said the old gentleman and prevail upon him to go into the country now and then and sleep in the fresh air besides two or three times a week which he could if he began business an hour later in the morning old tim linkinwater would grow young again in time and hes three good years our senior now old tim linkinwater young again eh brother ned eh why i recollect old tim linkinwater quite a little boy dont you ha ha ha poor tim poor tim  and the fine old fellows laughed pleasantly together each with a tear of regard for old tim linkinwater standing in his eye  but hear this firsthear this first brother ned said the old man hastily placing two chairs one on each side of nicholas ill tell it you myself brother ned because the young gentleman is modest and is a scholar ned and i shouldnt feel it right that he should tell us his story over and over again as if he was a beggar or as if we doubted him no no no  no no no returned the other nodding his head gravely very right my dear brother very right  he will tell me im wrong if i make a mistake said nicholass friend but whether i do or not youll be very much affected brother ned remembering the time when we were two friendless lads and earned our first shilling in this great city  the twins pressed each others hands in silence and in his own homely manner brother charles related the particulars he had heard from nicholas the conversation which ensued was a long one and when it was over a secret conference of almost equal duration took place between brother ned and tim linkinwater in another room it is no disparagement to nicholas to say that before he had been closeted with the two brothers ten minutes he could only wave his hand at every fresh expression of kindness and sympathy and sob like a little child  at length brother ned and tim linkinwater came back together when tim instantly walked up to nicholas and whispered in his ear in a very brief sentence for tim was ordinarily a man of few words that he had taken down the address in the strand and would call upon him that evening at eight having done which tim wiped his spectacles and put them on preparatory to hearing what more the brothers cheeryble had got to say  tim said brother charles you understand that we have an intention of taking this young gentleman into the countinghouse  brother ned remarked that tim was aware of that intention and quite approved of it and tim having nodded and said he did drew himself up and looked particularly fat and very important after which there was a profound silence  im not coming an hour later in the morning you know said tim breaking out all at once and looking very resolute im not going to sleep in the fresh air no nor im not going into the country either a pretty thing at this time of day certainly pho  damn your obstinacy tim linkinwater said brother charles looking at him without the faintest spark of anger and with a countenance radiant with attachment to the old clerk damn your obstinacy tim linkinwater what do you mean sir  its fortyfour year said tim making a calculation in the air with his pen and drawing an imaginary line before he cast it up fortyfour year next may since i first kept the books of cheeryble brothers ive opened the safe every morning all that time sundays excepted as the clock struck nine and gone over the house every night at halfpast ten except on foreign post nights and then twenty minutes before twelve to see the doors fastened and the fires out ive never slept out of the backattic one single night theres the same mignonette box in the middle of the window and the same four flowerpots two on each side that i brought with me when i first came there antive said it again and again and ill maintain itthere ant such a square as this in the world i know there ant said tim with sudden energy and looking sternly about him not one for business or pleasure in summertime or winteri dont care whichtheres nothing like it theres not such a spring in england as the pump under the archway theres not such a view in england as the view out of my window ive seen it every morning before i shaved and i ought to know something about it i have slept in that room added tim sinking his voice a little for fourandforty year and if it wasnt inconvenient and didnt interfere with business i should request leave to die there  damn you tim linkinwater how dare you talk about dying roared the twins by one impulse and blowing their old noses violently  thats what ive got to say mr edwin and mr charles said tim squaring his shoulders again this isnt the first time youve talked about superannuating me but if you please well make it the last and drop the subject for evermore  with these words tim linkinwater stalked out and shut himself up in his glass case with the air of a man who had had his say and was thoroughly resolved not to be put down  the brothers interchanged looks and coughed some halfdozen times without speaking  he must be done something with brother ned said the other warmly we must disregard his old scruples they cant be tolerated or borne he must be made a partner brother ned and if he wont submit to it peaceably we must have recourse to violence  quite right replied brother ned nodding his head as a man thoroughly determined quite right my dear brother if he wont listen to reason we must do it against his will and show him that we are determined to exert our authority we must quarrel with him brother charles  we must we certainly must have a quarrel with tim linkinwater said the other but in the meantime my dear brother we are keeping our young friend and the poor lady and her daughter will be anxious for his return so let us say goodbye for the present andthere theretake care of that box my dear sirandno no not a word now but be careful of the crossings and  and with any disjointed and unconnected words which would prevent nicholas from pouring forth his thanks the brothers hurried him out shaking hands with him all the way and affecting very unsuccessfullythey were poor hands at deceptionto be wholly unconscious of the feelings that completely mastered him  nicholass heart was too full to allow of his turning into the street until he had recovered some composure when he at last glided out of the dark doorway corner in which he had been compelled to halt he caught a glimpse of the twins stealthily peeping in at one corner of the glass case evidently undecided whether they should follow up their late attack without delay or for the present postpone laying further siege to the inflexible tim linkinwater  to recount all the delight and wonder which the circumstances just detailed awakened at miss la creevys and all the things that were done said thought expected hoped and prophesied in consequence is beside the present course and purpose of these adventures it is sufficient to state in brief that mr timothy linkinwater arrived punctual to his appointment that oddity as he was and jealous as he was bound to be of the proper exercise of his employers most comprehensive liberality he reported strongly and warmly in favour of nicholas and that next day he was appointed to the vacant stool in the countinghouse of cheeryble brothers with a present salary of one hundred and twenty pounds a year  and i think my dear brother said nicholass first friend that if we were to let them that little cottage at bow which is empty at something under the usual rent now eh brother ned  for nothing at all said brother ned we are rich and should be ashamed to touch the rent under such circumstances as these where is tim linkinwaterfor nothing at all my dear brother for nothing at all  perhaps it would be better to say something brother ned suggested the other mildly it would help to preserve habits of frugality you know and remove any painful sense of overwhelming obligations we might say fifteen pound or twenty pound and if it was punctually paid make it up to them in some other way and i might secretly advance a small loan towards a little furniture and you might secretly advance another small loan brother ned and if we find them doing wellas we shall theres no fear no fearwe can change the loans into gifts carefully brother ned and by degrees and without pressing upon them too much what do you say now brother  brother ned gave his hand upon it and not only said it should be done but had it done too and in one short week nicholas took possession of the stool and mrs nickleby and kate took possession of the house and all was hope bustle and lightheartedness  there surely never was such a week of discoveries and surprises as the first week of that cottage every night when nicholas came home something new had been found out one day it was a grapevine and another day it was a boiler and another day it was the key of the frontparlour closet at the bottom of the waterbutt and so on through a hundred items then this room was embellished with a muslin curtain and that room was rendered quite elegant by a windowblind and such improvements were made as no one would have supposed possible then there was miss la creevy who had come out in the omnibus to stop a day or two and help and who was perpetually losing a very small brownpaper parcel of tin tacks and a very large hammer and running about with her sleeves tucked up at the wrists and falling off pairs of steps and hurting herself very muchand mrs nickleby who talked incessantly and did something now and then but not oftenand kate who busied herself noiselessly everywhere and was pleased with everythingand smike who made the garden a perfect wonder to look uponand nicholas who helped and encouraged them every oneall the peace and cheerfulness of home restored with such new zest imparted to every frugal pleasure and such delight to every hour of meeting as misfortune and separation alone could give  in short the poor nicklebys were social and happy while the rich nickleby was alone and miserable    chapter 36  private and confidential relating to family matters showing how mr kenwigs underwent violent agitation and how mrs kenwigs was as well as could be expected   it might have been seven oclock in the evening and it was growing dark in the narrow streets near golden square when mr kenwigs sent out for a pair of the cheapest white kid glovesthose at fourteenpenceand selecting the strongest which happened to be the righthand one walked downstairs with an air of pomp and much excitement and proceeded to muffle the knob of the streetdoor knocker therein having executed this task with great nicety mr kenwigs pulled the door to after him and just stepped across the road to try the effect from the opposite side of the street satisfied that nothing could possibly look better in its way mr kenwigs then stepped back again and calling through the keyhole to morleena to open the door vanished into the house and was seen no longer  now considered as an abstract circumstance there was no more obvious cause or reason why mr kenwigs should take the trouble of muffling this particular knocker than there would have been for his muffling the knocker of any nobleman or gentleman resident ten miles off because for the greater convenience of the numerous lodgers the streetdoor always stood wide open and the knocker was never used at all the first floor the second floor and the third floor had each a bell of its own as to the attics no one ever called on them if anybody wanted the parlours they were close at hand and all he had to do was to walk straight into them while the kitchen had a separate entrance down the area steps as a question of mere necessity and usefulness therefore this muffling of the knocker was thoroughly incomprehensible  but knockers may be muffled for other purposes than those of mere utilitarianism as in the present instance was clearly shown there are certain polite forms and ceremonies which must be observed in civilised life or mankind relapse into their original barbarism no genteel lady was ever yet confinedindeed no genteel confinement can possibly take placewithout the accompanying symbol of a muffled knocker mrs kenwigs was a lady of some pretensions to gentility mrs kenwigs was confined and therefore mr kenwigs tied up the silent knocker on the premises in a white kid glove  im not quite certain neither said mr kenwigs arranging his shirtcollar and walking slowly upstairs whether as its a boy i wont have it in the papers  pondering upon the advisability of this step and the sensation it was likely to create in the neighbourhood mr kenwigs betook himself to the sittingroom where various extremely diminutive articles of clothing were airing on a horse before the fire and mr lumbey the doctor was dandling the babythat is the old babynot the new one  its a fine boy mr kenwigs said mr lumbey the doctor  you consider him a fine boy do you sir returned mr kenwigs  its the finest boy i ever saw in all my life said the doctor i never saw such a baby  it is a pleasant thing to reflect upon and furnishes a complete answer to those who contend for the gradual degeneration of the human species that every baby born into the world is a finer one than the last  i never saw such a baby said mr lumbey the doctor  morleena was a fine baby remarked mr kenwigs as if this were rather an attack by implication upon the family  they were all fine babies said mr lumbey and mr lumbey went on nursing the baby with a thoughtful look whether he was considering under what head he could best charge the nursing in the bill was best known to himself  during this short conversation miss morleena as the eldest of the family and natural representative of her mother during her indisposition had been hustling and slapping the three younger miss kenwigses without intermission which considerate and affectionate conduct brought tears into the eyes of mr kenwigs and caused him to declare that in understanding and behaviour that child was a woman  she will be a treasure to the man she marries sir said mr kenwigs half aside i think shell marry above her station mr lumbey  i shouldnt wonder at all replied the doctor  you never see her dance sir did you asked mr kenwigs  the doctor shook his head  ay said mr kenwigs as though he pitied him from his heart then you dont know what shes capable of  all this time there had been a great whisking in and out of the other room the door had been opened and shut very softly about twenty times a minute for it was necessary to keep mrs kenwigs quiet and the baby had been exhibited to a score or two of deputations from a select body of female friends who had assembled in the passage and about the streetdoor to discuss the event in all its bearings indeed the excitement extended itself over the whole street and groups of ladies might be seen standing at the doors some in the interesting condition in which mrs kenwigs had last appeared in public relating their experiences of similar occurrences some few acquired great credit from having prophesied the day before yesterday exactly when it would come to pass others again related how that they guessed what it was directly they saw mr kenwigs turn pale and run up the street as hard as ever he could go some said one thing and some another but all talked together and all agreed upon two points first that it was very meritorious and highly praiseworthy in mrs kenwigs to do as she had done and secondly that there never was such a skilful and scientific doctor as that dr lumbey  in the midst of this general hubbub dr lumbey sat in the firstfloor front as before related nursing the deposed baby and talking to mr kenwigs he was a stout blufflooking gentleman with no shirtcollar to speak of and a beard that had been growing since yesterday morning for dr lumbey was popular and the neighbourhood was prolific and there had been no less than three other knockers muffled one after the other within the last fortyeight hours  well mr kenwigs said dr lumbey this makes six youll have a fine family in time sir  i think six is almost enough sir returned mr kenwigs  pooh pooh said the doctor nonsense not half enough  with this the doctor laughed but he didnt laugh half as much as a married friend of mrs kenwigss who had just come in from the sick chamber to report progress and take a small sip of brandyandwater and who seemed to consider it one of the best jokes ever launched upon society  theyre not altogether dependent upon good fortune neither said mr kenwigs taking his second daughter on his knee they have expectations  oh indeed said mr lumbey the doctor  and very good ones too i believe havent they asked the married lady  why maam said mr kenwigs its not exactly for me to say what they may be or what they may not be its not for me to boast of any family with which i have the honour to be connected at the same time mrs kenwigss isi should say said mr kenwigs abruptly and raising his voice as he spoke that my children might come into a matter of a hundred pound apiece perhaps perhaps more but certainly that  and a very pretty little fortune said the married lady  there are some relations of mrs kenwigss said mr kenwigs taking a pinch of snuff from the doctors box and then sneezing very hard for he wasnt used to it that might leave their hundred pound apiece to ten people and yet not go begging when they had done it  ah i know who you mean observed the married lady nodding her head  i made mention of no names and i wish to make mention of no names said mr kenwigs with a portentous look many of my friends have met a relation of mrs kenwigss in this very room as would do honour to any company thats all  ive met him said the married lady with a glance towards dr lumbey  its naterally very gratifying to my feelings as a father to see such a man as that a kissing and taking notice of my children pursued mr kenwigs its naterally very gratifying to my feelings as a man to know that man it will be naterally very gratifying to my feelings as a husband to make that man acquainted with this ewent  having delivered his sentiments in this form of words mr kenwigs arranged his second daughters flaxen tail and bade her be a good girl and mind what her sister morleena said  that girl grows more like her mother every day said mr lumbey suddenly stricken with an enthusiastic admiration of morleena  there rejoined the married lady what i always say what i always did say shes the very picter of her having thus directed the general attention to the young lady in question the married lady embraced the opportunity of taking another sip of the brandyandwaterand a pretty long sip too  yes there is a likeness said mr kenwigs after some reflection but such a woman as mrs kenwigs was afore she was married good gracious such a woman  mr lumbey shook his head with great solemnity as though to imply that he supposed she must have been rather a dazzler  talk of fairies cried mr kenwigs i never see anybody so light to be alive never such manners too so playful and yet so sewerely proper as for her figure it isnt generally known said mr kenwigs dropping his voice but her figure was such at that time that the sign of the britannia over in the holloway road was painted from it  but only see what it is now urged the married lady does she look like the mother of six  quite ridiculous cried the doctor  she looks a deal more like her own daughter said the married lady  so she does assented mr lumbey a great deal more  mr kenwigs was about to make some further observations most probably in confirmation of this opinion when another married lady who had looked in to keep up mrs kenwigss spirits and help to clear off anything in the eating and drinking way that might be going about put in her head to announce that she had just been down to answer the bell and that there was a gentleman at the door who wanted to see mr kenwigs most particular  shadowy visions of his distinguished relation flitted through the brain of mr kenwigs as this message was delivered and under their influence he dispatched morleena to show the gentleman up straightway  why i do declare said mr kenwigs standing opposite the door so as to get the earliest glimpse of the visitor as he came upstairs its mr johnson how do you find yourself sir  nicholas shook hands kissed his old pupils all round intrusted a large parcel of toys to the guardianship of morleena bowed to the doctor and the married ladies and inquired after mrs kenwigs in a tone of interest which went to the very heart and soul of the nurse who had come in to warm some mysterious compound in a little saucepan over the fire  i ought to make a hundred apologies to you for calling at such a season said nicholas but i was not aware of it until i had rung the bell and my time is so fully occupied now that i feared it might be some days before i could possibly come again  no time like the present sir said mr kenwigs the sitiwation of mrs kenwigs sir is no obstacle to a little conversation between you and me i hope  you are very good said nicholas  at this juncture proclamation was made by another married lady that the baby had begun to eat like anything whereupon the two married ladies already mentioned rushed tumultuously into the bedroom to behold him in the act  the fact is resumed nicholas that before i left the country where i have been for some time past i undertook to deliver a message to you  ay ay said mr kenwigs  and i have been added nicholas already in town for some days without having had an opportunity of doing so  its no matter sir said mr kenwigs i dare say its none the worse for keeping cold message from the country said mr kenwigs ruminating thats curious i dont know anybody in the country  miss petowker suggested nicholas  oh from her is it said mr kenwigs oh dear yes ah mrs kenwigs will be glad to hear from her henrietta petowker eh how odd things come about now that you should have met her in the country well  hearing this mention of their old friends name the four miss kenwigses gathered round nicholas open eyed and mouthed to hear more mr kenwigs looked a little curious too but quite comfortable and unsuspecting  the message relates to family matters said nicholas hesitating  oh never mind said kenwigs glancing at mr lumbey who having rashly taken charge of little lillyvick found nobody disposed to relieve him of his precious burden all friends here  nicholas hemmed once or twice and seemed to have some difficulty in proceeding  at portsmouth henrietta petowker is observed mr kenwigs  yes said nicholas mr lillyvick is there  mr kenwigs turned pale but he recovered and said that was an odd coincidence also  the message is from him said nicholas  mr kenwigs appeared to revive he knew that his niece was in a delicate state and had no doubt sent word that they were to forward full particulars yes that was very kind of him so like him too  he desired me to give his kindest love said nicholas  very much obliged to him im sure your greatuncle lillyvick my dears interposed mr kenwigs condescendingly explaining it to the children  his kindest love resumed nicholas and to say that he had no time to write but that he was married to miss petowker  mr kenwigs started from his seat with a petrified stare caught his second daughter by her flaxen tail and covered his face with his pockethandkerchief morleena fell all stiff and rigid into the babys chair as she had seen her mother fall when she fainted away and the two remaining little kenwigses shrieked in affright  my children my defrauded swindled infants cried mr kenwigs pulling so hard in his vehemence at the flaxen tail of his second daughter that he lifted her up on tiptoe and kept her for some seconds in that attitude villain ass traitor  drat the man cried the nurse looking angrily around what does he mean by making that noise here  silence woman said mr kenwigs fiercely  i wont be silent returned the nurse be silent yourself you wretch have you no regard for your baby  no returned mr kenwigs  more shame for you retorted the nurse ugh you unnatural monster  let him die cried mr kenwigs in the torrent of his wrath let him die he has no expectations no property to come into we want no babies here said mr kenwigs recklessly take em away take em away to the fondling  with these awful remarks mr kenwigs sat himself down in a chair and defied the nurse who made the best of her way into the adjoining room and returned with a stream of matrons declaring that mr kenwigs had spoken blasphemy against his family and must be raving mad  appearances were certainly not in mr kenwigss favour for the exertion of speaking with so much vehemence and yet in such a tone as should prevent his lamentations reaching the ears of mrs kenwigs had made him very black in the face besides which the excitement of the occasion and an unwonted indulgence in various strong cordials to celebrate it had swollen and dilated his features to a most unusual extent but nicholas and the doctorwho had been passive at first doubting very much whether mr kenwigs could be in earnestinterfering to explain the immediate cause of his condition the indignation of the matrons was changed to pity and they implored him with much feeling to go quietly to bed  the attention said mr kenwigs looking around with a plaintive air the attention that ive shown to that man the hyseters he has eat and the pints of ale he has drank in this house  its very trying and very hard to bear we know said one of the married ladies but think of your dear darling wife  oh yes and what shes been a undergoing of only this day cried a great many voices theres a good man do  the presents that have been made to him said mr kenwigs reverting to his calamity the pipes the snuffboxesa pair of indiarubber goloshes that cost sixandsix  ah it wont bear thinking of indeed cried the matrons generally but itll all come home to him never fear  mr kenwigs looked darkly upon the ladies as if he would prefer its all coming home to him as there was nothing to be got by it but he said nothing and resting his head upon his hand subsided into a kind of doze  then the matrons again expatiated on the expediency of taking the good gentleman to bed observing that he would be better tomorrow and that they knew what was the wear and tear of some mens minds when their wives were taken as mrs kenwigs had been that day and that it did him great credit and there was nothing to be ashamed of in it far from it they liked to see it they did for it showed a good heart and one lady observed as a case bearing upon the present that her husband was often quite lightheaded from anxiety on similar occasions and that once when her little johnny was born it was nearly a week before he came to himself again during the whole of which time he did nothing but cry is it a boy is it a boy in a manner which went to the hearts of all his hearers  at length morleena who quite forgot she had fainted when she found she was not noticed announced that a chamber was ready for her afflicted parent and mr kenwigs having partially smothered his four daughters in the closeness of his embrace accepted the doctors arm on one side and the support of nicholas on the other and was conducted upstairs to a bedroom which been secured for the occasion  having seen him sound asleep and heard him snore most satisfactorily and having further presided over the distribution of the toys to the perfect contentment of all the little kenwigses nicholas took his leave the matrons dropped off one by one with the exception of six or eight particular friends who had determined to stop all night the lights in the houses gradually disappeared the last bulletin was issued that mrs kenwigs was as well as could be expected and the whole family were left to their repose    chapter 37  nicholas finds further favour in the eyes of the brothers cheeryble and mr timothy linkinwater the brothers give a banquet on a great annual occasion nicholas on returning home from it receives a mysterious and important disclosure from the lips of mrs nickleby   the square in which the countinghouse of the brothers cheeryble was situated although it might not wholly realise the very sanguine expectations which a stranger would be disposed to form on hearing the fervent encomiums bestowed upon it by tim linkinwater was nevertheless a sufficiently desirable nook in the heart of a busy town like london and one which occupied a high place in the affectionate remembrances of several grave persons domiciled in the neighbourhood whose recollections however dated from a much more recent period and whose attachment to the spot was far less absorbing than were the recollections and attachment of the enthusiastic tim  and let not those whose eyes have been accustomed to the aristocratic gravity of grosvenor square and hanover square the dowager barrenness and frigidity of fitzroy square or the gravel walks and garden seats of the squares of russell and euston suppose that the affections of tim linkinwater or the inferior lovers of this particular locality had been awakened and kept alive by any refreshing associations with leaves however dingy or grass however bare and thin the city square has no enclosure save the lamppost in the middle and no grass but the weeds which spring up round its base it is a quiet littlefrequented retired spot favourable to melancholy and contemplation and appointments of longwaiting and up and down its every side the appointed saunters idly by the hour together wakening the echoes with the monotonous sound of his footsteps on the smooth worn stones and counting first the windows and then the very bricks of the tall silent houses that hem him round about in wintertime the snow will linger there long after it has melted from the busy streets and highways the summers sun holds it in some respect and while he darts his cheerful rays sparingly into the square keeps his fiery heat and glare for noisier and lessimposing precincts it is so quiet that you can almost hear the ticking of your own watch when you stop to cool in its refreshing atmosphere there is a distant humof coaches not of insectsbut no other sound disturbs the stillness of the square the ticket porter leans idly against the post at the corner comfortably warm but not hot although the day is broiling his white apron flaps languidly in the air his head gradually droops upon his breast he takes very long winks with both eyes at once even he is unable to withstand the soporific influence of the place and is gradually falling asleep but now he starts into full wakefulness recoils a step or two and gazes out before him with eager wildness in his eye is it a job or a boy at marbles does he see a ghost or hear an organ no sight more unwonted stillthere is a butterfly in the squarea real live butterfly astray from flowers and sweets and fluttering among the iron heads of the dusty area railings  but if there were not many matters immediately without the doors of cheeryble brothers to engage the attention or distract the thoughts of the young clerk there were not a few within to interest and amuse him there was scarcely an object in the place animate or inanimate which did not partake in some degree of the scrupulous method and punctuality of mr timothy linkinwater punctual as the countinghouse dial which he maintained to be the best timekeeper in london next after the clock of some old hidden unknown church hard by for tim held the fabled goodness of that at the horse guards to be a pleasant fiction invented by jealous westenders the old clerk performed the minutest actions of the day and arranged the minutest articles in the little room in a precise and regular order which could not have been exceeded if it had actually been a real glass case fitted with the choicest curiosities paper pens ink ruler sealingwax wafers pouncebox stringbox firebox tims hat tims scrupulouslyfolded gloves tims other coatlooking precisely like a back view of himself as it hung against the wallall had their accustomed inches of space except the clock there was not such an accurate and unimpeachable instrument in existence as the little thermometer which hung behind the door there was not a bird of such methodical and businesslike habits in all the world as the blind blackbird who dreamed and dozed away his days in a large snug cage and had lost his voice from old age years before tim first bought him there was not such an eventful story in the whole range of anecdote as tim could tell concerning the acquisition of that very bird how compassionating his starved and suffering condition he had purchased him with the view of humanely terminating his wretched life how he determined to wait three days and see whether the bird revived how before half the time was out the bird did revive and how he went on reviving and picking up his appetite and good looks until he gradually became whatwhat you see him now sirtim would say glancing proudly at the cage and with that tim would utter a melodious chirrup and cry dick and dick who for any sign of life he had previously given might have been a wooden or stuffed representation of a blackbird indifferently executed would come to the side of the cage in three small jumps and thrusting his bill between the bars turn his sightless head towards his old masterand at that moment it would be very difficult to determine which of the two was the happier the bird or tim linkinwater  nor was this all everything gave back besides some reflection of the kindly spirit of the brothers the warehousemen and porters were such sturdy jolly fellows that it was a treat to see them among the shipping announcements and steampacket lists which decorated the countinghouse wall were designs for almshouses statements of charities and plans for new hospitals a blunderbuss and two swords hung above the chimneypiece for the terror of evildoers but the blunderbuss was rusty and shattered and the swords were broken and edgeless elsewhere their open display in such a condition would have realised a smile but there it seemed as though even violent and offensive weapons partook of the reigning influence and became emblems of mercy and forbearance  such thoughts as these occurred to nicholas very strongly on the morning when he first took possession of the vacant stool and looked about him more freely and at ease than he had before enjoyed an opportunity of doing perhaps they encouraged and stimulated him to exertion for during the next two weeks all his spare hours late at night and early in the morning were incessantly devoted to acquiring the mysteries of bookkeeping and some other forms of mercantile account to these he applied himself with such steadiness and perseverance that although he brought no greater amount of previous knowledge to the subject than certain dim recollections of two or three very long sums entered into a cipheringbook at school and relieved for parental inspection by the effigy of a fat swan tastefully flourished by the writingmasters own hand he found himself at the end of a fortnight in a condition to report his proficiency to mr linkinwater and to claim his promise that he nicholas nickleby should now be allowed to assist him in his graver labours  it was a sight to behold tim linkinwater slowly bring out a massive ledger and daybook and after turning them over and over and affectionately dusting their backs and sides open the leaves here and there and cast his eyes half mournfully half proudly upon the fair and unblotted entries  fourandforty year next may said tim many new ledgers since then fourandforty year  tim closed the book again  come come said nicholas i am all impatience to begin  tim linkinwater shook his head with an air of mild reproof mr nickleby was not sufficiently impressed with the deep and awful nature of his undertaking suppose there should be any mistakeany scratching out  young men are adventurous it is extraordinary what they will rush upon sometimes without even taking the precaution of sitting himself down upon his stool but standing leisurely at the desk and with a smile upon his faceactually a smilethere was no mistake about it mr linkinwater often mentioned it afterwardsnicholas dipped his pen into the inkstand before him and plunged into the books of cheeryble brothers  tim linkinwater turned pale and tilting up his stool on the two legs nearest nicholas looked over his shoulder in breathless anxiety brother charles and brother ned entered the countinghouse together but tim linkinwater without looking round impatiently waved his hand as a caution that profound silence must be observed and followed the nib of the inexperienced pen with strained and eager eyes  the brothers looked on with smiling faces but tim linkinwater smiled not nor moved for some minutes at length he drew a long slow breath and still maintaining his position on the tilted stool glanced at brother charles secretly pointed with the feather of his pen towards nicholas and nodded his head in a grave and resolute manner plainly signifying hell do  brother charles nodded again and exchanged a laughing look with brother ned but just then nicholas stopped to refer to some other page and tim linkinwater unable to contain his satisfaction any longer descended from his stool and caught him rapturously by the hand  he has done it said tim looking round at his employers and shaking his head triumphantly his capital bs and ds are exactly like mine he dots all his small is and crosses every t as he writes it there ant such a young man as this in all london said tim clapping nicholas on the back not one dont tell me the city cant produce his equal i challenge the city to do it  with this casting down of his gauntlet tim linkinwater struck the desk such a blow with his clenched fist that the old blackbird tumbled off his perch with the start it gave him and actually uttered a feeble croak in the extremity of his astonishment  well said timwell said tim linkinwater cried brother charles scarcely less pleased than tim himself and clapping his hands gently as he spoke i knew our young friend would take great pains and i was quite certain he would succeed in no time didnt i say so brother ned  you did my dear brother certainly my dear brother you said so and you were quite right replied ned quite right tim linkinwater is excited but he is justly excited properly excited tim is a fine fellow tim linkinwater siryoure a fine fellow  heres a pleasant thing to think of said tim wholly regardless of this address to himself and raising his spectacles from the ledger to the brothers heres a pleasant thing do you suppose i havent often thought of what would become of these books when i was gone do you suppose i havent often thought that things might go on irregular and untidy here after i was taken away but now said tim extending his forefinger towards nicholas now when ive shown him a little more im satisfied the business will go on when im dead as well as it did when i was alivejust the sameand i shall have the satisfaction of knowing that there never were such booksnever were such books no nor never will be such booksas the books of cheeryble brothers  having thus expressed his sentiments mr linkinwater gave vent to a short laugh indicative of defiance to the cities of london and westminster and turning again to his desk quietly carried seventysix from the last column he had added up and went on with his work  tim linkinwater sir said brother charles give me your hand sir this is your birthday how dare you talk about anything else till you have been wished many happy returns of the day tim linkinwater god bless you tim god bless you  my dear brother said the other seizing tims disengaged fist tim linkinwater looks ten years younger than he did on his last birthday  brother ned my dear boy returned the other old fellow i believe that tim linkinwater was born a hundred and fifty years old and is gradually coming down to fiveandtwenty for hes younger every birthday than he was the year before  so he is brother charles so he is replied brother ned theres not a doubt about it  remember tim said brother charles that we dine at halfpast five today instead of two oclock we always depart from our usual custom on this anniversary as you very well know tim linkinwater mr nickleby my dear sir you will make one tim linkinwater give me your snuffbox as a remembrance to brother charles and myself of an attached and faithful rascal and take that in exchange as a feeble mark of our respect and esteem and dont open it until you go to bed and never say another word upon the subject or ill kill the blackbird a dog he should have had a golden cage halfadozen years ago if it would have made him or his master a bit the happier now brother ned my dear fellow im ready at halfpast five remember mr nickleby tim linkinwater sir take care of mr nickleby at halfpast five now brother ned  chattering away thus according to custom to prevent the possibility of any thanks or acknowledgment being expressed on the other side the twins trotted off arminarm having endowed tim linkinwater with a costly gold snuffbox enclosing a bank note worth more than its value ten times told  at a quarter past five oclock punctual to the minute arrived according to annual usage tim linkinwaters sister and a great todo there was between tim linkinwaters sister and the old housekeeper respecting tim linkinwaters sisters cap which had been dispatched per boy from the house of the family where tim linkinwaters sister boarded and had not yet come to hand notwithstanding that it had been packed up in a bandbox and the bandbox in a handkerchief and the handkerchief tied on to the boys arm and notwithstanding too that the place of its consignment had been duly set forth at full length on the back of an old letter and the boy enjoined under pain of divers horrible penalties the full extent of which the eye of man could not foresee to deliver the same with all possible speed and not to loiter by the way tim linkinwaters sister lamented the housekeeper condoled and both kept thrusting their heads out of the secondfloor window to see if the boy was comingwhich would have been highly satisfactory and upon the whole tantamount to his being come as the distance to the corner was not quite five yardswhen all of a sudden and when he was least expected the messenger carrying the bandbox with elaborate caution appeared in an exactly opposite direction puffing and panting for breath and flushed with recent exercise as well he might be for he had taken the air in the first instance behind a hackney coach that went to camberwell and had followed two punches afterwards and had seen the stilts home to their own door the cap was all safe howeverthat was one comfortand it was no use scolding himthat was another so the boy went upon his way rejoicing and tim linkinwaters sister presented herself to the company belowstairs just five minutes after the halfhour had struck by tim linkinwaters own infallible clock  the company consisted of the brothers cheeryble tim linkinwater a ruddyfaced whiteheaded friend of tims who was a superannuated bank clerk and nicholas who was presented to tim linkinwaters sister with much gravity and solemnity the party being now completed brother ned rang for dinner and dinner being shortly afterwards announced led tim linkinwaters sister into the next room where it was set forth with great preparation then brother ned took the head of the table and brother charles the foot and tim linkinwaters sister sat on the left hand of brother ned and tim linkinwater himself on his right and an ancient butler of apoplectic appearance and with very short legs took up his position at the back of brother neds armchair and waving his right arm preparatory to taking off the covers with a flourish stood bolt upright and motionless  for these and all other blessings brother charles said ned  lord make us truly thankful brother ned said charles  whereupon the apoplectic butler whisked off the top of the soup tureen and shot all at once into a state of violent activity  there was abundance of conversation and little fear of its ever flagging for the goodhumour of the glorious old twins drew everybody out and tim linkinwaters sister went off into a long and circumstantial account of tim linkinwaters infancy immediately after the very first glass of champagnetaking care to premise that she was very much tims junior and had only become acquainted with the facts from their being preserved and handed down in the family this history concluded brother ned related how that exactly thirtyfive years ago tim linkinwater was suspected to have received a loveletter and how that vague information had been brought to the countinghouse of his having been seen walking down cheapside with an uncommonly handsome spinster at which there was a roar of laughter and tim linkinwater being charged with blushing and called upon to explain denied that the accusation was true and further that there would have been any harm in it if it had been which last position occasioned the superannuated bank clerk to laugh tremendously and to declare that it was the very best thing he had ever heard in his life and that tim linkinwater might say a great many things before he said anything which would beat that  there was one little ceremony peculiar to the day both the matter and manner of which made a very strong impression upon nicholas the cloth having been removed and the decanters sent round for the first time a profound silence succeeded and in the cheerful faces of the brothers there appeared an expression not of absolute melancholy but of quiet thoughtfulness very unusual at a festive table as nicholas struck by this sudden alteration was wondering what it could portend the brothers rose together and the one at the top of the table leaning forward towards the other and speaking in a low voice as if he were addressing him individually said  brother charles my dear fellow there is another association connected with this day which must never be forgotten and never can be forgotten by you and me this day which brought into the world a most faithful and excellent and exemplary fellow took from it the kindest and very best of parents the very best of parents to us both i wish that she could have seen us in our prosperity and shared it and had the happiness of knowing how dearly we loved her in it as we did when we were two poor boys but that was not to be my dear brotherthe memory of our mother  good lord thought nicholas and there are scores of people of their own station knowing all this and twenty thousand times more who wouldnt ask these men to dinner because they eat with their knives and never went to school  but there was no time to moralise for the joviality again became very brisk and the decanter of port being nearly out brother ned pulled the bell which was instantly answered by the apoplectic butler  david said brother ned  sir replied the butler  a magnum of the doublediamond david to drink the health of mr linkinwater  instantly by a feat of dexterity which was the admiration of all the company and had been annually for some years past the apoplectic butler bringing his left hand from behind the small of his back produced the bottle with the corkscrew already inserted uncorked it at a jerk and placed the magnum and the cork before his master with the dignity of conscious cleverness  ha said brother ned first examining the cork and afterwards filling his glass while the old butler looked complacently and amiably on as if it were all his own property but the company were quite welcome to make free with it this looks well david  it ought to sir replied david youd be troubled to find such a glass of wine as is our doublediamond and that mr linkinwater knows very well that was laid down when mr linkinwater first come that wine was gentlemen  nay david nay interposed brother charles  i wrote the entry in the cellarbook myself sir if you please said david in the tone of a man quite confident in the strength of his facts mr linkinwater had only been here twenty year sir when that pipe of doublediamond was laid down  david is quite right quite right brother charles said ned are the people here david  outside the door sir replied the butler  show em in david show em in  at this bidding the older butler placed before his master a small tray of clean glasses and opening the door admitted the jolly porters and warehousemen whom nicholas had seen below they were four in all and as they came in bowing and grinning and blushing the housekeeper and cook and housemaid brought up the rear  seven said brother ned filling a corresponding number of glasses with the doublediamond and david eight there now youre all of you to drink the health of your best friend mr timothy linkinwater and wish him health and long life and many happy returns of this day both for his own sake and that of your old masters who consider him an inestimable treasure tim linkinwater sir your health devil take you tim linkinwater sir god bless you  with this singular contradiction of terms brother ned gave tim linkinwater a slap on the back which made him look for the moment almost as apoplectic as the butler and tossed off the contents of his glass in a twinkling  the toast was scarcely drunk with all honour to tim linkinwater when the sturdiest and jolliest subordinate elbowed himself a little in advance of his fellows and exhibiting a very hot and flushed countenance pulled a single lock of grey hair in the middle of his forehead as a respectful salute to the company and delivered himself as followsrubbing the palms of his hands very hard on a blue cotton handkerchief as he did so  were allowed to take a liberty once a year genlemen and if you please well take it now there being no time like the present and no two birds in the hand worth one in the bush as is well knownleastways in a contrairy sense which the meaning is the same a pausethe butler unconvinced what we mean to say is that there never was looking at the butlersuchlooking at the cook nobleexcellentlooking everywhere and seeing nobody free generousspirited masters as them as has treated us so handsome this day and heres thanking of em for all their goodness as is so constancy a diffusing of itself over everywhere and wishing they may live long and die happy  when the foregoing speech was overand it might have been much more elegant and much less to the purposethe whole body of subordinates under command of the apoplectic butler gave three soft cheers which to that gentlemans great indignation were not very regular inasmuch as the women persisted in giving an immense number of little shrill hurrahs among themselves in utter disregard of the time this done they withdrew shortly afterwards tim linkinwaters sister withdrew in reasonable time after that the sitting was broken up for tea and coffee and a round game of cards  at halfpast tenlate hours for the squarethere appeared a little tray of sandwiches and a bowl of bishop which bishop coming on the top of the doublediamond and other excitements had such an effect upon tim linkinwater that he drew nicholas aside and gave him to understand confidentially that it was quite true about the uncommonly handsome spinster and that she was to the full as goodlooking as she had been describedmore so indeedbut that she was in too much of a hurry to change her condition and consequently while tim was courting her and thinking of changing his got married to somebody else after all i dare say it was my fault said tim ill show you a print i have got upstairs one of these days it cost me fiveandtwenty shillings i bought it soon after we were cool to each other dont mention it but its the most extraordinary accidental likeness you ever sawher very portrait sir  by this time it was past eleven oclock and tim linkinwaters sister declaring that she ought to have been at home a full hour ago a coach was procured into which she was handed with great ceremony by brother ned while brother charles imparted the fullest directions to the coachman and besides paying the man a shilling over and above his fare in order that he might take the utmost care of the lady all but choked him with a glass of spirits of uncommon strength and then nearly knocked all the breath out of his body in his energetic endeavours to knock it in again  at length the coach rumbled off and tim linkinwaters sister being now fairly on her way home nicholas and tim linkinwaters friend took their leaves together and left old tim and the worthy brothers to their repose  as nicholas had some distance to walk it was considerably past midnight by the time he reached home where he found his mother and smike sitting up to receive him it was long after their usual hour of retiring and they had expected him at the very latest two hours ago but the time had not hung heavily on their hands for mrs nickleby had entertained smike with a genealogical account of her family by the mothers side comprising biographical sketches of the principal members and smike had sat wondering what it was all about and whether it was learnt from a book or said out of mrs nicklebys own head so that they got on together very pleasantly  nicholas could not go to bed without expatiating on the excellences and munificence of the brothers cheeryble and relating the great success which had attended his efforts that day but before he had said a dozen words mrs nickleby with many sly winks and nods observed that she was sure mr smike must be quite tired out and that she positively must insist on his not sitting up a minute longer  a most biddable creature he is to be sure said mrs nickleby when smike had wished them goodnight and left the room i know youll excuse me nicholas my dear but i dont like to do this before a third person indeed before a young man it would not be quite proper though really after all i dont know what harm there is in it except that to be sure its not a very becoming thing though some people say it is very much so and really i dont know why it should not be if its well got up and the borders are smallplaited of course a good deal depends upon that  with which preface mrs nickleby took her nightcap from between the leaves of a very large prayerbook where it had been folded up small and proceeded to tie it on talking away in her usual discursive manner all the time  people may say what they like observed mrs nickleby but theres a great deal of comfort in a nightcap as im sure you would confess nicholas my dear if you would only have strings to yours and wear it like a christian instead of sticking it upon the very top of your head like a bluecoat boy you neednt think it an unmanly or quizzical thing to be particular about your nightcap for i have often heard your poor dear papa and the reverend mr whatshisname who used to read prayers in that old church with the curious little steeple that the weathercock was blown off the night week before you were borni have often heard them say that the young men at college are uncommonly particular about their nightcaps and that the oxford nightcaps are quite celebrated for their strength and goodness so much so indeed that the young men never dream of going to bed without em and i believe its admitted on all hands that they know whats good and dont coddle themselves  nicholas laughed and entering no further into the subject of this lengthened harangue reverted to the pleasant tone of the little birthday party and as mrs nickleby instantly became very curious respecting it and made a great number of inquiries touching what they had had for dinner and how it was put on table and whether it was overdone or underdone and who was there and what the mr cherrybles said and what nicholas said and what the mr cherrybles said when he said that nicholas described the festivities at full length and also the occurrences of the morning  late as it is said nicholas i am almost selfish enough to wish that kate had been up to hear all this i was all impatience as i came along to tell her  why kate said mrs nickleby putting her feet upon the fender and drawing her chair close to it as if settling herself for a long talk kate has been in bedoh a couple of hoursand im very glad nicholas my dear that i prevailed upon her not to sit up for i wished very much to have an opportunity of saying a few words to you i am naturally anxious about it and of course its a very delightful and consoling thing to have a grownup son that one can put confidence in and advise with indeed i dont know any use there would be in having sons at all unless people could put confidence in them  nicholas stopped in the middle of a sleepy yawn as his mother began to speak and looked at her with fixed attention  there was a lady in our neighbourhood said mrs nickleby speaking of sons puts me in mind of ita lady in our neighbourhood when we lived near dawlish i think her name was rogers indeed i am sure it was if it wasnt murphy which is the only doubt i have  is it about her mother that you wished to speak to me said nicholas quietly  about her cried mrs nickleby good gracious nicholas my dear how can you be so ridiculous but that was always the way with your poor dear papajust his wayalways wandering never able to fix his thoughts on any one subject for two minutes together i think i see him now said mrs nickleby wiping her eyes looking at me while i was talking to him about his affairs just as if his ideas were in a state of perfect conglomeration anybody who had come in upon us suddenly would have supposed i was confusing and distracting him instead of making things plainer upon my word they would  i am very sorry mother that i should inherit this unfortunate slowness of apprehension said nicholas kindly but ill do my best to understand you if youll only go straight on indeed i will  your poor pa said mrs nickleby pondering he never knew till it was too late what i would have had him do  this was undoubtedly the case inasmuch as the deceased mr nickleby had not arrived at the knowledge then he died neither had mrs nickleby herself which is in some sort an explanation of the circumstance  however said mrs nickleby drying her tears this has nothing to docertainly nothing whatever to dowith the gentleman in the next house  i should suppose that the gentleman in the next house has as little to do with us returned nicholas  there can be no doubt said mrs nickleby that he is a gentleman and has the manners of a gentleman and the appearance of a gentleman although he does wear smalls and grey worsted stockings that may be eccentricity or he may be proud of his legs i dont see why he shouldnt be the prince regent was proud of his legs and so was daniel lambert who was also a fat man he was proud of his legs so was miss biffin she wasno added mrs nickleby correcting herself i think she had only toes but the principle is the same  nicholas looked on quite amazed at the introduction of this new theme which seemed just what mrs nickleby had expected him to be  you may well be surprised nicholas my dear she said i am sure i was it came upon me like a flash of fire and almost froze my blood the bottom of his garden joins the bottom of ours and of course i had several times seen him sitting among the scarletbeans in his little arbour or working at his little hotbeds i used to think he stared rather but i didnt take any particular notice of that as we were newcomers and he might be curious to see what we were like but when he began to throw his cucumbers over our wall  to throw his cucumbers over our wall repeated nicholas in great astonishment  yes nicholas my dear replied mrs nickleby in a very serious tone his cucumbers over our wall and vegetable marrows likewise  confound his impudence said nicholas firing immediately what does he mean by that  i dont think he means it impertinently at all replied mrs nickleby  what said nicholas cucumbers and vegetable marrows flying at the heads of the family as they walk in their own garden and not meant impertinently why mother  nicholas stopped short for there was an indescribable expression of placid triumph mingled with a modest confusion lingering between the borders of mrs nicklebys nightcap which arrested his attention suddenly  he must be a very weak and foolish and inconsiderate man said mrs nickleby blamable indeedat least i suppose other people would consider him so of course i cant be expected to express any opinion on that point especially after always defending your poor dear papa when other people blamed him for making proposals to me and to be sure there can be no doubt that he has taken a very singular way of showing it still at the same time his attentions arethat is as far as it goes and to a certain extent of coursea flattering sort of thing and although i should never dream of marrying again with a dear girl like kate still unsettled in life  surely mother such an idea never entered your brain for an instant said nicholas  bless my heart nicholas my dear returned his mother in a peevish tone isnt that precisely what i am saying if you would only let me speak of course i never gave it a second thought and i am surprised and astonished that you should suppose me capable of such a thing all i say is what step is the best to take so as to reject these advances civilly and delicately and without hurting his feelings too much and driving him to despair or anything of that kind my goodness me exclaimed mrs nickleby with a halfsimper suppose he was to go doing anything rash to himself could i ever be happy again nicholas  despite his vexation and concern nicholas could scarcely help smiling as he rejoined now do you think mother that such a result would be likely to ensue from the most cruel repulse  upon my word my dear i dont know returned mrs nickleby really i dont know i am sure there was a case in the day before yesterdays paper extracted from one of the french newspapers about a journeyman shoemaker who was jealous of a young girl in an adjoining village because she wouldnt shut herself up in an airtight threepairofstairs and charcoal herself to death with him and who went and hid himself in a wood with a sharppointed knife and rushed out as she was passing by with a few friends and killed himself first and then all the friends and then herno killed all the friends first and then herself and then himselfwhich it is quite frightful to think of somehow or other added mrs nickleby after a momentary pause they always are journeyman shoemakers who do these things in france according to the papers i dont know how it issomething in the leather i suppose  but this man who is not a shoemakerwhat has he done mother what has he said inquired nicholas fretted almost beyond endurance but looking nearly as resigned and patient as mrs nickleby herself you know there is no language of vegetables which converts a cucumber into a formal declaration of attachment  my dear replied mrs nickleby tossing her head and looking at the ashes in the grate he has done and said all sorts of things  is there no mistake on your part asked nicholas  mistake cried mrs nickleby lord nicholas my dear do you suppose i dont know when a mans in earnest  well well muttered nicholas  every time i go to the window said mrs nickleby he kisses one hand and lays the other upon his heartof course its very foolish of him to do so and i dare say youll say its very wrong but he does it very respectfullyvery respectfully indeedand very tenderly extremely tenderly so far he deserves the greatest credit there can be no doubt about that then there are the presents which come pouring over the wall every day and very fine they certainly are very fine we had one of the cucumbers at dinner yesterday and think of pickling the rest for next winter and last evening added mrs nickleby with increased confusion he called gently over the wall as i was walking in the garden and proposed marriage and an elopement his voice is as clear as a bell or a musical glassvery like a musical glass indeedbut of course i didnt listen to it then the question is nicholas my dear what am i to do  does kate know of this asked nicholas  i have not said a word about it yet answered his mother  then for heavens sake rejoined nicholas rising do not for it would make her very unhappy and with regard to what you should do my dear mother do what your good sense and feeling and respect for my fathers memory would prompt there are a thousand ways in which you can show your dislike of these preposterous and doting attentions if you act as decidedly as you ought and they are still continued and to your annoyance i can speedily put a stop to them but i should not interfere in a matter so ridiculous and attach importance to it until you have vindicated yourself most women can do that but especially one of your age and condition in circumstances like these which are unworthy of a serious thought i would not shame you by seeming to take them to heart or treat them earnestly for an instant absurd old idiot  so saying nicholas kissed his mother and bade her goodnight and they retired to their respective chambers  to do mrs nickleby justice her attachment to her children would have prevented her seriously contemplating a second marriage even if she could have so far conquered her recollections of her late husband as to have any strong inclinations that way but although there was no evil and little real selfishness in mrs nicklebys heart she had a weak head and a vain one and there was something so flattering in being sought and vainly sought in marriage at this time of day that she could not dismiss the passion of the unknown gentleman quite so summarily or lightly as nicholas appeared to deem becoming  as to its being preposterous and doting and ridiculous thought mrs nickleby communing with herself in her own room i dont see that at all its hopeless on his part certainly but why he should be an absurd old idiot i confess i dont see he is not to be supposed to know its hopeless poor fellow he is to be pitied i think  having made these reflections mrs nickleby looked in her little dressingglass and walking backward a few steps from it tried to remember who it was who used to say that when nicholas was oneandtwenty he would have more the appearance of her brother than her son not being able to call the authority to mind she extinguished her candle and drew up the windowblind to admit the light of morning which had by this time begun to dawn  its a bad light to distinguish objects in murmured mrs nickleby peering into the garden and my eyes are not very goodi was shortsighted from a childbut upon my word i think theres another large vegetable marrow sticking at this moment on the broken glass bottles at the top of the wall    chapter 38  comprises certain particulars arising out of a visit of condolence which may prove important hereafter smike unexpectedly encounters a very old friend who invites him to his house and will take no denial   quite unconscious of the demonstrations of their amorous neighbour or their effects upon the susceptible bosom of her mama kate nickleby had by this time begun to enjoy a settled feeling of tranquillity and happiness to which even in occasional and transitory glimpses she had long been a stranger living under the same roof with the beloved brother from whom she had been so suddenly and hardly separated with a mind at ease and free from any persecutions which could call a blush into her cheek or a pang into her heart she seemed to have passed into a new state of being her former cheerfulness was restored her step regained its elasticity and lightness the colour which had forsaken her cheek visited it once again and kate nickleby looked more beautiful than ever  such was the result to which miss la creevys ruminations and observations led her when the cottage had been as she emphatically said thoroughly got to rights from the chimneypots to the streetdoor scraper and the busy little woman had at length a moments time to think about its inmates  which i declare i havent had since i first came down here said miss la creevy for i have thought of nothing but hammers nails screwdrivers and gimlets morning noon and night  you never bestowed one thought upon yourself i believe returned kate smiling  upon my word my dear when there are so many pleasanter things to think of i should be a goose if i did said miss la creevy bythebye i have thought of somebody too do you know that i observe a great change in one of this familya very extraordinary change  in whom asked kate anxiously not in  not in your brother my dear returned miss la creevy anticipating the close of the sentence for he is always the same affectionate goodnatured clever creature with a spice of thei wont say whoin him when theres any occasion that he was when i first knew you no smike as he will be called poor fellow for he wont hear of a mr before his name is greatly altered even in this short time  how asked kate not in health  nno perhaps not in health exactly said miss la creevy pausing to consider although he is a worn and feeble creature and has that in his face which it would wring my heart to see in yours no not in health  how then  i scarcely know said the miniature painter but i have watched him and he has brought the tears into my eyes many times it is not a very difficult matter to do that certainly for i am easily melted still i think these came with good cause and reason i am sure that since he has been here he has grown from some strong cause more conscious of his weak intellect he feels it more it gives him greater pain to know that he wanders sometimes and cannot understand very simple things i have watched him when you have not been by my dear sit brooding by himself with such a look of pain as i could scarcely bear to see and then get up and leave the room so sorrowfully and in such dejection that i cannot tell you how it has hurt me not three weeks ago he was a lighthearted busy creature overjoyed to be in a bustle and as happy as the day was long now he is another beingthe same willing harmless faithful loving creaturebut the same in nothing else  surely this will all pass off said kate poor fellow  i hope returned her little friend with a gravity very unusual in her it may i hope for the sake of that poor lad it may however said miss la creevy relapsing into the cheerful chattering tone which was habitual to her i have said my say and a very long say it is and a very wrong say too i shouldnt wonder at all i shall cheer him up tonight at all events for if he is to be my squire all the way to the strand i shall talk on and on and on and never leave off till i have roused him into a laugh at something so the sooner he goes the better for him and the sooner i go the better for me i am sure or else i shall have my maid gallivanting with somebody who may rob the housethough what there is to take away besides tables and chairs i dont know except the miniatures and he is a clever thief who can dispose of them to any great advantage for i cant i know and thats the honest truth  so saying little miss la creevy hid her face in a very flat bonnet and herself in a very big shawl and fixing herself tightly into the latter by means of a large pin declared that the omnibus might come as soon as it pleased for she was quite ready  but there was still mrs nickleby to take leave of and long before that good lady had concluded some reminiscences bearing upon and appropriate to the occasion the omnibus arrived this put miss la creevy in a great bustle in consequence whereof as she secretly rewarded the servant girl with eighteenpence behind the streetdoor she pulled out of her reticule tenpennyworth of halfpence which rolled into all possible corners of the passage and occupied some considerable time in the picking up this ceremony had of course to be succeeded by a second kissing of kate and mrs nickleby and a gathering together of the little basket and the brownpaper parcel during which proceedings the omnibus as miss la creevy protested swore so dreadfully that it was quite awful to hear it at length and at last it made a feint of going away and then miss la creevy darted out and darted in apologising with great volubility to all the passengers and declaring that she wouldnt purposely have kept them waiting on any account whatever while she was looking about for a convenient seat the conductor pushed smike in and cried that it was all rightthough it wasntand away went the huge vehicle with the noise of halfadozen brewers drays at least  leaving it to pursue its journey at the pleasure of the conductor aforementioned who lounged gracefully on his little shelf behind smoking an odoriferous cigar and leaving it to stop or go on or gallop or crawl as that gentleman deemed expedient and advisable this narrative may embrace the opportunity of ascertaining the condition of sir mulberry hawk and to what extent he had by this time recovered from the injuries consequent on being flung violently from his cabriolet under the circumstances already detailed  with a shattered limb a body severely bruised a face disfigured by halfhealed scars and pallid from the exhaustion of recent pain and fever sir mulberry hawk lay stretched upon his back on the couch to which he was doomed to be a prisoner for some weeks yet to come mr pyke and mr pluck sat drinking hard in the next room now and then varying the monotonous murmurs of their conversation with a halfsmothered laugh while the young lordthe only member of the party who was not thoroughly irredeemable and who really had a kind heartsat beside his mentor with a cigar in his mouth and read to him by the light of a lamp such scraps of intelligence from a paper of the day as were most likely to yield him interest or amusement  curse those hounds said the invalid turning his head impatiently towards the adjoining room will nothing stop their infernal throats  messrs pyke and pluck heard the exclamation and stopped immediately winking to each other as they did so and filling their glasses to the brim as some recompense for the deprivation of speech  damn muttered the sick man between his teeth and writhing impatiently in his bed isnt this mattress hard enough and the room dull enough and pain bad enough but they must torture me whats the time  halfpast eight replied his friend  here draw the table nearer and let us have the cards again said sir mulberry more piquet come  it was curious to see how eagerly the sick man debarred from any change of position save the mere turning of his head from side to side watched every motion of his friend in the progress of the game and with what eagerness and interest he played and yet how warily and coolly his address and skill were more than twenty times a match for his adversary who could make little head against them even when fortune favoured him with good cards which was not often the case sir mulberry won every game and when his companion threw down the cards and refused to play any longer thrust forth his wasted arm and caught up the stakes with a boastful oath and the same hoarse laugh though considerably lowered in tone that had resounded in ralph nicklebys diningroom months before  while he was thus occupied his man appeared to announce that mr ralph nickleby was below and wished to know how he was tonight  better said sir mulberry impatiently  mr nickleby wishes to know sir  i tell you better replied sir mulberry striking his hand upon the table  the man hesitated for a moment or two and then said that mr nickleby had requested permission to see sir mulberry hawk if it was not inconvenient  it is inconvenient i cant see him i cant see anybody said his master more violently than before you know that you blockhead  i am very sorry sir returned the man but mr nickleby pressed so much sir  the fact was that ralph nickleby had bribed the man who being anxious to earn his money with a view to future favours held the door in his hand and ventured to linger still  did he say whether he had any business to speak about inquired sir mulberry after a little impatient consideration  no sir he said he wished to see you sir particularly mr nickleby said sir  tell him to come up here cried sir mulberry calling the man back as he passed his hand over his disfigured face move that lamp and put it on the stand behind me wheel that table away and place a chair therefurther off leave it so  the man obeyed these directions as if he quite comprehended the motive with which they were dictated and left the room lord frederick verisopht remarking that he would look in presently strolled into the adjoining apartment and closed the folding door behind him  then was heard a subdued footstep on the stairs and ralph nickleby hat in hand crept softly into the room with his body bent forward as if in profound respect and his eyes fixed upon the face of his worthy client  well nickleby said sir mulberry motioning him to the chair by the couch side and waving his hand in assumed carelessness i have had a bad accident you see  i see rejoined ralph with the same steady gaze bad indeed i should not have known you sir mulberry dear dear this is bad  ralphs manner was one of profound humility and respect and the low tone of voice was that which the gentlest consideration for a sick man would have taught a visitor to assume but the expression of his face sir mulberrys being averted was in extraordinary contrast and as he stood in his usual attitude calmly looking on the prostrate form before him all that part of his features which was not cast into shadow by his protruding and contracted brows bore the impress of a sarcastic smile  sit down said sir mulberry turning towards him as though by a violent effort am i a sight that you stand gazing there  as he turned his face ralph recoiled a step or two and making as though he were irresistibly impelled to express astonishment but was determined not to do so sat down with wellacted confusion  i have inquired at the door sir mulberry every day said ralph twice a day indeed at firstand tonight presuming upon old acquaintance and past transactions by which we have mutually benefited in some degree i could not resist soliciting admission to your chamber have youhave you suffered much said ralph bending forward and allowing the same harsh smile to gather upon his face as the other closed his eyes  more than enough to please me and less than enough to please some brokendown hacks that you and i know of and who lay their ruin between us i dare say returned sir mulberry tossing his arm restlessly upon the coverlet  ralph shrugged his shoulders in deprecation of the intense irritation with which this had been said for there was an aggravating cold distinctness in his speech and manner which so grated on the sick man that he could scarcely endure it  and what is it in these past transactions that brought you here tonight asked sir mulberry  nothing replied ralph there are some bills of my lords which need renewal but let them be till you are well iicame said ralph speaking more slowly and with harsher emphasis i came to say how grieved i am that any relative of mine although disowned by me should have inflicted such punishment on you as  punishment interposed sir mulberry  i know it has been a severe one said ralph wilfully mistaking the meaning of the interruption and that has made me the more anxious to tell you that i disown this vagabondthat i acknowledge him as no kin of mineand that i leave him to take his deserts from you and every man besides you may wring his neck if you please i shall not interfere  this story that they tell me here has got abroad then has it asked sir mulberry clenching his hands and teeth  noised in all directions replied ralph every club and gamingroom has rung with it there has been a good song made about it as i am told said ralph looking eagerly at his questioner i have not heard it myself not being in the way of such things but i have been told its even printedfor private circulationbut thats all over town of course  its a lie said sir mulberry i tell you its all a lie the mare took fright  they say he frightened her observed ralph in the same unmoved and quiet manner some say he frightened you but thats a lie i know i have said that boldlyoh a score of times i am a peaceable man but i cant hear folks tell that of you no no  when sir mulberry found coherent words to utter ralph bent forward with his hand to his ear and a face as calm as if its every line of sternness had been cast in iron  when i am off this cursed bed said the invalid actually striking at his broken leg in the ecstasy of his passion ill have such revenge as never man had yet by god i will accident favouring him he has marked me for a week or two but ill put a mark on him that he shall carry to his grave ill slit his nose and ears flog him maim him for life ill do more than that ill drag that pattern of chastity that pink of prudery the delicate sister through  it might have been that even ralphs cold blood tingled in his cheeks at that moment it might have been that sir mulberry remembered that knave and usurer as he was he must in some early time of infancy have twined his arm about her fathers neck he stopped and menacing with his hand confirmed the unuttered threat with a tremendous oath  it is a galling thing said ralph after a short term of silence during which he had eyed the sufferer keenly to think that the man about town the rake the roue the rook of twenty seasons should be brought to this pass by a mere boy  sir mulberry darted a wrathful look at him but ralphs eyes were bent upon the ground and his face wore no other expression than one of thoughtfulness  a raw slight stripling continued ralph against a man whose very weight might crush him to say nothing of his skill ini am right i think said ralph raising his eyes you were a patron of the ring once were you not  the sick man made an impatient gesture which ralph chose to consider as one of acquiescence  ha he said i thought so that was before i knew you but i was pretty sure i couldnt be mistaken he is light and active i suppose but those were slight advantages compared with yours luck luck these hangdog outcasts have it  hell need the most he has when i am well again said sir mulberry hawk let him fly where he will  oh returned ralph quickly he doesnt dream of that he is here good sir waiting your pleasure here in london walking the streets at noonday carrying it off jauntily looking for you i swear said ralph his face darkening and his own hatred getting the upper hand of him for the first time as this gay picture of nicholas presented itself if we were only citizens of a country where it could be safely done id give good money to have him stabbed to the heart and rolled into the kennel for the dogs to tear  as ralph somewhat to the surprise of his old client vented this little piece of sound family feeling and took up his hat preparatory to departing lord frederick verisopht looked in  why what in the deyvles name hawk have you and nickleby been talking about said the young man i neyver heard such an insufferable riot croak croak croak bow wow wow what has it all been about  sir mulberry has been angry my lord said ralph looking towards the couch  not about money i hope nothing has gone wrong in business has it nickleby  no my lord no returned ralph on that point we always agree sir mulberry has been calling to mind the cause of  there was neither necessity nor opportunity for ralph to proceed for sir mulberry took up the theme and vented his threats and oaths against nicholas almost as ferociously as before  ralph who was no common observer was surprised to see that as this tirade proceeded the manner of lord frederick verisopht who at the commencement had been twirling his whiskers with a most dandified and listless air underwent a complete alteration he was still more surprised when sir mulberry ceasing to speak the young lord angrily and almost unaffectedly requested never to have the subject renewed in his presence  mind that hawk he added with unusual energy i never will be a party to or permit if i can help it a cowardly attack upon this young fellow  cowardly interrupted his friend  yees said the other turning full upon him if you had told him who you were if you had given him your card and found out afterwards that his station or character prevented your fighting him it would have been bad enough then upon my soul it would have been bad enough then as it is you did wrong i did wrong too not to interfere and i am sorry for it what happened to you afterwards was as much the consequence of accident as design and more your fault than his and it shall not with my knowledge be cruelly visited upon him it shall not indeed  with this emphatic repetition of his concluding words the young lord turned upon his heel but before he had reached the adjoining room he turned back again and said with even greater vehemence than he had displayed before  i do believe now upon my honour i do believe that the sister is as virtuous and modest a young lady as she is a handsome one and of the brother i say this that he acted as her brother should and in a manly and spirited manner and i only wish with all my heart and soul that any one of us came out of this matter half as well as he does  so saying lord frederick verisopht walked out of the room leaving ralph nickleby and sir mulberry in most unpleasant astonishment  is this your pupil asked ralph softly or has he come fresh from some country parson  green fools take these fits sometimes replied sir mulberry hawk biting his lip and pointing to the door leave him to me  ralph exchanged a familiar look with his old acquaintance for they had suddenly grown confidential again in this alarming surprise and took his way home thoughtfully and slowly  while these things were being said and done and long before they were concluded the omnibus had disgorged miss la creevy and her escort and they had arrived at her own door now the goodnature of the little miniature painter would by no means allow of smikes walking back again until he had been previously refreshed with just a sip of something comfortable and a mixed biscuit or so and smike entertaining no objection either to the sip of something comfortable or the mixed biscuit but considering on the contrary that they would be a very pleasant preparation for a walk to bow it fell out that he delayed much longer than he originally intended and that it was some halfhour after dusk when he set forth on his journey home  there was no likelihood of his losing his way for it lay quite straight before him and he had walked into town with nicholas and back alone almost every day so miss la creevy and he shook hands with mutual confidence and being charged with more kind remembrances to mrs and miss nickleby smike started off  at the foot of ludgate hill he turned a little out of the road to satisfy his curiosity by having a look at newgate after staring up at the sombre walls from the opposite side of the way with great care and dread for some minutes he turned back again into the old track and walked briskly through the city stopping now and then to gaze in at the window of some particularly attractive shop then running for a little way then stopping again and so on as any other country lad might do  he had been gazing for a long time through a jewellers window wishing he could take some of the beautiful trinkets home as a present and imagining what delight they would afford if he could when the clocks struck threequarters past eight roused by the sound he hurried on at a very quick pace and was crossing the corner of a bystreet when he felt himself violently brought to with a jerk so sudden that he was obliged to cling to a lamppost to save himself from falling at the same moment a small boy clung tight round his leg and a shrill cry of here he is father hooray vibrated in his ears  smike knew that voice too well he cast his despairing eyes downward towards the form from which it had proceeded and shuddering from head to foot looked round mr squeers had hooked him in the coat collar with the handle of his umbrella and was hanging on at the other end with all his might and main the cry of triumph proceeded from master wackford who regardless of all his kicks and struggles clung to him with the tenacity of a bulldog  one glance showed him this and in that one glance the terrified creature became utterly powerless and unable to utter a sound  heres a go cried mr squeers gradually coming handoverhand down the umbrella and only unhooking it when he had got tight hold of the victims collar heres a delicious go wackford my boy call up one of them coaches  a coach father cried little wackford  yes a coach sir replied squeers feasting his eyes upon the countenance of smike damn the expense lets have him in a coach  whats he been a doing of asked a labourer with a hod of bricks against whom and a fellowlabourer mr squeers had backed on the first jerk of the umbrella  everything replied mr squeers looking fixedly at his old pupil in a sort of rapturous trance everythingrunning away sirjoining in bloodthirsty attacks upon his mastertheres nothing thats bad that he hasnt done oh what a delicious go is this here good lord  the man looked from squeers to smike but such mental faculties as the poor fellow possessed had utterly deserted him the coach came up master wackford entered squeers pushed in his prize and following close at his heels pulled up the glasses the coachman mounted his box and drove slowly off leaving the two bricklayers and an old applewoman and a townmade little boy returning from an evening school who had been the only witnesses of the scene to meditate upon it at their leisure  mr squeers sat himself down on the opposite seat to the unfortunate smike and planting his hands firmly on his knees looked at him for some five minutes when seeming to recover from his trance he uttered a loud laugh and slapped his old pupils face several timestaking the right and left sides alternately  it isnt a dream said squeers thats real flesh and blood i know the feel of it and being quite assured of his good fortune by these experiments mr squeers administered a few boxes on the ear lest the entertainments should seem to partake of sameness and laughed louder and longer at every one  your mother will be fit to jump out of her skin my boy when she hears of this said squeers to his son  oh wont she though father replied master wackford  to think said squeers that you and me should be turning out of a street and come upon him at the very nick and that i should have him tight at only one cast of the umbrella as if i had hooked him with a grapplingiron ha ha  didnt i catch hold of his leg neither father said little wackford  you did like a good un my boy said mr squeers patting his sons head and you shall have the best buttonover jacket and waistcoat that the next new boy brings down as a reward of merit mind that you always keep on in the same path and do them things that you see your father do and when you die youll go right slap to heaven and no questions asked  improving the occasion in these words mr squeers patted his sons head again and then patted smikesbut harder and inquired in a bantering tone how he found himself by this time  i must go home replied smike looking wildly round  to be sure you must youre about right there replied mr squeers youll go home very soon you will youll find yourself at the peaceful village of dotheboys in yorkshire in something under a weeks time my young friend and the next time you get away from there i give you leave to keep away wheres the clothes you run off in you ungrateful robber said mr squeers in a severe voice  smike glanced at the neat attire which the care of nicholas had provided for him and wrung his hands  do you know that i could hang you up outside of the old bailey for making away with them articles of property said squeers do you know that its a hanging matterand i ant quite certain whether it ant an anatomy one besidesto walk off with upards of the valley of five pound from a dwellinghouse eh do you know that what do you suppose was the worth of them clothes you had do you know that that wellington boot you wore cost eightandtwenty shillings when it was a pair and the shoe sevenandsix but you came to the right shop for mercy when you came to me and thank your stars that it is me as has got to serve you with the article  anybody not in mr squeerss confidence would have supposed that he was quite out of the article in question instead of having a large stock on hand ready for all comers nor would the opinion of sceptical persons have undergone much alteration when he followed up the remark by poking smike in the chest with the ferrule of his umbrella and dealing a smart shower of blows with the ribs of the same instrument upon his head and shoulders  i never threshed a boy in a hackney coach before said mr squeers when he stopped to rest theres inconveniency in it but the novelty gives it a sort of relish too  poor smike he warded off the blows as well as he could and now shrunk into a corner of the coach with his head resting on his hands and his elbows on his knees he was stunned and stupefied and had no more idea that any act of his would enable him to escape from the allpowerful squeers now that he had no friend to speak to or to advise with than he had had in all the weary years of his yorkshire life which preceded the arrival of nicholas  the journey seemed endless street after street was entered and left behind and still they went jolting on at last mr squeers began to thrust his head out of the widow every halfminute and to bawl a variety of directions to the coachman and after passing with some difficulty through several mean streets which the appearance of the houses and the bad state of the road denoted to have been recently built mr squeers suddenly tugged at the check string with all his might and cried stop  what are you pulling a mans arm off for said the coachman looking angrily down  thats the house replied squeers the second of them four little houses one story high with the green shutters theres brass plate on the door with the name of snawley  couldnt you say that without wrenching a mans limbs off his body inquired the coachman  no bawled mr squeers say another word and ill summons you for having a broken winder stop  obedient to this direction the coach stopped at mr snawleys door mr snawley may be remembered as the sleek and sanctified gentleman who confided two sons in law to the parental care of mr squeers as narrated in the fourth chapter of this history mr snawleys house was on the extreme borders of some new settlements adjoining somers town and mr squeers had taken lodgings therein for a short time as his stay was longer than usual and the saracen having experience of master wackfords appetite had declined to receive him on any other terms than as a fullgrown customer  here we are said squeers hurrying smike into the little parlour where mr snawley and his wife were taking a lobster supper heres the vagrantthe felonthe rebelthe monster of unthankfulness  what the boy that run away cried snawley resting his knife and fork upright on the table and opening his eyes to their full width  the very boy said squeers putting his fist close to smikes nose and drawing it away again and repeating the process several times with a vicious aspect if there wasnt a lady present id fetch him such a never mind ill owe it him  and here mr squeers related how and in what manner and when and where he had picked up the runaway  its clear that there has been a providence in it sir said mr snawley casting down his eyes with an air of humility and elevating his fork with a bit of lobster on the top of it towards the ceiling  providence is against him no doubt replied mr squeers scratching his nose of course that was to be expected anybody might have known that  hardheartedness and evildoing will never prosper sir said mr snawley  never was such a thing known rejoined squeers taking a little roll of notes from his pocketbook to see that they were all safe  i have been mr snawley said mr squeers when he had satisfied himself upon this point i have been that chaps benefactor feeder teacher and clother i have been that chaps classical commercial mathematical philosophical and trigonomical friend my sonmy only son wackfordhas been his brother mrs squeers has been his mother grandmother auntah and i may say uncle too all in one she never cottoned to anybody except them two engaging and delightful boys of yours as she cottoned to this chap whats my return whats come of my milk of human kindness it turns into curds and whey when i look at him  well it may sir said mrs snawley oh well it may sir  where has he been all this time inquired snawley has he been living with  ah sir interposed squeers confronting him again have you been a living with that there devilish nickleby sir  but no threats or cuffs could elicit from smike one word of reply to this question for he had internally resolved that he would rather perish in the wretched prison to which he was again about to be consigned than utter one syllable which could involve his first and true friend he had already called to mind the strict injunctions of secrecy as to his past life which nicholas had laid upon him when they travelled from yorkshire and a confused and perplexed idea that his benefactor might have committed some terrible crime in bringing him away which would render him liable to heavy punishment if detected had contributed in some degree to reduce him to his present state of apathy and terror  such were the thoughtsif to visions so imperfect and undefined as those which wandered through his enfeebled brain the term can be appliedwhich were present to the mind of smike and rendered him deaf alike to intimidation and persuasion finding every effort useless mr squeers conducted him to a little back room upstairs where he was to pass the night and taking the precaution of removing his shoes and coat and waistcoat and also of locking the door on the outside lest he should muster up sufficient energy to make an attempt at escape that worthy gentleman left him to his meditations  what those meditations were and how the poor creatures heart sunk within him when he thoughtwhen did he for a moment cease to thinkof his late home and the dear friends and familiar faces with which it was associated cannot be told to prepare the mind for such a heavy sleep its growth must be stopped by rigour and cruelty in childhood there must be years of misery and suffering lightened by no ray of hope the chords of the heart which beat a quick response to the voice of gentleness and affection must have rusted and broken in their secret places and bear the lingering echo of no old word of love or kindness gloomy indeed must have been the short day and dull the long long twilight preceding such a night of intellect as his  there were voices which would have roused him even then but their welcome tones could not penetrate there and he crept to bed the same listless hopeless blighted creature that nicholas had first found him at the yorkshire school    chapter 39  in which another old friend encounters smike very opportunely and to some purpose   the night fraught with so much bitterness to one poor soul had given place to a bright and cloudless summer morning when a northcountry mailcoach traversed with cheerful noise the yet silent streets of islington and giving brisk note of its approach with the lively winding of the guards horn clattered onward to its haltingplace hard by the post office  the only outside passenger was a burly honestlooking countryman on the box who with his eyes fixed upon the dome of st pauls cathedral appeared so wrapt in admiring wonder as to be quite insensible to all the bustle of getting out the bags and parcels until one of the coach windows being let sharply down he looked round and encountered a pretty female face which was just then thrust out  see there lass bawled the countryman pointing towards the object of his admiration there be pauls church ecod he be a soizable un he be  goodness john i shouldnt have thought it could have been half the size what a monster  monstheryere aboot right theer i reckon mrs browdie said the countryman goodhumouredly as he came slowly down in his huge topcoat and waat dost thee tak yon place to be noothotun owor the wa yed never coom near it gin you thried for twolve moonths its na but a poast office ho ho they need to charge for dooblelatthers a poast office waat dost thee think o thot ecod if thots ony a poast office id loike to see where the lord mayor o lunnun lives  so saying john browdiefor he it wasopened the coachdoor and tapping mrs browdie late miss price on the cheek as he looked in burst into a boisterous fit of laughter  weel said john dang my bootuns if she beant asleep agean  shes been asleep all night and was all yesterday except for a minute or two now and then replied john browdies choice and i was very sorry when she woke for she has been so cross  the subject of these remarks was a slumbering figure so muffled in shawl and cloak that it would have been matter of impossibility to guess at its sex but for a brown beaver bonnet and green veil which ornamented the head and which having been crushed and flattened for two hundred and fifty miles in that particular angle of the vehicle from which the ladys snores now proceeded presented an appearance sufficiently ludicrous to have moved less risible muscles than those of john browdies ruddy face  hollo cried john twitching one end of the dragged veil coom wakken oop will ee  after several burrowings into the old corner and many exclamations of impatience and fatigue the figure struggled into a sitting posture and there under a mass of crumpled beaver and surrounded by a semicircle of blue curlpapers were the delicate features of miss fanny squeers  oh tilda cried miss squeers how you have been kicking of me through this blessed night  well i do like that replied her friend laughing when you have had nearly the whole coach to yourself  dont deny it tilda said miss squeers impressively because you have and its no use to go attempting to say you havent you mightnt have known it in your sleep tilda but i havent closed my eyes for a single wink and so i think i am to be believed  with which reply miss squeers adjusted the bonnet and veil which nothing but supernatural interference and an utter suspension of natures laws could have reduced to any shape or form and evidently flattering herself that it looked uncommonly neat brushed off the sandwichcrumbs and bits of biscuit which had accumulated in her lap and availing herself of john browdies proffered arm descended from the coach  noo said john when a hackney coach had been called and the ladies and the luggage hurried in gang to the sarahs head mun  to the vere cried the coachman  lawk mr browdie interrupted miss squeers the idea saracens head  surely said john i knowd it was something aboot sarahs sons head dost thou know thot  oh ah i know that replied the coachman gruffly as he banged the door  tilda dear really remonstrated miss squeers we shall be taken for i dont know what  let them tak us as they foind us said john browdie we deant come to lunnun to do nought but joy oursel do we  i hope not mr browdie replied miss squeers looking singularly dismal  well then said john its no matther ive only been a married man fower days account of poor old feyther deein and puttin it off here be a weddin partybroide and broidesmaid and the groomif a mun deant joy himsel noo when ought he hey drat it all thots what i want to know  so in order that he might begin to enjoy himself at once and lose no time mr browdie gave his wife a hearty kiss and succeeded in wresting another from miss squeers after a maidenly resistance of scratching and struggling on the part of that young lady which was not quite over when they reached the saracens head  here the party straightway retired to rest the refreshment of sleep being necessary after so long a journey and here they met again about noon to a substantial breakfast spread by direction of mr john browdie in a small private room upstairs commanding an uninterrupted view of the stables  to have seen miss squeers now divested of the brown beaver the green veil and the blue curlpapers and arrayed in all the virgin splendour of a white frock and spencer with a white muslin bonnet and an imitative damask rose in full bloom on the inside thereofher luxuriant crop of hair arranged in curls so tight that it was impossible they could come out by any accident and her bonnetcap trimmed with little damask roses which might be supposed to be so many promising scions of the big roseto have seen all this and to have seen the broad damask belt matching both the family rose and the little roses which encircled her slender waist and by a happy ingenuity took off from the shortness of the spencer behindto have beheld all this and to have taken further into account the coral bracelets rather short of beads and with a very visible black string which clasped her wrists and the coral necklace which rested on her neck supporting outside her frock a lonely cornelian heart typical of her own disengaged affectionsto have contemplated all these mute but expressive appeals to the purest feelings of our nature might have thawed the frost of age and added new and inextinguishable fuel to the fire of youth  the waiter was touched waiter as he was he had human passions and feelings and he looked very hard at miss squeers as he handed the muffins  is my pa in do you know asked miss squeers with dignity  beg your pardon miss  my pa repeated miss squeers is he in  in where miss  in herein the house replied miss squeers my pamr wackford squeershes stopping here is he at home  i didnt know there was any genlman of that name in the house miss replied the waiter there may be in the coffeeroom  may be very pretty this indeed here was miss squeers who had been depending all the way to london upon showing her friends how much at home she would be and how much respectful notice her name and connections would excite told that her father might be there as if he was a feller observed miss squeers with emphatic indignation  yed betther inquire mun said john browdie an hond up another pigeonpie will ee dang the chap muttered john looking into the empty dish as the waiter retired does he ca this a piethree yoong pigeons and a troifling matther o steak and a crust so loight that you doant know when its in your mooth and when its gane i wonder hoo many pies goes to a breakfast  after a short interval which john browdie employed upon the ham and a cold round of beef the waiter returned with another pie and the information that mr squeers was not stopping in the house but that he came there every day and that directly he arrived he should be shown upstairs with this he retired and he had not retired two minutes when he returned with mr squeers and his hopeful son  why whod have thought of this said mr squeers when he had saluted the party and received some private family intelligence from his daughter  who indeed pa replied that young lady spitefully but you see tilda is married at last  and i stond threat for a soight o lunnun schoolmeasther said john vigorously attacking the pie  one of them things that young men do when they get married returned squeers and as runs through with their money like nothing at all how much better wouldnt it be now to save it up for the eddication of any little boys for instance they come on you said mr squeers in a moralising way before youre aware of it mine did upon me  will ee pick a bit said john  i wont myself returned squeers but if youll just let little wackford tuck into something fat ill be obliged to you give it him in his fingers else the waiter charges it on and theres lot of profit on this sort of vittles without that if you hear the waiter coming sir shove it in your pocket and look out of the window dye hear  im awake father replied the dutiful wackford  well said squeers turning to his daughter its your turn to be married next you must make haste  oh im in no hurry said miss squeers very sharply  no fanny cried her old friend with some archness  no tilda replied miss squeers shaking her head vehemently i can wait  so can the young men it seems fanny observed mrs browdie  they ant drawd into it by me tilda retorted miss squeers  no returned her friend thats exceedingly true  the sarcastic tone of this reply might have provoked a rather acrimonious retort from miss squeers who besides being of a constitutionally vicious temperaggravated just now by travel and recent joltingwas somewhat irritated by old recollections and the failure of her own designs upon mr browdie and the acrimonious retort might have led to a great many other retorts which might have led to heaven knows what if the subject of conversation had not been at that precise moment accidentally changed by mr squeers himself  what do you think said that gentleman who do you suppose we have laid hands on wackford and me  pa not mr miss squeers was unable to finish the sentence but mrs browdie did it for her and added nickleby  no said squeers but next door to him though  you cant mean smike cried miss squeers clapping her hands  yes i can though rejoined her father ive got him hard and fast  waat exclaimed john browdie pushing away his plate got that poordomd scoondrel where  why in the top back room at my lodging replied squeers with him on one side and the key on the other  at thy loodgin theest gotten him at thy loodgin ho ho the schoolmeasther agin all england give us thee hond mun im darned but i must shak thee by the hond for thotgotten him at thy loodgin  yes replied squeers staggering in his chair under the congratulatory blow on the chest which the stout yorkshireman dealt him thankee dont do it again you mean it kindly i know but it hurts rather yes there he is thats not so bad is it  baad repeated john browdie its eneaf to scare a mun to hear tell on  i thought it would surprise you a bit said squeers rubbing his hands it was pretty neatly done and pretty quick too  hoo wor it inquired john sitting down close to him tell us all aboot it mun coom quick  although he could not keep pace with john browdies impatience mr squeers related the lucky chance by which smike had fallen into his hands as quickly as he could and except when he was interrupted by the admiring remarks of his auditors paused not in the recital until he had brought it to an end  for fear he should give me the slip by any chance observed squeers when he had finished looking very cunning ive taken three outsides for tomorrow morningfor wackford and him and meand have arranged to leave the accounts and the new boys to the agent dont you see so its very lucky you come today or youd have missed us and as it is unless you could come and tea with me tonight we shant see anything more of you before we go away  deant say anoother wurd returned the yorkshireman shaking him by the hand wed coom if it was twonty mile  no would you though returned mr squeers who had not expected quite such a ready acceptance of his invitation or he would have considered twice before he gave it  john browdies only reply was another squeeze of the hand and an assurance that they would not begin to see london till tomorrow so that they might be at mr snawleys at six oclock without fail and after some further conversation mr squeers and his son departed  during the remainder of the day mr browdie was in a very odd and excitable state bursting occasionally into an explosion of laughter and then taking up his hat and running into the coachyard to have it out by himself he was very restless too constantly walking in and out and snapping his fingers and dancing scraps of uncouth country dances and in short conducting himself in such a very extraordinary manner that miss squeers opined he was going mad and begging her dear tilda not to distress herself communicated her suspicions in so many words mrs browdie however without discovering any great alarm observed that she had seen him so once before and that although he was almost sure to be ill after it it would not be anything very serious and therefore he was better left alone  the result proved her to be perfectly correct for while they were all sitting in mr snawleys parlour that night and just as it was beginning to get dusk john browdie was taken so ill and seized with such an alarming dizziness in the head that the whole company were thrown into the utmost consternation his good lady indeed was the only person present who retained presence of mind enough to observe that if he were allowed to lie down on mr squeerss bed for an hour or so and left entirely to himself he would be sure to recover again almost as quickly as he had been taken ill nobody could refuse to try the effect of so reasonable a proposal before sending for a surgeon accordingly john was supported upstairs with great difficulty being a monstrous weight and regularly tumbling down two steps every time they hoisted him up three and being laid on the bed was left in charge of his wife who after a short interval reappeared in the parlour with the gratifying intelligence that he had fallen fast asleep  now the fact was that at that particular moment john browdie was sitting on the bed with the reddest face ever seen cramming the corner of the pillow into his mouth to prevent his roaring out loud with laughter he had no sooner succeeded in suppressing this emotion than he slipped off his shoes and creeping to the adjoining room where the prisoner was confined turned the key which was on the outside and darting in covered smikes mouth with his huge hand before he could utter a sound  odsbobs dost thee not know me mun whispered the yorkshireman to the bewildered lad browdie chap as met thee efther schoolmeasther was banged  yes yes cried smike oh help me  help thee replied john stopping his mouth again the instant he had said this much thee didnt need help if thee warnt as silly yoongster as ever drawd breath waat did ee come here for then  he brought me oh he brought me cried smike  brout thee replied john why didnt ee

forgi me for bragging ower yan o his weakest creeturs  smike opened his mouth to speak but john browdie stopped him  stan still said the yorkshireman and doantee speak a morsel o talk till i tellee  with this caution john browdie shook his head significantly and drawing a screwdriver from his pocket took off the box of the lock in a very deliberate and workmanlike manner and laid it together with the implement on the floor  see thot said john thot be thy doin noo coot awa  smike looked vacantly at him as if unable to comprehend his meaning  i say coot awa repeated john hastily dost thee know where thee livest thee dost weel are yon thy clothes or schoolmeasthers  mine replied smike as the yorkshireman hurried him to the adjoining room and pointed out a pair of shoes and a coat which were lying on a chair  on wi em said john forcing the wrong arm into the wrong sleeve and winding the tails of the coat round the fugitives neck noo foller me and when thee getst ootside door turn to the right and they weant see thee pass  butbuthell hear me shut the door replied smike trembling from head to foot  then deant shut it at all retorted john browdie dang it thee beant afeard o schoolmeasthers takkin cold i hope  nno said smike his teeth chattering in his head but he brought me back before and will again he will he will indeed  he wull he wull replied john impatiently he

boans for i weant if he foinds it oot soon efther ill put un on a wrong scent i warrant ee but if thee keepst a good hart theelt be at whoam afore they know theest gotten off coom  smike who comprehended just enough of this to know it was intended as encouragement prepared to follow with tottering steps when john whispered in his ear  theelt just tell yoong measther that im sploiced to tilly price and to be heerd on at the saracen by latther and that i beant jealous of undang it im loike to boost when i think o that neight cod i think i see un now a powderin awa at the thin bread an butther  it was rather a ticklish recollection for john just then for he was within an ace of breaking out into a loud guffaw restraining himself however just in time by a great effort he glided downstairs hauling smike behind him and placing himself close to the parlour door to confront the first person that might come out signed to him to make off  having got so far smike needed no second bidding opening the housedoor gently and casting a look of mingled gratitude and terror at his deliverer he took the direction which had been indicated to him and sped away like the wind  the yorkshireman remained on his post for a few minutes but finding that there was no pause in the conversation inside crept back again unheard and stood listening over the stairrail for a full hour everything remaining perfectly quiet he got into mr squeerss bed once more and drawing the clothes over his head laughed till he was nearly smothered  if there could only have been somebody by to see how the bedclothes shook and to see the yorkshiremans great red face and round head appear above the sheets every now and then like some jovial monster coming to the surface to breathe and once more dive down convulsed with the laughter which came bursting forth afreshthat somebody would have been scarcely less amused than john browdie himself    chapter 40  in which nicholas falls in love he employs a mediator whose proceedings are crowned with unexpected success excepting in one solitary particular   once more out of the clutches of his old persecutor it needed no fresh stimulation to call forth the utmost energy and exertion that smike was capable of summoning to his aid without pausing for a moment to reflect upon the course he was taking or the probability of its leading him homewards or the reverse he fled away with surprising swiftness and constancy of purpose borne upon such wings as only fear can wear and impelled by imaginary shouts in the well remembered voice of squeers who with a host of pursuers seemed to the poor fellows disordered senses to press hard upon his track now left at a greater distance in the rear and now gaining faster and faster upon him as the alternations of hope and terror agitated him by turns long after he had become assured that these sounds were but the creation of his excited brain he still held on at a pace which even weakness and exhaustion could scarcely retard it was not until the darkness and quiet of a country road recalled him to a sense of external objects and the starry sky above warned him of the rapid flight of time that covered with dust and panting for breath he stopped to listen and look about him  all was still and silent a glare of light in the distance casting a warm glow upon the sky marked where the huge city lay solitary fields divided by hedges and ditches through many of which he had crashed and scrambled in his flight skirted the road both by the way he had come and upon the opposite side it was late now they could scarcely trace him by such paths as he had taken and if he could hope to regain his own dwelling it must surely be at such a time as that and under cover of the darkness this by degrees became pretty plain even to the mind of smike he had at first entertained some vague and childish idea of travelling into the country for ten or a dozen miles and then returning homewards by a wide circuit which should keep him clear of londonso great was his apprehension of traversing the streets alone lest he should again encounter his dreaded enemybut yielding to the conviction which these thoughts inspired he turned back and taking the open road though not without many fears and misgivings made for london again with scarcely less speed of foot than that with which he had left the temporary abode of mr squeers  by the time he reentered it at the western extremity the greater part of the shops were closed of the throngs of people who had been tempted abroad after the heat of the day but few remained in the streets and they were lounging home but of these he asked his way from time to time and by dint of repeated inquiries he at length reached the dwelling of newman noggs  all that evening newman had been hunting and searching in byways and corners for the very person who now knocked at his door while nicholas had been pursuing the same inquiry in other directions he was sitting with a melancholy air at his poor supper when smikes timorous and uncertain knock reached his ears alive to every sound in his anxious and expectant state newman hurried downstairs and uttering a cry of joyful surprise dragged the welcome visitor into the passage and up the stairs and said not a word until he had him safe in his own garret and the door was shut behind them when he mixed a great mugfull of ginandwater and holding it to smikes mouth as one might hold a bowl of medicine to the lips of a refractory child commanded him to drain it to the last drop  newman looked uncommonly blank when he found that smike did little more than put his lips to the precious mixture he was in the act of raising the mug to his own mouth with a deep sigh of compassion for his poor friends weakness when smike beginning to relate the adventures which had befallen him arrested him halfway and he stood listening with the mug in his hand  it was odd enough to see the change that came over newman as smike proceeded at first he stood rubbing his lips with the back of his hand as a preparatory ceremony towards composing himself for a draught then at the mention of squeers he took the mug under his arm and opening his eyes very wide looked on in the utmost astonishment when smike came to the assault upon himself in the hackney coach he hastily deposited the mug upon the table and limped up and down the room in a state of the greatest excitement stopping himself with a jerk every now and then as if to listen more attentively when john browdie came to be spoken of he dropped by slow and gradual degrees into a chair and rubbing his hands upon his kneesquicker and quicker as the story reached its climaxburst at last into a laugh composed of one loud sonorous ha ha having given vent to which his countenance immediately fell again as he inquired with the utmost anxiety whether it was probable that john browdie and squeers had come to blows  no i think not replied smike i dont think he could have missed me till i had got quite away  newman scratched his head with a shout of great disappointment and once more lifting up the mug applied himself to the contents smiling meanwhile over the rim with a grim and ghastly smile at smike  you shall stay here said newman youre tiredfagged ill tell them youre come back they have been half mad about you mr nicholas  god bless him cried smike  amen returned newman he hasnt had a minutes rest or peace no more has the old lady nor miss nickleby  no no has she thought about me said smike has she though oh has she has she dont tell me so if she has not  she has cried newman she is as noblehearted as she is beautiful  yes yes cried smike well said  so mild and gentle said newman  yes yes cried smike with increasing eagerness  and yet with such a true and gallant spirit pursued newman  he was going on in his enthusiasm when chancing to look at his companion he saw that he had covered his face with his hands and that tears were stealing out between his fingers  a moment before the boys eyes were sparkling with unwonted fire and every feature had been lighted up with an excitement which made him appear for the moment quite a different being  well well muttered newman as if he were a little puzzled it has touched me more than once to think such a nature should have been exposed to such trials this poor fellowyes yeshe feels that tooit softens himmakes him think of his former misery hah thats it yes thatshum  it was by no means clear from the tone of these broken reflections that newman noggs considered them as explaining at all satisfactorily the emotion which had suggested them he sat in a musing attitude for some time regarding smike occasionally with an anxious and doubtful glance which sufficiently showed that he was not very remotely connected with his thoughts  at length he repeated his proposition that smike should remain where he was for that night and that he noggs should straightway repair to the cottage to relieve the suspense of the family but as smike would not hear of thispleading his anxiety to see his friends againthey eventually sallied forth together and the night being by this time far advanced and smike being besides so footsore that he could hardly crawl along it was within an hour of sunrise when they reached their destination  at the first sound of their voices outside the house nicholas who had passed a sleepless night devising schemes for the recovery of his lost charge started from his bed and joyfully admitted them there was so much noisy conversation and congratulation and indignation that the remainder of the family were soon awakened and smike received a warm and cordial welcome not only from kate but from mrs nickleby also who assured him of her future favour and regard and was so obliging as to relate for his entertainment and that of the assembled circle a most remarkable account extracted from some work the name of which she had never known of a miraculous escape from some prison but what one she couldnt remember effected by an officer whose name she had forgotten confined for some crime which she didnt clearly recollect  at first nicholas was disposed to give his uncle credit for some portion of this bold attempt which had so nearly proved successful to carry off smike but on more mature consideration he was inclined to think that the full merit of it rested with mr squeers determined to ascertain if he could through john browdie how the case really stood he betook himself to his daily occupation meditating as he went on a great variety of schemes for the punishment of the yorkshire schoolmaster all of which had their foundation in the strictest principles of retributive justice and had but the one drawback of being wholly impracticable  a fine morning mr linkinwater said nicholas entering the office  ah replied tim talk of the country indeed what do you think of this now for a daya london dayeh  its a little clearer out of town said nicholas  clearer echoed tim linkinwater you should see it from my bedroom window  you should see it from mine replied nicholas with a smile  pooh pooh said tim linkinwater dont tell me country bow was quite a rustic place to tim nonsense what can you get in the country but newlaid eggs and flowers i can buy newlaid eggs in leadenhall market any morning before breakfast and as to flowers its worth a run upstairs to smell my mignonette or to see the double wallflower in the backattic window at no 6 in the court  there is a double wallflower at no 6 in the court is there said nicholas  yes is there replied tim and planted in a cracked jug without a spout there were hyacinths there this last spring blossoming inbut youll laugh at that of course  at what  at their blossoming in old blackingbottles said tim  not i indeed returned nicholas  tim looked wistfully at him for a moment as if he were encouraged by the tone of this reply to be more communicative on the subject and sticking behind his ear a pen that he had been making and shutting up his knife with a smart click said  they belong to a sickly bedridden humpbacked boy and seem to be the only pleasure mr nickleby of his sad existence how many years is it said tim pondering since i first noticed him quite a little child dragging himself about on a pair of tiny crutches well well not many but though they would appear nothing if i thought of other things they seem a long long time when i think of him it is a sad thing said tim breaking off to see a little deformed child sitting apart from other children who are active and merry watching the games he is denied the power to share in he made my heart ache very often  it is a good heart said nicholas that disentangles itself from the close avocations of every day to heed such things you were saying  that the flowers belonged to this poor boy said tim thats all when it is fine weather and he can crawl out of bed he draws a chair close to the window and sits there looking at them and arranging them all day long he used to nod at first and then we came to speak formerly when i called to him of a morning and asked him how he was he would smile and say better but now he shakes his head and only bends more closely over his old plants it must be dull to watch the dark housetops and the flying clouds for so many months but he is very patient  is there nobody in the house to cheer or help him asked nicholas  his father lives there i believe replied tim and other people too but no one seems to care much for the poor sickly cripple i have asked him very often if i can do nothing for him his answer is always the same nothing his voice is growing weak of late but i can see that he makes the old reply he cant leave his bed now so they have moved it close beside the window and there he lies all day now looking at the sky and now at his flowers which he still makes shift to trim and water with his own thin hands at night when he sees my candle he draws back his curtain and leaves it so till i am in bed it seems such company to him to know that i am there that i often sit at my window for an hour or more that he may see i am still awake and sometimes i get up in the night to look at the dull melancholy light in his little room and wonder whether he is awake or sleeping  the night will not be long coming said tim when he will sleep and never wake again on earth we have never so much as shaken hands in all our lives and yet i shall miss him like an old friend are there any country flowers that could interest me like these do you think or do you suppose that the withering of a hundred kinds of the choicest flowers that blow called by the hardest latin names that were ever invented would give me one fraction of the pain that i shall feel when these old jugs and bottles are swept away as lumber country cried tim with a contemptuous emphasis dont you know that i couldnt have such a court under my bedroom window anywhere but in london  with which inquiry tim turned his back and pretending to be absorbed in his accounts took an opportunity of hastily wiping his eyes when he supposed nicholas was looking another way  whether it was that tims accounts were more than usually intricate that morning or whether it was that his habitual serenity had been a little disturbed by these recollections it so happened that when nicholas returned from executing some commission and inquired whether mr charles cheeryble was alone in his room tim promptly and without the smallest hesitation replied in the affirmative although somebody had passed into the room not ten minutes before and tim took especial and particular pride in preventing any intrusion on either of the brothers when they were engaged with any visitor whatever  ill take this letter to him at once said nicholas if thats the case and with that he walked to the room and knocked at the door  no answer  another knock and still no answer  he cant be here thought nicholas ill lay it on his table  so nicholas opened the door and walked in and very quickly he turned to walk out again when he saw to his great astonishment and discomfiture a young lady upon her knees at mr cheerybles feet and mr cheeryble beseeching her to rise and entreating a third person who had the appearance of the young ladys female attendant to add her persuasions to his to induce her to do so  nicholas stammered out an awkward apology and was precipitately retiring when the young lady turning her head a little presented to his view the features of the lovely girl whom he had seen at the registeroffice on his first visit long before glancing from her to the attendant he recognised the same clumsy servant who had accompanied her then and between his admiration of the young ladys beauty and the confusion and surprise of this unexpected recognition he stood stockstill in such a bewildered state of surprise and embarrassment that for the moment he was quite bereft of the power either to speak or move  my dear maammy dear young lady cried brother charles in violent agitation pray dontnot another word i beseech and entreat you i implore youi beg of youto rise weweare not alone  as he spoke he raised the young lady who staggered to a chair and swooned away  she has fainted sir said nicholas darting eagerly forward  poor dear poor dear cried brother charles where is my brother ned ned my dear brother come here pray  brother charles my dear fellow replied his brother hurrying into the room what is theah what  hush hushnot a word for your life brother ned returned the other ring for the housekeeper my dear brothercall tim linkinwater here tim linkinwater sirmr nickleby my dear sir leave the room i beg and beseech of you  i think she is better now said nicholas who had been watching the patient so eagerly that he had not heard the request  poor bird cried brother charles gently taking her hand in his and laying her head upon his arm brother ned my dear fellow you will be surprised i know to witness this in business hours but here he was again reminded of the presence of nicholas and shaking him by the hand earnestly requested him to leave the room and to send tim linkinwater without an instants delay  nicholas immediately withdrew and on his way to the countinghouse met both the old housekeeper and tim linkinwater jostling each other in the passage and hurrying to the scene of action with extraordinary speed without waiting to hear his message tim linkinwater darted into the room and presently afterwards nicholas heard the door shut and locked on the inside  he had abundance of time to ruminate on this discovery for tim linkinwater was absent during the greater part of an hour during the whole of which time nicholas thought of nothing but the young lady and her exceeding beauty and what could possibly have brought her there and why they made such a mystery of it the more he thought of all this the more it perplexed him and the more anxious he became to know who and what she was i should have known her among ten thousand thought nicholas and with that he walked up and down the room and recalling her face and figure of which he had a peculiarly vivid remembrance discarded all other subjects of reflection and dwelt upon that alone  at length tim linkinwater came backprovokingly cool and with papers in his hand and a pen in his mouth as if nothing had happened  is she quite recovered said nicholas impetuously  who returned tim linkinwater  who repeated nicholas the young lady  what do you make mr nickleby said tim taking his pen out of his mouth what do you make of four hundred and twentyseven times three thousand two hundred and thirtyeight  nay returned nicholas what do you make of my question first i asked you  about the young lady said tim linkinwater putting on his spectacles to be sure yes oh shes very well  very well is she returned nicholas  very well replied mr linkinwater gravely  will she be able to go home today asked nicholas  shes gone said tim  gone  yes  i hope she has not far to go said nicholas looking earnestly at the other  ay replied the immovable tim i hope she hasnt  nicholas hazarded one or two further remarks but it was evident that tim linkinwater had his own reasons for evading the subject and that he was determined to afford no further information respecting the fair unknown who had awakened so much curiosity in the breast of his young friend nothing daunted by this repulse nicholas returned to the charge next day emboldened by the circumstance of mr linkinwater being in a very talkative and communicative mood but directly he resumed the theme tim relapsed into a state of most provoking taciturnity and from answering in monosyllables came to returning no answers at all save such as were to be inferred from several grave nods and shrugs which only served to whet that appetite for intelligence in nicholas which had already attained a most unreasonable height  foiled in these attempts he was fain to content himself with watching for the young ladys next visit but here again he was disappointed day after day passed and she did not return he looked eagerly at the superscription of all the notes and letters but there was not one among them which he could fancy to be in her handwriting on two or three occasions he was employed on business which took him to a distance and had formerly been transacted by tim linkinwater nicholas could not help suspecting that for some reason or other he was sent out of the way on purpose and that the young lady was there in his absence nothing transpired however to confirm this suspicion and tim could not be entrapped into any confession or admission tending to support it in the smallest degree  mystery and disappointment are not absolutely indispensable to the growth of love but they are very often its powerful auxiliaries out of sight out of mind is well enough as a proverb applicable to cases of friendship though absence is not always necessary to hollowness of heart even between friends and truth and honesty like precious stones are perhaps most easily imitated at a distance when the counterfeits often pass for real love however is very materially assisted by a warm and active imagination which has a long memory and will thrive for a considerable time on very slight and sparing food thus it is that it often attains its most luxuriant growth in separation and under circumstances of the utmost difficulty and thus it was that nicholas thinking of nothing but the unknown young lady from day to day and from hour to hour began at last to think that he was very desperately in love with her and that never was such an illused and persecuted lover as he  still though he loved and languished after the most orthodox models and was only deterred from making a confidante of kate by the slight considerations of having never in all his life spoken to the object of his passion and having never set eyes upon her except on two occasions on both of which she had come and gone like a flash of lightningor as nicholas himself said in the numerous conversations he held with himself like a vision of youth and beauty much too bright to lasthis ardour and devotion remained without its reward the young lady appeared no more so there was a great deal of love wasted enough indeed to have set up halfadozen young gentlemen as times go with the utmost decency and nobody was a bit the wiser for it not even nicholas himself who on the contrary became more dull sentimental and lackadaisical every day  while matters were in this state the failure of a correspondent of the brothers cheeryble in germany imposed upon tim linkinwater and nicholas the necessity of going through some very long and complicated accounts extending over a considerable space of time to get through them with the greater dispatch tim linkinwater proposed that they should remain at the countinghouse for a week or so until ten oclock at night to this as nothing damped the zeal of nicholas in the service of his kind patronsnot even romance which has seldom business habitshe cheerfully assented on the very first night of these later hours at nine exactly there came not the young lady herself but her servant who being closeted with brother charles for some time went away and returned next night at the same hour and on the next and on the next again  these repeated visits inflamed the curiosity of nicholas to the very highest pitch tantalised and excited beyond all bearing and unable to fathom the mystery without neglecting his duty he confided the whole secret to newman noggs imploring him to be on the watch next night to follow the girl home to set on foot such inquiries relative to the name condition and history of her mistress as he could without exciting suspicion and to report the result to him with the least possible delay  beyond all measure proud of this commission newman noggs took up his post in the square on the following evening a full hour before the needful time and planting himself behind the pump and pulling his hat over his eyes began his watch with an elaborate appearance of mystery admirably calculated to excite the suspicion of all beholders indeed divers servant girls who came to draw water and sundry little boys who stopped to drink at the ladle were almost scared out of their senses by the apparition of newman noggs looking stealthily round the pump with nothing of him visible but his face and that wearing the expression of a meditative ogre  punctual to her time the messenger came again and after an interview of rather longer duration than usual departed newman had made two appointments with nicholas one for the next evening conditional on his success and one the next night following which was to be kept under all circumstances the first night he was not at the place of meeting a certain tavern about halfway between the city and golden square but on the second night he was there before nicholas and received him with open arms  its all right whispered newman sit down sit down theres a dear young man and let me tell you all about it  nicholas needed no second invitation and eagerly inquired what was the news  theres a great deal of news said newman in a flutter of exultation its all right dont be anxious i dont know where to begin never mind that keep up your spirits its all right  well said nicholas eagerly yes  yes replied newman thats it  whats it said nicholas the namethe name my dear fellow  the names bobster replied newman  bobster repeated nicholas indignantly  thats the name said newman i remember it by lobster  bobster repeated nicholas more emphatically than before that must be the servants name  no it ant said newman shaking his head with great positiveness miss cecilia bobster  cecilia eh returned nicholas muttering the two names together over and over again in every variety of tone to try the effect well cecilia is a pretty name  very and a pretty creature too said newman  who said nicholas  miss bobster  why where have you seen her demanded nicholas  never mind my dear boy retorted noggs clapping him on the shoulder i have seen her you shall see her ive managed it all  my dear newman cried nicholas grasping his hand are you serious  i am replied newman i mean it all every word you shall see her tomorrow night she consents to hear you speak for yourself i persuaded her she is all affability goodness sweetness and beauty  i know she is i know she must be newman said nicholas wringing his hand  you are right returned newman  where does she live cried nicholas what have you learnt of her history has she a fathermotherany brotherssisters what did she say how came you to see her was she not very much surprised did you say how passionately i have longed to speak to her did you tell her where i had seen her did you tell her how and when and where and how long and how often i have thought of that sweet face which came upon me in my bitterest distress like a glimpse of some better worlddid you newmandid you  poor noggs literally gasped for breath as this flood of questions rushed upon him and moved spasmodically in his chair at every fresh inquiry staring at nicholas meanwhile with a most ludicrous expression of perplexity  no said newman i didnt tell her that  didnt tell her which asked nicholas  about the glimpse of the better world said newman i didnt tell her who you were either or where youd seen her i said you loved her to distraction  thats true newman replied nicholas with his characteristic vehemence heaven knows i do  i said too that you had admired her for a long time in secret said newman  yes yes what did she say to that asked nicholas  blushed said newman  to be sure of course she would said nicholas approvingly newman then went on to say that the young lady was an only child that her mother was dead that she resided with her father and that she had been induced to allow her lover a secret interview at the intercession of her servant who had great influence with her he further related how it required much moving and great eloquence to bring the young lady to this pass how it was expressly understood that she merely afforded nicholas an opportunity of declaring his passion and how she by no means pledged herself to be favourably impressed with his attentions the mystery of her visits to the brothers cheeryble remained wholly unexplained for newman had not alluded to them either in his preliminary conversations with the servant or his subsequent interview with the mistress merely remarking that he had been instructed to watch the girl home and plead his young friends cause and not saying how far he had followed her or from what point but newman hinted that from what had fallen from the confidante he had been led to suspect that the young lady led a very miserable and unhappy life under the strict control of her only parent who was of a violent and brutal temper a circumstance which he thought might in some degree account both for her having sought the protection and friendship of the brothers and her suffering herself to be prevailed upon to grant the promised interview the last he held to be a very logical deduction from the premises inasmuch as it was but natural to suppose that a young lady whose present condition was so unenviable would be more than commonly desirous to change it  it appeared on further questioningfor it was only by a very long and arduous process that all this could be got out of newman noggsthat newman in explanation of his shabby appearance had represented himself as being for certain wise and indispensable purposes connected with that intrigue in disguise and being questioned how he had come to exceed his commission so far as to procure an interview he responded that the lady appearing willing to grant it he considered himself bound both in duty and gallantry to avail himself of such a golden means of enabling nicholas to prosecute his addresses after these and all possible questions had been asked and answered twenty times over they parted undertaking to meet on the following night at halfpast ten for the purpose of fulfilling the appointment which was for eleven oclock  things come about very strangely thought nicholas as he walked home i never contemplated anything of this kind never dreamt of the possibility of it to know something of the life of one in whom i felt such interest to see her in the street to pass the house in which she lived to meet her sometimes in her walks to hope that a day might come when i might be in a condition to tell her of my love this was the utmost extent of my thoughts now howeverbut i should be a fool indeed to repine at my own good fortune  still nicholas was dissatisfied and there was more in the dissatisfaction than mere revulsion of feeling he was angry with the young lady for being so easily won because reasoned nicholas it is not as if she knew it was i but it might have been anybodywhich was certainly not pleasant the next moment he was angry with himself for entertaining such thoughts arguing that nothing but goodness could dwell in such a temple and that the behaviour of the brothers sufficiently showed the estimation in which they held her the fact is shes a mystery altogether said nicholas this was not more satisfactory than his previous course of reflection and only drove him out upon a new sea of speculation and conjecture where he tossed and tumbled in great discomfort of mind until the clock struck ten and the hour of meeting drew nigh  nicholas had dressed himself with great care and even newman noggs had trimmed himself up a little his coat presenting the phenomenon of two consecutive buttons and the supplementary pins being inserted at tolerably regular intervals he wore his hat too in the newest taste with a pockethandkerchief in the crown and a twisted end of it straggling out behind after the fashion of a pigtail though he could scarcely lay claim to the ingenuity of inventing this latter decoration inasmuch as he was utterly unconscious of it being in a nervous and excited condition which rendered him quite insensible to everything but the great object of the expedition  they traversed the streets in profound silence and after walking at a round pace for some distance arrived in one of a gloomy appearance and very little frequented near the edgeware road  number twelve said newman  oh replied nicholas looking about him  good street said newman  yes returned nicholas rather dull  newman made no answer to this remark but halting abruptly planted nicholas with his back to some area railings and gave him to understand that he was to wait there without moving hand or foot until it was satisfactorily ascertained that the coast was clear this done noggs limped away with great alacrity looking over his shoulder every instant to make quite certain that nicholas was obeying his directions and ascending the steps of a house some halfdozen doors off was lost to view  after a short delay he reappeared and limping back again halted midway and beckoned nicholas to follow him  well said nicholas advancing towards him on tiptoe  all right replied newman in high glee all ready nobody at home couldnt be better ha ha  with this fortifying assurance he stole past a streetdoor on which nicholas caught a glimpse of a brass plate with bobster in very large letters and stopping at the areagate which was open signed to his young friend to descend  what the devil cried nicholas drawing back are we to sneak into the kitchen as if we came after the forks  hush replied newman old bobsterferocious turk hed kill em allbox the young ladys earshe doesoften  what cried nicholas in high wrath do you mean to tell me that any man would dare to box the ears of such a  he had no time to sing the praises of his mistress just then for newman gave him a gentle push which had nearly precipitated him to the bottom of the area steps thinking it best to take the hint in good part nicholas descended without further remonstrance but with a countenance bespeaking anything rather than the hope and rapture of a passionate lover newman followedhe would have followed head first but for the timely assistance of nicholasand taking his hand led him through a stone passage profoundly dark into a backkitchen or cellar of the blackest and most pitchy obscurity where they stopped  well said nicholas in a discontented whisper this is not all i suppose is it  no no rejoined noggs theyll be here directly its all right  i am glad to hear it said nicholas i shouldnt have thought it i confess  they exchanged no further words and there nicholas stood listening to the loud breathing of newman noggs and imagining that his nose seemed to glow like a redhot coal even in the midst of the darkness which enshrouded them suddenly the sound of cautious footsteps attracted his ear and directly afterwards a female voice inquired if the gentleman was there  yes replied nicholas turning towards the corner from which the voice proceeded who is that  only me sir replied the voice now if you please maam  a gleam of light shone into the place and presently the servant girl appeared bearing a light and followed by her young mistress who seemed to be overwhelmed by modesty and confusion  at sight of the young lady nicholas started and changed colour his heart beat violently and he stood rooted to the spot at that instant and almost simultaneously with her arrival and that of the candle there was heard a loud and furious knocking at the streetdoor which caused newman noggs to jump up with great agility from a beerbarrel on which he had been seated astride and to exclaim abruptly and with a face of ashy paleness bobster by the lord  the young lady shrieked the attendant wrung her hands nicholas gazed from one to the other in apparent stupefaction and newman hurried to and fro thrusting his hands into all his pockets successively and drawing out the linings of every one in the excess of his irresolution it was but a moment but the confusion crowded into that one moment no imagination can exaggerate  leave the house for heavens sake we have done wrong we deserve it all cried the young lady leave the house or i am ruined and undone for ever  will you hear me say but one word cried nicholas only one i will not detain you will you hear me say one word in explanation of this mischance  but nicholas might as well have spoken to the wind for the young lady with distracted looks hurried up the stairs he would have followed her but newman twisting his hand in his coat collar dragged him towards the passage by which they had entered  let me go newman in the devils name cried nicholas i must speak to her i will i will not leave this house without  reputationcharacterviolenceconsider said newman clinging round him with both arms and hurrying him away let them open the door well go as we came directly its shut come this way here  overpowered by the remonstrances of newman and the tears and prayers of the girl and the tremendous knocking above which had never ceased nicholas allowed himself to be hurried off and precisely as mr bobster made his entrance by the streetdoor he and noggs made their exit by the areagate  they hurried away through several streets without stopping or speaking at last they halted and confronted each other with blank and rueful faces  never mind said newman gasping for breath dont be cast down its all right more fortunate next time it couldnt be helped i did my part  excellently replied nicholas taking his hand excellently and like the true and zealous friend you are onlymind i am not disappointed newman and feel just as much indebted to youonly it was the wrong lady  eh cried newman noggs taken in by the servant  newman newman said nicholas laying his hand upon his shoulder it was the wrong servant too  newmans underjaw dropped and he gazed at nicholas with his sound eye fixed fast and motionless in his head  dont take it to heart said nicholas its of no consequence you see i dont care about it you followed the wrong person thats all  that was all whether newman noggs had looked round the pump in a slanting direction so long that his sight became impaired or whether finding that there was time to spare he had recruited himself with a few drops of something stronger than the pump could yieldby whatsoever means it had come to pass this was his mistake and nicholas went home to brood upon it and to meditate upon the charms of the unknown young lady now as far beyond his reach as ever    chapter 41  containing some romantic passages between mrs nickleby and the gentleman in the smallclothes next door   ever since her last momentous conversation with her son mrs nickleby had begun to display unusual care in the adornment of her person gradually superadding to those staid and matronly habiliments which had up to that time formed her ordinary attire a variety of embellishments and decorations slight perhaps in themselves but taken together and considered with reference to the subject of her disclosure of no mean importance even her black dress assumed something of a deadlylively air from the jaunty style in which it was worn and eked out as its lingering attractions were by a prudent disposal here and there of certain juvenile ornaments of little or no value which had for that reason alone escaped the general wreck and been permitted to slumber peacefully in odd corners of old drawers and boxes where daylight seldom shone her mourning garments assumed quite a new character from being the outward tokens of respect and sorrow for the dead they became converted into signals of very slaughterous and killing designs upon the living  mrs nickleby might have been stimulated to this proceeding by a lofty sense of duty and impulses of unquestionable excellence she might by this time have become impressed with the sinfulness of long indulgence in unavailing woe or the necessity of setting a proper example of neatness and decorum to her blooming daughter considerations of duty and responsibility apart the change might have taken its rise in feelings of the purest and most disinterested charity the gentleman next door had been vilified by nicholas rudely stigmatised as a dotard and an idiot and for these attacks upon his understanding mrs nickleby was in some sort accountable she might have felt that it was the act of a good christian to show by all means in her power that the abused gentleman was neither the one nor the other and what better means could she adopt towards so virtuous and laudable an end than proving to all men in her own person that his passion was the most rational and reasonable in the world and just the very result of all others which discreet and thinking persons might have foreseen from her incautiously displaying her matured charms without reserve under the very eye as it were of an ardent and toosusceptible man  ah said mrs nickleby gravely shaking her head if nicholas knew what his poor dear papa suffered before we were engaged when i used to hate him he would have a little more feeling shall i ever forget the morning i looked scornfully at him when he offered to carry my parasol or that night when i frowned at him it was a mercy he didnt emigrate it very nearly drove him to it  whether the deceased might not have been better off if he had emigrated in his bachelor days was a question which his relict did not stop to consider for kate entered the room with her workbox in this stage of her reflections and a much slighter interruption or no interruption at all would have diverted mrs nicklebys thoughts into a new channel at any time  kate my dear said mrs nickleby i dont know how it is but a fine warm summer day like this with the birds singing in every direction always puts me in mind of roast pig with sage and onion sauce and made gravy  thats a curious association of ideas is it not mama  upon my word my dear i dont know replied mrs nickleby roast pig let me see on the day five weeks after you were christened we had a roastno that couldnt have been a pig either because i recollect there were a pair of them to carve and your poor papa and i could never have thought of sitting down to two pigsthey must have been partridges roast pig i hardly think we ever could have had one now i come to remember for your papa could never bear the sight of them in the shops and used to say that they always put him in mind of very little babies only the pigs had much fairer complexions and he had a horror of little babies too because he couldnt very well afford any increase to his family and had a natural dislike to the subject its very odd now what can have put that in my head i recollect dining once at mrs bevans in that broad street round the corner by the coachmakers where the tipsy man fell through the cellarflap of an empty house nearly a week before the quarterday and wasnt found till the new tenant went inand we had roast pig there it must be that i think that reminds me of it especially as there was a little bird in the room that would keep on singing all the time of dinnerat least not a little bird for it was a parrot and he didnt sing exactly for he talked and swore dreadfully but i think it must be that indeed i am sure it must shouldnt you say so my dear  i should say there was not a doubt about it mama returned kate with a cheerful smile  no but do you think so kate said mrs nickleby with as much gravity as if it were a question of the most imminent and thrilling interest if you dont say so at once you know because its just as well to be correct particularly on a point of this kind which is very curious and worth settling while one thinks about it  kate laughingly replied that she was quite convinced and as her mama still appeared undetermined whether it was not absolutely essential that the subject should be renewed proposed that they should take their work into the summerhouse and enjoy the beauty of the afternoon mrs nickleby readily assented and to the summerhouse they repaired without further discussion  well i will say observed mrs nickleby as she took her seat that there never was such a good creature as smike upon my word the pains he has taken in putting this little arbour to rights and training the sweetest flowers about it are beyond anything i could havei wish he wouldnt put all the gravel on your side kate my dear though and leave nothing but mould for me  dear mama returned kate hastily take this seatdoto oblige me mama  no indeed my dear i shall keep my own side said mrs nickleby well i declare  kate looked up inquiringly  if he hasnt been said mrs nickleby and got from somewhere or other a couple of roots of those flowers that i said i was so fond of the other night and asked you if you were notno that you said you were so fond of the other night and asked me if i wasntits the same thing now upon my word i take that as very kind and attentive indeed i dont see added mrs nickleby looking narrowly about her any of them on my side but i suppose they grow best near the gravel you may depend upon it they do kate and thats the reason they are all near you and he has put the gravel there because its the sunny side upon my word thats very clever now i shouldnt have had half as much thought myself  mama said kate bending over her work so that her face was almost hidden before you were married  dear me kate interrupted mrs nickleby what in the name of goodness graciousness makes you fly off to the time before i was married when im talking to you about his thoughtfulness and attention to me you dont seem to take the smallest interest in the garden  oh mama said kate raising her face again you know i do  well then my dear why dont you praise the neatness and prettiness with which its kept said mrs nickleby how very odd you are kate  i do praise it mama answered kate gently poor fellow  i scarcely ever hear you my dear retorted mrs nickleby thats all ive got to say by this time the good lady had been a long while upon one topic so she fell at once into her daughters little trap if trap it were and inquired what she had been going to say  about what mama said kate who had apparently quite forgotten her diversion  lor kate my dear returned her mother why youre asleep or stupid about the time before i was married  oh yes said kate i remember i was going to ask mama before you were married had you many suitors  suitors my dear cried mrs nickleby with a smile of wonderful complacency first and last kate i must have had a dozen at least  mama returned kate in a tone of remonstrance  i had indeed my dear said mrs nickleby not including your poor papa or a young gentleman who used to go at that time to the same dancing school and who would send gold watches and bracelets to our house in giltedged paper which were always returned and who afterwards unfortunately went out to botany bay in a cadet shipa convict ship i meanand escaped into a bush and killed sheep i dont know how they got there and was going to be hung only he accidentally choked himself and the government pardoned him then there was young lukin said mrs nickleby beginning with her left thumb and checking off the names on her fingersmogleytipslarkcabberysmifser  having now reached her little finger mrs nickleby was carrying the account over to the other hand when a loud hem which appeared to come from the very foundation of the gardenwall gave both herself and her daughter a violent start  mama what was that said kate in a low tone of voice  upon my word my dear returned mrs nickleby considerably startled unless it was the gentleman belonging to the next house i dont know what it could possibly  ahem cried the same voice and that not in the tone of an ordinary clearing of the throat but in a kind of bellow which woke up all the echoes in the neighbourhood and was prolonged to an extent which must have made the unseen bellower quite black in the face  i understand it now my dear said mrs nickleby laying her hand on kates dont be alarmed my love its not directed to you and is not intended to frighten anybody let us give everybody their due kate i am bound to say that  so saying mrs nickleby nodded her head and patted the back of her daughters hand a great many times and looked as if she could tell something vastly important if she chose but had selfdenial thank heaven and wouldnt do it  what do you mean mama demanded kate in evident surprise  dont be flurried my dear replied mrs nickleby looking towards the gardenwall for you see im not and if it would be excusable in anybody to be flurried it certainly wouldunder all the circumstancesbe excusable in me but i am not katenot at all  it seems designed to attract our attention mama said kate  it is designed to attract our attention my dear at least rejoined mrs nickleby drawing herself up and patting her daughters hand more blandly than before to attract the attention of one of us hem you neednt be at all uneasy my dear  kate looked very much perplexed and was apparently about to ask for further explanation when a shouting and scuffling noise as of an elderly gentleman whooping and kicking up his legs on loose gravel with great violence was heard to proceed from the same direction as the former sounds and before they had subsided a large cucumber was seen to shoot up in the air with the velocity of a skyrocket whence it descended tumbling over and over until it fell at mrs nicklebys feet  this remarkable appearance was succeeded by another of a precisely similar description then a fine vegetable marrow of unusually large dimensions was seen to whirl aloft and come toppling down then several cucumbers shot up together and finally the air was darkened by a shower of onions turnipradishes and other small vegetables which fell rolling and scattering and bumping about in all directions  as kate rose from her seat in some alarm and caught her mothers hand to run with her into the house she felt herself rather retarded than assisted in her intention and following the direction of mrs nicklebys eyes was quite terrified by the apparition of an old black velvet cap which by slow degrees as if its wearer were ascending a ladder or pair of steps rose above the wall dividing their garden from that of the next cottage which like their own was a detached building and was gradually followed by a very large head and an old face in which were a pair of most extraordinary grey eyes very wild very wide open and rolling in their sockets with a dull languishing leering look most ugly to behold  mama cried kate really terrified for the moment why do you stop why do you lose an instant mama pray come in  kate my dear returned her mother still holding back how can you be so foolish im ashamed of you how do you suppose you are ever to get through life if youre such a coward as this what do you want sir said mrs nickleby addressing the intruder with a sort of simpering displeasure how dare you look into this garden  queen of my soul replied the stranger folding his hands together this goblet sip  nonsense sir said mrs nickleby kate my love pray be quiet  wont you sip the goblet urged the stranger with his head imploringly on one side and his right hand on his breast oh do sip the goblet  i shall not consent to do anything of the kind sir said mrs nickleby pray begone  why is it said the old gentleman coming up a step higher and leaning his elbows on the wall with as much complacency as if he were looking out of window why is it that beauty is always obdurate even when admiration is as honourable and respectful as mine here he smiled kissed his hand and made several low bows is it owing to the bees who when the honey season is over and they are supposed to have been killed with brimstone in reality fly to barbary and lull the captive moors to sleep with their drowsy songs or is it he added dropping his voice almost to a whisper in consequence of the statue at charing cross having been lately seen on the stock exchange at midnight walking arminarm with the pump from aldgate in a ridinghabit  mama murmured kate do you hear him  hush my dear replied mrs nickleby in the same tone of voice he is very polite and i think that was a quotation from the poets pray dont worry me soyoull pinch my arm black and blue go away sir  quite away said the gentleman with a languishing look oh quite away  yes returned mrs nickleby certainly you have no business here this is private property sir you ought to know that  i do know said the old gentleman laying his finger on his nose with an air of familiarity most reprehensible that this is a sacred and enchanted spot where the most divine charmshere he kissed his hand and bowed againwaft mellifluousness over the neighbours gardens and force the fruit and vegetables into premature existence that fact i am acquainted with but will you permit me fairest creature to ask you one question in the absence of the planet venus who has gone on business to the horse guards and would otherwisejealous of your superior charmsinterpose between us  kate observed mrs nickleby turning to her daughter its very awkward positively i really dont know what to say to this gentleman one ought to be civil you know  dear mama rejoined kate dont say a word to him but let us run away as fast as we can and shut ourselves up till nicholas comes home  mrs nickleby looked very grand not to say contemptuous at this humiliating proposal and turning to the old gentleman who had watched them during these whispers with absorbing eagerness said  if you will conduct yourself sir like the gentleman i should imagine you to be from your language andandappearance quite the counterpart of your grandpapa kate my dear in his best days and will put your question to me in plain words i will answer it  if mrs nicklebys excellent papa had borne in his best days a resemblance to the neighbour now looking over the wall he must have been to say the least a very queerlooking old gentleman in his prime perhaps kate thought so for she ventured to glance at his living portrait with some attention as he took off his black velvet cap and exhibiting a perfectly bald head made a long series of bows each accompanied with a fresh kiss of the hand after exhausting himself to all appearance with this fatiguing performance he covered his head once more pulled the cap very carefully over the tips of his ears and resuming his former attitude said  the question is  here he broke off to look round in every direction and satisfy himself beyond all doubt that there were no listeners near assured that there were not he tapped his nose several times accompanying the action with a cunning look as though congratulating himself on his caution and stretching out his neck said in a loud whisper  are you a princess  you are mocking me sir replied mrs nickleby making a feint of retreating towards the house  no but are you said the old gentleman  you know i am not sir replied mrs nickleby  then are you any relation to the archbishop of canterbury inquired the old gentleman with great anxiety or to the pope of rome or the speaker of the house of commons forgive me if i am wrong but i was told you were niece to the commissioners of paving and daughterinlaw to the lord mayor and court of common council which would account for your relationship to all three  whoever has spread such reports sir returned mrs nickleby with some warmth has taken great liberties with my name and one which i am sure my son nicholas if he was aware of it would not allow for an instant the idea said mrs nickleby drawing herself up niece to the commissioners of paving  pray mama come away whispered kate  pray mama nonsense kate said mrs nickleby angrily but thats just the way if they had said i was niece to a piping bullfinch what would you care but i have no sympathy whimpered mrs nickleby i dont expect it thats one thing  tears cried the old gentleman with such an energetic jump that he fell down two or three steps and grated his chin against the wall catch the crystal globulescatch embottle em upcork em tightput sealing wax on the topseal em with a cupidlabel em best qualityand stow em away in the fourteen binn with a bar of iron on the top to keep the thunder off  issuing these commands as if there were a dozen attendants all actively engaged in their execution he turned his velvet cap inside out put it on with great dignity so as to obscure his right eye and threefourths of his nose and sticking his arms akimbo looked very fiercely at a sparrow hard by till the bird flew away when he put his cap in his pocket with an air of great satisfaction and addressed himself with respectful demeanour to mrs nickleby  beautiful madam such were his words if i have made any mistake with regard to your family or connections i humbly beseech you to pardon me if i supposed you to be related to foreign powers or native boards it is because you have a manner a carriage a dignity which you will excuse my saying that none but yourself with the single exception perhaps of the tragic muse when playing extemporaneously on the barrel organ before the east india company can parallel i am not a youth maam as you see and although beings like you can never grow old i venture to presume that we are fitted for each other  really kate my love said mrs nickleby faintly and looking another way  i have estates maam said the old gentleman flourishing his right hand negligently as if he made very light of such matters and speaking very fast jewels lighthouses fishponds a whalery of my own in the north sea and several oysterbeds of great profit in the pacific ocean if you will have the kindness to step down to the royal exchange and to take the cockedhat off the stoutest beadles head you will find my card in the lining of the crown wrapped up in a piece of blue paper my walkingstick is also to be seen on application to the chaplain of the house of commons who is strictly forbidden to take any money for showing it i have enemies about me maam he looked towards his house and spoke very low who attack me on all occasions and wish to secure my property if you bless me with your hand and heart you can apply to the lord chancellor or call out the military if necessarysending my toothpick to the commanderinchief will be sufficientand so clear the house of them before the ceremony is performed after that love bliss and rapture rapture love and bliss be mine be mine  repeating these last words with great rapture and enthusiasm the old gentleman put on his black velvet cap again and looking up into the sky in a hasty manner said something that was not quite intelligible concerning a balloon he expected and which was rather after its time  be mine be mine repeated the old gentleman  kate my dear said mrs nickleby i have hardly the power to speak but it is necessary for the happiness of all parties that this matter should be set at rest for ever  surely there is no necessity for you to say one word mama reasoned kate  you will allow me my dear if you please to judge for myself said mrs nickleby  be mine be mine cried the old gentleman  it can scarcely be expected sir said mrs nickleby fixing her eyes modestly on the ground that i should tell a stranger whether i feel flattered and obliged by such proposals or not they certainly are made under very singular circumstances still at the same time as far as it goes and to a certain extent of course mrs nicklebys customary qualification they must be gratifying and agreeable to ones feelings  be mine be mine cried the old gentleman gog and magog gog and magog be mine be mine  it will be sufficient for me to say sir resumed mrs nickleby with perfect seriousnessand im sure youll see the propriety of taking an answer and going awaythat i have made up my mind to remain a widow and to devote myself to my children you may not suppose i am the mother of two childrenindeed many people have doubted it and said that nothing on earth could ever make em believe it possiblebut it is the case and they are both grown up we shall be very glad to have you for a neighbourvery glad delighted im surebut in any other character its quite impossible quite as to my being young enough to marry again that perhaps may be so or it may not be but i couldnt think of it for an instant not on any account whatever i said i never would and i never will its a very painful thing to have to reject proposals and i would much rather that none were made at the same time this is the answer that i determined long ago to make and this is the answer i shall always give  these observations were partly addressed to the old gentleman partly to kate and partly delivered in soliloquy towards their conclusion the suitor evinced a very irreverent degree of inattention and mrs nickleby had scarcely finished speaking when to the great terror both of that lady and her daughter he suddenly flung off his coat and springing on the top of the wall threw himself into an attitude which displayed his smallclothes and grey worsteds to the fullest advantage and concluded by standing on one leg and repeating his favourite bellow with increased vehemence  while he was still dwelling on the last note and embellishing it with a prolonged flourish a dirty hand was observed to glide stealthily and swiftly along the top of the wall as if in pursuit of a fly and then to clasp with the utmost dexterity one of the old gentlemans ankles this done the companion hand appeared and clasped the other ankle  thus encumbered the old gentleman lifted his legs awkwardly once or twice as if they were very clumsy and imperfect pieces of machinery and then looking down on his own side of the wall burst into a loud laugh  its you is it said the old gentleman  yes its me replied a gruff voice  hows the emperor of tartary said the old gentleman  oh hes much the same as usual was the reply no better and no worse  the young prince of china said the old gentleman with much interest is he reconciled to his fatherinlaw the great potato salesman  no answered the gruff voice and he says he never will be thats more  if thats the case observed the old gentleman perhaps id better come down  well said the man on the other side i think you had perhaps  one of the hands being then cautiously unclasped the old gentleman dropped into a sitting posture and was looking round to smile and bow to mrs nickleby when he disappeared with some precipitation as if his legs had been pulled from below  very much relieved by his disappearance kate was turning to speak to her mama when the dirty hands again became visible and were immediately followed by the figure of a coarse squat man who ascended by the steps which had been recently occupied by their singular neighbour  beg your pardon ladies said this new comer grinning and touching his hat has he been making love to either of you  yes said kate  ah rejoined the man taking his handkerchief out of his hat and wiping his face he always will you know nothing will prevent his making love  i need not ask you if he is out of his mind poor creature said kate  why no replied the man looking into his hat throwing his handkerchief in at one dab and putting it on again thats pretty plain that is  has he been long so asked kate  a long while  and is there no hope for him said kate compassionately  not a bit and dont deserve to be replied the keeper hes a deal pleasanter without his senses than with em he was the cruellest wickedest outandouterest old flint that ever drawed breath  indeed said kate  by george replied the keeper shaking his head so emphatically that he was obliged to frown to keep his hat on i never come across such a vagabond and my mate says the same broke his poor wifes heart turned his daughters out of doors drove his sons into the streets it was a blessing he went mad at last through evil tempers and covetousness and selfishness and guzzling and drinking or hed have drove many others so hope for him an old rip there isnt too much hope going but ill bet a crown that what there is is saved for more deserving chaps than him anyhow  with which confession of his faith the keeper shook his head again as much as to say that nothing short of this would do if things were to go on at all and touching his hat sulkilynot that he was in an ill humour but that his subject ruffled himdescended the ladder and took it away  during this conversation mrs nickleby had regarded the man with a severe and steadfast look she now heaved a profound sigh and pursing up her lips shook her head in a slow and doubtful manner  poor creature said kate  ah poor indeed rejoined mrs nickleby its shameful that such things should be allowed shameful  how can they be helped mama said kate mournfully the infirmities of nature  nature said mrs nickleby what do you suppose this poor gentleman is out of his mind  can anybody who sees him entertain any other opinion mama  why then i just tell you this kate returned mrs nickleby that he is nothing of the kind and i am surprised you can be so imposed upon its some plot of these people to possess themselves of his propertydidnt he say so himself he may be a little odd and flighty perhaps many of us are that but downright mad and express himself as he does respectfully and in quite poetical language and making offers with so much thought and care and prudencenot as if he ran into the streets and went down upon his knees to the first chit of a girl he met as a madman would no no kate theres a great deal too much method in his madness depend upon that my dear    chapter 42  illustrative of the convivial sentiment that the best of friends must sometimes part   the pavement of snow hill had been baking and frying all day in the heat and the twain saracens heads guarding the entrance to the hostelry of whose name and sign they are the duplicate presentments lookedor seemed in the eyes of jaded and footsore passersby to lookmore vicious than usual after blistering and scorching in the sun when in one of the inns smallest sittingrooms through whose open window there rose in a palpable steam wholesome exhalations from reeking coachhorses the usual furniture of a teatable was displayed in neat and inviting order flanked by large joints of roast and boiled a tongue a pigeon pie a cold fowl a tankard of ale and other little matters of the like kind which in degenerate towns and cities are generally understood to belong more particularly to solid lunches stagecoach dinners or unusually substantial breakfasts  mr john browdie with his hands in his pockets hovered restlessly about these delicacies stopping occasionally to whisk the flies out of the sugarbasin with his wifes pockethandkerchief or to dip a teaspoon in the milkpot and carry it to his mouth or to cut off a little knob of crust and a little corner of meat and swallow them at two gulps like a couple of pills after every one of these flirtations with the eatables he pulled out his watch and declared with an earnestness quite pathetic that he couldnt undertake to hold out two minutes longer  tilly said john to his lady who was reclining half awake and half asleep upon a sofa  well john  well john retorted her husband impatiently dost thou feel hoongry lass  not very said mrs browdie  not vary repeated john raising his eyes to the ceiling hear her say not vary and us dining at three and loonching off pasthry thot aggravates a mon stead of pacifying him not vary  heres a genlman for you sir said the

shook nicholas by the hand again and again slapping his palm with great violence between each shake to add warmth to the reception  ah there she be said john observing the look which nicholas directed towards his wife there she bewe shant quarrel about her nooeh ecod when i think o thotbut thou wantst soomat to eat fall to mun fall to and for waat were aboot to receive  no doubt the grace was properly finished but nothing more was heard for john had already begun to play such a knife and fork that his speech was for the time gone  i shall take the usual licence mr browdie said nicholas as he placed a chair for the bride  tak whatever thou likest said john and when as gane ca for more  without stopping to explain nicholas kissed the blushing mrs browdie and handed her to her seat  i say

into his windpipe roared again persisted in eating at the same time got red in the face and black in the forehead coughed cried got better went off again laughing inwardly got worse choked had his back thumped stamped about frightened his wife and at last recovered in a state of the last exhaustion and with the water streaming from his eyes but still faintly ejaculating a godfeythera godfeyther tilly in a tone bespeaking an exquisite relish of the sally which no suffering could diminish  you remember the night of our first teadrinking said nicholas  shall i eer forget it mun replied john browdie  he was a desperate fellow that night though was he not mrs browdie said nicholas quite a monster  if you had only heard him as we were going home mr nickleby youd have said so indeed returned the bride i never was so frightened in all my life  coom coom said john with a broad grin thou knowst betther than thot tilly  so i was replied mrs browdie i almost made up my mind never to speak to

whippersnapper as yon she says ha ha ha she said whippersnapper ecod i says efther thot neame the day and lets have it ower ha ha ha  nicholas laughed very heartily at this story both on account of its telling against himself and his being desirous to spare the blushes of mrs browdie whose protestations were drowned in peals of laughter from her husband his goodnature soon put her at her ease and although she still denied the charge she laughed so heartily at it that nicholas had the satisfaction of feeling assured that in all essential respects it was strictly true  this is the second time said nicholas that we have ever taken a meal together and only third i have ever seen you and yet it really seems to me as if i were among old friends  weel observed the yorkshireman so i say  and i am sure i do added his young wife  i have the best reason to be impressed with the feeling mind said nicholas for if it had not been for your kindness of heart my good friend when i had no right or reason to expect it i know not what might have become of me or what plight i should have been in by this time  talk aboot soomat else replied john gruffly and dinnot bother  it must be a new song to the same tune then said nicholas smiling i told you in my letter that i deeply felt and admired your sympathy with that poor lad whom you released at the risk of involving yourself in trouble and difficulty but i can never tell you how grateful he and i and others whom you dont know are to you for taking pity on him  ecod rejoined john browdie drawing up his chair and i can never tell you hoo gratful soom folks that we do know would be loikewise if they knowd i had takken pity on him  ah exclaimed mrs browdie what a state i was in that night  were they at all disposed to give you credit

eye looking sharp out for the lad and his coattails flying out behind and him spattered wi mud all ower face and all i thot i should ha dropped doon and killed myself wi laughing  john laughed so heartily at the mere recollection that he communicated the contagion to both his hearers and all three burst into peals of laughter which were renewed again and again until they could laugh no longer  hes a bad un said john wiping his eyes a very bad un is schoolmeasther  i cant bear the sight of him john said his wife  coom retorted john thots tidy in you thot is if it want along o you we shouldnt

its best to be neighbourly and keep up old acquaintance loike and what i say is deant quarrel if ee can help it dinnot think so mr nickleby  certainly returned nicholas and you acted upon that principle when i meet you on horseback on the road after our memorable evening  surely said john waat i say i stick by  and thats a fine thing to do and manly too said nicholas though its not exactly what we understand by coming yorkshire over us in london miss squeers is stopping with you you said in your note  yes replied john tillys bridesmaid and a queer bridesmaid she be too she weant be a bride in a hurry i reckon  for shame john said mrs browdie with an acute perception of the joke though being a bride herself  the groom will be a blessed mun said john his eyes twinkling at the idea hell be in luck he will  you see mr nickleby said his wife that it was in consequence of her being here that john wrote to you and fixed tonight because we thought that it wouldnt be pleasant for you to meet after what has passed  unquestionably you were quite right in that said nicholas interrupting  especially observed mrs browdie looking very sly after what we know about past and gone love matters  we know indeed said nicholas shaking his head you behaved rather wickedly there i suspect  o course she did said john browdie passing his huge forefinger through one of his wifes pretty ringlets and looking very proud of her she wur always as skittish and full o tricks as a  well as a what said his wife  as a woman returned john ding but i dinnot know ought else that cooms near it  you were speaking about miss squeers said nicholas with the view of stopping some slight connubialities which had begun to pass between mr and mrs browdie and which rendered the position of a third party in some degree embarrassing as occasioning him to feel rather in the way than otherwise  oh yes rejoined mrs browdie john ha done john fixed tonight because she had settled that she would go and drink tea with her father and to make quite sure of there being nothing amiss and of your being quite alone with us he settled to go out there and fetch her home  that was a very good arrangement said nicholas though i am sorry to be the occasion of so much trouble  not the least in the world returned mrs browdie for we have looked forward to see youjohn and i havewith the greatest possible pleasure do you know mr nickleby said mrs browdie with her archest smile that i really think fanny squeers was very fond of you  i am very much obliged to her said nicholas but upon my word i never aspired to making any impression upon her virgin heart  how you talk tittered mrs browdie no but do you know that reallyseriously now and without any jokingi was given to understand by fanny herself that you had made an offer to her and that you two were going to be engaged quite solemn and regular  was you maamwas you cried a shrill female voice was you given to understand that iiwas going to be engaged to an assassinating thief that shed the gore of my pa do youdo you think maamthat i was very fond of such dirt beneath my feet as i couldnt condescend to touch with kitchen tongs without blacking and crocking myself by the contract do you maamdo you oh base and degrading tilda  with these reproaches miss squeers flung the door wide open and disclosed to the eyes of the astonished browdies and nicholas not only her own symmetrical form arrayed in the chaste white garments before described a little dirtier but the form of her brother and father the pair of wackfords  this is the hend is it continued miss squeers who being excited aspirated her hs strongly this is the hend is it of all my forbearance and friendship for that doublefaced thingthat viper thatthatmermaid miss squeers hesitated a long time for this last epithet and brought it out triumphantly at last as if it quite clinched the business this is the hend is it of all my bearing with her deceitfulness her lowness her falseness her laying herself out to catch the admiration of vulgar minds in a way which made me blush for myfor my  gender suggested mr squeers regarding the spectators with a malevolent eyeliterally a malevolent eye  yes said miss squeers but i thank my stars that my ma is of the same  hear hear remarked mr squeers and i wish she was here to have a scratch at this company  this is the hend is it said miss squeers tossing her head and looking contemptuously at the floor of my taking notice of that rubbishing creature and demeaning myself to patronise her  oh come rejoined mrs browdie disregarding all the endeavours of her spouse to restrain her and forcing herself into a front row dont talk such nonsense as that  have i not patronised you maam demanded miss squeers  no returned mrs browdie  i will not look for blushes in such a quarter said miss squeers haughtily for that countenance is a stranger to everything but hignominiousness and redfaced boldness  i say interposed john browdie nettled by these accumulated attacks on his wife dra it mild dra it mild  you mr browdie said miss squeers taking him up very quickly i pity i have no feeling for you sir but one of unliquidated pity  oh said john  no said miss squeers looking sideways at her parent although i am a queer bridesmaid and shant be a bride in a hurry and although my husband will be in luck i entertain no sentiments towards you sir but sentiments of pity  here miss squeers looked sideways at her father again who looked sideways at her as much as to say there you had him  i know what youve got to go through said miss squeers shaking her curls violently i know what life is before you and if you was my bitterest and deadliest enemy i could wish you nothing worse  couldnt you wish to be married to him yourself if that was the case inquired mrs browdie with great suavity of manner  oh maam how witty you are retorted miss squeers with a low curtsy almost as witty maam as you are clever how very clever it was in you maam to choose a time when i had gone to tea with my pa and was sure not to come back without being fetched what a pity you never thought that other people might be as clever as yourself and spoil your plans  you wont vex me child with such airs as these said the late miss price assuming the matron  dont missis me maam if you please returned miss squeers sharply ill not bear it is this the hend  dang it a cried john browdie impatiently say thee say out fanny and mak sure its the end and dinnot ask nobody whether it is or not  thanking you for your advice which was not required mr browdie returned miss squeers with laborious politeness have the goodness not to presume to meddle with my christian name even my pity shall never make me forget whats due to myself mr browdie tilda said miss squeers with such a sudden accession of violence that john started in his boots i throw you off for ever miss i abandon you i renounce you i wouldnt cried miss squeers in a solemn voice have a child named tilda not to save it from its grave  as for the matther o that observed john itll be time eneaf to think aboot neaming of it when it cooms  john interposed his wife dont tease her  oh tease indeed cried miss squeers bridling up tease indeed he he tease too no dont tease her consider her feelings pray  if its fated that listeners are never to hear any good of themselves said mrs browdie i cant help it and i am very sorry for it but i will say fanny that times out of number i have spoken so kindly of you behind your back that even you could have found no fault with what i said  oh i dare say not maam cried miss squeers with another curtsy best thanks to you for your goodness and begging and praying you not to be hard upon me another time  i dont know resumed mrs browdie that i have said anything very bad of you even now at all events what i did say was quite true but if i have i am very sorry for it and i beg your pardon you have said much worse of me scores of times fanny but i have never borne any malice to you and i hope youll not bear any to me  miss squeers made no more direct reply than surveying her former friend from top to toe and elevating her nose in the air with ineffable disdain but some indistinct allusions to a puss and a minx and a contemptible creature escaped her and this together with a severe biting of the lips great difficulty in swallowing and very frequent comings and goings of breath seemed to imply that feelings were swelling in miss squeerss bosom too great for utterance  while the foregoing conversation was proceeding master wackford finding himself unnoticed and feeling his preponderating inclinations strong upon him had by little and little sidled up to the table and attacked the food with such slight skirmishing as drawing his fingers round and round the inside of the plates and afterwards sucking them with infinite relish picking the bread and dragging the pieces over the surface of the butter pocketing lumps of sugar pretending all the time to be absorbed in thought and so forth finding that no interference was attempted with these small liberties he gradually mounted to greater and after helping himself to a moderately good cold collation was by this time deep in the pie  nothing of this had been unobserved by mr squeers who so long as the attention of the company was fixed upon other objects hugged himself to think that his son and heir should be fattening at the enemys expense but there being now an appearance of a temporary calm in which the proceedings of little wackford could scarcely fail to be observed he feigned to be aware of the circumstance for the first time and inflicted upon the face of that young gentleman a slap that made the very teacups ring  eating cried mr squeers of what his fathers enemies has left its fit to go and poison you you unnatral boy  it weant hurt him said john apparently very much relieved by the prospect of having a man in the quarrel let un eat i wish the whole school was here id giveem soomat to stay their unfortnate stomachs wi if i spent the last penny i had  squeers scowled at him with the worst and most malicious expression of which his face was capableit was a face of remarkable capability too in that wayand shook his fist stealthily  coom coom schoolmeasther said john dinnot make a fool o thyself for if i was to sheake mineonly oncethoud fa doon wi the wind o it  it was you was it returned squeers that helped off my runaway boy it was you was it  me returned john in a loud tone yes it wa me coom waat o that it wa me noo then  you hear him say he did it my child said squeers appealing to his daughter you hear him say he did it  did it cried john ill tell ee more hear this too if thoud got another roonaway boy id do it agean if thoud got twonty roonaway boys id do it twonty times ower and twonty more to thot and i tell thee more said john noo my blood is oop that thourt an old raascal and that its weel for thou thou beest an old un or id ha poonded thee to flour when thou told an honest mun hoo thoud licked that poor chap in t coorch  an honest man cried squeers with a sneer  ah an honest man replied john honest in ought but ever putting legs under seame table wi such as thou  scandal said squeers exultingly two witnesses to it wackford knows the nature of an oath he does we shall have you there sir rascal eh mr squeers took out his pocketbook and made a note of it very good i should say that was worth full twenty pound at the next assizes without the honesty sir  soizes cried john thoud betther not talk to me o soizes yorkshire schools have been shown up at soizes afore noo mun and its a ticklish soobjact to revive i can tell ye  mr squeers shook his head in a threatening manner looking very white with passion and taking his daughters arm and dragging little wackford by the hand retreated towards the door  as for you said squeers turning round and addressing nicholas who as he had caused him to smart pretty soundly on a former occasion purposely abstained from taking any part in the discussion see if i aint down upon you before long youll go a kidnapping of boys will you take care their fathers dont turn upmark thattake care their fathers dont turn up and send em back to me to do as i like with in spite of you  i am not afraid of that replied nicholas shrugging his shoulders contemptuously and turning away  aint you retorted squeers with a diabolical look now then come along  i leave such society with my pa for hever said miss squeers looking contemptuously and loftily round i am defiled by breathing the air with such creatures poor mr browdie he he he i do pity him that i do hes so deluded he he heartful and designing tilda  with this sudden relapse into the sternest and most majestic wrath miss squeers swept from the room and having sustained her dignity until the last possible moment was heard to sob and scream and struggle in the passage  john browdie remained standing behind the table looking from his wife to nicholas and back again with his mouth wide open until his hand accidentally fell upon the tankard of ale when he took it up and having obscured his features therewith for some time drew a long breath handed it over to nicholas and rang the bell  here waither said john briskly look alive here tak these things awa and lets have soomat broiled for soopervary comfortable and plenty o itat ten oclock bring soom brandy and soom wather and a pair o slippersthe largest pair in the houseand be quick aboot it dash ma wig said john rubbing his hands theres no ganging oot to neeght noo to fetch anybody whoam and ecod well begin to spend the evening in airnest    chapter 43  officiates as a kind of gentleman usher in bringing various people together   the storm had long given place to a calm the most profound and the evening was pretty far advancedindeed supper was over and the process of digestion proceeding as favourably as under the influence of complete tranquillity cheerful conversation and a moderate allowance of brandyandwater most wise men conversant with the anatomy and functions of the human frame will consider that it ought to have proceeded when the three friends or as one might say both in a civil and religious sense and with proper deference and regard to the holy state of matrimony the two friends mr and mrs browdie counting as no more than one were startled by the noise of loud and angry threatenings below stairs which presently attained so high a pitch and were conveyed besides in language so towering sanguinary and ferocious that it could hardly have been surpassed if there had actually been a saracens head then present in the establishment supported on the shoulders and surmounting the trunk of a real live furious and most unappeasable saracen  this turmoil instead of quickly subsiding after the first outburst as turmoils not unfrequently do whether in taverns legislative assemblies or elsewhere into a mere grumbling and growling squabble increased every moment and although the whole din appeared to be raised by but one pair of lungs yet that one pair was of so powerful a quality and repeated such words as scoundrel rascal insolent puppy and a variety of expletives no less flattering to the party addressed with such great relish and strength of tone that a dozen voices raised in concert under any ordinary circumstances would have made far less uproar and created much smaller consternation  why whats the matter said nicholas moving hastily towards the door  john browdie was striding in the same direction when mrs browdie turned pale and leaning back in her chair requested him with a faint voice to take notice that if he ran into any danger it was her intention to fall into hysterics immediately and that the consequences might be more serious than he thought for john looked rather disconcerted by this intelligence though there was a lurking grin on his face at the same time but being quite unable to keep out of the fray he compromised the matter by tucking his wifes arm under his own and thus accompanied following nicholas downstairs with all speed  the passage outside the coffeeroom door was the scene of disturbance and here were congregated the coffeeroom customers and waiters together with two or three coachmen and helpers from the yard these had hastily assembled round a young man who from his appearance might have been a year or two older than nicholas and who besides having given utterance to the defiances just now described seemed to have proceeded to even greater lengths in his indignation inasmuch as his feet had no other covering than a pair of stockings while a couple of slippers lay at no great distance from the head of a prostrate figure in an opposite corner who bore the appearance of having been shot into his present retreat by means of a kick and complimented by having the slippers flung about his ears afterwards  the coffeeroom customers and the waiters and the coachmen and the helpersnot to mention a barmaid who was looking on from behind an open sash windowseemed at that moment if a spectator might judge from their winks nods and muttered exclamations strongly disposed to take part against the young gentleman in the stockings observing this and that the young gentleman was nearly of his own age and had in nothing the appearance of an habitual brawler nicholas impelled by such feelings as will influence young men sometimes felt a very strong disposition to side with the weaker party and so thrust himself at once into the centre of the group and in a more emphatic tone perhaps than circumstances might seem to warrant demanded what all that noise was about  hallo said one of the men from the yard this is somebody in disguise this is  room for the eldest son of the emperor of roosher genlmen cried another fellow  disregarding these sallies which were uncommonly well received as sallies at the expense of the bestdressed persons in a crowd usually are nicholas glanced carelessly round and addressing the young gentleman who had by this time picked up his slippers and thrust his feet into them repeated his inquiries with a courteous air  a mere nothing he replied  at this a murmur was raised by the lookerson and some of the boldest cried oh indeedwasnt it thoughnothing ehhe called that nothing did he lucky for him if he found it nothing these and many other expressions of ironical disapprobation having been exhausted two or three of the outofdoor fellows began to hustle nicholas and the young gentleman who had made the noise stumbling against them by accident and treading on their toes and so forth but this being a round game and one not necessarily limited to three or four players was open to john browdie too who bursting into the little crowdto the great terror of his wifeand falling about in all directions now to the right now to the left now forwards now backwards and accidentally driving his elbow through the hat of the tallest helper who had been particularly active speedily caused the odds to wear a very different appearance while more than one stout fellow limped away to a respectful distance anathematising with tears in his eyes the heavy tread and ponderous feet of the burly yorkshireman  let me see him do it again said he who had been kicked into the corner rising as he spoke apparently more from the fear of john browdies inadvertently treading upon him than from any desire to place himself on equal terms with his late adversary let me see him do it again thats all  let me hear you make those remarks again said the young man and ill knock that head of yours in among the wineglasses behind you there  here a waiter who had been rubbing his hands in excessive enjoyment of the scene so long as only the breaking of heads was in question adjured the spectators with great earnestness to fetch the police declaring that otherwise murder would be surely done and that he was responsible for all the glass and china on the premises  no one need trouble himself to stir said the young gentleman i am going to remain in the house all night and shall be found here in the morning if there is any assault to answer for  what did you strike him for asked one of the bystanders  ah what did you strike him for demanded the others  the unpopular gentleman looked coolly round and addressing himself to nicholas said  you inquired just now what was the matter here the matter is simply this yonder person who was drinking with a friend in the coffeeroom when i took my seat there for half an hour before going to bed for i have just come off a journey and preferred stopping here tonight to going home at this hour where i was not expected until tomorrow chose to express himself in very disrespectful and insolently familiar terms of a young lady whom i recognised from his description and other circumstances and whom i have the honour to know as he spoke loud enough to be overheard by the other guests who were present i informed him most civilly that he was mistaken in his conjectures which were of an offensive nature and requested him to forbear he did so for a little time but as he chose to renew his conversation when leaving the room in a more offensive strain than before i could not refrain from making after him and facilitating his departure by a kick which reduced him to the posture in which you saw him just now i am the best judge of my own affairs i take it said the young man who had certainly not quite recovered from his recent heat if anybody here thinks proper to make this quarrel his own i have not the smallest earthly objection i do assure him  of all possible courses of proceeding under the circumstances detailed there was certainly not one which in his then state of mind could have appeared more laudable to nicholas than this there were not many subjects of dispute which at that moment could have come home to his own breast more powerfully for having the unknown uppermost in his thoughts it naturally occurred to him that he would have done just the same if any audacious gossiper durst have presumed in his hearing to speak lightly of her influenced by these considerations he espoused the young gentlemans quarrel with great warmth protesting that he had done quite right and that he respected him for it which john browdie albeit not quite clear as to the merits immediately protested too with not inferior vehemence  let him take care thats all said the defeated party who was being rubbed down by a waiter after his recent fall on the dusty boards he dont knock me about for nothing i can tell him that a pretty state of things if a man isnt to admire a handsome girl without being beat to pieces for it  this reflection appeared to have great weight with the young lady in the bar who adjusting her cap as she spoke and glancing at a mirror declared that it would be a very pretty state of things indeed and that if people were to be punished for actions so innocent and natural as that there would be more people to be knocked down than there would be people to knock them down and that she wondered what the gentleman meant by it that she did  my dear girl said the young gentleman in a low voice advancing towards the sash window  nonsense sir replied the young lady sharply smiling though as she turned aside and biting her lip whereat mrs browdie who was still standing on the stairs glanced at her with disdain and called to her husband to come away  no but listen to me said the young man if admiration of a pretty face were criminal i should be the most hopeless person alive for i cannot resist one it has the most extraordinary effect upon me checks and controls me in the most furious and obstinate mood you see what an effect yours has had upon me already  oh thats very pretty replied the young lady tossing her head but  yes i know its very pretty said the young man looking with an air of admiration in the barmaids face i said so you know just this moment but beauty should be spoken of respectfullyrespectfully and in proper terms and with a becoming sense of its worth and excellence whereas this fellow has no more notion  the young lady interrupted the conversation at this point by thrusting her head out of the barwindow and inquiring of the waiter in a shrill voice whether that young man who had been knocked down was going to stand in the passage all night or whether the entrance was to be left clear for other people the waiters taking the hint and communicating it to the hostlers were not slow to change their tone too and the result was that the unfortunate victim was bundled out in a twinkling  i am sure i have seen that fellow before said nicholas  indeed replied his new acquaintance  i am certain of it said nicholas pausing to reflect where can i havestopyes to be surehe belongs to a registeroffice up at the west end of the town i knew i recollected the face  it was indeed tom the ugly clerk  thats odd enough said nicholas ruminating upon the strange manner in which the registeroffice seemed to start up and stare him in the face every now and then and when he least expected it  i am much obliged to you for your kind advocacy of my cause when it most needed an advocate said the young man laughing and drawing a card from his pocket perhaps youll do me the favour to let me know where i can thank you  nicholas took the card and glancing at it involuntarily as he returned the compliment evinced very great surprise  mr frank cheeryble said nicholas surely not the nephew of cheeryble brothers who is expected tomorrow  i dont usually call myself the nephew of the firm returned mr frank goodhumouredly but of the two excellent individuals who compose it i am proud to say i am the nephew and you i see are mr nickleby of whom i have heard so much this is a most unexpected meeting but not the less welcome i assure you  nicholas responded to these compliments with others of the same kind and they shook hands warmly then he introduced john browdie who had remained in a state of great admiration ever since the young lady in the bar had been so skilfully won over to the right side then mrs john browdie was introduced and finally they all went upstairs together and spent the next halfhour with great satisfaction and mutual entertainment mrs john browdie beginning the conversation by declaring that of all the madeup things she ever saw that young woman belowstairs was the vainest and the plainest  this mr frank cheeryble although to judge from what had recently taken place a hotheaded young man which is not an absolute miracle and phenomenon in nature was a sprightly goodhumoured pleasant fellow with much both in his countenance and disposition that reminded nicholas very strongly of the kindhearted brothers his manner was as unaffected as theirs and his demeanour full of that heartiness which to most people who have anything generous in their composition is peculiarly prepossessing add to this that he was goodlooking and intelligent had a plentiful share of vivacity was extremely cheerful and accommodated himself in five minutes time to all john browdies oddities with as much ease as if he had known him from a boy and it will be a source of no great wonder that when they parted for the night he had produced a most favourable impression not only upon the worthy yorkshireman and his wife but upon nicholas also who revolving all these things in his mind as he made the best of his way home arrived at the conclusion that he had laid the foundation of a most agreeable and desirable acquaintance  but its a most extraordinary thing about that registeroffice fellow thought nicholas is it likely that this nephew can know anything about that beautiful girl when tim linkinwater gave me to understand the other day that he was coming to take a share in the business here he said he had been superintending it in germany for four years and that during the last six months he had been engaged in establishing an agency in the north of england thats four years and a halffour years and a half she cant be more than seventeensay eighteen at the outside she was quite a child when he went away then i should say he knew nothing about her and had never seen her so he can give me no information at all events thought nicholas coming to the real point in his mind there can be no danger of any prior occupation of her affections in that quarter thats quite clear  is selfishness a necessary ingredient in the composition of that passion called love or does it deserve all the fine things which poets in the exercise of their undoubted vocation have said of it there are no doubt authenticated instances of gentlemen having given up ladies and ladies having given up gentlemen to meritorious rivals under circumstances of great highmindedness but is it quite established that the majority of such ladies and gentlemen have not made a virtue of necessity and nobly resigned what was beyond their reach as a private soldier might register a vow never to accept the order of the garter or a poor curate of great piety and learning but of no familysave a very large family of childrenmight renounce a bishopric  here was nicholas nickleby who would have scorned the thought of counting how the chances stood of his rising in favour or fortune with the brothers cheeryble now that their nephew had returned already deep in calculations whether that same nephew was likely to rival him in the affections of the fair unknowndiscussing the matter with himself too as gravely as if with that one exception it were all settled and recurring to the subject again and again and feeling quite indignant and illused at the notion of anybody else making love to one with whom he had never exchanged a word in all his life to be sure he exaggerated rather than depreciated the merits of his new acquaintance but still he took it as a kind of personal offence that he should have any merits at allin the eyes of this particular young lady that is for elsewhere he was quite welcome to have as many as he pleased there was undoubted selfishness in all this and yet nicholas was of a most free and generous nature with as few mean or sordid thoughts perhaps as ever fell to the lot of any man and there is no reason to suppose that being in love he felt and thought differently from other people in the like sublime condition  he did not stop to set on foot an inquiry into his train of thought or state of feeling however but went thinking on all the way home and continued to dream on in the same strain all night for having satisfied himself that frank cheeryble could have no knowledge of or acquaintance with the mysterious young lady it began to occur to him that even he himself might never see her again upon which hypothesis he built up a very ingenious succession of tormenting ideas which answered his purpose even better than the vision of mr frank cheeryble and tantalised and worried him waking and sleeping  notwithstanding all that has been said and sung to the contrary there is no wellestablished case of morning having either deferred or hastened its approach by the term of an hour or so for the mere gratification of a splenetic feeling against some unoffending lover the sun having in the discharge of his public duty as the books of precedent report invariably risen according to the almanacs and without suffering himself to be swayed by any private considerations so morning came as usual and with it businesshours and with them mr frank cheeryble and with him a long train of smiles and welcomes from the worthy brothers and a more grave and clerklike but scarcely less hearty reception from mr timothy linkinwater  that mr frank and mr nickleby should have met last night said tim linkinwater getting slowly off his stool and looking round the countinghouse with his back planted against the desk as was his custom when he had anything very particular to say that those two young men should have met last night in that manner is i say a coincidence a remarkable coincidence why i dont believe now added tim taking off his spectacles and smiling as with gentle pride that theres such a place in all the world for coincidences as london is  i dont know about that said mr frank but  dont know about it mr francis interrupted tim with an obstinate air well but let us know if there is any better place for such things where is it is it in europe no that it isnt is it in asia why of course its not is it in africa not a bit of it is it in america you know better than that at all events well then said tim folding his arms resolutely where is it  i was not about to dispute the point tim said young cheeryble laughing i am not such a heretic as that all i was going to say was that i hold myself under an obligation to the coincidence thats all  oh if you dont dispute it said tim quite satisfied thats another thing ill tell you what though i wish you had i wish you or anybody would i would so put that man down said tim tapping the forefinger of his left hand emphatically with his spectacles so put that man down by argument  it was quite impossible to find language to express the degree of mental prostration to which such an adventurous wight would be reduced in the keen encounter with tim linkinwater so tim gave up the rest of his declaration in pure lack of words and mounted his stool again  we may consider ourselves brother ned said charles after he had patted tim linkinwater approvingly on the back very fortunate in having two such young men about us as our nephew frank and mr nickleby it should be a source of great satisfaction and pleasure to us  certainly charles certainly returned the other  of tim added brother ned i say nothing whatever because tim is a mere childan infanta nobody that we never think of or take into account at all tim you villain what do you say to that sir  i am jealous of both of em said tim and mean to look out for another situation so provide yourselves gentlemen if you please  tim thought this such an exquisite unparalleled and most extraordinary joke that he laid his pen upon the inkstand and rather tumbling off his stool than getting down with his usual deliberation laughed till he was quite faint shaking his head all the time so that little particles of powder flew palpably about the office nor were the brothers at all behindhand for they laughed almost as heartily at the ludicrous idea of any voluntary separation between themselves and old tim nicholas and mr frank laughed quite boisterously perhaps to conceal some other emotion awakened by this little incident and so indeed did the three old fellows after the first burst so perhaps there was as much keen enjoyment and relish in that laugh altogether as the politest assembly ever derived from the most poignant witticism uttered at any one persons expense  mr nickleby said brother charles calling him aside and taking him kindly by the hand iiam anxious my dear sir to see that you are properly and comfortably settled in the cottage we cannot allow those who serve us well to labour under any privation or discomfort that it is in our power to remove i wish too to see your mother and sister to know them mr nickleby and have an opportunity of relieving their minds by assuring them that any trifling service we have been able to do them is a great deal more than repaid by the zeal and ardour you displaynot a word my dear sir i beg tomorrow is sunday i shall make bold to come out at teatime and take the chance of finding you at home if you are not you know or the ladies should feel a delicacy in being intruded on and would rather not be known to me just now why i can come again another time any other time would do for me let it remain upon that understanding brother ned my dear fellow let me have a word with you this way  the twins went out of the office arminarm and nicholas who saw in this act of kindness and many others of which he had been the subject that morning only so many delicate renewals on the arrival of their nephew of the kind assurance which the brothers had given him in his absence could scarcely feel sufficient admiration and gratitude for such extraordinary consideration  the intelligence that they were to have visitorand such a visitornext day awakened in the breast of mrs nickleby mingled feelings of exultation and regret for whereas on the one hand she hailed it as an omen of her speedy restoration to good society and the almostforgotten pleasures of morning calls and evening teadrinkings she could not on the other but reflect with bitterness of spirit on the absence of a silver teapot with an ivory knob on the lid and a milkjug to match which had been the pride of her heart in days of yore and had been kept from years end to years end wrapped up in washleather on a certain top shelf which now presented itself in lively colours to her sorrowing imagination  i wonder whos got that spicebox said mrs nickleby shaking her head it used to stand in the lefthand corner next but two to the pickled onions you remember that spicebox kate  perfectly well mama  i shouldnt think you did kate returned mrs nickleby in a severe manner talking about it in that cold and unfeeling way if there is any one thing that vexes me in these losses more than the losses themselves i do protest and declare said mrs nickleby rubbing her nose with an impassioned air that it is to have people about me who take things with such provoking calmness  my dear mama said kate stealing her arm round her mothers neck why do you say what i know you cannot seriously mean or think or why be angry with me for being happy and content you and nicholas are left to me we are together once again and what regard can i have for a few trifling things of which we never feel the want when i have seen all the misery and desolation that death can bring and known the lonesome feeling of being solitary and alone in crowds and all the agony of separation in grief and poverty when we most needed comfort and support from each other can you wonder that i look upon this as a place of such delicious quiet and rest that with you beside me i have nothing to wish for or regret there was a time and not long since when all the comforts of our old home did come back upon me i own very oftenoftener than you would think perhapsbut i affected to care nothing for them in the hope that you would so be brought to regret them the less i was not insensible indeed i might have felt happier if i had been dear mama said kate in great agitation i know no difference between this home and that in which we were all so happy for so many years except that the kindest and gentlest heart that ever ached on earth has passed in peace to heaven  kate my dear kate cried mrs nickleby folding her in her arms  i have so often thought sobbed kate of all his kind wordsof the last time he looked into my little room as he passed upstairs to bed and said god bless you darling there was a paleness in his face mamathe broken hearti know it wasi little thought sothen  a gush of tears came to her relief and kate laid her head upon her mothers breast and wept like a little child  it is an exquisite and beautiful thing in our nature that when the heart is touched and softened by some tranquil happiness or affectionate feeling the memory of the dead comes over it most powerfully and irresistibly it would almost seem as though our better thoughts and sympathies were charms in virtue of which the soul is enabled to hold some vague and mysterious intercourse with the spirits of those whom we dearly loved in life alas how often and how long may those patient angels hover above us watching for the spell which is so seldom uttered and so soon forgotten  poor mrs nickleby accustomed to give ready utterance to whatever came uppermost in her mind had never conceived the possibility of her daughters dwelling upon these thoughts in secret the more especially as no hard trial or querulous reproach had ever drawn them from her but now when the happiness of all that nicholas had just told them and of their new and peaceful life brought these recollections so strongly upon kate that she could not suppress them mrs nickleby began to have a glimmering that she had been rather thoughtless now and then and was conscious of something like selfreproach as she embraced her daughter and yielded to the emotions which such a conversation naturally awakened  there was a mighty bustle that night and a vast quantity of preparation for the expected visitor and a very large nosegay was brought from a gardeners hard by and cut up into a number of very small ones with which mrs nickleby would have garnished the little sittingroom in a style that certainly could not have failed to attract anybodys attention if kate had not offered to spare her the trouble and arranged them in the prettiest and neatest manner possible if the cottage ever looked pretty it must have been on such a bright and sunshiny day as the next day was but smikes pride in the garden or mrs nicklebys in the condition of the furniture or kates in everything was nothing to the pride with which nicholas looked at kate herself and surely the costliest mansion in all england might have found in her beautiful face and graceful form its most exquisite and peerless ornament  about six oclock in the afternoon mrs nickleby was thrown into a great flutter of spirits by the longexpected knock at the door nor was this flutter at all composed by the audible tread of two pair of boots in the passage which mrs nickleby augured in a breathless state must be the two mr cheerybles as it certainly was though not the two mrs nickleby expected because it was mr charles cheeryble and his nephew mr frank who made a thousand apologies for his intrusion which mrs nickleby having teaspoons enough and to spare for all most graciously received nor did the appearance of this unexpected visitor occasion the least embarrassment save in kate and that only to the extent of a blush or two at first for the old gentleman was so kind and cordial and the young gentleman imitated him in this respect so well that the usual stiffness and formality of a first meeting showed no signs of appearing and kate really more than once detected herself in the very act of wondering when it was going to begin  at the teatable there was plenty of conversation on a great variety of subjects nor were there wanting jocose matters of discussion such as they were for young mr cheerybles recent stay in germany happening to be alluded to old mr cheeryble informed the company that the aforesaid young mr cheeryble was suspected to have fallen deeply in love with the daughter of a certain german burgomaster this accusation young mr cheeryble most indignantly repelled upon which mrs nickleby slyly remarked that she suspected from the very warmth of the denial there must be something in it young mr cheeryble then earnestly entreated old mr cheeryble to confess that it was all a jest which old mr cheeryble at last did young mr cheeryble being so much in earnest about it thatas mrs nickleby said many thousand times afterwards in recalling the scenehe quite coloured which she rightly considered a memorable circumstance and one worthy of remark young men not being as a class remarkable for modesty or selfdenial especially when there is a lady in the case when if they colour at all it is rather their practice to colour the story and not themselves  after tea there was a walk in the garden and the evening being very fine they strolled out at the gardengate into some lanes and byeroads and sauntered up and down until it grew quite dark the time seemed to pass very quickly with all the party kate went first leaning upon her brothers arm and talking with him and mr frank cheeryble and mrs nickleby and the elder gentleman followed at a short distance the kindness of the good merchant his interest in the welfare of nicholas and his admiration of kate so operating upon the good ladys feelings that the usual current of her speech was confined within very narrow and circumscribed limits smike who if he had ever been an object of interest in his life had been one that day accompanied them joining sometimes one group and sometimes the other as brother charles laying his hand upon his shoulder bade him walk with him or nicholas looking smilingly round beckoned him to come and talk with the old friend who understood him best and who could win a smile into his careworn face when none else could  pride is one of the seven deadly sins but it cannot be the pride of a mother in her children for that is a compound of two cardinal virtuesfaith and hope this was the pride which swelled mrs nicklebys heart that night and this it was which left upon her face glistening in the light when they returned home traces of the most grateful tears she had ever shed  there was a quiet mirth about the little supper which harmonised exactly with this tone of feeling and at length the two gentlemen took their leave there was one circumstance in the leavetaking which occasioned a vast deal of smiling and pleasantry and that was that mr frank cheeryble offered his hand to kate twice over quite forgetting that he had bade her adieu already this was held by the elder mr cheeryble to be a convincing proof that he was thinking of his german flame and the jest occasioned immense laughter so easy is it to move light hearts  in short it was a day of serene and tranquil happiness and as we all have some bright daymany of us let us hope among a crowd of othersto which we revert with particular delight so this one was often looked back to afterwards as holding a conspicuous place in the calendar of those who shared it  was there one exception and that one he who needed to have been most happy  who was that who in the silence of his own chamber sunk upon his knees to pray as his first friend had taught him and folding his hands and stretching them wildly in the air fell upon his face in a passion of bitter grief    chapter 44  mr ralph nickleby cuts an old acquaintance it would also appear from the contents hereof that a joke even between husband and wife may be sometimes carried too far   there are some men who living with the one object of enriching themselves no matter by what means and being perfectly conscious of the baseness and rascality of the means which they will use every day towards this end affect neverthelesseven to themselvesa high tone of moral rectitude and shake their heads and sigh over the depravity of the world some of the craftiest scoundrels that ever walked this earth or ratherfor walking implies at least an erect position and the bearing of a manthat ever crawled and crept through life by its dirtiest and narrowest ways will gravely jot down in diaries the events of every day and keep a regular debtor and creditor account with heaven which shall always show a floating balance in their own favour whether this is a gratuitous the only gratuitous part of the falsehood and trickery of such mens lives or whether they really hope to cheat heaven itself and lay up treasure in the next world by the same process which has enabled them to lay up treasure in thisnot to question how it is so it is and doubtless such bookkeeping like certain autobiographies which have enlightened the world cannot fail to prove serviceable in the one respect of sparing the recording angel some time and labour  ralph nickleby was not a man of this stamp stern unyielding dogged and impenetrable ralph cared for nothing in life or beyond it save the gratification of two passions avarice the first and predominant appetite of his nature and hatred the second affecting to consider himself but a type of all humanity he was at little pains to conceal his true character from the world in general and in his own heart he exulted over and cherished every bad design as it had birth the only scriptural admonition that ralph nickleby heeded in the letter was know thyself he knew himself well and choosing to imagine that all mankind were cast in the same mould hated them for though no man hates himself the coldest among us having too much selflove for that yet most men unconsciously judge the world from themselves and it will be very generally found that those who sneer habitually at human nature and affect to despise it are among its worst and least pleasant samples  but the present business of these adventures is with ralph himself who stood regarding newman noggs with a heavy frown while that worthy took off his fingerless gloves and spreading them carefully on the palm of his left hand and flattening them with his right to take the creases out proceeded to roll them up with an absent air as if he were utterly regardless of all things else in the deep interest of the ceremonial  gone out of town said ralph slowly a mistake of yours go back again  no mistake returned newman not even going gone  has he turned girl or baby muttered ralph with a fretful gesture  i dont know said newman but hes gone  the repetition of the word gone seemed to afford newman noggs inexpressible delight in proportion as it annoyed ralph nickleby he uttered the word with a full round emphasis dwelling upon it as long as he decently could and when he could hold out no longer without attracting observation stood gasping it to himself as if even that were a satisfaction  and where has he gone said ralph  france replied newman danger of another attack of erysipelasa worse attackin the head so the doctors ordered him off and hes gone  and lord frederick began ralph  hes gone too replied newman  and he carries his drubbing with him does he said ralph turning away pockets his bruises and sneaks off without the retaliation of a word or seeking the smallest reparation  hes too ill said newman  too ill repeated ralph why i would have it if i were dying in that case i should only be the more determined to have it and that without delayi mean if i were he but hes too ill poor sir mulberry too ill  uttering these words with supreme contempt and great irritation of manner ralph signed hastily to newman to leave the room and throwing himself into his chair beat his foot impatiently upon the ground  there is some spell about that boy said ralph grinding his teeth circumstances conspire to help him talk of fortunes favours what is even money to such devils luck as this  he thrust his hands impatiently into his pockets but notwithstanding his previous reflection there was some consolation there for his face relaxed a little and although there was still a deep frown upon the contracted brow it was one of calculation and not of disappointment  this hawk will come back however muttered ralph and if i know the man and i should by this time his wrath will have lost nothing of its violence in the meanwhile obliged to live in retirementthe monotony of a sickroom to a man of his habitsno lifeno drinkno playnothing that he likes and lives by he is not likely to forget his obligations to the cause of all this few men would but he of all others no no  he smiled and shook his head and resting his chin upon his hand fell a musing and smiled again after a time he rose and rang the bell  that mr squeers has he been here said ralph  he was here last night i left him here when i went home returned newman  i know that fool do i not said ralph irascibly has he been here since was he here this morning  no bawled newman in a very loud key  if he comes while i am outhe is pretty sure to be here by nine tonightlet him wait and if theres another man with him as there will beperhaps said ralph checking himself let him wait too  let em both wait said newman  ay replied ralph turning upon him with an angry look help me on with this spencer and dont repeat after me like a croaking parrot  i wish i was a parrot newman sulkily  i wish you were rejoined ralph drawing his spencer on id have wrung your neck long ago  newman returned no answer to this compliment but looked over ralphs shoulder for an instant he was adjusting the collar of the spencer behind just then as if he were strongly disposed to tweak him by the nose meeting ralphs eye however he suddenly recalled his wandering fingers and rubbed his own red nose with a vehemence quite astonishing  bestowing no further notice upon his eccentric follower than a threatening look and an admonition to be careful and make no mistake ralph took his hat and gloves and walked out  he appeared to have a very extraordinary and miscellaneous connection and very odd calls he made some at great rich houses and some at small poor ones but all upon one subject money his face was a talisman to the porters and servants of his more dashing clients and procured him ready admission though he trudged on foot and others who were denied rattled to the door in carriages here he was all softness and cringing civility his step so light that it scarcely produced a sound upon the thick carpets his voice so soft that it was not audible beyond the person to whom it was addressed but in the poorer habitations ralph was another man his boots creaked upon the passage floor as he walked boldly in his voice was harsh and loud as he demanded the money that was overdue his threats were coarse and angry with another class of customers ralph was again another man these were attorneys of more than doubtful reputation who helped him to new business or raised fresh profits upon old with them ralph was familiar and jocose humorous upon the topics of the day and especially pleasant upon bankruptcies and pecuniary difficulties that made good for trade in short it would have been difficult to have recognised the same man under these various aspects but for the bulky leather case full of bills and notes which he drew from his pocket at every house and the constant repetition of the same complaint varied only in tone and style of delivery that the world thought him rich and that perhaps he might be if he had his own but there was no getting money in when it was once out either principal or interest and it was a hard matter to live even to live from day to day  it was evening before a long round of such visits interrupted only by a scanty dinner at an eatinghouse terminated at pimlico and ralph walked along st jamess park on his way home  there were some deep schemes in his head as the puckered brow and firmlyset mouth would have abundantly testified even if they had been unaccompanied by a complete indifference to or unconsciousness of the objects about him so complete was his abstraction however that ralph usually as quicksighted as any man did not observe that he was followed by a shambling figure which at one time stole behind him with noiseless footsteps at another crept a few paces before him and at another glided along by his side at all times regarding him with an eye so keen and a look so eager and attentive that it was more like the expression of an intrusive face in some powerful picture or strongly marked dream than the scrutiny even of a most interested and anxious observer  the sky had been lowering and dark for some time and the commencement of a violent storm of rain drove ralph for shelter to a tree he was leaning against it with folded arms still buried in thought when happening to raise his eyes he suddenly met those of a man who creeping round the trunk peered into his face with a searching look there was something in the usurers expression at the moment which the man appeared to remember well for it decided him and stepping close up to ralph he pronounced his name  astonished for the moment ralph fell back a couple of paces and surveyed him from head to foot a spare dark withered man of about his own age with a stooping body and a very sinister face rendered more illfavoured by hollow and hungry cheeks deeply sunburnt and thick black eyebrows blacker in contrast with the perfect whiteness of his hair roughly clothed in shabby garments of a strange and uncouth make and having about him an indefinable manner of depression and degradationthis for a moment was all he saw but he looked again and the face and person seemed gradually to grow less strange to change as he looked to subside and soften into lineaments that were familiar until at last they resolved themselves as if by some strange optical illusion into those of one whom he had known for many years and forgotten and lost sight of for nearly as many more  the man saw that the recognition was mutual and beckoning to ralph to take his former place under the tree and not to stand in the falling rain of which in his first surprise he had been quite regardless addressed him in a hoarse faint tone  you would hardly have known me from my voice i suppose mr nickleby he said  no returned ralph bending a severe look upon him though there is something in that that i remember now  there is little in me that you can call to mind as having been there eight years ago i dare say observed the other  quite enough said ralph carelessly and averting his face more than enough  if i had remained in doubt about you mr nickleby said the other this reception and your manner would have decided me very soon  did you expect any other asked ralph sharply  no said the man  you were right retorted ralph and as you feel no surprise need express none  mr nickleby said the man bluntly after a brief pause during which he had seemed to struggle with an inclination to answer him by some reproach will you hear a few words that i have to say  i am obliged to wait here till the rain holds a little said ralph looking abroad if you talk sir i shall not put my fingers in my ears though your talking may have as much effect as if i did  i was once in your confidence thus his companion began ralph looked round and smiled involuntarily  well said the other as much in your confidence as you ever chose to let anybody be  ah rejoined ralph folding his arms thats another thing quite another thing  dont let us play upon words mr nickleby in the name of humanity  of what said ralph  of humanity replied the other sternly i am hungry and in want if the change that you must see in me after so long an absencemust see for i upon whom it has come by slow and hard degrees see it and know it wellwill not move you to pity let the knowledge that bread not the daily bread of the lords prayer which as it is offered up in cities like this is understood to include half the luxuries of the world for the rich and just as much coarse food as will support life for the poornot that but bread a crust of dry hard bread is beyond my reach todaylet that have some weight with you if nothing else has  if this is the usual form in which you beg sir said ralph you have studied your part well but if you will take advice from one who knows something of the world and its ways i should recommend a lower tone a little lower tone or you stand a fair chance of being starved in good earnest  as he said this ralph clenched his left wrist tightly with his right hand and inclining his head a little on one side and dropping his chin upon his breast looked at him whom he addressed with a frowning sullen face the very picture of a man whom nothing could move or soften  yesterday was my first day in london said the old man glancing at his travelstained dress and worn shoes  it would have been better for you i think if it had been your last also replied ralph  i have been seeking you these two days where i thought you were most likely to be found resumed the other more humbly and i met you here at last when i had almost given up the hope of encountering you mr nickleby  he seemed to wait for some reply but ralph giving him none he continued  i am a most miserable and wretched outcast nearly sixty years old and as destitute and helpless as a child of six  i am sixty years old too replied ralph and am neither destitute nor helpless work dont make fine playacting speeches about bread but earn it  how cried the other where show me the means will you give them to mewill you  i did once replied ralph composedly you scarcely need ask me whether i will again  its twenty years ago or more said the man in a suppressed voice since you and i fell out you remember that i claimed a share in the profits of some business i brought to you and as i persisted you arrested me for an old advance of ten pounds odd shillings including interest at fifty per cent or so  i remember something of it replied ralph carelessly what then  that didnt part us said the man i made submission being on the wrong side of the bolts and bars and as you were not the made man then that you are now you were glad enough to take back a clerk who wasnt over nice and who knew something of the trade you drove  you begged and prayed and i consented returned ralph that was kind of me perhaps i did want you i forget i should think i did or you would have begged in vain you were useful not too honest not too delicate not too nice of hand or heart but useful  useful indeed said the man come you had pinched and ground me down for some years before that but i had served you faithfully up to that time in spite of all your dogs usage had i  ralph made no reply  had i said the man again  you had had your wages rejoined ralph and had done your work we stood on equal ground so far and could both cry quits  then but not afterwards said the other  not afterwards certainly nor even then for as you have just said you owed me money and do still replied ralph  thats not all said the man eagerly thats not all mark that i didnt forget that old sore trust me partly in remembrance of that and partly in the hope of making money someday by the scheme i took advantage of my position about you and possessed myself of a hold upon you which you would give half of all you have to know and never can know but through me i left youlong after that time rememberand for some poor trickery that came within the law but was nothing to what you moneymakers daily practise just outside its bounds was sent away a convict for seven years i have returned what you see me now mr nickleby said the man with a strange mixture of humility and sense of power what help and assistance will you give me what bribe to speak out plainly my expectations are not monstrous but i must live and to live i must eat and drink money is on your side and hunger and thirst on mine you may drive an easy bargain  is that all said ralph still eyeing his companion with the same steady look and moving nothing but his lips  it depends on you mr nickleby whether thats all or not was the rejoinder  why then harkye mr i dont know by what name i am to call you said ralph  by my old one if you like  why then harkye mr brooker said ralph in his harshest accents and dont expect to draw another speech from me harkye sir i know you of old for a ready scoundrel but you never had a stout heart and hard work with maybe chains upon those legs of yours and shorter food than when i pinched and ground you has blunted your wits or you would not come with such a tale as this to me you a hold upon me keep it or publish it to the world if you like  i cant do that interposed brooker that wouldnt serve me  wouldnt it said ralph it will serve you as much as bringing it to me i promise you to be plain with you i am a careful man and know my affairs thoroughly i know the world and the world knows me whatever you gleaned or heard or saw when you served me the world knows and magnifies already you could tell it nothing that would surprise it unless indeed it redounded to my credit or honour and then it would scout you for a liar and yet i dont find business slack or clients scrupulous quite the contrary i am reviled or threatened every day by one man or another said ralph but things roll on just the same and i dont grow poorer either  i neither revile nor threaten rejoined the man i can tell you of what you have lost by my act what i only can restore and what if i die without restoring dies with me and never can be regained  i tell my money pretty accurately and generally keep it in my own custody said ralph i look sharply after most men that i deal with and most of all i looked sharply after you you are welcome to all you have kept from me  are those of your own name dear to you said the man emphatically if they are  they are not returned ralph exasperated at this perseverance and the thought of nicholas which the last question awakened they are not if you had come as a common beggar i might have thrown a sixpence to you in remembrance of the clever knave you used to be but since you try to palm these stale tricks upon one you might have known better ill not part with a halfpennynor would i to save you from rotting and remember this scapegallows said ralph menacing him with his hand that if we meet again and you so much as notice me by one begging gesture you shall see the inside of a jail once more and tighten this hold upon me in intervals of the hard labour that vagabonds are put to theres my answer to your trash take it  with a disdainful scowl at the object of his anger who met his eye but uttered not a word ralph walked away at his usual pace without manifesting the slightest curiosity to see what became of his late companion or indeed once looking behind him the man remained on the same spot with his eyes fixed upon his retreating figure until it was lost to view and then drawing his arm about his chest as if the damp and lack of food struck coldly to him lingered with slouching steps by the wayside and begged of those who passed along  ralph in nowise moved by what had lately passed further than as he had already expressed himself walked deliberately on and turning out of the park and leaving golden square on his right took his way through some streets at the west end of the town until he arrived in that particular one in which stood the residence of madame mantalini the name of that lady no longer appeared on the flaming doorplate that of miss knag being substituted in its stead but the bonnets and dresses were still dimly visible in the firstfloor windows by the decaying light of a summers evening and excepting this ostensible alteration in the proprietorship the establishment wore its old appearance  humph muttered ralph drawing his hand across his mouth with a connoisseurlike air and surveying the house from top to bottom these people look pretty well they cant last long but if i know of their going in good time i am safe and a fair profit too i must keep them closely in view thats all  so nodding his head very complacently ralph was leaving the spot when his quick ear caught the sound of a confused noise and hubbub of voices mingled with a great running up and down stairs in the very house which had been the subject of his scrutiny and while he was hesitating whether to knock at the door or listen at the keyhole a little longer a female servant of madame mantalinis whom he had often seen opened it abruptly and bounced out with her blue capribbons streaming in the air  hallo here stop cried ralph whats the matter here am i didnt you hear me knock  oh mr nickleby sir said the girl go up for the love of gracious masters been and done it again  done what said ralph tartly what dye mean  i knew he would if he was drove to it cried the girl i said so all along  come here you silly wench said ralph catching her by the wrist and dont carry family matters to the neighbours destroying the credit of the establishment come here do you hear me girl  without any further expostulation he led or rather pulled the frightened handmaid into the house and shut the door then bidding her walk upstairs before him followed without more ceremony  guided by the noise of a great many voices all talking together and passing the girl in his impatience before they had ascended many steps ralph quickly reached the private sittingroom when he was rather amazed by the confused and inexplicable scene in which he suddenly found himself  there were all the younglady workers some with bonnets and some without in various attitudes expressive of alarm and consternation some gathered round madame mantalini who was in tears upon one chair and others round miss knag who was in opposition tears upon another and others round mr mantalini who was perhaps the most striking figure in the whole group for mr mantalinis legs were extended at full length upon the floor and his head and shoulders were supported by a very tall footman who didnt seem to know what to do with them and mr mantalinis eyes were closed and his face was pale and his hair was comparatively straight and his whiskers and moustache were limp and his teeth were clenched and he had a little bottle in his right hand and a little teaspoon in his left and his hands arms legs and shoulders were all stiff and powerless and yet madame mantalini was not weeping upon the body but was scolding violently upon her chair and all this amidst a clamour of tongues perfectly deafening and which really appeared to have driven the unfortunate footman to the utmost verge of distraction  what is the matter here said ralph pressing forward  at this inquiry the clamour was increased twentyfold and an astounding string of such shrill contradictions as hes poisoned himselfhe hasntsend for a doctordonthes dyinghe isnt hes only pretendingwith various other cries poured forth with bewildering volubility until madame mantalini was seen to address herself to ralph when female curiosity to know what she would say prevailed and as if by general consent a dead silence unbroken by a single whisper instantaneously succeeded  mr nickleby said madame mantalini by what chance you came here i dont know  here a gurgling voice was heard to ejaculate as part of the wanderings of a sick man the words demnition sweetness but nobody heeded them except the footman who being startled to hear such awful tones proceeding as it were from between his very fingers dropped his masters head upon the floor with a pretty loud crash and then without an effort to lift it up gazed upon the bystanders as if he had done something rather clever than otherwise  i will however continued madame mantalini drying her eyes and speaking with great indignation say before you and before everybody here for the first time and once for all that i never will supply that mans extravagances and viciousness again i have been a dupe and a fool to him long enough in future he shall support himself if he can and then he may spend what money he pleases upon whom and how he pleases but it shall not be mine and therefore you had better pause before you trust him further  thereupon madame mantalini quite unmoved by some most pathetic lamentations on the part of her husband that the apothecary had not mixed the prussic acid strong enough and that he must take another bottle or two to finish the work he had in hand entered into a catalogue of that amiable gentlemans gallantries deceptions extravagances and infidelities especially the last winding up with a protest against being supposed to entertain the smallest remnant of regard for him and adducing in proof of the altered state of her affections the circumstance of his having poisoned himself in private no less than six times within the last fortnight and her not having once interfered by word or deed to save his life  and i insist on being separated and left to myself said madame mantalini sobbing if he dares to refuse me a separation ill have one in lawi canand i hope this will be a warning to all girls who have seen this disgraceful exhibition  miss knag who was unquestionably the oldest girl in company said with great solemnity that it would be a warning to her and so did the young ladies generally with the exception of one or two who appeared to entertain some doubts whether such whispers could do wrong  why do you say all this before so many listeners said ralph in a low voice you know you are not in earnest  i am in earnest replied madame mantalini aloud and retreating towards miss knag  well but consider reasoned ralph who had a great interest in the matter it would be well to reflect a married woman has no property  not a solitary single individual dem my soul and mr mantalini raising himself upon his elbow  i am quite aware of that retorted madame mantalini tossing her head and i have none the business the stock this house and everything in it all belong to miss knag  thats quite true madame mantalini said miss knag with whom her late employer had secretly come to an amicable understanding on this point very true indeed madame mantalinihemvery true and i never was more glad in all my life that i had strength of mind to resist matrimonial offers no matter how advantageous than i am when i think of my present position as compared with your most unfortunate and most undeserved one madame mantalini  demmit cried mr mantalini turning his head towards his wife will it not slap and pinch the envious dowager that dares to reflect upon its own delicious  but the day of mr mantalinis blandishments had departed miss knag sir said his wife is my particular friend and although mr mantalini leered till his eyes seemed in danger of never coming back to their right places again madame mantalini showed no signs of softening  to do the excellent miss knag justice she had been mainly instrumental in bringing about this altered state of things for finding by daily experience that there was no chance of the business thriving or even continuing to exist while mr mantalini had any hand in the expenditure and having now a considerable interest in its welldoing she had sedulously applied herself to the investigation of some little matters connected with that gentlemans private character which she had so well elucidated and artfully imparted to madame mantalini as to open her eyes more effectually than the closest and most philosophical reasoning could have done in a series of years to which end the accidental discovery by miss knag of some tender correspondence in which madame mantalini was described as old and ordinary had most providentially contributed  however notwithstanding her firmness madame mantalini wept very piteously and as she leant upon miss knag and signed towards the door that young lady and all the other young ladies with sympathising faces proceeded to bear her out  nickleby said mr mantalini in tears you have been made a witness to this demnition cruelty on the part of the demdest enslaver and captivator that never was oh dem i forgive that woman  forgive repeated madame mantalini angrily  i do forgive her nickleby said mr mantalini you will blame me the world will blame me the women will blame me everybody will laugh and scoff and smile and grin most demnebly they will say she had a blessing she did not know it he was too weak he was too good he was a demd fine fellow but he loved too strong he could not bear her to be cross and call him wicked names it was a demd case there never was a demder but i forgive her  with this affecting speech mr mantalini fell down again very flat and lay to all appearance without sense or motion until all the females had left the room when he came cautiously into a sitting posture and confronted ralph with a very blank face and the little bottle still in one hand and the teaspoon in the other  you may put away those fooleries now and live by your wits again said ralph coolly putting on his hat  demmit nickleby youre not serious  i seldom joke said ralph goodnight  no but nickleby said mantalini  i am wrong perhaps rejoined ralph i hope so you should know best goodnight  affecting not to hear his entreaties that he would stay and advise with him ralph left the crestfallen mr mantalini to his meditations and left the house quietly  oho he said sets the wind that way so soon half knave and half fool and detected in both characters i think your day is over sir  as he said this he made some memorandum in his pocketbook in which mr mantalinis name figured conspicuously and finding by his watch that it was between nine and ten oclock made all speed home  are they here was the first question he asked of newman  newman nodded been here half an hour  two of them one a fat sleek man  ay said newman in your room now  good rejoined ralph get me a coach  a coach what yougoing toeh stammered newman  ralph angrily repeated his orders and noggs who might well have been excused for wondering at such an unusual and extraordinary circumstance for he had never seen ralph in a coach in his life departed on his errand and presently returned with the conveyance  into it went mr squeers and ralph and the third man whom newman noggs had never seen newman stood upon the doorstep to see them off not troubling himself to wonder where or upon what business they were going until he chanced by mere accident to hear ralph name the address whither the coachman was to drive  quick as lightning and in a state of the most extreme wonder newman darted into his little office for his hat and limped after the coach as if with the intention of getting up behind but in this design he was balked for it had too much the start of him and was soon hopelessly ahead leaving him gaping in the empty street  i dont know though said noggs stopping for breath any good that i could have done by going too he would have seen me if i had drive there what can come of this if i had only known it yesterday i could have tolddrive there theres mischief in it there must be  his reflections were interrupted by a greyhaired man of a very remarkable though far from prepossessing appearance who coming stealthily towards him solicited relief  newman still cogitating deeply turned away but the man followed him and pressed him with such a tale of misery that newman who might have been considered a hopeless person to beg from and who had little enough to give looked into his hat for some halfpence which he usually kept screwed up when he had any in a corner of his pockethandkerchief  while he was busily untwisting the knot with his teeth the man said something which attracted his attention whatever that something was it led to something else and in the end he and newman walked away side by sidethe strange man talking earnestly and newman listening    chapter 45  containing matter of a surprising kind   as we gang awa fra lunnun tomorrow neeght and as i dinnot know that i was eer so happy in a my days misther nickleby ding but i will tak anoother glass to our next merry meeting  so said john browdie rubbing his hands with great joyousness and looking round him with a ruddy shining face quite in keeping with the declaration  the time at which john found himself in this enviable condition was the same evening to which the last chapter bore reference the place was the cottage and the assembled company were nicholas mrs nickleby mrs browdie kate nickleby and smike  a very merry party they had been mrs nickleby knowing of her sons obligations to the honest yorkshireman had after some demur yielded her consent to mr and mrs browdie being invited out to tea in the way of which arrangement there were at first sundry difficulties and obstacles arising out of her not having had an opportunity of calling upon mrs browdie first for although mrs nickleby very often observed with much complacency as most punctilious people do that she had not an atom of pride or formality about her still she was a great stickler for dignity and ceremonies and as it was manifest that until a call had been made she could not be politely speaking and according to the laws of society even cognisant of the fact of mrs browdies existence she felt her situation to be one of peculiar delicacy and difficulty  the call must originate with me my dear said mrs nickleby thats indispensable the fact is my dear that its necessary there should be a sort of condescension on my part and that i should show this young person that i am willing to take notice of her theres a very respectablelooking young man added mrs nickleby after a short consideration who is conductor to one of the omnibuses that go by here and who wears a glazed hatyour sister and i have noticed him very oftenhe has a wart upon his nose kate you know exactly like a gentlemans servant  have all gentlemens servants warts upon their noses mother asked nicholas  nicholas my dear how very absurd you are returned his mother of course i mean that his glazed hat looks like a gentlemans servant and not the wart upon his nose though even that is not so ridiculous as it may seem to you for we had a footboy once who had not only a wart but a wen also and a very large wen too and he demanded to have his wages raised in consequence because he found it came very expensive let me see what was ioh yes i know the best way that i can think of would be to send a card and my compliments ive no doubt hed take em for a pot of porter by this young man to the saracen with two necks if the waiter took him for a gentlemans servant so much the better then all mrs browdie would have to do would be to send her card back by the carrier he could easily come with a double knock and theres an end of it  my dear mother said nicholas i dont suppose such unsophisticated people as these ever had a card of their own or ever will have  oh that indeed nicholas my dear returned mrs nickleby thats another thing if you put it upon that ground why of course i have no more to say than that i have no doubt they are very good sort of persons and that i have no kind of objection to their coming here to tea if they like and shall make a point of being very civil to them if they do  the point being thus effectually set at rest and mrs nickleby duly placed in the patronising and mildlycondescending position which became her rank and matrimonial years mr and mrs browdie were invited and came and as they were very deferential to mrs nickleby and seemed to have a becoming appreciation of her greatness and were very much pleased with everything the good lady had more than once given kate to understand in a whisper that she thought they were the very bestmeaning people she had ever seen and perfectly well behaved  and thus it came to pass that john browdie declared in the parlour after supper to wit and twenty minutes before eleven oclock pm that he had never been so happy in all his days  nor was mrs browdie much behind her husband in this respect for that young matron whose rustic beauty contrasted very prettily with the more delicate loveliness of kate and without suffering by the contrast either for each served as it were to set off and decorate the other could not sufficiently admire the gentle and winning manners of the young lady or the engaging affability of the elder one then kate had the art of turning the conversation to subjects upon which the country girl bashful at first in strange company could feel herself at home and if mrs nickleby was not quite so felicitous at times in the selection of topics of discourse or if she did seem as mrs browdie expressed it rather high in her notions still nothing could be kinder and that she took considerable interest in the young couple was manifest from the very long lectures on housewifery with which she was so obliging as to entertain mrs browdies private ear which were illustrated by various references to the domestic economy of the cottage in which those duties falling exclusively upon kate the good lady had about as much share either in theory or practice as any one of the statues of the twelve apostles which embellish the exterior of st pauls cathedral  mr browdie said kate addressing his young wife is the besthumoured the kindest and heartiest creature i ever saw if i were oppressed with i dont know how many cares it would make me happy only to look at him  he does seem indeed upon my word a most excellent creature kate said mrs nickleby most excellent and i am sure that at all times it will give me pleasurereally pleasure nowto have you mrs browdie to see me in this plain and homely manner we make no display said mrs nickleby with an air which seemed to insinuate that they could make a vast deal if they were so disposed no fuss no preparation i wouldnt allow it i said kate my dear you will only make mrs browdie feel uncomfortable and how very foolish and inconsiderate that would be  i am very much obliged to you i am sure maam returned mrs browdie gratefully its nearly eleven oclock john i am afraid we are keeping you up very late maam  late cried mrs nickleby with a sharp thin laugh and one little cough at the end like a note of admiration expressed this is quite early for us we used to keep such hours twelve one two three oclock was nothing to us balls dinners cardparties never were such rakes as the people about where we used to live i often think now i am sure that how we ever could go through with it is quite astonishing and that is just the evil of having a large connection and being a great deal sought after which i would recommend all young married people steadily to resist though of course and its perfectly clear and a very happy thing too i think that very few young married people can be exposed to such temptations there was one family in particular that used to live about a mile from usnot straight down the road but turning sharp off to the left by the turnpike where the plymouth mail ran over the donkeythat were quite extraordinary people for giving the most extravagant parties with artificial flowers and champagne and variegated lamps and in short every delicacy of eating and drinking that the most singular epicure could possibly require i dont think that there ever were such people as those peltiroguses you remember the peltiroguses kate  kate saw that for the ease and comfort of the visitors it was high time to stay this flood of recollection so answered that she entertained of the peltiroguses a most vivid and distinct remembrance and then said that mr browdie had half promised early in the evening that he would sing a yorkshire song and that she was most impatient that he should redeem his promise because she was sure it would afford her mama more amusement and pleasure than it was possible to express  mrs nickleby confirming her daughter with the best possible gracefor there was patronage in that too and a kind of implication that she had a discerning taste in such matters and was something of a criticjohn browdie proceeded to consider the words of some northcountry ditty and to take his wifes recollection respecting the same this done he made divers ungainly movements in his chair and singling out one particular fly on the ceiling from the other flies there asleep fixed his eyes upon him and began to roar a meek sentiment supposed to be uttered by a gentle swain fast pining away with love and despair in a voice of thunder  at the end of the first verse as though some person without had waited until then to make himself audible was heard a loud and violent knocking at the streetdoor so loud and so violent indeed that the ladies started as by one accord and john browdie stopped  it must be some mistake said nicholas carelessly we know nobody who would come here at this hour  mrs nickleby surmised however that perhaps the countinghouse was burnt down or perhaps the mr cheerybles had sent to take nicholas into partnership which certainly appeared highly probable at that time of night or perhaps mr linkinwater had run away with the property or perhaps miss la creevy was taken in or perhaps  but a hasty exclamation from kate stopped her abruptly in her conjectures and ralph nickleby walked into the room  stay said ralph as nicholas rose and kate making her way towards him threw herself upon his arm before that boy says a word hear me  nicholas bit his lip and shook his head in a threatening manner but appeared for the moment unable to articulate a syllable kate clung closer to his arm smike retreated behind them and john browdie who had heard of ralph and appeared to have no great difficulty in recognising him stepped between the old man and his young friend as if with the intention of preventing either of them from advancing a step further  hear me i say said ralph and not him  say what thoust gotten to say then sir retorted john and tak care thou dinnot put up angry bluid which thoudst betther try to quiet  i should know you said ralph by your tongue and him pointing to smike by his looks  dont speak to him said nicholas recovering his voice i will not have it i will not hear him i do not know that man i cannot breathe the air that he corrupts his presence is an insult to my sister it is shame to see him i will not bear it  stand cried john laying his heavy hand upon his chest  then let him instantly retire said nicholas struggling i am not going to lay hands upon him but he shall withdraw i will not have him here john john browdie is this my house am i a child if he stands there cried nicholas burning with fury looking so calmly upon those who know his black and dastardly heart hell drive me mad  to all these exclamations john browdie answered not a word but he retained his hold upon nicholas and when he was silent again spoke  theres more to say and hear than thou thinkst for said john i tellee i ha gotten scent o thot already waat be that shadow ootside door there noo schoolmeasther show thyself mun dinnot be sheamefeaced noo auld genlman lets have schoolmeasther coom  hearing this adjuration mr squeers who had been lingering in the passage until such time as it should be expedient for him to enter and he could appear with effect was fain to present himself in a somewhat undignified and sneaking way at which john browdie laughed with such keen and heartfelt delight that even kate in all the pain anxiety and surprise of the scene and though the tears were in her eyes felt a disposition to join him  have you done enjoying yourself sir said ralph at length  pratty nigh for the prasant time sir replied john  i can wait said ralph take your own time pray  ralph waited until there was a perfect silence and then turning to mrs nickleby but directing an eager glance at kate as if more anxious to watch his effect upon her said  now maam listen to me i dont imagine that you were a party to a very fine tirade of words sent me by that boy of yours because i dont believe that under his control you have the slightest will of your own or that your advice your opinion your wants your wishes anything which in nature and reason or of what use is your great experience ought to weigh with him has the slightest influence or weight whatever or is taken for a moment into account  mrs nickleby shook her head and sighed as if there were a good deal in that certainly  for this reason resumed ralph i address myself to you maam for this reason partly and partly because i do not wish to be disgraced by the acts of a vicious stripling whom i was obliged to disown and who afterwards in his boyish majesty feigns toha hato disown me i present myself here tonight i have another motive in coming a motive of humanity i come here said ralph looking round with a biting and triumphant smile and gloating and dwelling upon the words as if he were loath to lose the pleasure of saying them to restore a parent his child ay sir he continued bending eagerly forward and addressing nicholas as he marked the change of his countenance to restore a parent his child his son sir trepanned waylaid and guarded at every turn by you with the base design of robbing him some day of any little wretched pittance of which he might become possessed  in that you know you lie said nicholas proudly  in this i know i speak the truth i have his father here retorted ralph  here sneered squeers stepping forward do you hear that here didnt i tell you to be careful that his father didnt turn up and send him back to me why his fathers my friend hes to come back to me directly he is now what do you sayehnowcomewhat do you say to thatant you sorry you took so much trouble for nothing ant you ant you  you bear upon your body certain marks i gave you said nicholas looking quietly away and may talk in acknowledgment of them as much as you please youll talk a long time before you rub them out mr squeers  the estimable gentleman last named cast a hasty look at the table as if he were prompted by this retort to throw a jug or bottle at the head of nicholas but he was interrupted in this design if such design he had by ralph who touching him on the elbow bade him tell the father that he might now appear and claim his son  this being purely a labour of love mr squeers readily complied and leaving the room for the purpose almost immediately returned supporting a sleek personage with an oily face who bursting from him and giving to view the form and face of mr snawley made straight up to smike and tucking that poor fellows head under his arm in a most uncouth and awkward embrace elevated his broadbrimmed hat at arms length in the air as a token of devout thanksgiving exclaiming meanwhile how little did i think of this here joyful meeting when i saw him last oh how little did i think it  be composed sir said ralph with a gruff expression of sympathy you have got him now  got him oh havent i got him have i got him though cried mr snawley scarcely able to believe it yes here he is flesh and blood flesh and blood  vary little flesh said john browdie  mr snawley was too much occupied by his parental feelings to notice this remark and to assure himself more completely of the restoration of his child tucked his head under his arm again and kept it there  what was it said snawley that made me take such a strong interest in him when that worthy instructor of youth brought him to my house what was it that made me burn all over with a wish to chastise him severely for cutting away from his best friends his pastors and masters  it was parental instinct sir observed squeers  thats what it was sir rejoined snawley the elevated feeling the feeling of the ancient romans and grecians and of the beasts of the field and birds of the air with the exception of rabbits and tomcats which sometimes devour their offspring my heart yearned towards him i could havei dont know what i couldnt have done to him in the anger of a father  it only shows what natur is sir said mr squeers shes rum un is natur  she is a holy thing sir remarked snawley  i believe you added mr squeers with a moral sigh i should like to know how we should ever get on without her natur said mr squeers solemnly is more easier conceived than described oh what a blessed thing sir to be in a state of natur  pending this philosophical discourse the bystanders had been quite stupefied with amazement while nicholas had looked keenly from snawley to squeers and from squeers to ralph divided between his feelings of disgust doubt and surprise at this juncture smike escaping from his father fled to nicholas and implored him in most moving terms never to give him up but to let him live and die beside him  if you are this boys father said nicholas look at the wreck he is and tell me that you purpose to send him back to that loathsome den from which i brought him  scandal again cried squeers recollect you ant worth powder and shot but ill be even with you one way or another  stop interposed ralph as snawley was about to speak let us cut this matter short and not bandy words here with harebrained profligates this is your son as you can prove and you mr squeers you know this boy to be the same that was with you for so many years under the name of smike do you  do i returned squeers dont i  good said ralph a very few words will be sufficient here you had a son by your first wife mr snawley  i had replied that person and there he stands  well show that presently said ralph you and your wife were separated and she had the boy to live with her when he was a year old you received a communication from her when you had lived apart a year or two that the boy was dead and you believed it  of course i did returned snawley oh the joy of  be rational sir pray said ralph this is business and transports interfere with it this wife died a year and a half ago or thereaboutsnot morein some obscure place where she was housekeeper in a family is that the case  thats the case replied snawley  having written on her deathbed a letter or confession to you about this very boy which as it was not directed otherwise than in your name only reached you and that by a circuitous course a few days since  just so said snawley correct in every particular sir  and this confession resumed ralph is to the effect that his death was an invention of hers to wound youwas a part of a system of annoyance in short which you seem to have adopted towards each otherthat the boy lived but was of weak and imperfect intellectthat she sent him by a trusty hand to a cheap school in yorkshirethat she had paid for his education for some years and then being poor and going a long way off gradually deserted him for which she prayed forgiveness  snawley nodded his head and wiped his eyes the first slightly the last violently  the school was mr squeerss continued ralph the boy was left there in the name of smike every description was fully given dates tally exactly with mr squeerss books mr squeers is lodging with you at this time you have two other boys at his school you communicated the whole discovery to him he brought you to me as the person who had recommended to him the kidnapper of his child and i brought you here is that so  you talk like a good book sir thats got nothing in its inside but whats the truth replied snawley  this is your pocketbook said ralph producing one from his coat the certificates of your first marriage and of the boys birth and your wifes two letters and every other paper that can support these statements directly or by implication are here are they  every one of em sir  and you dont object to their being looked at here so that these people may be convinced of your power to substantiate your claim at once in law and reason and you may resume your control over your own son without more delay do i understand you  i couldnt have understood myself better sir  there then said ralph tossing the pocketbook upon the table let them see them if they like and as those are the original papers i should recommend you to stand near while they are being examined or you may chance to lose some  with these words ralph sat down unbidden and compressing his lips which were for the moment slightly parted by a smile folded his arms and looked for the first time at his nephew  nicholas stung by the concluding taunt darted an indignant glance at him but commanding himself as well as he could entered upon a close examination of the documents at which john browdie assisted there was nothing about them which could be called in question the certificates were regularly signed as extracts from the parish books the first letter had a genuine appearance of having been written and preserved for some years the handwriting of the second tallied with it exactly making proper allowance for its having been written by a person in extremity and there were several other corroboratory scraps of entries and memoranda which it was equally difficult to question  dear nicholas whispered kate who had been looking anxiously over his shoulder can this be really the case is this statement true  i fear it is answered nicholas what say you john  john scratched his head and shook it but said nothing at all  you will observe maam said ralph addressing himself to mrs nickleby that this boy being a minor and not of strong mind we might have come here tonight armed with the powers of the law and backed by a troop of its myrmidons i should have done so maam unquestionably but for my regard for the feelings of yourself and your daughter  you have shown your regard for her feelings well said nicholas drawing his sister towards him  thank you replied ralph your praise sir is commendation indeed  well said squeers whats to be done them hackneycoach horses will catch cold if we dont think of moving theres one of em a sneezing now so that he blows the street door right open whats the order of the day is master snawley to come along with us  no no no replied smike drawing back and clinging to nicholas  no pray no i will not go from you with him no no  this is a cruel thing said snawley looking to his friends for support do parents bring children into the world for this  do parents bring children into the world for thot said john browdie bluntly pointing as he spoke to squeers  never you mind retorted that gentleman tapping his nose derisively  never i mind said john no nor never nobody mind sayst thou schoolmeasther its nobodys minding that keeps sike men as thou afloat noo then where beest thou coomin to dang it dinnot coom treadin ower me mun  suiting the action to the word john browdie just jerked his elbow into the chest of mr squeers who was advancing upon smike with so much dexterity that the schoolmaster reeled and staggered back upon ralph nickleby and being unable to recover his balance knocked that gentleman off his chair and stumbled heavily upon him  this accidental circumstance was the signal for some very decisive proceedings in the midst of a great noise occasioned by the prayers and entreaties of smike the cries and exclamations of the women and the vehemence of the men demonstrations were made of carrying off the lost son by violence squeers had actually begun to haul him out when nicholas who until then had been evidently undecided how to act took him by the collar and shaking him so that such teeth as he had chattered in his head politely escorted him to the roomdoor and thrusting him into the passage shut it upon him  now said nicholas to the other two have the goodness to follow your friend  i want my son said snawley  your son replied nicholas chooses for himself he chooses to remain here and he shall  you wont give him up said snawley  i would not give him up against his will to be the victim of such brutality as that to which you would consign him replied nicholas if he were a dog or a rat  knock that nickleby down with a candlestick cried mr squeers through the keyhole and bring out my hat somebody will you unless he wants to steal it  i am very sorry indeed said mrs nickleby who with mrs browdie had stood crying and biting her fingers in a corner while kate very pale but perfectly quiet had kept as near her brother as she could i am very sorry indeed for all this i really dont know what would be best to do and thats the truth nicholas ought to be the best judge and i hope he is of course its a hard thing to have to keep other peoples children though young mr snawley is certainly as useful and willing as its possible for anybody to be but if it could be settled in any friendly mannerif old mr snawley for instance would settle to pay something certain for his board and lodging and some fair arrangement was come to so that we undertook to have fish twice a week and a pudding twice or a dumpling or something of that sorti do think that it might be very satisfactory and pleasant for all parties  this compromise which was proposed with abundance of tears and sighs not exactly meeting the point at issue nobody took any notice of it and poor mrs nickleby accordingly proceeded to enlighten mrs browdie upon the advantages of such a scheme and the unhappy results flowing on all occasions from her not being attended to when she proffered her advice  you sir said snawley addressing the terrified smike are an unnatural ungrateful unlovable boy you wont let me love you when i want to wont you come home wont you  no no no cried smike shrinking back  he never loved nobody bawled squeers through the keyhole he never loved me he never loved wackford who is next door but one to a cherubim how can you expect that hell love his father hell never love his father he wont he dont know what it is to have a father he dont understand it it ant in him  mr snawley looked steadfastly at his son for a full minute and then covering his eyes with his hand and once more raising his hat in the air appeared deeply occupied in deploring his black ingratitude then drawing his arm across his eyes he picked up mr squeerss hat and taking it under one arm and his own under the other walked slowly and sadly out  your romance sir said ralph lingering for a moment is destroyed i take it no unknown no persecuted descendant of a man of high degree but the weak imbecile son of a poor petty tradesman we shall see how your sympathy melts before plain matter of fact  you shall said nicholas motioning towards the door  and trust me sir added ralph that i never supposed you would give him up tonight pride obstinacy reputation for fine feeling were all against it these must be brought down sir lowered crushed as they shall be soon the protracted and wearing anxiety and expense of the law in its most oppressive form its torture from hour to hour its weary days and sleepless nights with these ill prove you and break your haughty spirit strong as you deem it now and when you make this house a hell and visit these trials upon yonder wretched object as you will i know you and those who think you now a youngfledged hero well go into old accounts between us two and see who stands the debtor and comes out best at last even before the world  ralph nickleby withdrew but mr squeers who had heard a portion of this closing address and was by this time wound up to a pitch of impotent malignity almost unprecedented could not refrain from returning to the parlour door and actually cutting some dozen capers with various wry faces and hideous grimaces expressive of his triumphant confidence in the downfall and defeat of nicholas  having concluded this wardance in which his short trousers and large boots had borne a very conspicuous figure mr squeers followed his friends and the family were left to meditate upon recent occurrences    chapter 46  throws some light upon nicholass love but whether for good or evil the reader must determine   after an anxious consideration of the painful and embarrassing position in which he was placed nicholas decided that he ought to lose no time in frankly stating it to the kind brothers availing himself of the first opportunity of being alone with mr charles cheeryble at the close of next day he accordingly related smikes little history and modestly but firmly expressed his hope that the good old gentleman would under such circumstances as he described hold him justified in adopting the extreme course of interfering between parent and child and upholding the latter in his disobedience even though his horror and dread of his father might seem and would doubtless be represented as a thing so repulsive and unnatural as to render those who countenanced him in it fit objects of general detestation and abhorrence  so deeply rooted does this horror of the man appear to be said nicholas that i can hardly believe he really is his son nature does not seem to have implanted in his breast one lingering feeling of affection for him and surely she can never err  my dear sir replied brother charles you fall into the very common mistake of charging upon nature matters with which she has not the smallest connection and for which she is in no way responsible men talk of nature as an abstract thing and lose sight of what is natural while they do so here is a poor lad who has never felt a parents care who has scarcely known anything all his life but suffering and sorrow presented to a man who he is told is his father and whose first act is to signify his intention of putting an end to his short term of happiness of consigning him to his old fate and taking him from the only friend he has ever hadwhich is yourself if nature in such a case put into that lads breast but one secret prompting which urged him towards his father and away from you she would be a liar and an idiot  nicholas was delighted to find that the old gentleman spoke so warmly and in the hope that he might say something more to the same purpose made no reply  the same mistake presents itself to me in one shape or other at every turn said brother charles parents who never showed their love complain of want of natural affection in their children children who never showed their duty complain of want of natural feeling in their parents lawmakers who find both so miserable that their affections have never had enough of lifes sun to develop them are loud in their moralisings over parents and children too and cry that the very ties of nature are disregarded natural affections and instincts my dear sir are the most beautiful of the almightys works but like other beautiful works of his they must be reared and fostered or it is as natural that they should be wholly obscured and that new feelings should usurp their place as it is that the sweetest productions of the earth left untended should be choked with weeds and briers i wish we could be brought to consider this and remembering natural obligations a little more at the right time talk about them a little less at the wrong one  after this brother charles who had talked himself into a great heat stopped to cool a little and then continued  i dare say you are surprised my dear sir that i have listened to your recital with so little astonishment that is easily explained your uncle has been here this morning  nicholas coloured and drew back a step or two  yes said the old gentleman tapping his desk emphatically here in this room he would listen neither to reason feeling nor justice but brother ned was hard upon him brother ned sir might have melted a pavingstone  he came to said nicholas  to complain of you returned brother charles to poison our ears with calumnies and falsehoods but he came on a fruitless errand and went away with some wholesome truths in his ear besides brother ned my dear my nicklebybrother ned sir is a perfect lion so is tim linkinwater tim is quite a lion we had tim in to face him at first and tim was at him sir before you could say jack robinson  how can i ever thank you for all the deep obligations you impose upon me every day said nicholas  by keeping silence upon the subject my dear sir returned brother charles you shall be righted at least you shall not be wronged nobody belonging to you shall be wronged they shall not hurt a hair of your head or the boys head or your mothers head or your sisters head i have said it brother ned has said it tim linkinwater has said it we have all said it and well all do it i have seen the fatherif he is the fatherand i suppose he must be he is a barbarian and a hypocrite mr nickleby i told him you are a barbarian sir i did i said youre a barbarian sir and im glad of it i am very glad i told him he was a barbarian very glad indeed  by this time brother charles was in such a very warm state of indignation that nicholas thought he might venture to put in a word but the moment he essayed to do so mr cheeryble laid his hand softly upon his arm and pointed to a chair  the subject is at an end for the present said the old gentleman wiping his face dont revive it by a single word i am going to speak upon another subject a confidential subject mr nickleby we must be cool again we must be cool  after two or three turns across the room he resumed his seat and drawing his chair nearer to that on which nicholas was seated said  i am about to employ you my dear sir on a confidential and delicate mission  you might employ many a more able messenger sir said nicholas but a more trustworthy or zealous one i may be bold to say you could not find  of that i am well assured returned brother charles well assured you will give me credit for thinking so when i tell you that the object of this mission is a young lady  a young lady sir cried nicholas quite trembling for the moment with his eagerness to hear more  a very beautiful young lady said mr cheeryble gravely  pray go on sir returned nicholas  i am thinking how to do so said brother charles sadly as it seemed to his young friend and with an expression allied to pain you accidentally saw a young lady in this room one morning my dear sir in a fainting fit do you remember perhaps you have forgotten  oh no replied nicholas hurriedly iiremember it very well indeed  she is the lady i speak of said brother charles like the famous parrot nicholas thought a great deal but was unable to utter a word  she is the daughter said mr cheeryble of a lady who when she was a beautiful girl herself and i was very many years younger iit seems a strange word for me to utter nowi loved very dearly you will smile perhaps to hear a greyheaded man talk about such things you will not offend me for when i was as young as you i dare say i should have done the same  i have no such inclination indeed said nicholas  my dear brother ned continued mr cheeryble was to have married her sister but she died she is dead too now and has been for many years she married her choice and i wish i could add that her afterlife was as happy as god knows i ever prayed it might be  a short silence intervened which nicholas made no effort to break  if trial and calamity had fallen as lightly on his head as in the deepest truth of my own heart i ever hoped for her sake it would his life would have been one of peace and happiness said the old gentleman calmly it will be enough to say that this was not the case that she was not happy that they fell into complicated distresses and difficulties that she came twelve months before her death to appeal to my old friendship sadly changed sadly altered brokenspirited from suffering and illusage and almost brokenhearted he readily availed himself of the money which to give her but one hours peace of mind i would have poured out as freely as waternay he often sent her back for moreand yet even while he squandered it he made the very success of these her applications to me the groundwork of cruel taunts and jeers protesting that he knew she thought with bitter remorse of the choice she had made that she had married him from motives of interest and vanity he was a gay young man with great friends about him when she chose him for her husband and venting in short upon her by every unjust and unkind means the bitterness of that ruin and disappointment which had been brought about by his profligacy alone in those times this young lady was a mere child i never saw her again until that morning when you saw her also but my nephew frank  nicholas started and indistinctly apologising for the interruption begged his patron to proceed  my nephew frank i say resumed mr cheeryble encountered her by accident and lost sight of her almost in a minute afterwards within two days after he returned to england her father lay in some secret place to avoid his creditors reduced between sickness and poverty to the verge of death and she a childwe might almost think if we did not know the wisdom of all heavens decreeswho should have blessed a better man was steadily braving privation degradation and everything most terrible to such a young and delicate creatures heart for the purpose of supporting him she was attended sir said brother charles in these reverses by one faithful creature who had been in old times a poor kitchen wench in the family who was then their solitary servant but who might have been for the truth and fidelity of her heartwho might have beenah the wife of tim linkinwater himself sir  pursuing this encomium upon the poor follower with such energy and relish as no words can describe brother charles leant back in his chair and delivered the remainder of his relation with greater composure  it was in substance this that proudly resisting all offers of permanent aid and support from her late mothers friends because they were made conditional upon her quitting the wretched man her father who had no friends left and shrinking with instinctive delicacy from appealing in their behalf to that true and noble heart which he hated and had through its greatest and purest goodness deeply wronged by misconstruction and ill report this young girl had struggled alone and unassisted to maintain him by the labour of her hands that through the utmost depths of poverty and affliction she had toiled never turning aside for an instant from her task never wearied by the petulant gloom of a sick man sustained by no consoling recollections of the past or hopes of the future never repining for the comforts she had rejected or bewailing the hard lot she had voluntarily incurred that every little accomplishment she had acquired in happier days had been put into requisition for this purpose and directed to this one end that for two long years toiling by day and often too by night working at the needle the pencil and the pen and submitting as a daily governess to such caprices and indignities as women with daughters too too often love to inflict upon their own sex when they serve in such capacities as though in jealousy of the superior intelligence which they are necessitated to employindignities in ninetynine cases out of every hundred heaped upon persons immeasurably and incalculably their betters but outweighing in comparison any that the most heartless blackleg would put upon his groomthat for two long years by dint of labouring in all these capacities and wearying in none she had not succeeded in the sole aim and object of her life but that overwhelmed by accumulated difficulties and disappointments she had been compelled to seek out her mothers old friend and with a bursting heart to confide in him at last  if i had been poor said brother charles with sparkling eyes if i had been poor mr nickleby my dear sir which thank god i am not i would have denied myself of course anybody would under such circumstances the commonest necessaries of life to help her as it is the task is a difficult one if her father were dead nothing could be easier for then she should share and cheer the happiest home that brother ned and i could have as if she were our child or sister but he is still alive nobody can help him that has been tried a thousand times he was not abandoned by all without good cause i know  cannot she be persuaded to nicholas hesitated when he had got thus far  to leave him said brother charles who could entreat a child to desert her parent such entreaties limited to her seeing him occasionally have been urged upon hernot by mebut always with the same result  is he kind to her said nicholas does he requite her affection  true kindness considerate selfdenying kindness is not in his nature returned mr cheeryble such kindness as he knows he regards her with i believe the mother was a gentle loving confiding creature and although he wounded her from their marriage till her death as cruelly and wantonly as ever man did she never ceased to love him she commended him on her deathbed to her childs care her child has never forgotten it and never will  have you no influence over him asked nicholas  i my dear sir the last man in the world such are his jealousy and hatred of me that if he knew his daughter had opened her heart to me he would render her life miserable with his reproaches althoughthis is the inconsistency and selfishness of his characteralthough if he knew that every penny she had came from me he would not relinquish one personal desire that the most reckless expenditure of her scanty stock could gratify  an unnatural scoundrel said nicholas indignantly  we will use no harsh terms said brother charles in a gentle voice but accommodate ourselves to the circumstances in which this young lady is placed such assistance as i have prevailed upon her to accept i have been obliged at her own earnest request to dole out in the smallest portions lest he finding how easily money was procured should squander it even more lightly than he is accustomed to do she has come to and fro to and fro secretly and by night to take even this and i cannot bear that things should go on in this way mr nickleby i really cannot bear it  then it came out by little and little how that the twins had been revolving in their good old heads manifold plans and schemes for helping this young lady in the most delicate and considerate way and so that her father should not suspect the source whence the aid was derived and how they had at last come to the conclusion that the best course would be to make a feint of purchasing her little drawings and ornamental work at a high price and keeping up a constant demand for the same for the furtherance of which end and object it was necessary that somebody should represent the dealer in such commodities and after great deliberation they had pitched upon nicholas to support this character  he knows me said brother charles and he knows my brother ned neither of us would do frank is a very good fellowa very fine fellowbut we are afraid that he might be a little flighty and thoughtless in such a delicate matter and that he might perhapsthat he might in short be too susceptible for she is a beautiful creature sir just what her poor mother was and falling in love with her before he knew well his own mind carry pain and sorrow into that innocent breast which we would be the humble instruments of gradually making happy he took an extraordinary interest in her fortunes when he first happened to encounter her and we gather from the inquiries we have made of him that it was she in whose behalf he made that turmoil which led to your first acquaintance  nicholas stammered out that he had before suspected the possibility of such a thing and in explanation of its having occurred to him described when and where he had seen the young lady himself  well then you see continued brother charles that he wouldnt do tim linkinwater is out of the question for tim sir is such a tremendous fellow that he could never contain himself but would go to loggerheads with the father before he had been in the place five minutes you dont know what tim is sir when he is aroused by anything that appeals to his feelings very strongly then he is terrific sir is tim linkinwater absolutely terrific now in you we can repose the strictest confidence in you we have seenor at least i have seen and thats the same thing for theres no difference between me and my brother ned except that he is the finest creature that ever lived and that there is not and never will be anybody like him in all the worldin you we have seen domestic virtues and affections and delicacy of feeling which exactly qualify you for such an office and you are the man sir  the young lady sir said nicholas who felt so embarrassed that he had no small difficulty in saying anything at alldoesisis she a party to this innocent deceit  yes yes returned mr cheeryble at least she knows you come from us she does not know however but that we shall dispose of these little productions that youll purchase from time to time and perhaps if you did it very well that is very well indeed perhaps she might be brought to believe that wethat we made a profit of them eh eh  in this guileless and most kind simplicity brother charles was so happy and in this possibility of the young lady being led to think that she was under no obligation to him he evidently felt so sanguine and had so much delight that nicholas would not breathe a doubt upon the subject  all this time however there hovered upon the tip of his tongue a confession that the very same objections which mr cheeryble had stated to the employment of his nephew in this commission applied with at least equal force and validity to himself and a hundred times had he been upon the point of avowing the real state of his feelings and entreating to be released from it but as often treading upon the heels of this impulse came another which urged him to refrain and to keep his secret to his own breast why should i thought nicholas why should i throw difficulties in the way of this benevolent and highminded design what if i do love and reverence this good and lovely creature should i not appear a most arrogant and shallow coxcomb if i gravely represented that there was any danger of her falling in love with me besides have i no confidence in myself am i not now bound in honour to repress these thoughts has not this excellent man a right to my best and heartiest services and should any considerations of self deter me from rendering them  asking himself such questions as these nicholas mentally answered with great emphasis no and persuading himself that he was a most conscientious and glorious martyr nobly resolved to do what if he had examined his own heart a little more carefully he would have found he could not resist such is the sleight of hand by which we juggle with ourselves and change our very weaknesses into stanch and most magnanimous virtues  mr cheeryble being of course wholly unsuspicious that such reflections were presenting themselves to his young friend proceeded to give him the needful credentials and directions for his first visit which was to be made next morning and all preliminaries being arranged and the strictest secrecy enjoined nicholas walked home for the night very thoughtfully indeed  the place to which mr cheeryble had directed him was a row of mean and not overcleanly houses situated within the rules of the kings bench prison and not many hundred paces distant from the obelisk in st georges fields the rules are a certain liberty adjoining the prison and comprising some dozen streets in which debtors who can raise money to pay large fees from which their creditors do not derive any benefit are permitted to reside by the wise provisions of the same enlightened laws which leave the debtor who can raise no money to starve in jail without the food clothing lodging or warmth which are provided for felons convicted of the most atrocious crimes that can disgrace humanity there are many pleasant fictions of the law in constant operation but there is not one so pleasant or practically humorous as that which supposes every man to be of equal value in its impartial eye and the benefits of all laws to be equally attainable by all men without the smallest reference to the furniture of their pockets  to the row of houses indicated to him by mr charles cheeryble nicholas directed his steps without much troubling his head with such matters as these and at this row of housesafter traversing a very dirty and dusty suburb of which minor theatricals shellfish gingerbeer spring vans greengrocery and brokers shops appeared to compose the main and most prominent featureshe at length arrived with a palpitating heart there were small gardens in front which being wholly neglected in all other respects served as little pens for the dust to collect in until the wind came round the corner and blew it down the road opening the rickety gate which dangling on its broken hinges before one of these half admitted and half repulsed the visitor nicholas knocked at the street door with a faltering hand  it was in truth a shabby house outside with very dim parlour windows and very small show of blinds and very dirty muslin curtains dangling across the lower panes on very loose and limp strings neither when the door was opened did the inside appear to belie the outward promise as there was faded carpeting on the stairs and faded oilcloth in the passage in addition to which discomforts a gentleman ruler was smoking hard in the front parlour though it was not yet noon while the lady of the house was busily engaged in turpentining the disjointed fragments of a tentbedstead at the door of the back parlour as if in preparation for the reception of some new lodger who had been fortunate enough to engage it  nicholas had ample time to make these observations while the little boy who went on errands for the lodgers clattered down the kitchen stairs and was heard to scream as in some remote cellar for miss brays servant who presently appearing and requesting him to follow her caused him to evince greater symptoms of nervousness and disorder than so natural a consequence of his having inquired for that young lady would seem calculated to occasion  upstairs he went however and into a front room he was shown and there seated at a little table by the window on which were drawing materials with which she was occupied sat the beautiful girl who had so engrossed his thoughts and who surrounded by all the new and strong interest which nicholas attached to her story seemed now in his eyes a thousand times more beautiful than he had ever yet supposed her  but how the graces and elegancies which she had dispersed about the poorlyfurnished room went to the heart of nicholas flowers plants birds the harp the old piano whose notes had sounded so much sweeter in bygone times how many struggles had it cost her to keep these two last links of that broken chain which bound her yet to home with every slender ornament the occupation of her leisure hours replete with that graceful charm which lingers in every little tasteful work of womans hands how much patient endurance and how many gentle affections were entwined he felt as though the smile of heaven were on the little chamber as though the beautiful devotion of so young and weak a creature had shed a ray of its own on the inanimate things around and made them beautiful as itself as though the halo with which old painters surround the bright angels of a sinless world played about a being akin in spirit to them and its light were visibly before him  and yet nicholas was in the rules of the kings bench prison if he had been in italy indeed and the time had been sunset and the scene a stately terrace but there is one broad sky over all the world and whether it be blue or cloudy the same heaven beyond it so perhaps he had no need of compunction for thinking as he did  it is not to be supposed that he took in everything at one glance for he had as yet been unconscious of the presence of a sick man propped up with pillows in an easychair who moving restlessly and impatiently in his seat attracted his attention  he was scarce fifty perhaps but so emaciated as to appear much older his features presented the remains of a handsome countenance but one in which the embers of strong and impetuous passions were easier to be traced than any expression which would have rendered a far plainer face much more prepossessing his looks were very haggard and his limbs and body literally worn to the bone but there was something of the old fire in the large sunken eye notwithstanding and it seemed to kindle afresh as he struck a thick stick with which he seemed to have supported himself in his seat impatiently on the floor twice or thrice and called his daughter by her name  madeline who is this what does anybody want here who told a stranger we could be seen what is it  i believe the young lady began as she inclined her head with an air of some confusion in reply to the salutation of nicholas  you always believe returned her father petulantly what is it  by this time nicholas had recovered sufficient presence of mind to speak for himself so he said as it had been agreed he should say that he had called about a pair of handscreens and some painted velvet for an ottoman both of which were required to be of the most elegant design possible neither time nor expense being of the smallest consideration he had also to pay for the two drawings with many thanks and advancing to the little table he laid upon it a bank note folded in an envelope and sealed  see that the money is right madeline said the father open the paper my dear  its quite right papa im sure  here said mr bray putting out his hand and opening and shutting his bony fingers with irritable impatience let me see what are you talking about madeline youre sure how can you be sure of any such thing five poundswell is that right  quite said madeline bending over him she was so busily employed in arranging the pillows that nicholas could not see her face but as she stooped he thought he saw a tear fall  ring the bell ring the bell said the sick man with the same nervous eagerness and motioning towards it with such a quivering hand that the bank note rustled in the air tell her to get it changed to get me a newspaper to buy me some grapes another bottle of the wine that i had last weekandandi forget half i want just now but she can go out again let her get those first those first now madeline my love quick quick good god how slow you are  he remembers nothing that she wants thought nicholas perhaps something of what he thought was expressed in his countenance for the sick man turning towards him with great asperity demanded to know if he waited for a receipt  it is no matter at all said nicholas  no matter what do you mean sir was the tart rejoinder no matter do you think you bring your paltry money here as a favour or a gift or as a matter of business and in return for value received dn you sir because you cant appreciate the time and taste which are bestowed upon the goods you deal in do you think you give your money away do you know that you are talking to a gentleman sir who at one time could have bought up fifty such men as you and all you have what do you mean  i merely mean that as i shall have many dealings with this lady if she will kindly allow me i will not trouble her with such forms said nicholas  then i mean if you please that well have as many forms as we can returned the father my daughter sir requires no kindness from you or anybody else have the goodness to confine your dealings strictly to trade and business and not to travel beyond it every petty tradesman is to begin to pity her now is he upon my soul very pretty madeline my dear give him a receipt and mind you always do so  while she was feigning to write it and nicholas was ruminating upon the extraordinary but by no means uncommon character thus presented to his observation the invalid who appeared at times to suffer great bodily pain sank back in his chair and moaned out a feeble complaint that the girl had been gone an hour and that everybody conspired to goad him  when said nicholas as he took the piece of paper when shall i call again  this was addressed to the daughter but the father answered immediately  when youre requested to call sir and not before dont worry and persecute madeline my dear when is this person to call again  oh not for a long time not for three or four weeks it is not necessary indeed i can do without said the young lady with great eagerness  why how are we to do without urged her father not speaking above his breath three or four weeks madeline three or four weeks  then sooner sooner if you please said the young lady turning to nicholas  three or four weeks muttered the father madeline what on earthdo nothing for three or four weeks  it is a long time maam said nicholas  you think so do you retorted the father angrily if i chose to beg sir and stoop to ask assistance from people i despise three or four months would not be a long time three or four years would not be a long time understand sir that is if i chose to be dependent but as i dont you may call in a week  nicholas bowed low to the young lady and retired pondering upon mr brays ideas of independence and devoutly hoping that there might be few such independent spirits as he mingling with the baser clay of humanity  he heard a light footstep above him as he descended the stairs and looking round saw that the young lady was standing there and glancing timidly towards him seemed to hesitate whether she should call him back or no the best way of settling the question was to turn back at once which nicholas did  i dont know whether i do right in asking you sir said madeline hurriedly but pray pray do not mention to my poor mothers dear friends what has passed here today he has suffered much and is worse this morning i beg you sir as a boon a favour to myself  you have but to hint a wish returned nicholas fervently and i would hazard my life to gratify it  you speak hastily sir  truly and sincerely rejoined nicholas his lips trembling as he formed the words if ever man spoke truly yet i am not skilled in disguising my feelings and if i were i could not hide my heart from you dear madam as i know your history and feel as men and angels must who hear and see such things i do entreat you to believe that i would die to serve you  the young lady turned away her head and was plainly weeping  forgive me said nicholas with respectful earnestness if i seem to say too much or to presume upon the confidence which has been intrusted to me but i could not leave you as if my interest and sympathy expired with the commission of the day i am your faithful servant humbly devoted to you from this hour devoted in strict truth and honour to him who sent me here and in pure integrity of heart and distant respect for you if i meant more or less than this i should be unworthy his regard and false to the very nature that prompts the honest words i utter  she waved her hand entreating him to be gone but answered not a word nicholas could say no more and silently withdrew and thus ended his first interview with madeline bray    chapter 47  mr ralph nickleby has some confidential intercourse with another old friend they concert between them a project which promises well for both   there go the threequarters past muttered newman noggs listening to the chimes of some neighbouring church and my dinner times two he does it on purpose he makes a point of it its just like him  it was in his own little den of an office and on the top of his official stool that newman thus soliloquised and the soliloquy referred as newmans grumbling soliloquies usually did to ralph nickleby  i dont believe he ever had an appetite said newman except for pounds shillings and pence and with them hes as greedy as a wolf i should like to have him compelled to swallow one of every english coin the penny would be an awkward morselbut the crownha ha  his goodhumour being in some degree restored by the vision of ralph nickleby swallowing perforce a fiveshilling piece newman slowly brought forth from his desk one of those portable bottles currently known as pocketpistols and shaking the same close to his ear so as to produce a rippling sound very cool and pleasant to listen to suffered his features to relax and took a gurgling drink which relaxed them still more replacing the cork he smacked his lips twice or thrice with an air of great relish and the taste of the liquor having by this time evaporated recurred to his grievance again  five minutes to three growled newman it cant want more by this time and i had my breakfast at eight oclock and such a breakfast and my right dinnertime two and i might have a nice little bit of hot roast meat spoiling at home all this timehow does he know i havent dont go till i come back dont go till i come back day after day what do you always go out at my dinnertime for theneh dont you know its nothing but aggravationeh  these words though uttered in a very loud key were addressed to nothing but empty air the recital of his wrongs however seemed to have the effect of making newman noggs desperate for he flattened his old hat upon his head and drawing on the everlasting gloves declared with great vehemence that come what might he would go to dinner that very minute  carrying this resolution into instant effect he had advanced as far as the passage when the sound of the latchkey in the street door caused him to make a precipitate retreat into his own office again  here he is growled newman and somebody with him now itll be stop till this gentlemans gone but i wont thats flat  so saying newman slipped into a tall empty closet which opened with two half doors and shut himself up intending to slip out directly ralph was safe inside his own room  noggs cried ralph where is that fellow noggs  but not a word said newman  the dog has gone to his dinner though i told him not muttered ralph looking into the office and pulling out his watch humph you had better come in here gride my mans out and the sun is hot upon my room this is cool and in the shade if you dont mind roughing it  not at all mr nickleby oh not at all all places are alike to me sir ah very nice indeed oh very nice  the parson who made this reply was a little old man of about seventy or seventyfive years of age of a very lean figure much bent and slightly twisted he wore a grey coat with a very narrow collar an oldfashioned waistcoat of ribbed black silk and such scanty trousers as displayed his shrunken spindleshanks in their full ugliness the only articles of display or ornament in his dress were a steel watchchain to which were attached some large gold seals and a black ribbon into which in compliance with an old fashion scarcely ever observed in these days his grey hair was gathered behind his nose and chin were sharp and prominent his jaws had fallen inwards from loss of teeth his face was shrivelled and yellow save where the cheeks were streaked with the colour of a dry winter apple and where his beard had been there lingered yet a few grey tufts which seemed like the ragged eyebrows to denote the badness of the soil from which they sprung the whole air and attitude of the form was one of stealthy catlike obsequiousness the whole expression of the face was concentrated in a wrinkled leer compounded of cunning lecherousness slyness and avarice  such was old arthur gride in whose face there was not a wrinkle in whose dress there was not one spare fold or plait but expressed the most covetous and griping penury and sufficiently indicated his belonging to that class of which ralph nickleby was a member such was old arthur gride as he sat in a low chair looking up into the face of ralph nickleby who lounging upon the tall office stool with his arms upon his knees looked down into his a match for him on whatever errand he had come  and how have you been said gride feigning great interest in ralphs state of health i havent seen you foroh not for  not for a long time said ralph with a peculiar smile importing that he very well knew it was not on a mere visit of compliment that his friend had come it was a narrow chance that you saw me now for i had only just come up to the door as you turned the corner  i am very lucky observed gride  so men say replied ralph drily  the older moneylender wagged his chin and smiled but he originated no new remark and they sat for some little time without speaking each was looking out to take the other at a disadvantage  come gride said ralph at length whats in the wind today  aha youre a bold man mr nickleby cried the other apparently very much relieved by ralphs leading the way to business oh dear dear what a bold man you are  why you have a sleek and slinking way with you that makes me seem so by contrast returned ralph i dont know but that yours may answer better but i want the patience for it  you were born a genius mr nickleby said old arthur deep deep deep ah  deep enough retorted ralph to know that i shall need all the depth i have when men like you begin to compliment you know i have stood by when you fawned and flattered other people and i remember pretty well what that always led to  ha ha ha rejoined arthur rubbing his hands so you do so you do no doubt not a man knows it better well its a pleasant thing now to think that you remember old times oh dear  now then said ralph composedly whats in the wind i ask again what is it  see that now cried the other he cant even keep from business while were chatting over bygones oh dear dear what a man it is  which of the bygones do you want to revive said ralph one of them i know or you wouldnt talk about them  he suspects even me cried old arthur holding up his hands even me oh dear even me what a man it is ha ha ha what a man it is mr nickleby against all the world theres nobody like him a giant among pigmies a giant a giant  ralph looked at the old dog with a quiet smile as he chuckled on in this strain and newman noggs in the closet felt his heart sink within him as the prospect of dinner grew fainter and fainter  i must humour him though cried old arthur he must have his waya wilful man as the scotch saywell well theyre a wise people the scotch he will talk about business and wont give away his time for nothing hes very right time is money time is money  he was one of us who made that saying i should think said ralph time is money and very good money too to those who reckon interest by it time is money yes and time costs money its rather an expensive article to some people we could name or i forget my trade  in rejoinder to this sally old arthur again raised his hands again chuckled and again ejaculated what a man it is which done he dragged the low chair a little nearer to ralphs high stool and looking upwards into his immovable face said  what would you say to me if i was to tell you that i wasthat i wasgoing to be married  i should tell you replied ralph looking coldly down upon him that for some purpose of your own you told a lie and that it wasnt the first time and wouldnt be the last that i wasnt surprised and wasnt to be taken in  then i tell you seriously that i am said old arthur  and i tell you seriously rejoined ralph what i told you this minute stay let me look at you theres a liquorish devilry in your face what is this  i wouldnt deceive you you know whined arthur gride i couldnt do it i should be mad to try i i to deceive mr nickleby the pigmy to impose upon the giant i ask againhe he hewhat should you say to me if i was to tell you that i was going to be married  to some old hag said ralph  no no cried arthur interrupting him and rubbing his hands in an ecstasy wrong wrong again mr nickleby for once at fault out quite out to a young and beautiful girl fresh lovely bewitching and not nineteen dark eyes long eyelashes ripe and ruddy lips that to look at is to long to kiss beautiful clustering hair that ones fingers itch to play with such a waist as might make a man clasp the air involuntarily thinking of twining his arm about it little feet that tread so lightly they hardly seem to walk upon the groundto marry all this sir thishey hey  this is something more than common drivelling said ralph after listening with a curled lip to the old sinners raptures the girls name  oh deep deep see now how deep that is exclaimed old arthur he knows i want his help he knows he can give it me he knows it must all turn to his advantage he sees the thing already her nameis there nobody within hearing  why who the devil should there be retorted ralph testily  i didnt know but that perhaps somebody might be passing up or down the stairs said arthur gride after looking out at the door and carefully reclosing it or but that your man might have come back and might have been listening outside clerks and servants have a trick of listening and i should have been very uncomfortable if mr noggs  curse mr noggs said ralph sharply and go on with what you have to say  curse mr noggs by all means rejoined old arthur i am sure i have not the least objection to that her name is  well said ralph rendered very irritable by old arthurs pausing again what is it  madeline bray  whatever reasons there might have beenand arthur gride appeared to have anticipated somefor the mention of this name producing an effect upon ralph or whatever effect it really did produce upon him he permitted none to manifest itself but calmly repeated the name several times as if reflecting when and where he had heard it before  bray said ralph braythere was young bray ofno he never had a daughter  you remember bray rejoined arthur gride  no said ralph looking vacantly at him  not walter bray the dashing man who used his handsome wife so ill  if you seek to recall any particular dashing man to my recollection by such a trait as that said ralph shrugging his shoulders i shall confound him with ninetenths of the dashing men i have ever known  tut tut that bray who is now in the rules of the bench said old arthur you cant have forgotten bray both of us did business with him why he owes you money  oh him rejoined ralph ay ay now you speak oh its his daughter is it  naturally as this was said it was not said so naturally but that a kindred spirit like old arthur gride might have discerned a design upon the part of ralph to lead him on to much more explicit statements and explanations than he would have volunteered or that ralph could in all likelihood have obtained by any other means old arthur however was so intent upon his own designs that he suffered himself to be overreached and had no suspicion but that his good friend was in earnest  i knew you couldnt forget him when you came to think for a moment he said  you were right answered ralph but old arthur gride and matrimony is a most anomalous conjunction of words old arthur gride and dark eyes and eyelashes and lips that to look at is to long to kiss and clustering hair that he wants to play with and waists that he wants to span and little feet that dont tread upon anythingold arthur gride and such things as these is more monstrous still but old arthur gride marrying the daughter of a ruined dashing man in the rules of the bench is the most monstrous and incredible of all plainly friend arthur gride if you want any help from me in this business which of course you do or you would not be here speak out and to the purpose and above all dont talk to me of its turning to my advantage for i know it must turn to yours also and to a good round tune too or you would have no finger in such a pie as this  there was enough acerbity and sarcasm not only in the matter of ralphs speech but in the tone of voice in which he uttered it and the looks with which he eked it out to have fired even the ancient usurers cold blood and flushed even his withered cheek but he gave vent to no demonstration of anger contenting himself with exclaiming as before what a man it is and rolling his head from side to side as if in unrestrained enjoyment of his freedom and drollery clearly observing however from the expression in ralphs features that he had best come to the point as speedily as might be he composed himself for more serious business and entered upon the pith and marrow of his negotiation  first he dwelt upon the fact that madeline bray was devoted to the support and maintenance and was a slave to every wish of her only parent who had no other friend on earth to which ralph rejoined that he had heard something of the kind before and that if she had known a little more of the world she wouldnt have been such a fool  secondly he enlarged upon the character of her father arguing that even taking it for granted that he loved her in return with the utmost affection of which he was capable yet he loved himself a great deal better which ralph said it was quite unnecessary to say anything more about as that was very natural and probable enough  and thirdly old arthur premised that the girl was a delicate and beautiful creature and that he had really a hankering to have her for his wife to this ralph deigned no other rejoinder than a harsh smile and a glance at the shrivelled old creature before him which were however sufficiently expressive  now said gride for the little plan i have in my mind to bring this about because i havent offered myself even to the father yet i should have told you but that you have gathered already ah oh dear oh dear what an edged tool you are  dont play with me then said ralph impatiently you know the proverb  a reply always on the tip of his tongue cried old arthur raising his hands and eyes in admiration he is always prepared oh dear what a blessing to have such a ready wit and so much ready money to back it then suddenly changing his tone he went on i have been backwards and forwards to brays lodgings several times within the last six months it is just half a year since i first saw this delicate morsel and oh dear what a delicate morsel it is but that is neither here nor there i am his detaining creditor for seventeen hundred pounds  you talk as if you were the only detaining creditor said ralph pulling out his pocketbook i am another for nine hundred and seventyfive pounds four and threepence  the only other mr nickleby said old arthur eagerly the only other nobody else went to the expense of lodging a detainer trusting to our holding him fast enough i warrant you we both fell into the same snare oh dear what a pitfall it was it almost ruined me and lent him our money upon bills with only one name besides his own which to be sure everybody supposed to be a good one and was as negotiable as money but which turned out you know how just as we should have come upon him he died insolvent ah it went very nigh to ruin me that loss did  go on with your scheme said ralph its of no use raising the cry of our trade just now theres nobody to hear us  its always as well to talk that way returned old arthur with a chuckle whether theres anybody to hear us or not practice makes perfect you know now if i offer myself to bray as his soninlaw upon one simple condition that the moment i am fast married he shall be quietly released and have an allowance to live just tother side the water like a gentleman he cant live long for i have asked his doctor and he declares that his complaint is one of the heart and it is impossible and if all the advantages of this condition are properly stated and dwelt upon to him do you think he could resist me and if he could not resist me do you think his daughter could resist him shouldnt i have her mrs arthur gridepretty mrs arthur gridea titbita dainty chickshouldnt i have her mrs arthur gride in a week a month a dayany time i chose to name  go on said ralph nodding his head deliberately and speaking in a tone whose studied coldness presented a strange contrast to the rapturous squeak to which his friend had gradually mounted go on you didnt come here to ask me that  oh dear how you talk cried old arthur edging himself closer still to ralph of course i didnt i dont pretend i did i came to ask what you would take from me if i prospered with the father for this debt of yours five shillings in the pound six andeightpence ten shillings i would go as far as ten for such a friend as you we have always been on such good terms but you wont be so hard upon me as that i know now will you  theres something more to be told said ralph as stony and immovable as ever  yes yes there is but you wont give me time returned arthur gride i want a backer in this matter one who can talk and urge and press a point which you can do as no man can i cant do that for i am a poor timid nervous creature now if you get a good composition for this debt which you long ago gave up for lost youll stand my friend and help me wont you  theres something more said ralph  no no indeed cried arthur gride  yes yes indeed i tell you yes said ralph  oh returned old arthur feigning to be suddenly enlightened you mean something more as concerns myself and my intention ay surely surely shall i mention that  i think you had better rejoined ralph drily  i didnt like to trouble you with that because i supposed your interest would cease with your own concern in the affair said arthur gride thats kind of you to ask oh dear how very kind of you why supposing i had a knowledge of some propertysome little propertyvery littleto which this pretty chick was entitled which nobody does or can know of at this time but which her husband could sweep into his pouch if he knew as much as i do would that account for  for the whole proceeding rejoined ralph abruptly now let me turn this matter over and consider what i ought to have if i should help you to success  but dont be hard cried old arthur raising his hands with an imploring gesture and speaking in a tremulous voice dont be too hard upon me its a very small property it is indeed say the ten shillings and well close the bargain its more than i ought to give but youre so kindshall we say the ten do now do  ralph took no notice of these supplications but sat for three or four minutes in a brown study looking thoughtfully at the person from whom they proceeded after sufficient cogitation he broke silence and it certainly could not be objected that he used any needless circumlocution or failed to speak directly to the purpose  if you married this girl without me said ralph you must pay my debt in full because you couldnt set her father free otherwise its plain then that i must have the whole amount clear of all deduction or incumbrance or i should lose from being honoured with your confidence instead of gaining by it thats the first article of the treaty for the second i shall stipulate that for my trouble in negotiation and persuasion and helping you to this fortune i have five hundred pounds thats very little because you have the ripe lips and the clustering hair and what not all to yourself for the third and last article i require that you execute a bond to me this day binding yourself in the payment of these two sums before noon of the day of your marriage with madeline bray you have told me i can urge and press a point i press this one and will take nothing less than these terms accept them if you like if not marry her without me if you can i shall still get my debt  to all entreaties protestations and offers of compromise between his own proposals and those which arthur gride had first suggested ralph was deaf as an adder he would enter into no further discussion of the subject and while old arthur dilated upon the enormity of his demands and proposed modifications of them approaching by degrees nearer and nearer to the terms he resisted sat perfectly mute looking with an air of quiet abstraction over the entries and papers in his pocketbook finding that it was impossible to make any impression upon his staunch friend arthur gride who had prepared himself for some such result before he came consented with a heavy heart to the proposed treaty and upon the spot filled up the bond required ralph kept such instruments handy after exacting the condition that mr nickleby should accompany him to brays lodgings that very hour and open the negotiation at once should circumstances appear auspicious and favourable to their designs  in pursuance of this last understanding the worthy gentlemen went out together shortly afterwards and newman noggs emerged bottle in hand from the cupboard out of the upper door of which at the imminent risk of detection he had more than once thrust his red nose when such parts of the subject were under discussion as interested him most  i have no appetite now said newman putting the flask in his pocket ive had my dinner  having delivered this observation in a very grievous and doleful tone newman reached the door in one long limp and came back again in another  i dont know who she may be or what she may be he said but i pity her with all my heart and soul and i cant help her nor can i any of the people against whom a hundred tricks but none so vile as this are plotted every day well that adds to my pain but not to theirs the thing is no worse because i know it and it tortures me as well as them gride and nickleby good pair for a curricle oh roguery roguery roguery  with these reflections and a very hard knock on the crown of his unfortunate hat at each repetition of the last word newman noggs whose brain was a little muddled by so much of the contents of the pocketpistol as had found their way there during his recent concealment went forth to seek such consolation as might be derivable from the beef and greens of some cheap eatinghouse  meanwhile the two plotters had betaken themselves to the same house whither nicholas had repaired for the first time but a few mornings before and having obtained access to mr bray and found his daughter from home had by a train of the most masterly approaches that ralphs utmost skill could frame at length laid open the real object of their visit  there he sits mr bray said ralph as the invalid not yet recovered from his surprise reclined in his chair looking alternately at him and arthur gride what if he has had the illfortune to be one cause of your detention in this place i have been another men must live you are too much a man of the world not to see that in its true light we offer the best reparation in our power reparation here is an offer of marriage that many a titled father would leap at for his child mr arthur gride with the fortune of a prince think what a haul it is  my daughter sir returned bray haughtily as i have brought her up would be a rich recompense for the largest fortune that a man could bestow in exchange for her hand  precisely what i told you said the artful ralph turning to his friend old arthur precisely what made me consider the thing so fair and easy there is no obligation on either side you have money and miss madeline has beauty and worth she has youth you have money she has not money you have not youth tit for tat quits a match of heavens own making  matches are made in heaven they say added arthur gride leering hideously at the fatherinlaw he wanted if we are married it will be destiny according to that  then think mr bray said ralph hastily substituting for this argument considerations more nearly allied to earth think what a stake is involved in the acceptance or rejection of these proposals of my friend  how can i accept or reject interrupted mr bray with an irritable consciousness that it really rested with him to decide it is for my daughter to accept or reject it is for my daughter you know that  true said ralph emphatically but you have still the power to advise to state the reasons for and against to hint a wish  to hint a wish sir returned the debtor proud and mean by turns and selfish at all times i am her father am i not why should i hint and beat about the bush do you suppose like her mothers friends and my enemiesa curse upon them allthat there is anything in what she has done for me but duty sir but duty or do you think that my having been unfortunate is a sufficient reason why our relative positions should be changed and that she should command and i should obey hint a wish too perhaps you think because you see me in this place and scarcely able to leave this chair without assistance that i am some brokenspirited dependent creature without the courage or power to do what i may think best for my own child still the power to hint a wish i hope so  pardon me returned ralph who thoroughly knew his man and had taken his ground accordingly you do not hear me out i was about to say that your hinting a wish even hinting a wish would surely be equivalent to commanding  why of course it would retorted mr bray in an exasperated tone if you dont happen to have heard of the time sir i tell you that there was a time when i carried every point in triumph against her mothers whole family although they had power and wealth on their side by my will alone  still rejoined ralph as mildly as his nature would allow him you have not heard me out you are a man yet qualified to shine in society with many years of life before you that is if you lived in freer air and under brighter skies and chose your own companions gaiety is your element you have shone in it before fashion and freedom for you france and an annuity that would support you there in luxury would give you a new lease of life would transfer you to a new existence the town rang with your expensive pleasures once and you could blaze up on a new scene again profiting by experience and living a little at others cost instead of letting others live at yours what is there on the reverse side of the picture what is there i dont know which is the nearest churchyard but a gravestone there wherever it is and a date perhaps two years hence perhaps twenty thats all  mr bray rested his elbow on the arm of his chair and shaded his face with his hand  i speak plainly said ralph sitting down beside him because i feel strongly its my interest that you should marry your daughter to my friend gride because then he sees me paidin part that is i dont disguise it i acknowledge it openly but what interest have you in recommending her to such a step keep that in view she might object remonstrate shed tears talk of his being too old and plead that her life would be rendered miserable but what is it now  several slight gestures on the part of the invalid showed that these arguments were no more lost upon him than the smallest iota of his demeanour was upon ralph  what is it now i say pursued the wily usurer or what has it a chance of being if you died indeed the people you hate would make her happy but can you bear the thought of that  no returned bray urged by a vindictive impulse he could not repress  i should imagine not indeed said ralph quietly if she profits by anybodys death this was said in a lower tone let it be by her husbands dont let her have to look back to yours as the event from which to date a happier life where is the objection let me hear it stated what is it that her suitor is an old man why how often do men of family and fortune who havent your excuse but have all the means and superfluities of life within their reach how often do they marry their daughters to old men or worse still to young men without heads or hearts to tickle some idle vanity strengthen some family interest or secure some seat in parliament judge for her sir judge for her you must know best and she will live to thank you  hush hush cried mr bray suddenly starting up and covering ralphs mouth with his trembling hand i hear her at the door  there was a gleam of conscience in the shame and terror of this hasty action which in one short moment tore the thin covering of sophistry from the cruel design and laid it bare in all its meanness and heartless deformity the father fell into his chair pale and trembling arthur gride plucked and fumbled at his hat and durst not raise his eyes from the floor even ralph crouched for the moment like a beaten hound cowed by the presence of one young innocent girl  the effect was almost as brief as sudden ralph was the first to recover himself and observing madelines looks of alarm entreated the poor girl to be composed assuring her that there was no cause for fear  a sudden spasm said ralph glancing at mr bray he is quite well now  it might have moved a very hard and worldly heart to see the young and beautiful creature whose certain misery they had been contriving but a minute before throw her arms about her fathers neck and pour forth words of tender sympathy and love the sweetest a fathers ear can know or childs lips form but ralph looked coldly on and arthur gride whose bleared eyes gloated only over the outward beauties and were blind to the spirit which reigned within evinceda fantastic kind of warmth certainly but not exactly that kind of warmth of feeling which the contemplation of virtue usually inspires  madeline said her father gently disengaging himself it was nothing  but you had that spasm yesterday and it is terrible to see you in such pain can i do nothing for you  nothing just now here are two gentlemen madeline one of whom you have seen before she used to say added mr bray addressing arthur gride that the sight of you always made me worse that was natural knowing what she did and only what she did of our connection and its results well well perhaps she may change her mind on that point girls have leave to change their minds you know you are very tired my dear  i am not indeed  indeed you are you do too much  i wish i could do more  i know you do but you overtask your strength this wretched life my love of daily labour and fatigue is more than you can bear i am sure it is poor madeline  with these and many more kind words mr bray drew his daughter to him and kissed her cheek affectionately ralph watching him sharply and closely in the meantime made his way towards the door and signed to gride to follow him  you will communicate with us again said ralph  yes yes returned mr bray hastily thrusting his daughter aside in a week give me a week  one week said ralph turning to his companion from today goodmorning miss madeline i kiss your hand  we will shake hands gride said mr bray extending his as old arthur bowed you mean well no doubt i an bound to say so now if i owed you money that was not your fault madeline my love your hand here  oh dear if the young lady would condescent only the tips of her fingers said arthur hesitating and half retreating  madeline shrunk involuntarily from the goblin figure but she placed the tips of her fingers in his hand and instantly withdrew them after an ineffectual clutch intended to detain and carry them to his lips old arthur gave his own fingers a mumbling kiss and with many amorous distortions of visage went in pursuit of his friend who was by this time in the street  what does he say what does he say what does the giant say to the pigmy inquired arthur gride hobbling up to ralph  what does the pigmy say to the giant rejoined ralph elevating his eyebrows and looking down upon his questioner  he doesnt know what to say replied arthur gride he hopes and fears but is she not a dainty morsel  i have no great taste for beauty growled ralph  but i have rejoined arthur rubbing his hands oh dear how handsome her eyes looked when she was stooping over him such long lashes such delicate fringe sheshelooked at me so soft  not overlovingly i think said ralph did she  no you think not replied old arthur but dont you think it can be brought about dont you think it can  ralph looked at him with a contemptuous frown and replied with a sneer and between his teeth  did you mark his telling her she was tired and did too much and overtasked her strength  ay ay what of it  when do you think he ever told her that before the life is more than she can bear yes yes hell change it for her  dye think its done inquired old arthur peering into his companions face with halfclosed eyes  i am sure its done said ralph he is trying to deceive himself even before our eyes already he is making believe that he thinks of her good and not his own he is acting a virtuous part and so considerate and affectionate sir that the daughter scarcely knew him i saw a tear of surprise in her eye therell be a few more tears of surprise there before long though of a different kind oh we may wait with confidence for this day week    chapter 48  being for the benefit of mr vincent crummles and positively his last appearance on this stage   it was with a very sad and heavy heart oppressed by many painful ideas that nicholas retraced his steps eastward and betook himself to the countinghouse of cheeryble brothers whatever the idle hopes he had suffered himself to entertain whatever the pleasant visions which had sprung up in his mind and grouped themselves round the fair image of madeline bray they were now dispelled and not a vestige of their gaiety and brightness remained  it would be a poor compliment to nicholass better nature and one which he was very far from deserving to insinuate that the solution and such a solution of the mystery which had seemed to surround madeline bray when he was ignorant even of her name had damped his ardour or cooled the fervour of his admiration if he had regarded her before with such a passion as young men attracted by mere beauty and elegance may entertain he was now conscious of much deeper and stronger feelings but reverence for the truth and purity of her heart respect for the helplessness and loneliness of her situation sympathy with the trials of one so young and fair and admiration of her great and noble spirit all seemed to raise her far above his reach and while they imparted new depth and dignity to his love to whisper that it was hopeless  i will keep my word as i have pledged it to her said nicholas manfully this is no common trust that i have to discharge and i will perform the double duty that is imposed upon me most scrupulously and strictly my secret feelings deserve no consideration in such a case as this and they shall have none  still there were the secret feelings in existence just the same and in secret nicholas rather encouraged them than otherwise reasoning if he reasoned at all that there they could do no harm to anybody but himself and that if he kept them to himself from a sense of duty he had an additional right to entertain himself with them as a reward for his heroism  all these thoughts coupled with what he had seen that morning and the anticipation of his next visit rendered him a very dull and abstracted companion so much so indeed that tim linkinwater suspected he must have made the mistake of a figure somewhere which was preying upon his mind and seriously conjured him if such were the case to make a clean breast and scratch it out rather than have his whole life embittered by the tortures of remorse  but in reply to these considerate representations and many others both from tim and mr frank nicholas could only be brought to state that he was never merrier in his life and so went on all day and so went towards home at night still turning over and over again the same subjects thinking over and over again the same things and arriving over and over again at the same conclusions  in this pensive wayward and uncertain state people are apt to lounge and loiter without knowing why to read placards on the walls with great attention and without the smallest idea of one word of their contents and to stare most earnestly through shopwindows at things which they dont see it was thus that nicholas found himself poring with the utmost interest over a large playbill hanging outside a minor theatre which he had to pass on his way home and reading a list of the actors and actresses who had promised to do honour to some approaching benefit with as much gravity as if it had been a catalogue of the names of those ladies and gentlemen who stood highest upon the book of fate and he had been looking anxiously for his own he glanced at the top of the bill with a smile at his own dulness as he prepared to resume his walk and there saw announced in large letters with a large space between each of them positively the last appearance of mr vincent crummles of provincial celebrity  nonsense said nicholas turning back again it cant be  but there it was in one line by itself was an announcement of the first night of a new melodrama in another line by itself was an announcement of the last six nights of an old one a third line was devoted to the reengagement of the unrivalled african knifeswallower who had kindly suffered himself to be prevailed upon to forego his country engagements for one week longer a fourth line announced that mr snittle timberry having recovered from his late severe indisposition would have the honour of appearing that evening a fifth line said that there were cheers tears and laughter every night a sixth that that was positively the last appearance of mr vincent crummles of provincial celebrity  surely it must be the same man thought nicholas there cant be two vincent crummleses  the better to settle this question he referred to the bill again and finding that there was a baron in the first piece and that roberto his son was enacted by one master crummles and spaletro his nephew by one master percy crummlestheir last appearancesand that incidental to the piece was a characteristic dance by the characters and a castanet pas seul by the infant phenomenonher last appearancehe no longer entertained any doubt and presenting himself at the stagedoor and sending in a scrap of paper with mr johnson written thereon in pencil was presently conducted by a robber with a very large belt and buckle round his waist and very large leather gauntlets on his hands into the presence of his former manager  mr crummles was unfeignedly glad to see him and starting up from before a small dressingglass with one very bushy eyebrow stuck on crooked over his left eye and the fellow eyebrow and the calf of one of his legs in his hand embraced him cordially at the same time observing that it would do mrs crummless heart good to bid him goodbye before they went  you were always a favourite of hers johnson said crummles always were from the first i was quite easy in my mind about you from that first day you dined with us one that mrs crummles took a fancy to was sure to turn out right ah johnson what a woman that is  i am sincerely obliged to her for her kindness in this and all other respects said nicholas but where are you going that you talk about bidding goodbye  havent you seen it in the papers said crummles with some dignity  no replied nicholas  i wonder at that said the manager it was among the varieties i had the paragraph here somewherebut i dont knowoh yes here it is  so saying mr crummles after pretending that he thought he must have lost it produced a square inch of newspaper from the pocket of the pantaloons he wore in private life which together with the plain clothes of several other gentlemen lay scattered about on a kind of dresser in the room and gave it to nicholas to read  the talented vincent crummles long favourably known to fame as a country manager and actor of no ordinary pretensions is about to cross the atlantic on a histrionic expedition crummles is to be accompanied we hear by his lady and gifted family we know no man superior to crummles in his particular line of character or one who whether as a public or private individual could carry with him the best wishes of a larger circle of friends crummles is certain to succeed  heres another bit said mr crummles handing over a still smaller scrap this is from the notices to correspondents this one  nicholas read it aloud philodramaticus crummles the country manager and actor cannot be more than fortythree or fortyfour years of age crummles is not a prussian having been born at chelsea humph said nicholas thats an odd paragraph  very returned crummles scratching the side of his nose and looking at nicholas with an assumption of great unconcern i cant think who puts these things in i didnt  still keeping his eye on nicholas mr crummles shook his head twice or thrice with profound gravity and remarking that he could not for the life of him imagine how the newspapers found out the things they did folded up the extracts and put them in his pocket again  i am astonished to hear this news said nicholas going to america you had no such thing in contemplation when i was with you  no replied crummles i hadnt then the fact is that mrs crummlesmost extraordinary woman johnson here he broke off and whispered something in his ear  oh said nicholas smiling the prospect of an addition to your family  the seventh addition johnson returned mr crummles solemnly i thought such a child as the phenomenon must have been a closer but it seems we are to have another she is a very remarkable woman  i congratulate you said nicholas and i hope this may prove a phenomenon too  why its pretty sure to be something uncommon i suppose rejoined mr crummles the talent of the other three is principally in combat and serious pantomime i should like this one to have a turn for juvenile tragedy i understand they want something of that sort in america very much however we must take it as it comes perhaps it may have a genius for the tightrope it may have any sort of genius in short if it takes after its mother johnson for she is an universal genius but whatever its genius is that genius shall be developed  expressing himself after these terms mr crummles put on his other eyebrow and the calves of his legs and then put on his legs which were of a yellowish fleshcolour and rather soiled about the knees from frequent going down upon those joints in curses prayers last struggles and other strong passages  while the exmanager completed his toilet he informed nicholas that as he should have a fair start in america from the proceeds of a tolerably good engagement which he had been fortunate enough to obtain and as he and mrs crummles could scarcely hope to act for ever not being immortal except in the breath of fame and in a figurative sense he had made up his mind to settle there permanently in the hope of acquiring some land of his own which would support them in their old age and which they could afterwards bequeath to their children nicholas having highly commended the resolution mr crummles went on to impart such further intelligence relative to their mutual friends as he thought might prove interesting informing nicholas among other things that miss snevellicci was happily married to an affluent young waxchandler who had supplied the theatre with candles and that mr lillyvick didnt dare to say his soul was his own such was the tyrannical sway of mrs lillyvick who reigned paramount and supreme  nicholas responded to this confidence on the part of mr crummles by confiding to him his own name situation and prospects and informing him in as few general words as he could of the circumstances which had led to their first acquaintance after congratulating him with great heartiness on the improved state of his fortunes mr crummles gave him to understand that next morning he and his were to start for liverpool where the vessel lay which was to carry them from the shores of england and that if nicholas wished to take a last adieu of mrs crummles he must repair with him that night to a farewell supper given in honour of the family at a neighbouring tavern at which mr snittle timberry would preside while the honours of the vicechair would be sustained by the african swallower  the room being by this time very warm and somewhat crowded in consequence of the influx of four gentlemen who had just killed each other in the piece under representation nicholas accepted the invitation and promised to return at the conclusion of the performances preferring the cool air and twilight out of doors to the mingled perfume of gas orangepeel and gunpowder which pervaded the hot and glaring theatre  he availed himself of this interval to buy a silver snuffboxthe best his funds would affordas a token of remembrance for mr crummles and having purchased besides a pair of earrings for mrs crummles a necklace for the phenomenon and a flaming shirtpin for each of the young gentlemen he refreshed himself with a walk and returning a little after the appointed time found the lights out the theatre empty the curtain raised for the night and mr crummles walking up and down the stage expecting his arrival  timberry wont be long said mr crummles he played the audience out tonight he does a faithful black in the last piece and it takes him a little longer to wash himself  a very unpleasant line of character i should think said nicholas  no i dont know replied mr crummles it comes off easily enough and theres only the face and neck we had a firsttragedy man in our company once who when he played othello used to black himself all over but thats feeling a part and going into it as if you meant it it isnt usual mores the pity  mr snittle timberry now appeared arminarm with the african swallower and being introduced to nicholas raised his hat half a foot and said he was proud to know him the swallower said the same and looked and spoke remarkably like an irishman  i see by the bills that you have been ill sir said nicholas to mr timberry i hope you are none the worse for your exertions tonight  mr timberry in reply shook his head with a gloomy air tapped his chest several times with great significancy and drawing his cloak more closely about him said but no matter no matter come  it is observable that when people upon the stage are in any strait involving the very last extremity of weakness and exhaustion they invariably perform feats of strength requiring great ingenuity and muscular power thus a wounded prince or bandit chief who is bleeding to death and too faint to move except to the softest music and then only upon his hands and knees shall be seen to approach a cottage door for aid in such a series of writhings and twistings and with such curlings up of the legs and such rollings over and over and such gettings up and tumblings down again as could never be achieved save by a very strong man skilled in posturemaking and so natural did this sort of performance come to mr snittle timberry that on their way out of the theatre and towards the tavern where the supper was to be holden he testified the severity of his recent indisposition and its wasting effects upon the nervous system by a series of gymnastic performances which were the admiration of all witnesses  why this is indeed a joy i had not looked for said mrs crummles when nicholas was presented  nor i replied nicholas it is by a mere chance that i have this opportunity of seeing you although i would have made a great exertion to have availed myself of it  here is one whom you know said mrs crummles thrusting forward the phenomenon in a blue gauze frock extensively flounced and trousers of the same and here anotherand another presenting the master crummleses and how is your friend the faithful digby  digby said nicholas forgetting at the instant that this had been smikes theatrical name oh yes hes quitewhat am i sayinghe is very far from well  how exclaimed mrs crummles with a tragic recoil  i fear said nicholas shaking his head and making an attempt to smile that your betterhalf would be more struck with him now than ever  what mean you rejoined mrs crummles in her most popular manner whence comes this altered tone  i mean that a dastardly enemy of mine has struck at me through him and that while he thinks to torture me he inflicts on him such agonies of terror and suspense asyou will excuse me i am sure said nicholas checking himself i should never speak of this and never do except to those who know the facts but for a moment i forgot myself  with this hasty apology nicholas stooped down to salute the phenomenon and changed the subject inwardly cursing his precipitation and very much wondering what mrs crummles must think of so sudden an explosion  that lady seemed to think very little about it for the supper being by this time on table she gave her hand to nicholas and repaired with a stately step to the left hand of mr snittle timberry nicholas had the honour to support her and mr crummles was placed upon the chairmans right the phenomenon and the master crummleses sustained the vice  the company amounted in number to some twentyfive or thirty being composed of such members of the theatrical profession then engaged or disengaged in london as were numbered among the most intimate friends of mr and mrs crummles the ladies and gentlemen were pretty equally balanced the expenses of the entertainment being defrayed by the latter each of whom had the privilege of inviting one of the former as his guest  it was upon the whole a very distinguished party for independently of the lesser theatrical lights who clustered on this occasion round mr snittle timberry there was a literary gentleman present who had dramatised in his time two hundred and fortyseven novels as fast as they had come outsome of them faster than they had come outand who was a literary gentleman in consequence  this gentleman sat on the left hand of nicholas to whom he was introduced by his friend the african swallower from the bottom of the table with a high eulogium upon his fame and reputation  i am happy to know a gentleman of such great distinction said nicholas politely  sir replied the wit youre very welcome im sure the honour is reciprocal sir as i usually say when i dramatise a book did you ever hear a definition of fame sir  i have heard several replied nicholas with a smile what is yours  when i dramatise a book sir said the literary gentleman thats fame for its author  oh indeed rejoined nicholas  thats fame sir said the literary gentleman  so richard turpin tom king and jerry abershaw have handed down to fame the names of those on whom they committed their most impudent robberies said nicholas  i dont know anything about that sir answered the literary gentleman  shakespeare dramatised stories which had previously appeared in print it is true observed nicholas  meaning bill sir said the literary gentleman so he did bill was an adapter certainly so he wasand very well he adapted tooconsidering  i was about to say rejoined nicholas that shakespeare derived some of his plots from old tales and legends in general circulation but it seems to me that some of the gentlemen of your craft at the present day have shot very far beyond him  youre quite right sir interrupted the literary gentleman leaning back in his chair and exercising his toothpick human intellect sir has progressed since his time is progressing will progress  shot beyond him i mean resumed nicholas in quite another respect for whereas he brought within the magic circle of his genius traditions peculiarly adapted for his purpose and turned familiar things into constellations which should enlighten the world for ages you drag within the magic circle of your dulness subjects not at all adapted to the purposes of the stage and debase as he exalted for instance you take the uncompleted books of living authors fresh from their hands wet from the press cut hack and carve them to the powers and capacities of your actors and the capability of your theatres finish unfinished works hastily and crudely vamp up ideas not yet worked out by their original projector but which have doubtless cost him many thoughtful days and sleepless nights by a comparison of incidents and dialogue down to the very last word he may have written a fortnight before do your utmost to anticipate his plotall this without his permission and against his will and then to crown the whole proceeding publish in some mean pamphlet an unmeaning farrago of garbled extracts from his work to which your name as author with the honourable distinction annexed of having perpetrated a hundred other outrages of the same description now show me the distinction between such pilfering as this and picking a mans pocket in the street unless indeed it be that the legislature has a regard for pockethandkerchiefs and leaves mens brains except when they are knocked out by violence to take care of themselves  men must live sir said the literary gentleman shrugging his shoulders  that would be an equally fair plea in both cases replied nicholas but if you put it upon that ground i have nothing more to say than that if i were a writer of books and you a thirsty dramatist i would rather pay your tavern score for six months large as it might be than have a niche in the temple of fame with you for the humblest corner of my pedestal through six hundred generations  the conversation threatened to take a somewhat angry tone when it had arrived thus far but mrs crummles opportunely interposed to prevent its leading to any violent outbreak by making some inquiries of the literary gentleman relative to the plots of the six new pieces which he had written by contract to introduce the african knifeswallower in his various unrivalled performances this speedily engaged him in an animated conversation with that lady in the interest of which all recollection of his recent discussion with nicholas very quickly evaporated  the board being now clear of the more substantial articles of food and punch wine and spirits being placed upon it and handed about the guests who had been previously conversing in little groups of three or four gradually fell off into a dead silence while the majority of those present glanced from time to time at mr snittle timberry and the bolder spirits did not even hesitate to strike the table with their knuckles and plainly intimate their expectations by uttering such encouragements as now tim wake up mr chairman all charged sir and waiting for a toast and so forth  to these remonstrances mr timberry deigned no other rejoinder than striking his chest and gasping for breath and giving many other indications of being still the victim of indispositionfor a man must not make himself too cheap either on the stage or offwhile mr crummles who knew full well that he would be the subject of the forthcoming toast sat gracefully in his chair with his arm thrown carelessly over the back and now and then lifted his glass to his mouth and drank a little punch with the same air with which he was accustomed to take long draughts of nothing out of the pasteboard goblets in banquet scenes  at length mr snittle timberry rose in the most approved attitude with one hand in the breast of his waistcoat and the other on the nearest snuffbox and having been received with great enthusiasm proposed with abundance of quotations his friend mr vincent crummles ending a pretty long speech by extending his right hand on one side and his left on the other and severally calling upon mr and mrs crummles to grasp the same this done mr vincent crummles returned thanks and that done the african swallower proposed mrs vincent crummles in affecting terms then were heard loud moans and sobs from mrs crummles and the ladies despite of which that heroic woman insisted upon returning thanks herself which she did in a manner and in a speech which has never been surpassed and seldom equalled it then became the duty of mr snittle timberry to give the young crummleses which he did after which mr vincent crummles as their father addressed the company in a supplementary speech enlarging on their virtues amiabilities and excellences and wishing that they were the sons and daughter of every lady and gentleman present these solemnities having been succeeded by a decent interval enlivened by musical and other entertainments mr crummles proposed that ornament of the profession the african swallower his very dear friend if he would allow him to call him so which liberty there being no particular reason why he should not allow it the african swallower graciously permitted the literary gentleman was then about to be drunk but it being discovered that he had been drunk for some time in another acceptation of the term and was then asleep on the stairs the intention was abandoned and the honour transferred to the ladies finally after a very long sitting mr snittle timberry vacated the chair and the company with many adieux and embraces dispersed  nicholas waited to the last to give his little presents when he had said goodbye all round and came to mr crummles he could not but mark the difference between their present separation and their parting at portsmouth not a jot of his theatrical manner remained he put out his hand with an air which if he could have summoned it at will would have made him the best actor of his day in homely parts and when nicholas shook it with the warmth he honestly felt appeared thoroughly melted  we were a very happy little company johnson said poor crummles you and i never had a word i shall be very glad tomorrow morning to think that i saw you again but now i almost wish you hadnt come  nicholas was about to return a cheerful reply when he was greatly disconcerted by the sudden apparition of mrs grudden who it seemed had declined to attend the supper in order that she might rise earlier in the morning and who now burst out of an adjoining bedroom habited in very extraordinary white robes and throwing her arms about his neck hugged him with great affection  what are you going too said nicholas submitting with as good a grace as if she had been the finest young creature in the world  going returned mrs grudden lord ha mercy what do you think theyd do without me  nicholas submitted to another hug with even a better grace than before if that were possible and waving his hat as cheerfully as he could took farewell of the vincent crummleses    chapter 49  chronicles the further proceedings of the nickleby family and the sequel of the adventure of the gentleman in the smallclothes   while nicholas absorbed in the one engrossing subject of interest which had recently opened upon him occupied his leisure hours with thoughts of madeline bray and in execution of the commissions which the anxiety of brother charles in her behalf imposed upon him saw her again and again and each time with greater danger to his peace of mind and a more weakening effect upon the lofty resolutions he had formed mrs nickleby and kate continued to live in peace and quiet agitated by no other cares than those which were connected with certain harassing proceedings taken by mr snawley for the recovery of his son and their anxiety for smike himself whose health long upon the wane began to be so much affected by apprehension and uncertainty as sometimes to occasion both them and nicholas considerable uneasiness and even alarm  it was no complaint or murmur on the part of the poor fellow himself that thus disturbed them ever eager to be employed in such slight services as he could render and always anxious to repay his benefactors with cheerful and happy looks less friendly eyes might have seen in him no cause for any misgiving but there were times and often too when the sunken eye was too bright the hollow cheek too flushed the breath too thick and heavy in its course the frame too feeble and exhausted to escape their regard and notice  there is a dread disease which so prepares its victim as it were for death which so refines it of its grosser aspect and throws around familiar looks unearthly indications of the coming change a dread disease in which the struggle between soul and body is so gradual quiet and solemn and the result so sure that day by day and grain by grain the mortal part wastes and withers away so that the spirit grows light and sanguine with its lightening load and feeling immortality at hand deems it but a new term of mortal life a disease in which death and life are so strangely blended that death takes the glow and hue of life and life the gaunt and grisly form of death a disease which medicine never cured wealth never warded off or poverty could boast exemption from which sometimes moves in giant strides and sometimes at a tardy sluggish pace but slow or quick is ever sure and certain  it was with some faint reference in his own mind to this disorder though he would by no means admit it even to himself that nicholas had already carried his faithful companion to a physician of great repute there was no cause for immediate alarm he said there were no present symptoms which could be deemed conclusive the constitution had been greatly tried and injured in childhood but still it might not beand that was all  but he seemed to grow no worse and as it was not difficult to find a reason for these symptoms of illness in the shock and agitation he had recently undergone nicholas comforted himself with the hope that his poor friend would soon recover this hope his mother and sister shared with him and as the object of their joint solicitude seemed to have no uneasiness or despondency for himself but each day answered with a quiet smile that he felt better than he had upon the day before their fears abated and the general happiness was by degrees restored  many and many a time in after years did nicholas look back to this period of his life and tread again the humble quiet homely scenes that rose up as of old before him many and many a time in the twilight of a summer evening or beside the flickering winters firebut not so often or so sadly thenwould his thoughts wander back to these old days and dwell with a pleasant sorrow upon every slight remembrance which they brought crowding home the little room in which they had so often sat long after it was dark figuring such happy futures kates cheerful voice and merry laugh how if she were from home they used to sit and watch for her return scarcely breaking silence but to say how dull it seemed without her the glee with which poor smike would start from the darkened corner where he used to sit and hurry to admit her and the tears they often saw upon his face half wondering to see them too and he so pleased and happy every little incident and even slight words and looks of those old days little heeded then but well remembered when busy cares and trials were quite forgotten came fresh and thick before him many and many a time and rustling above the dusty growth of years came back green boughs of yesterday  but there were other persons associated with these recollections and many changes came about before they had being a necessary reflection for the purposes of these adventures which at once subside into their accustomed train and shunning all flighty anticipations or wayward wanderings pursue their steady and decorous course  if the brothers cheeryble as they found nicholas worthy of trust and confidence bestowed upon him every day some new and substantial mark of kindness they were not less mindful of those who depended on him various little presents to mrs nickleby always of the very things they most required tended in no slight degree to the improvement and embellishment of the cottage kates little store of trinkets became quite dazzling and for company if brother charles and brother ned failed to look in for at least a few minutes every sunday or one evening in the week there was mr tim linkinwater who had never made halfadozen other acquaintances in all his life and who took such delight in his new friends as no words can express constantly coming and going in his evening walks and stopping to rest while mr frank cheeryble happened by some strange conjunction of circumstances to be passing the door on some business or other at least three nights in the week  he is the most attentive young man i ever saw kate said mrs nickleby to her daughter one evening when this lastnamed gentleman had been the subject of the worthy ladys eulogium for some time and kate had sat perfectly silent  attentive mama rejoined kate  bless my heart kate cried mrs nickleby with her wonted suddenness what a colour you have got why youre quite flushed  oh mama what strange things you fancy  it wasnt fancy kate my dear im certain of that returned her mother however its gone now at any rate so it dont much matter whether it was or not what was it we were talking about oh mr frank i never saw such attention in my life never  surely you are not serious returned kate colouring again and this time beyond all dispute  not serious returned mrs nickleby why shouldnt i be serious im sure i never was more serious i will say that his politeness and attention to me is one of the most becoming gratifying pleasant things i have seen for a very long time you dont often meet with such behaviour in young men and it strikes one more when one does meet with it  oh attention to you mama rejoined kate quicklyoh yes  dear me kate retorted mrs nickleby what an extraordinary girl you are was it likely i should be talking of his attention to anybody else i declare im quite sorry to think he should be in love with a german lady that i am  he said very positively that it was no such thing mama returned kate dont you remember his saying so that very first night he came here besides she added in a more gentle tone why should we be sorry if it is the case what is it to us mama  nothing to us kate perhaps said mrs nickleby emphatically but something to me i confess i like english people to be thorough english people and not half english and half i dont know what i shall tell him pointblank next time he comes that i wish he would marry one of his own countrywomen and see what he says to that  pray dont think of such a thing mama returned kate hastily not for the world consider how very  well my dear how very what said mrs nickleby opening her eyes in great astonishment  before kate had returned any reply a queer little double knock announced that miss la creevy had called to see them and when miss la creevy presented herself mrs nickleby though strongly disposed to be argumentative on the previous question forgot all about it in a gush of supposes about the coach she had come by supposing that the man who drove must have been either the man in the shirtsleeves or the man with the black eye that whoever he was he hadnt found that parasol she left inside last week that no doubt they had stopped a long while at the halfway house coming down or that perhaps being full they had come straight on and lastly that they surely must have passed nicholas on the road  i saw nothing of him answered miss la creevy but i saw that dear old soul mr linkinwater  taking his evening walk and coming on to rest here before he turns back to the city ill be bound said mrs nickleby  i should think he was returned miss la creevy especially as young mr cheeryble was with him  surely that is no reason why mr linkinwater should be coming here said kate  why i think it is my dear said miss la creevy for a young man mr frank is not a very great walker and i observe that he generally falls tired and requires a good long rest when he has come as far as this but where is my friend said the little woman looking about after having glanced slyly at kate he has not been run away with again has he  ah where is mr smike said mrs nickleby he was here this instant  upon further inquiry it turned out to the good ladys unbounded astonishment that smike had that moment gone upstairs to bed  well now said mrs nickleby he is the strangest creature last tuesdaywas it tuesday yes to be sure it was you recollect kate my dear the very last time young mr cheeryble was herelast tuesday night he went off in just the same strange way at the very moment the knock came to the door it cannot be that he dont like company because he is always fond of people who are fond of nicholas and i am sure young mr cheeryble is and the strangest thing is that he does not go to bed therefore it cannot be because he is tired i know he doesnt go to bed because my room is the next one and when i went upstairs last tuesday hours after him i found that he had not even taken his shoes off and he had no candle so he must have sat moping in the dark all the time now upon my word said mrs nickleby when i come to think of it thats very extraordinary  as the hearers did not echo this sentiment but remained profoundly silent either as not knowing what to say or as being unwilling to interrupt mrs nickleby pursued the thread of her discourse after her own fashion  i hope said that lady that this unaccountable conduct may not be the beginning of his taking to his bed and living there all his life like the thirsty woman of tutbury or the cocklane ghost or some of those extraordinary creatures one of them had some connection with our family i forget without looking back to some old letters i have upstairs whether it was my greatgrandfather who went to school with the cocklane ghost or the thirsty woman of tutbury who went to school with my grandmother miss la creevy you know of course which was it that didnt mind what the clergyman said the cocklane ghost or the thirsty woman of tutbury  the cocklane ghost i believe  then i have no doubt said mrs nickleby that it was with him my greatgrandfather went to school for i know the master of his school was a dissenter and that would in a great measure account for the cocklane ghosts behaving in such an improper manner to the clergyman when he grew up ah train up a ghostchild i mean  any further reflections on this fruitful theme were abruptly cut short by the arrival of tim linkinwater and mr frank cheeryble in the hurry of receiving whom mrs nickleby speedily lost sight of everything else  i am so sorry nicholas is not at home said mrs nickleby kate my dear you must be both nicholas and yourself  miss nickleby need be but herself said frank iif i may venture to say sooppose all change in her  then at all events she shall press you to stay returned mrs nickleby mr linkinwater says ten minutes but i cannot let you go so soon nicholas would be very much vexed i am sure kate my dear  in obedience to a great number of nods and winks and frowns of extra significance kate added her entreaties that the visitors would remain but it was observable that she addressed them exclusively to tim linkinwater and there was besides a certain embarrassment in her manner which although it was as far from impairing its graceful character as the tinge it communicated to her cheek was from diminishing her beauty was obvious at a glance even to mrs nickleby not being of a very speculative character however save under circumstances when her speculations could be put into words and uttered aloud that discreet matron attributed the emotion to the circumstance of her daughters not happening to have her best frock on though i never saw her look better certainly she reflected at the same time having settled the question in this way and being most complacently satisfied that in this and in all other instances her conjecture could not fail to be the right one mrs nickleby dismissed it from her thoughts and inwardly congratulated herself on being so shrewd and knowing  nicholas did not come home nor did smike reappear but neither circumstance to say the truth had any great effect upon the little party who were all in the best humour possible indeed there sprung up quite a flirtation between miss la creevy and tim linkinwater who said a thousand jocose and facetious things and became by degrees quite gallant not to say tender little miss la creevy on her part was in high spirits and rallied tim on having remained a bachelor all his life with so much success that tim was actually induced to declare that if he could get anybody to have him he didnt know but what he might change his condition even yet miss la creevy earnestly recommended a lady she knew who would exactly suit mr linkinwater and had a very comfortable property of her own but this latter qualification had very little effect upon tim who manfully protested that fortune would be no object with him but that true worth and cheerfulness of disposition were what a man should look for in a wife and that if he had these he could find money enough for the moderate wants of both this avowal was considered so honourable to tim that neither mrs nickleby nor miss la creevy could sufficiently extol it and stimulated by their praises tim launched out into several other declarations also manifesting the disinterestedness of his heart and a great devotion to the fair sex which were received with no less approbation this was done and said with a comical mixture of jest and earnest and leading to a great amount of laughter made them very merry indeed  kate was commonly the life and soul of the conversation at home but she was more silent than usual upon this occasion perhaps because tim and miss la creevy engrossed so much of it and keeping aloof from the talkers sat at the window watching the shadows as the evening closed in and enjoying the quiet beauty of the night which seemed to have scarcely less attractions to frank who first lingered near and then sat down beside her no doubt there are a great many things to be said appropriate to a summer evening and no doubt they are best said in a low voice as being most suitable to the peace and serenity of the hour long pauses too at times and then an earnest word or so and then another interval of silence which somehow does not seem like silence either and perhaps now and then a hasty turning away of the head or drooping of the eyes towards the ground all these minor circumstances with a disinclination to have candles introduced and a tendency to confuse hours with minutes are doubtless mere influences of the time as many lovely lips can clearly testify neither is there the slightest reason why mrs nickleby should have expressed surprise when candles being at length brought in kates bright eyes were unable to bear the light which obliged her to avert her face and even to leave the room for some short time because when one has sat in the dark so long candles are dazzling and nothing can be more strictly natural than that such results should be produced as all wellinformed young people know for that matter old people know it too or did know it once but they forget these things sometimes and mores the pity  the good ladys surprise however did not end here it was greatly increased when it was discovered that kate had not the least appetite for supper a discovery so alarming that there is no knowing in what unaccountable efforts of oratory mrs nicklebys apprehensions might have been vented if the general attention had not been attracted at the moment by a very strange and uncommon noise proceeding as the pale and trembling servant girl affirmed and as everybodys sense of hearing seemed to affirm also right down the chimney of the adjoining room  it being quite plain to the comprehension of all present that however extraordinary and improbable it might appear the noise did nevertheless proceed from the chimney in question and the noise which was a strange compound of various shuffling sliding rumbling and struggling sounds all muffled by the chimney still continuing frank cheeryble caught up a candle and tim linkinwater the tongs and they would have very quickly ascertained the cause of this disturbance if mrs nickleby had not been taken very faint and declined being left behind on any account this produced a short remonstrance which terminated in their all proceeding to the troubled chamber in a body excepting only miss la creevy who as the servant girl volunteered a confession of having been subject to fits in her infancy remained with her to give the alarm and apply restoratives in case of extremity  advancing to the door of the mysterious apartment they were not a little surprised to hear a human voice chanting with a highly elaborated expression of melancholy and in tones of suffocation which a human voice might have produced from under five or six featherbeds of the best quality the once popular air of has she then failed in her truth the beautiful maid i adore nor on bursting into the room without demanding a parley was their astonishment lessened by the discovery that these romantic sounds certainly proceeded from the throat of some man up the chimney of whom nothing was visible but a pair of legs which were dangling above the grate apparently feeling with extreme anxiety for the top bar whereon to effect a landing  a sight so unusual and unbusinesslike as this completely paralysed tim linkinwater who after one or two gentle pinches at the strangers ankles which were productive of no effect stood clapping the tongs together as if he were sharpening them for another assault and did nothing else  this must be some drunken fellow said frank no thief would announce his presence thus  as he said this with great indignation he raised the candle to obtain a better view of the legs and was darting forward to pull them down with very little ceremony when mrs nickleby clasping her hands uttered a sharp sound something between a scream and an exclamation and demanded to know whether the mysterious limbs were not clad in smallclothes and grey worsted stockings or whether her eyes had deceived her  yes cried frank looking a little closer smallclothes certainly andandrough grey stockings too do you know him maam  kate my dear said mrs nickleby deliberately sitting herself down in a chair with that sort of desperate resignation which seemed to imply that now matters had come to a crisis and all disguise was useless you will have the goodness my love to explain precisely how this matter stands i have given him no encouragementnone whatevernot the least in the world you know that my dear perfectly well he was very respectful exceedingly respectful when he declared as you were a witness to still at the same time if i am to be persecuted in this way if vegetable whatshisnames and all kinds of gardenstuff are to strew my path out of doors and gentlemen are to come choking up our chimneys at home i really dont knowupon my word i do not knowwhat is to become of me its a very hard caseharder than anything i was ever exposed to before i married your poor dear papa though i suffered a good deal of annoyance thenbut that of course i expected and made up my mind for when i was not nearly so old as you my dear there was a young gentleman who sat next us at church who used almost every sunday to cut my name in large letters in the front of his pew while the sermon was going on it was gratifying of course naturally so but still it was an annoyance because the pew was in a very conspicuous place and he was several times publicly taken out by the beadle for doing it but that was nothing to this this is a great deal worse and a great deal more embarrassing i would rather kate my dear said mrs nickleby with great solemnity and an effusion of tears i would rather i declare have been a pigfaced lady than be exposed to such a life as this  frank cheeryble and tim linkinwater looked in irrepressible astonishment first at each other and then at kate who felt that some explanation was necessary but who between her terror at the apparition of the legs her fear lest their owner should be smothered and her anxiety to give the least ridiculous solution of the mystery that it was capable of bearing was quite unable to utter a single word  he gives me great pain continued mrs nickleby drying her eyes great pain but dont hurt a hair of his head i beg on no account hurt a hair of his head  it would not under existing circumstances have been quite so easy to hurt a hair of the gentlemans head as mrs nickleby seemed to imagine inasmuch as that part of his person was some feet up the chimney which was by no means a wide one but as all this time he had never left off singing about the bankruptcy of the beautiful maid in respect of truth and now began not only to croak very feebly but to kick with great violence as if respiration became a task of difficulty frank cheeryble without further hesitation pulled at the shorts and worsteds with such heartiness as to bring him floundering into the room with greater precipitation than he had quite calculated upon  oh yes yes said kate directly the whole figure of this singular visitor appeared in this abrupt manner i know who it is pray dont be rough with him is he hurt i hope not oh pray see if he is hurt  he is not i assure you replied frank handling the object of his surprise after this appeal with sudden tenderness and respect he is not hurt in the least  dont let him come any nearer said kate retiring as far as she could  oh no he shall not rejoined frank you see i have him secure here but may i ask you what this means and whether you expected this old gentleman  oh no said kate of course not but hemama does not think so i believebut he is a mad gentleman who has escaped from the next house and must have found an opportunity of secreting himself here  kate interposed mrs nickleby with severe dignity i am surprised at you  dear mama kate gently remonstrated  i am surprised at you repeated mrs nickleby upon my word kate i am quite astonished that you should join the persecutors of this unfortunate gentleman when you know very well that they have the basest designs upon his property and that that is the whole secret of it it would be much kinder of you kate to ask mr linkinwater or mr cheeryble to interfere in his behalf and see him righted you ought not to allow your feelings to influence you its not right very far from it what should my feelings be do you suppose if anybody ought to be indignant who is it i of course and very properly so still at the same time i wouldnt commit such an injustice for the world no continued mrs nickleby drawing herself up and looking another way with a kind of bashful stateliness this gentleman will understand me when i tell him that i repeat the answer i gave him the other day that i always will repeat it though i do believe him to be sincere when i find him placing himself in such dreadful situations on my account and that i request him to have the goodness to go away directly or it will be impossible to keep his behaviour a secret from my son nicholas i am obliged to him very much obliged to him but i cannot listen to his addresses for a moment its quite impossible  while this address was in course of delivery the old gentleman with his nose and cheeks embellished with large patches of soot sat upon the ground with his arms folded eyeing the spectators in profound silence and with a very majestic demeanour he did not appear to take the smallest notice of what mrs nickleby said but when she ceased to speak he honoured her with a long stare and inquired if she had quite finished  i have nothing more to say replied that lady modestly i really cannot say anything more  very good said the old gentleman raising his voice then bring in the bottled lightning a clean tumbler and a corkscrew  nobody executing this order the old gentleman after a short pause raised his voice again and demanded a thunder sandwich this article not being forthcoming either he requested to be served with a fricassee of boottops and goldfish sauce and then laughing heartily gratified his hearers with a very long very loud and most melodious bellow  but still mrs nickleby in reply to the significant looks of all about her shook her head as though to assure them that she saw nothing whatever in all this unless indeed it were a slight degree of eccentricity she might have remained impressed with these opinions down to the latest moment of her life but for a slight train of circumstances which trivial as they were altered the whole complexion of the case  it happened that miss la creevy finding her patient in no very threatening condition and being strongly impelled by curiosity to see what was going forward bustled into the room while the old gentleman was in the very act of bellowing it happened too that the instant the old gentleman saw her he stopped short skipped suddenly on his feet and fell to kissing his hand violently a change of demeanour which almost terrified the little portrait painter out of her senses and caused her to retreat behind tim linkinwater with the utmost expedition  aha cried the old gentleman folding his hands and squeezing them with great force against each other i see her now i see her now my love my life my bride my peerless beauty she is come at lastat lastand all is gas and gaiters  mrs nickleby looked rather disconcerted for a moment but immediately recovering nodded to miss la creevy and the other spectators several times and frowned and smiled gravely giving them to understand that she saw where the mistake was and would set it all to rights in a minute or two  she is come said the old gentleman laying his hand upon his heart cormoran and blunderbore she is come all the wealth i have is hers if she will take me for her slave where are grace beauty and blandishments like those in the empress of madagascar no in the queen of diamonds no in mrs rowland who every morning bathes in kalydor for nothing no melt all these down into one with the three graces the nine muses and fourteen biscuitbakers daughters from oxford street and make a woman half as lovely pho i defy you  after uttering this rhapsody the old gentleman snapped his fingers twenty or thirty times and then subsided into an ecstatic contemplation of miss la creevys charms this affording mrs nickleby a favourable opportunity of explanation she went about it straight  i am sure said the worthy lady with a prefatory cough that its a great relief under such trying circumstances as these to have anybody else mistaken for mea very great relief and its a circumstance that never occurred before although i have several times been mistaken for my daughter kate i have no doubt the people were very foolish and perhaps ought to have known better but still they did take me for her and of course that was no fault of mine and it would be very hard indeed if i was to be made responsible for it however in this instance of course i must feel that i should do exceedingly wrong if i suffered anybodyespecially anybody that i am under great obligations toto be made uncomfortable on my account and therefore i think it my duty to tell that gentleman that he is mistaken that i am the lady who he was told by some impertinent person was niece to the council of pavingstones and that i do beg and entreat of him to go quietly away if its only for here mrs nickleby simpered and hesitated for my sake  it might have been expected that the old gentleman would have been penetrated to the heart by the delicacy and condescension of this appeal and that he would at least have returned a courteous and suitable reply what then was the shock which mrs nickleby received when accosting her in the most unmistakable manner he replied in a loud and sonourous voice avaunt cat  sir cried mrs nickleby in a faint tone  cat repeated the old gentleman puss kit tit grimalkin tabby brindle whoosh with which last sound uttered in a hissing manner between his teeth the old gentleman swung his arms violently round and round and at the same time alternately advanced on mrs nickleby and retreated from her in that species of savage dance with which boys on marketdays may be seen to frighten pigs sheep and other animals when they give out obstinate indications of turning down a wrong street  mrs nickleby wasted no words but uttered an exclamation of horror and surprise and immediately fainted away  ill attend to mama said kate hastily i am not at all frightened but pray take him away pray take him away  frank was not at all confident of his power of complying with this request until he bethought himself of the stratagem of sending miss la creevy on a few paces in advance and urging the old gentleman to follow her it succeeded to a miracle and he went away in a rapture of admiration strongly guarded by tim linkinwater on one side and frank himself on the other  kate murmured mrs nickleby reviving when the coast was clear is he gone  she was assured that he was  i shall never forgive myself kate said mrs nickleby never that gentleman has lost his senses and i am the unhappy cause  you the cause said kate greatly astonished  i my love replied mrs nickleby with a desperate calmness you saw what he was the other day you see what he is now i told your brother weeks and weeks ago kate that i hoped a disappointment might not be too much for him you see what a wreck he is making allowance for his being a little flighty you know how rationally and sensibly and honourably he talked when we saw him in the garden you have heard the dreadful nonsense he has been guilty of this night and the manner in which he has gone on with that poor unfortunate little old maid can anybody doubt how all this has been brought about  i should scarcely think they could said kate mildly  i should scarcely think so either rejoined her mother well if i am the unfortunate cause of this i have the satisfaction of knowing that i am not to blame i told nicholas i said to him nicholas my dear we should be very careful how we proceed he would scarcely hear me if the matter had only been properly taken up at first as i wished it to be but you are both of you so like your poor papa however i have my consolation and that should be enough for me  washing her hands thus of all responsibility under this head past present or to come mrs nickleby kindly added that she hoped her children might never have greater cause to reproach themselves than she had and prepared herself to receive the escort who soon returned with the intelligence that the old gentleman was safely housed and that they found his custodians who had been making merry with some friends wholly ignorant of his absence  quiet being again restored a delicious halfhourso frank called it in the course of subsequent conversation with tim linkinwater as they were walking homewas spent in conversation and tims watch at length apprising him that it was high time to depart the ladies were left alone though not without many offers on the part of frank to remain until nicholas arrived no matter what hour of the night it might be if after the late neighbourly irruption they entertained the least fear of being left to themselves as their freedom from all further apprehension however left no pretext for his insisting on mounting guard he was obliged to abandon the citadel and to retire with the trusty tim  nearly three hours of silence passed away kate blushed to find when nicholas returned how long she had been sitting alone occupied with her own thoughts  i really thought it had not been half an hour she said  they must have been pleasant thoughts kate rejoined nicholas gaily to make time pass away like that what were they now  kate was confused she toyed with some trifle on the table looked up and smiled looked down and dropped a tear  why kate said nicholas drawing his sister towards him and kissing her let me see your face no ah that was but a glimpse thats scarcely fair a longer look than that kate comeand ill read your thoughts for you  there was something in this proposition albeit it was said without the slightest consciousness or application which so alarmed his sister that nicholas laughingly changed the subject to domestic matters and thus gathered by degrees as they left the room and went upstairs together how lonely smike had been all nightand by very slow degrees too for on this subject also kate seemed to speak with some reluctance  poor fellow said nicholas tapping gently at his door what can be the cause of all this  kate was hanging on her brothers arm the door being quickly opened she had not time to disengage herself before smike very pale and haggard and completely dressed confronted them  and have you not been to bed said nicholas  nnno was the reply  nicholas gently detained his sister who made an effort to retire and asked why not  i could not sleep said smike grasping the hand which his friend extended to him  you are not well rejoined nicholas  i am better indeed a great deal better said smike quickly  then why do you give way to these fits of melancholy inquired nicholas in his kindest manner or why not tell us the cause you grow a different creature smike  i do i know i do he replied i will tell you the reason one day but not now i hate myself for this you are all so good and kind but i cannot help it my heart is very full you do not know how full it is  he wrung nicholass hand before he released it and glancing for a moment at the brother and sister as they stood together as if there were something in their strong affection which touched him very deeply withdrew into his chamber and was soon the only watcher under that quiet roof    chapter 50  involves a serious catastrophe   the little racecourse at hampton was in the full tide and height of its gaiety the day as dazzling as day could be the sun high in the cloudless sky and shining in its fullest splendour every gaudy colour that fluttered in the air from carriage seat and garish tent top shone out in its gaudiest hues old dingy flags grew new again faded gilding was reburnished stained rotten canvas looked a snowy white the very beggars rags were freshened up and sentiment quite forgot its charity in its fervent admiration of poverty so picturesque  it was one of those scenes of life and animation caught in its very brightest and freshest moments which can scarcely fail to please for if the eye be tired of show and glare or the ear be weary with a ceaseless round of noise the one may repose turn almost where it will on eager happy and expectant faces and the other deaden all consciousness of more annoying sounds in those of mirth and exhilaration even the sunburnt faces of gypsy children half naked though they be suggest a drop of comfort it is a pleasant thing to see that the sun has been there to know that the air and light are on them every day to feel that they are children and lead childrens lives that if their pillows be damp it is with the dews of heaven and not with tears that the limbs of their girls are free and that they are not crippled by distortions imposing an unnatural and horrible penance upon their sex that their lives are spent from day to day at least among the waving trees and not in the midst of dreadful engines which make young children old before they know what childhood is and give them the exhaustion and infirmity of age without like age the privilege to die god send that old nursery tales were true and that gypsies stole such children by the score  the great race of the day had just been run and the close lines of people on either side of the course suddenly breaking up and pouring into it imparted a new liveliness to the scene which was again all busy movement some hurried eagerly to catch a glimpse of the winning horse others darted to and fro searching no less eagerly for the carriages they had left in quest of better stations here a little knot gathered round a pea and thimble table to watch the plucking of some unhappy greenhorn and there another proprietor with his confederates in various disguisesone man in spectacles another with an eyeglass and a stylish hat a third dressed as a farmer well to do in the world with his topcoat over his arm and his flash notes in a large leathern pocketbook and all with heavyhandled whips to represent most innocent country fellows who had trotted there on horsebacksought by loud and noisy talk and pretended play to entrap some unwary customer while the gentlemen confederates of more villainous aspect still in clean linen and good clothes betrayed their close interest in the concern by the anxious furtive glance they cast on all new comers these would be hanging on the outskirts of a wide circle of people assembled round some itinerant juggler opposed in his turn by a noisy band of music or the classic game of ring the bull while ventriloquists holding dialogues with wooden dolls and fortunetelling women smothering the cries of real babies divided with them and many more the general attention of the company drinkingtents were full glasses began to clink in carriages hampers to be unpacked tempting provisions to be set forth knives and forks to rattle champagne corks to fly eyes to brighten that were not dull before and pickpockets to count their gains during the last heat the attention so recently strained on one object of interest was now divided among a hundred and look where you would there was a motley assemblage of feasting laughing talking begging gambling and mummery  of the gamblingbooths there was a plentiful show flourishing in all the splendour of carpeted ground striped hangings crimson cloth pinnacled roofs geranium pots and livery servants there were the strangers clubhouse the athenaeum clubhouse the hampton clubhouse the st jamess clubhouse and half a mile of clubhouses to play in and there were rougeetnoir french hazard and other games to play at it is into one of these booths that our story takes its way  fitted up with three tables for the purposes of play and crowded with players and lookers on it was although the largest place of the kind upon the course intensely hot notwithstanding that a portion of the canvas roof was rolled back to admit more air and there were two doors for a free passage in and out excepting one or two men who each with a long roll of halfcrowns chequered with a few stray sovereigns in his left hand staked their money at every roll of the ball with a businesslike sedateness which showed that they were used to it and had been playing all day and most probably all the day before there was no very distinctive character about the players who were chiefly young men apparently attracted by curiosity or staking small sums as part of the amusement of the day with no very great interest in winning or losing there were two persons present however who as peculiarly good specimens of a class deserve a passing notice  of these one was a man of six or eight and fifty who sat on a chair near one of the entrances of the booth with his hands folded on the top of his stick and his chin appearing above them he was a tall fat longbodied man buttoned up to the throat in a light green coat which made his body look still longer than it was he wore besides drab breeches and gaiters a white neckerchief and a broadbrimmed white hat amid all the buzzing noise of the games and the perpetual passing in and out of the people he seemed perfectly calm and abstracted without the smallest particle of excitement in his composition he exhibited no indication of weariness nor to a casual observer of interest either there he sat quite still and collected sometimes but very rarely he nodded to some passing face or beckoned to a waiter to obey a call from one of the tables the next instant he subsided into his old state he might have been some profoundly deaf old gentleman who had come in to take a rest or he might have been patiently waiting for a friend without the least consciousness of anybodys presence or fixed in a trance or under the influence of opium people turned round and looked at him he made no gesture caught nobodys eye let them pass away and others come on and be succeeded by others and took no notice when he did move it seemed wonderful how he could have seen anything to occasion it and so in truth it was but there was not a face that passed in or out which this man failed to see not a gesture at any one of the three tables that was lost upon him not a word spoken by the bankers but reached his ear not a winner or loser he could not have marked and he was the proprietor of the place  the other presided over the rougeetnoir table he was probably some ten years younger and was a plump paunchy sturdylooking fellow with his underlip a little pursed from a habit of counting money inwardly as he paid it but with no decidedly bad expression in his face which was rather an honest and jolly one than otherwise he wore no coat the weather being hot and stood behind the table with a huge mound of crowns and halfcrowns before him and a cashbox for notes this game was constantly playing perhaps twenty people would be staking at the same time this man had to roll the ball to watch the stakes as they were laid down to gather them off the colour which lost to pay those who won to do it all with the utmost dispatch to roll the ball again and to keep this game perpetually alive he did it all with a rapidity absolutely marvellous never hesitating never making a mistake never stopping and never ceasing to repeat such unconnected phrases as the following which partly from habit and partly to have something appropriate and businesslike to say he constantly poured out with the same monotonous emphasis and in nearly the same order all day

indeedgentlemen the balls arolling  this officer was busily plying his vocation when halfadozen persons sauntered through the booth to whom but without stopping either in his speech or work he bowed respectfully at the same time directing by a look the attention of a man beside him to the tallest figure in the group in recognition of whom the proprietor pulled off his hat this was sir mulberry hawk with whom were his friend and pupil and a small train of gentlemanlydressed men of characters more doubtful than obscure  the proprietor in a low voice bade sir mulberry goodday sir mulberry in the same tone bade the proprietor go to the devil and turned to speak with his friends  there was evidently an irritable consciousness about him that he was an object of curiosity on this first occasion of showing himself in public after the accident that had befallen him and it was easy to perceive that he appeared on the racecourse that day more in the hope of meeting with a great many people who knew him and so getting over as much as possible of the annoyance at once than with any purpose of enjoying the sport there yet remained a slight scar upon his face and whenever he was recognised as he was almost every minute by people sauntering in and out he made a restless effort to conceal it with his glove showing how keenly he felt the disgrace he had undergone  ah hawk said one very sprucelydressed personage in a newmarket coat a choice neckerchief and all other accessories of the most unexceptionable kind how dye do old fellow  this was a rival trainer of young noblemen and gentlemen and the person of all others whom sir mulberry most hated and dreaded to meet they shook hands with excessive cordiality  and how are you now old fellow hey  quite well quite well said sir mulberry  thats right said the other how dye do verisopht hes a little pulled down our friend here rather out of condition still hey  it should be observed that the gentleman had very white teeth and that when there was no excuse for laughing he generally finished with the same monosyllable which he uttered so as to display them  hes in very good condition theres nothing the matter with him said the young man carelessly  upon my soul im glad to hear it rejoined the other have you just returned from brussels  we only reached town late last night said lord frederick sir mulberry turned away to speak to one of his own party and feigned not to hear  now upon my life said the friend affecting to speak in a whisper its an uncommonly bold and game thing in hawk to show himself so soon i say it advisedly theres a vast deal of courage in it you see he has just rusticated long enough to excite curiosity and not long enough for men to have forgotten that deuced unpleasantbythebyeyou know the rights of the affair of course why did you never give those confounded papers the lie i seldom read the papers but i looked in the papers for that and may i be  look in the papers interrupted sir mulberry turning suddenly round tomorrowno next day will you  upon my life my dear fellow i seldom or never read the papers said the other shrugging his shoulders but i will at your recommendation what shall i look for  good day said sir mulberry turning abruptly on his heel and drawing his pupil with him falling again into the loitering careless pace at which they had entered they lounged out arm in arm  i wont give him a case of murder to read muttered sir mulberry with an oath but it shall be something very near it if whipcord cuts and bludgeons bruise  his companion said nothing but there was something in his manner which galled sir mulberry to add with nearly as much ferocity as if his friend had been nicholas himself  i sent jenkins to old nickleby before eight oclock this morning hes a staunch one he was back with me before the messenger i had it all from him in the first five minutes i know where this hound is to be met with time and place both but theres no need to talk tomorrow will soon be here  and whaats to be done tomorrow inquired lord frederick  sir mulberry hawk honoured him with an angry glance but condescended to return no verbal answer to this inquiry both walked sullenly on as though their thoughts were busily occupied until they were quite clear of the crowd and almost alone when sir mulberry wheeled round to return  stop said his companion i want to speak to you in earnest dont turn back let us walk here a few minutes  what have you to say to me that you could not say yonder as well as here returned his mentor disengaging his arm  hawk rejoined the other tell me i must know  must know interrupted the other disdainfully whew go on if you must know of course theres no escape for me must know  must ask then returned lord frederick and must press you for a plain and straightforward answer is what you have just said only a mere whim of the moment occasioned by your being out of humour and irritated or is it your serious intention and one that you have actually contemplated  why dont you remember what passed on the subject one night when i was laid up with a broken limb said sir mulberry with a sneer  perfectly well  then take that for an answer in the devils name replied sir mulberry and ask me for no other  such was the ascendancy he had acquired over his dupe and such the latters general habit of submission that for the moment the young man seemed half afraid to pursue the subject he soon overcame this feeling however if it had restrained him at all and retorted angrily  if i remember what passed at the time you speak of i expressed a strong opinion on this subject and said that with my knowledge or consent you never should do what you threaten now  will you prevent me asked sir mulberry with a laugh  yees if i can returned the other promptly  a very proper saving clause that last said sir mulberry and one you stand in need of oh look to your own business and leave me to look to mine  this is mine retorted lord frederick i make it mine i will make it mine its mine already i am more compromised than i should be as it is  do as you please and what you please for yourself said sir mulberry affecting an easy goodhumour surely that must content you do nothing for me thats all i advise no man to interfere in proceedings that i choose to take i am sure you know me better than to do so the fact is i see you mean to offer me advice it is well meant i have no doubt but i reject it now if you please we will return to the carriage i find no entertainment here but quite the reverse if we prolong this conversation we might quarrel which would be no proof of wisdom in either you or me  with this rejoinder and waiting for no further discussion sir mulberry hawk yawned and very leisurely turned back  there was not a little tact and knowledge of the young lords disposition in this mode of treating him sir mulberry clearly saw that if his dominion were to last it must be established now he knew that the moment he became violent the young man would become violent too he had many times been enabled to strengthen his influence when any circumstance had occurred to weaken it by adopting this cool and laconic style and he trusted to it now with very little doubt of its entire success  but while he did this and wore the most careless and indifferent deportment that his practised arts enabled him to assume he inwardly resolved not only to visit all the mortification of being compelled to suppress his feelings with additional severity upon nicholas but also to make the young lord pay dearly for it one day in some shape or other so long as he had been a passive instrument in his hands sir mulberry had regarded him with no other feeling than contempt but now that he presumed to avow opinions in opposition to his and even to turn upon him with a lofty tone and an air of superiority he began to hate him conscious that in the vilest and most worthless sense of the term he was dependent upon the weak young lord sir mulberry could the less brook humiliation at his hands and when he began to dislike him he measured his dislikeas men often doby the extent of the injuries he had inflicted upon its object when it is remembered that sir mulberry hawk had plundered duped deceived and fooled his pupil in every possible way it will not be wondered at that beginning to hate him he began to hate him cordially  on the other hand the young lord having thoughtwhich he very seldom did about anythingand seriously too upon the affair with nicholas and the circumstances which led to it had arrived at a manly and honest conclusion sir mulberrys coarse and insulting behaviour on the occasion in question had produced a deep impression on his mind a strong suspicion of his having led him on to pursue miss nickleby for purposes of his own had been lurking there for some time he was really ashamed of his share in the transaction and deeply mortified by the misgiving that he had been gulled he had had sufficient leisure to reflect upon these things during their late retirement and at times when his careless and indolent nature would permit had availed himself of the opportunity slight circumstances too had occurred to increase his suspicion it wanted but a very slight circumstance to kindle his wrath against sir mulberry this his disdainful and insolent tone in their recent conversation the only one they had held upon the subject since the period to which sir mulberry referred effected  thus they rejoined their friends each with causes of dislike against the other rankling in his breast and the young man haunted besides with thoughts of the vindictive retaliation which was threatened against nicholas and the determination to prevent it by some strong step if possible but this was not all sir mulberry conceiving that he had silenced him effectually could not suppress his triumph or forbear from following up what he conceived to be his advantage mr pyke was there and mr pluck was there and colonel chowser and other gentlemen of the same caste and it was a great point for sir mulberry to show them that he had not lost his influence at first the young lord contented himself with a silent determination to take measures for withdrawing himself from the connection immediately by degrees he grew more angry and was exasperated by jests and familiarities which a few hours before would have been a source of amusement to him this did not serve him for at such bantering or retort as suited the company he was no match for sir mulberry still no violent rupture took place they returned to town messrs pyke and pluck and other gentlemen frequently protesting on the way thither that sir mulberry had never been in such tiptop spirits in all his life  they dined together sumptuously the wine flowed freely as indeed it had done all day sir mulberry drank to recompense himself for his recent abstinence the young lord to drown his indignation and the remainder of the party because the wine was of the best and they had nothing to pay it was nearly midnight when they rushed out wild burning with wine their blood boiling and their brains on fire to the gamingtable  here they encountered another party mad like themselves the excitement of play hot rooms and glaring lights was not calculated to allay the fever of the time in that giddy whirl of noise and confusion the men were delirious who thought of money ruin or the morrow in the savage intoxication of the moment more wine was called for glass after glass was drained their parched and scalding mouths were cracked with thirst down poured the wine like oil on blazing fire and still the riot went on the debauchery gained its height glasses were dashed upon the floor by hands that could not carry them to lips oaths were shouted out by lips which could scarcely form the words to vent them in drunken losers cursed and roared some mounted on the tables waving bottles above their heads and bidding defiance to the rest some danced some sang some tore the cards and raved tumult and frenzy reigned supreme when a noise arose that drowned all others and two men seizing each other by the throat struggled into the middle of the room  a dozen voices until now unheard called aloud to part them those who had kept themselves cool to win and who earned their living in such scenes threw themselves upon the combatants and forcing them asunder dragged them some space apart  let me go cried sir mulberry in a thick hoarse voice he struck me do you hear i say he struck me have i a friend here who is this westwood do you hear me say he struck me  i hear i hear replied one of those who held him come away for tonight  i will not by g he replied a dozen men about us saw the blow  tomorrow will be ample time said the friend  it will not be ample time cried sir mulberry tonight at once here his passion was so great that he could not articulate but stood clenching his fist tearing his hair and stamping upon the ground  what is this my lord said one of those who surrounded him have blows passed  one blow has was the panting reply i struck him i proclaim it to all here i struck him and he knows why i say with him let this quarrel be adjusted now captain adams said the young lord looking hurriedly about him and addressing one of those who had interposed let me speak with you i beg  the person addressed stepped forward and taking the young mans arm they retired together followed shortly afterwards by sir mulberry and his friend  it was a profligate haunt of the worst repute and not a place in which such an affair was likely to awaken any sympathy for either party or to call forth any further remonstrance or interposition elsewhere its further progress would have been instantly prevented and time allowed for sober and cool reflection but not there disturbed in their orgies the party broke up some reeled away with looks of tipsy gravity others withdrew noisily discussing what had just occurred the gentlemen of honour who lived upon their winnings remarked to each other as they went out that hawk was a good shot and those who had been most noisy fell fast asleep upon the sofas and thought no more about it  meanwhile the two seconds as they may be called now after a long conference each with his principal met together in another room both utterly heartless both men upon town both thoroughly initiated in its worst vices both deeply in debt both fallen from some higher estate both addicted to every depravity for which society can find some genteel name and plead its most depraving conventionalities as an excuse they were naturally gentlemen of most unblemished honour themselves and of great nicety concerning the honour of other people  these two gentlemen were unusually cheerful just now for the affair was pretty certain to make some noise and could scarcely fail to enhance their reputations  this is an awkward affair adams said mr westwood drawing himself up  very returned the captain a blow has been struck and there is but one course of course  no apology i suppose said mr westwood  not a syllable sir from my man if we talk till doomsday returned the captain the original cause of dispute i understand was some girl or other to whom your principal applied certain terms which lord frederick defending the girl repelled but this led to a long recrimination upon a great many sore subjects charges and countercharges sir mulberry was sarcastic lord frederick was excited and struck him in the heat of provocation and under circumstances of great aggravation that blow unless there is a full retraction on the part of sir mulberry lord frederick is ready to justify  there is no more to be said returned the other but to settle the hour and the place of meeting its a responsibility but there is a strong feeling to have it over do you object to say at sunrise  sharp work replied the captain referring to his watch however as this seems to have been a long time breeding and negotiation is only a waste of words no  something may possibly be said out of doors after what passed in the other room which renders it desirable that we should be off without delay and quite clear of town said mr westwood what do you say to one of the meadows opposite twickenham by the riverside  the captain saw no objection  shall we join company in the avenue of trees which leads from petersham to ham house and settle the exact spot when we arrive there said mr westwood  to this the captain also assented after a few other preliminaries equally brief and having settled the road each party should take to avoid suspicion they separated  we shall just have comfortable time my lord said the captain when he had communicated the arrangements to call at my rooms for a case of pistols and then jog coolly down if you will allow me to dismiss your servant well take my cab for yours perhaps might be recognised  what a contrast when they reached the street to the scene they had just left it was already daybreak for the flaring yellow light within was substituted the clear bright glorious morning for a hot close atmosphere tainted with the smell of expiring lamps and reeking with the steams of riot and dissipation the free fresh wholesome air but to the fevered head on which that cool air blew it seemed to come laden with remorse for time misspent and countless opportunities neglected with throbbing veins and burning skin eyes wild and heavy thoughts hurried and disordered he felt as though the light were a reproach and shrunk involuntarily from the day as if he were some foul and hideous thing  shivering said the captain you are cold  rather  it does strike cool coming out of those hot rooms wrap that cloak about you so so now were off  they rattled through the quiet streets made their call at the captains lodgings cleared the town and emerged upon the open road without hindrance or molestation  fields trees gardens hedges everything looked very beautiful the young man scarcely seemed to have noticed them before though he had passed the same objects a thousand times there was a peace and serenity upon them all strangely at variance with the bewilderment and confusion of his own halfsobered thoughts and yet impressive and welcome he had no fear upon his mind but as he looked about him he had less anger and though all old delusions relative to his worthless late companion were now cleared away he rather wished he had never known him than thought of its having come to this  the past night the day before and many other days and nights beside all mingled themselves up in one unintelligible and senseless whirl he could not separate the transactions of one time from those of another now the noise of the wheels resolved itself into some wild tune in which he could recognise scraps of airs he knew now there was nothing in his ears but a stunning and bewildering sound like rushing water but his companion rallied him on being so silent and they talked and laughed boisterously when they stopped he was a little surprised to find himself in the act of smoking but on reflection he remembered when and where he had taken the cigar  they stopped at the avenue gate and alighted leaving the carriage to the care of the servant who was a smart fellow and nearly as well accustomed to such proceedings as his master sir mulberry and his friend were already there all four walked in profound silence up the aisle of stately elm trees which meeting far above their heads formed a long green perspective of gothic arches terminating like some old ruin in the open sky  after a pause and a brief conference between the seconds they at length turned to the right and taking a track across a little meadow passed ham house and came into some fields beyond in one of these they stopped the ground was measured some usual forms gone through the two principals were placed front to front at the distance agreed upon and sir mulberry turned his face towards his young adversary for the first time he was very pale his eyes were bloodshot his dress disordered and his hair dishevelled for the face it expressed nothing but violent and evil passions he shaded his eyes with his hand grazed at his opponent steadfastly for a few moments and then taking the weapon which was tendered to him bent his eyes upon that and looked up no more until the word was given when he instantly fired  the two shots were fired as nearly as possible at the same instant in that instant the young lord turned his head sharply round fixed upon his adversary a ghastly stare and without a groan or stagger fell down dead  hes gone cried westwood who with the other second had run up to the body and fallen on one knee beside it  his blood on his own head said sir mulberry he brought this upon himself and forced it upon me  captain adams cried westwood hastily i call you to witness that this was fairly done hawk we have not a moment to lose we must leave this place immediately push for brighton and cross to france with all speed this has been a bad business and may be worse if we delay a moment adams consult your own safety and dont remain here the living before the dead goodbye  with these words he seized sir mulberry by the arm and hurried him away captain adamsonly pausing to convince himself beyond all question of the fatal resultsped off in the same direction to concert measures with his servant for removing the body and securing his own safety likewise  so died lord frederick verisopht by the hand which he had loaded with gifts and clasped a thousand times by the act of him but for whom and others like him he might have lived a happy man and died with childrens faces round his bed  the sun came proudly up in all his majesty the noble river ran its winding course the leaves quivered and rustled in the air the birds poured their cheerful songs from every tree the shortlived butterfly fluttered its little wings all the light and life of day came on and amidst it all and pressing down the grass whose every blade bore twenty tiny lives lay the dead man with his stark and rigid face turned upwards to the sky    chapter 51  the project of mr ralph nickleby and his friend approaching a successful issue becomes unexpectedly known to another party not admitted into their confidence   in an old house dismal dark and dusty which seemed to have withered like himself and to have grown yellow and shrivelled in hoarding him from the light of day as he had in hoarding his money lived arthur gride meagre old chairs and tables of spare and bony make and hard and cold as misers hearts were ranged in grim array against the gloomy walls attenuated presses grown lank and lanternjawed in guarding the treasures they enclosed and tottering as though from constant fear and dread of thieves shrunk up in dark corners whence they cast no shadows on the ground and seemed to hide and cower from observation a tall grim clock upon the stairs with long lean hands and famished face ticked in cautious whispers and when it struck the time in thin and piping sounds like an old mans voice rattled as if it were pinched with hunger  no fireside couch was there to invite repose and comfort elbowchairs there were but they looked uneasy in their minds cocked their arms suspiciously and timidly and kept upon their guard others were fantastically grim and gaunt as having drawn themselves up to their utmost height and put on their fiercest looks to stare all comers out of countenance others again knocked up against their neighbours or leant for support against the wallsomewhat ostentatiously as if to call all men to witness that they were not worth the taking the dark square lumbering bedsteads seemed built for restless dreams the musty hangings seemed to creep in scanty folds together whispering among themselves when rustled by the wind their trembling knowledge of the tempting wares that lurked within the dark and tightlocked closets  from out the most spare and hungry room in all this spare and hungry house there came one morning the tremulous tones of old grides voice as it feebly chirruped forth the fag end of some forgotten song of which the burden ran       tarantantoo      throw the old shoe      and may the wedding be lucky  which he repeated in the same shrill quavering notes again and again until a violent fit of coughing obliged him to desist and to pursue in silence the occupation upon which he was engaged  this occupation was to take down from the shelves of a wormeaten wardrobe a quantity of frouzy garments one by one to subject each to a careful and minute inspection by holding it up against the light and after folding it with great exactness to lay it on one or other of two little heaps beside him he never took two articles of clothing out together but always brought them forth singly and never failed to shut the wardrobe door and turn the key between each visit to its shelves  the snuffcoloured suit said arthur gride surveying a threadbare coat did i look well in snuffcolour let me think  the result of his cogitations appeared to be unfavourable for he folded the garment once more laid it aside and mounted on a chair to get down another chirping while he did so       young loving and fair      oh what happiness there      the wedding is sure to be lucky  they always put in young said old arthur but songs are only written for the sake of rhyme and this is a silly one that the poor countrypeople sang when i was a little boy though stopyoung is quite right tooit means the brideyes he he he it means the bride oh dear thats good thats very good and true besides quite true  in the satisfaction of this discovery he went over the verse again with increased expression and a shake or two here and there he then resumed his employment  the bottlegreen said old arthur the bottlegreen was a famous suit to wear and i bought it very cheap at a pawnbrokers and there washe he hea tarnished shilling in the waistcoat pocket to think that the pawnbroker shouldnt have known there was a shilling in it i knew it i felt it when i was examining the quality oh what a dull dog of a pawnbroker it was a lucky suit too this bottlegreen the very day i put it on first old lord mallowford was burnt to death in his bed and all the postobits fell in ill be married in the bottlegreen peg peg sliderskewill wear the bottlegreen  this call loudly repeated twice or thrice at the roomdoor brought into the apartment a short thin weasen bleareyed old woman palsystricken and hideously ugly who wiping her shrivelled face upon her dirty apron inquired in that subdued tone in which deaf people commonly speak  was that you a calling or only the clock a striking my hearing gets so bad i never know which is which but when i hear a noise i know it must be one of you because nothing else never stirs in the house  me peg me said arthur gride tapping himself on the breast to render the reply more intelligible  you eh returned peg and what do you want  ill be married in the bottlegreen cried arthur gride  its a deal too good to be married in master rejoined peg after a short inspection of the suit havent you got anything worse than this  nothing thatll do replied old arthur  why not do retorted peg why dont you wear your everyday clothes like a maneh  they ant becoming enough peg returned her master  not what enough said peg  becoming  becoming what said peg sharply not becoming too old to wear  arthur gride muttered an imprecation on his housekeepers deafness as he roared in her ear  not smart enough i want to look as well as i can  look cried peg if shes as handsome as you say she is she wont look much at you master take your oath of that and as to how you look yourselfpepperandsalt bottlegreen skyblue or tartanplaid will make no difference in you  with which consolatory assurance peg sliderskew gathered up the chosen suit and folding her skinny arms upon the bundle stood mouthing and grinning and blinking her watery eyes like an uncouth figure in some monstrous piece of carving  youre in a funny humour ant you peg said arthur with not the best possible grace  why isnt it enough to make me rejoined the old woman i shall soon enough be put out though if anybody tries to domineer it over me and so i give you notice master nobody shall be put over peg sliderskews head after so many years you know that and so i neednt tell you that wont do for meno no nor for you try that once and come to ruinruinruin  oh dear dear i shall never try it said arthur gride appalled by the mention of the word not for the world it would be very easy to ruin me we must be very careful more saving than ever with another mouth to feed only wewe mustnt let her lose her good looks peg because i like to see em  take care you dont find good looks come expensive returned peg shaking her forefinger  but she can earn money herself peg said arthur gride eagerly watching what effect his communication produced upon the old womans countenance she can draw paint work all manner of pretty things for ornamenting stools and chairs slippers peg watchguards hairchains and a thousand little dainty trifles that i couldnt give you half the names of then she can play the piano and whats more shes got one and sing like a little bird shell be very cheap to dress and keep peg dont you think she will  if you dont let her make a fool of you she may returned peg  a fool of me exclaimed arthur trust your old master not to be fooled by pretty faces peg no no nonor by ugly ones neither mrs sliderskew he softly added by way of soliloquy  youre a saying something you dont want me to hear said peg i know you are  oh dear the devils in this woman muttered arthur adding with an ugly leer i said i trusted everything to you peg that was all  you do that master and all your cares are over said peg approvingly  when i do that peg sliderskew thought arthur gride they will be  although he thought this very distinctly he durst not move his lips lest the old woman should detect him he even seemed half afraid that she might have read his thoughts for he leered coaxingly upon her as he said aloud  take up all loose stitches in the bottlegreen with the best black silk have a skein of the best and some new buttons for the coat andthis is a good idea peg and one youll like i knowas i have never given her anything yet and girls like such attentions you shall polish up a sparking necklace that i have got upstairs and ill give it her upon the wedding morningclasp it round her charming little neck myselfand take it away again next day he he he ill lock it up for her peg and lose it wholl be made the fool of there i wonder to begin witheh peg  mrs sliderskew appeared to approve highly of this ingenious scheme and expressed her satisfaction by various rackings and twitchings of her head and body which by no means enhanced her charms these she prolonged until she had hobbled to the door when she exchanged them for a sour malignant look and twisting her underjaw from side to side muttered hearty curses upon the future mrs gride as she crept slowly down the stairs and paused for breath at nearly every one  shes half a witch i think said arthur gride when he found himself again alone but shes very frugal and shes very deaf her living costs me next to nothing and its no use her listening at keyholes for she cant hear shes a charming womanfor the purpose a most discreet old housekeeper and worth her weight incopper  having extolled the merits of his domestic in these high terms old arthur went back to the burden of his song the suit destined to grace his approaching nuptials being now selected he replaced the others with no less care than he had displayed in drawing them from the musty nooks where they had silently reposed for many years  startled by a ring at the door he hastily concluded this operation and locked the press but there was no need for any particular hurry as the discreet peg seldom knew the bell was rung unless she happened to cast her dim eyes upwards and to see it shaking against the kitchen ceiling after a short delay however peg tottered in followed by newman noggs  ah mr noggs cried arthur gride rubbing his hands my good friend mr noggs what news do you bring for me  newman with a steadfast and immovable aspect and his fixed eye very fixed indeed replied suiting the action to the word a letter from mr nickleby bearer waits  wont you take aa  newman looked up and smacked his lips  a chair said arthur gride  no replied newman thankee  arthur opened the letter with trembling hands and devoured its contents with the utmost greediness chuckling rapturously over it and reading it several times before he could take it from before his eyes so many times did he peruse and reperuse it that newman considered it expedient to remind him of his presence  answer said newman bearer waits  true replied old arthur yesyes i almost forgot i do declare  i thought you were forgetting said newman  quite right to remind me mr noggs oh very right indeed said arthur yes ill write a line imimrather flurried mr noggs the news is  bad interrupted newman  no mr noggs thank you good good the very best of news sit down ill get the pen and ink and write a line in answer ill not detain you long i know youre a treasure to your master mr noggs he speaks of you in such terms sometimes that oh dear youd be astonished i may say that i do too and always did i always say the same of you  thats curse mr noggs with all my heart then if you do thought newman as gride hurried out  the letter had fallen on the ground looking carefully about him for an instant newman impelled by curiosity to know the result of the design he had overheard from his office closet caught it up and rapidly read as follows   gride  i saw bray again this morning and proposed the day after tomorrow as you suggested for the marriage there is no objection on his part and all days are alike to his daughter we will go together and you must be with me by seven in the morning i need not tell you to be punctual  make no further visits to the girl in the meantime you have been there of late much oftener than you should she does not languish for you and it might have been dangerous restrain your youthful ardour for eightandforty hours and leave her to the father you only undo what he does and does well  yours  ralph nickleby   a footstep was heard without newman dropped the letter on the same spot again pressed it with his foot to prevent its fluttering away regained his seat in a single stride and looked as vacant and unconscious as ever mortal looked arthur gride after peering nervously about him spied it on the ground picked it up and sitting down to write glanced at newman noggs who was staring at the wall with an intensity so remarkable that arthur was quite alarmed  do you see anything particular mr noggs said arthur trying to follow the direction of newmans eyeswhich was an impossibility and a thing no man had ever done  only a cobweb replied newman  oh is that all  no said newman theres a fly in it  there are a good many cobwebs here observed arthur gride  so there are in our place returned newman and flies too  newman appeared to derive great entertainment from this repartee and to the great discomposure of arthur grides nerves produced a series of sharp cracks from his fingerjoints resembling the noise of a distant discharge of small artillery arthur succeeded in finishing his reply to ralphs note nevertheless and at length handed it over to the eccentric messenger for delivery  thats it mr noggs said gride  newman gave a nod put it in his hat and was shuffling away when gride whose doting delight knew no bounds beckoned him back again and said in a shrill whisper and with a grin which puckered up his whole face and almost obscured his eyes  will youwill you take a little drop of somethingjust a taste  in good fellowship if arthur gride had been capable of it newman would not have drunk with him one bubble of the richest wine that was ever made but to see what he would be at and to punish him as much as he could he accepted the offer immediately  arthur gride therefore again applied himself to the press and from a shelf laden with tall flemish drinkingglasses and quaint bottles some with necks like so many storks and others with square dutchbuilt bodies and short fat apoplectic throats took down one dusty bottle of promising appearance and two glasses of curiously small size  you never tasted this said arthur its eaudorgolden water i like it on account of its name its a delicious name water of gold golden water o dear me it seems quite a sin to drink it  as his courage appeared to be fast failing him and he trifled with the stopper in a manner which threatened the dismissal of the bottle to its old place newman took up one of the little glasses and clinked it twice or thrice against the bottle as a gentle reminder that he had not been helped yet with a deep sigh arthur gride slowly filled itthough not to the brimand then filled his own  stop stop dont drink it yet he said laying his hand on newmans it was given to me twenty years ago and when i take a little taste which is very seldom i like to think of it beforehand and tease myself well drink a toast shall we drink a toast mr noggs  ah said newman eyeing his little glass impatiently look sharp bearer waits  why then ill tell you what tittered arthur well drinkhe he hewell drink a lady  the ladies said newman  no no mr noggs replied gride arresting his hand a lady you wonder to hear me say a lady i know you do i know you do heres little madeline thats the toast mr noggs little madeline  madeline said newman inwardly adding and god help her  the rapidity and unconcern with which newman dismissed his portion of the golden water had a great effect upon the old man who sat upright in his chair and gazed at him openmouthed as if the sight had taken away his breath quite unmoved however newman left him to sip his own at leisure or to pour it back again into the bottle if he chose and departed after greatly outraging the dignity of peg sliderskew by brushing past her in the passage without a word of apology or recognition  mr gride and his housekeeper immediately on being left alone resolved themselves into a committee of ways and means and discussed the arrangements which should be made for the reception of the young bride as they were like some other committees extremely dull and prolix in debate this history may pursue the footsteps of newman noggs thereby combining advantage with necessity for it would have been necessary to do so under any circumstances and necessity has no law as all the world knows  youve been a long time said ralph when newman returned  he was a long time replied newman  bah cried ralph impatiently give me his note if he gave you one his message if he didnt and dont go away i want a word with you sir  newman handed in the note and looked very virtuous and innocent while his employer broke the seal and glanced his eye over it  hell be sure to come muttered ralph as he tore it to pieces why of course i know hell be sure to come what need to say that noggs pray sir what man was that with whom i saw you in the street last night  i dont know replied newman  you had better refresh your memory sir said ralph with a threatening look  i tell you returned newman boldly that i dont know he came here twice and asked for you you were out he came again you packed him off yourself he gave the name of brooker  i know he did said ralph what then  what then why then he lurked about and dogged me in the street he follows me night after night and urges me to bring him face to face with you as he says he has been once and not long ago either he wants to see you face to face he says and youll soon hear him out he warrants  and what say you to that inquired ralph looking keenly at his drudge  that its no business of mine and i wont i told him he might catch you in the street if that was all he wanted but no that wouldnt do you wouldnt hear a word there he said he must have you alone in a room with the door locked where he could speak without fear and youd soon change your tone and hear him patiently  an audacious dog ralph muttered  thats all i know said newman i say again i dont know what man he is i dont believe he knows himself you have seen him perhaps you do  i think i do replied ralph  well retored newman sulkily dont expect me to know him too thats all youll ask me next why i never told you this before what would you say if i was to tell you all that people say of you what do you call me when i sometimes do brute ass and snap at me like a dragon  this was true enough though the question which newman anticipated was in fact upon ralphs lips at the moment  he is an idle ruffian said ralph a vagabond from beyond the sea where he travelled for his crimes a felon let loose to run his neck into the halter a swindler who has the audacity to try his schemes on me who know him well the next time he tampers with you hand him over to the police for attempting to extort money by lies and threatsdye hearand leave the rest to me he shall cool his heels in jail a little time and ill be bound he looks for other folks to fleece when he comes out you mind what i say do you  i hear said newman  do it then returned ralph and ill reward you now you may go  newman readily availed himself of the permission and shutting himself up in his little office remained there in very serious cogitation all day when he was released at night he proceeded with all the expedition he could use to the city and took up his old position behind the pump to watch for nicholas for newman noggs was proud in his way and could not bear to appear as his friend before the brothers cheeryble in the shabby and degraded state to which he was reduced  he had not occupied this position many minutes when he was rejoiced to see nicholas approaching and darted out from his ambuscade to meet him nicholas on his part was no less pleased to encounter his friend whom he had not seen for some time so their greeting was a warm one  i was thinking of you at that moment said nicholas  thats right rejoined newman and i of you i couldnt help coming up tonight i say i think i am going to find out something  and what may that be returned nicholas smiling at this odd communication  i dont know what it may be i dont know what it may not be said newman its some secret in which your uncle is concerned but what ive not yet been able to discover although i have my strong suspicions ill not hint em now in case you should be disappointed  i disappointed cried nicholas am i interested  i think you are replied newman i have a crotchet in my head that it must be so i have found out a man who plainly knows more than he cares to tell at once and he has already dropped such hints to me as puzzle mei say as puzzle me said newman scratching his red nose into a state of violent inflammation and staring at nicholas with all his might and main meanwhile  admiring what could have wound his friend up to such a pitch of mystery nicholas endeavoured by a series of questions to elucidate the cause but in vain newman could not be drawn into any more explicit statement than a repetition of the perplexities he had already thrown out and a confused oration showing how it was necessary to use the utmost caution how the lynxeyed ralph had already seen him in company with his unknown correspondent and how he had baffled the said ralph by extreme guardedness of manner and ingenuity of speech having prepared himself for such a contingency from the first  remembering his companions propensityof which his nose indeed perpetually warned all beholders like a beaconnicholas had drawn him into a sequestered tavern here they fell to reviewing the origin and progress of their acquaintance as men sometimes do and tracing out the little events by which it was most strongly marked came at last to miss cecilia bobster  and that reminds me said newman that you never told me the young ladys real name  madeline said nicholas  madeline cried newman what madeline her other name say her other name  bray said nicholas in great astonishment  its the same cried newman sad story can you stand idly by and let that unnatural marriage take place without one attempt to save her  what do you mean exclaimed nicholas starting up marriage are you mad  are you is she are you blind deaf senseless dead said newman do you know that within one day by means of your uncle ralph she will be married to a man as bad as he and worse if worse there is do you know that within one day she will be sacrificed as sure as you stand there alive to a hoary wretcha devil born and bred and grey in devils ways  be careful what you say replied nicholas for heavens sake be careful i am left here alone and those who could stretch out a hand to rescue her are far away what is it that you mean  i never heard her name said newman choking with his energy why didnt you tell me how was i to know we might at least have had some time to think  what is it that you mean cried nicholas  it was not an easy task to arrive at this information but after a great quantity of extraordinary pantomime which in no way assisted it nicholas who was almost as wild as newman noggs himself forced the latter down upon his seat and held him down until he began his tale  rage astonishment indignation and a storm of passions rushed through the listeners heart as the plot was laid bare he no sooner understood it all than with a face of ashy paleness and trembling in every limb he darted from the house  stop him cried newman bolting out in pursuit hell be doing something desperate hell murder somebody hallo there stop him stop thief stop thief    chapter 52  nicholas despairs of rescuing madeline bray but plucks up his spirits again and determines to attempt it domestic intelligence of the kenwigses and lillyvicks   finding that newman was determined to arrest his progress at any hazard and apprehensive that some wellintentioned passenger attracted by the cry of stop thief might lay violent hands upon his person and place him in a disagreeable predicament from which he might have some difficulty in extricating himself nicholas soon slackened his pace and suffered newman noggs to come up with him which he did in so breathless a condition that it seemed impossible he could have held out for a minute longer  i will go straight to brays said nicholas i will see this man if there is a feeling of humanity lingering in his breast a spark of consideration for his own child motherless and friendless as she is i will awaken it  you will not replied newman you will not indeed  then said nicholas pressing onward i will act upon my first impulse and go straight to ralph nickleby  by the time you reach his house he will be in bed said newman  ill drag him from it cried nicholas  tut tut said noggs be yourself  you are the best of friends to me newman rejoined nicholas after a pause and taking his hand as he spoke i have made head against many trials but the misery of another and such misery is involved in this one that i declare to you i am rendered desperate and know not how to act  in truth it did seem a hopeless case it was impossible to make any use of such intelligence as newman noggs had gleaned when he lay concealed in the closet the mere circumstance of the compact between ralph nickleby and gride would not invalidate the marriage or render bray averse to it who if he did not actually know of the existence of some such understanding doubtless suspected it what had been hinted with reference to some fraud on madeline had been put with sufficient obscurity by arthur gride but coming from newman noggs and obscured still further by the smoke of his pocketpistol it became wholly unintelligible and involved in utter darkness  there seems no ray of hope said nicholas  the greater necessity for coolness for reason for consideration for thought said newman pausing at every alternate word to look anxiously in his friends face where are the brothers  both absent on urgent business as they will be for a week to come  is there no way of communicating with them no way of getting one of them here by tomorrow night  impossible said nicholas the sea is between us and them with the fairest winds that ever blew to go and return would take three days and nights  their nephew said newman their old clerk  what could either do that i cannot rejoined nicholas with reference to them especially i am enjoined to the strictest silence on this subject what right have i to betray the confidence reposed in me when nothing but a miracle can prevent this sacrifice  think urged newman is there no way  there is none said nicholas in utter dejection not one the father urges the daughter consents these demons have her in their toils legal right might power money and every influence are on their side how can i hope to save her  hope to the last said newman clapping him on the back always hope thats a dear boy never leave off hoping it dont answer do you mind me nick it dont answer dont leave a stone unturned its always something to know youve done the most you could but dont leave off hoping or its of no use doing anything hope hope to the last  nicholas needed encouragement the suddenness with which intelligence of the two usurers plans had come upon him the little time which remained for exertion the probability almost amounting to certainty itself that a few hours would place madeline bray for ever beyond his reach consign her to unspeakable misery and perhaps to an untimely death all this quite stunned and overwhelmed him every hope connected with her that he had suffered himself to form or had entertained unconsciously seemed to fall at his feet withered and dead every charm with which his memory or imagination had surrounded her presented itself before him only to heighten his anguish and add new bitterness to his despair every feeling of sympathy for her forlorn condition and of admiration for her heroism and fortitude aggravated the indignation which shook him in every limb and swelled his heart almost to bursting  but if nicholass own heart embarrassed him newmans came to his relief there was so much earnestness in his remonstrance and such sincerity and fervour in his manner odd and ludicrous as it always was that it imparted to nicholas new firmness and enabled him to say after he had walked on for some little way in silence  you read me a good lesson newman and i will profit by it one step at least i may takeam bound to take indeedand to that i will apply myself tomorrow  what is that asked noggs wistfully not to threaten ralph not to see the father  to see the daughter newman replied nicholas to do what after all is the utmost that the brothers could do if they were here as heaven send they were to reason with her upon this hideous union to point out to her all the horrors to which she is hastening rashly it may be and without due reflection to entreat her at least to pause she can have had no counsellor for her good perhaps even i may move her so far yet though it is the eleventh hour and she upon the very brink of ruin  bravely spoken said newman well done well done yes very good  and i do declare cried nicholas with honest enthusiasm that in this effort i am influenced by no selfish or personal considerations but by pity for her and detestation and abhorrence of this scheme and that i would do the same were there twenty rivals in the field and i the last and least favoured of them all  you would i believe said newman but where are you hurrying now  homewards answered nicholas do you come with me or i shall say goodnight  ill come a little way if you will but walk not run said noggs  i cannot walk tonight newman returned nicholas hurriedly i must move rapidly or i could not draw my breath ill tell you what ive said and done tomorrow  without waiting for a reply he darted off at a rapid pace and plunging into the crowds which thronged the street was quickly lost to view  hes a violent youth at times said newman looking after him and yet like him for it theres cause enough now or the deuce is in it hope i said hope i think ralph nickleby and gride with their heads together and hope for the opposite party ho ho  it was with a very melancholy laugh that newman noggs concluded this soliloquy and it was with a very melancholy shake of the head and a very rueful countenance that he turned about and went plodding on his way  this under ordinary circumstances would have been to some small tavern or dramshop that being his way in more senses than one but newman was too much interested and too anxious to betake himself even to this resource and so with many desponding and dismal reflections went straight home  it had come to pass that afternoon that miss morleena kenwigs had received an invitation to repair next day per steamer from westminster bridge unto the eelpie island at twickenham there to make merry upon a cold collation bottled beer shrub and shrimps and to dance in the open air to the music of a locomotive band conveyed thither for the purpose the steamer being specially engaged by a dancingmaster of extensive connection for the accommodation of his numerous pupils and the pupils displaying their appreciation of the dancingmasters services by purchasing themselves and inducing their friends to do the like divers lightblue tickets entitling them to join the expedition of these lightblue tickets one had been presented by an ambitious neighbour to miss morleena kenwigs with an invitation to join her daughters and mrs kenwigs rightly deeming that the honour of the family was involved in miss morleenas making the most splendid appearance possible on so short a notice and testifying to the dancingmaster that there were other dancingmasters besides him and to all fathers and mothers present that other peoples children could learn to be genteel besides theirs had fainted away twice under the magnitude of her preparations but upheld by a determination to sustain the family name or perish in the attempt was still hard at work when newman noggs came home  now between the italianironing of frills the flouncing of trousers the trimming of frocks the faintings and the comingsto again incidental to the occasion mrs kenwigs had been so entirely occupied that she had not observed until within half an hour before that the flaxen tails of miss morleenas hair were in a manner run to seed and that unless she were put under the hands of a skilful hairdresser she never could achieve that signal triumph over the daughters of all other people anything less than which would be tantamount to defeat this discovery drove mrs kenwigs to despair for the hairdresser lived three streets and eight dangerous crossings off morleena could not be trusted to go there alone even if such a proceeding were strictly proper of which mrs kenwigs had her doubts mr kenwigs had not returned from business and there was nobody to take her so mrs kenwigs first slapped miss kenwigs for being the cause of her vexation and then shed tears  you ungrateful child said mrs kenwigs after i have gone through what i have this night for your good  i cant help it ma replied morleena also in tears my hair will grow  dont talk to me you naughty thing said mrs kenwigs dont even if i was to trust you by yourself and you were to escape being run over i know youd run in to laura chopkins who was the daughter of the ambitious neighbour and tell her what youre going to wear tomorrow i know you would youve no proper pride in yourself and are not to be trusted out of sight for an instant  deploring the evilmindedness of her eldest daughter in these terms mrs kenwigs distilled fresh drops of vexation from her eyes and declared that she did believe there never was anybody so tried as she was thereupon morleena kenwigs wept afresh and they bemoaned themselves together  matters were at this point as newman noggs was heard to limp past the door on his way upstairs when mrs kenwigs gaining new hope from the sound of his footsteps hastily removed from her countenance as many traces of her late emotion as were effaceable on so short a notice and presenting herself before him and representing their dilemma entreated that he would escort morleena to the hairdressers shop  i wouldnt ask you mr noggs said mrs kenwigs if i didnt know what a good kindhearted creature you are no not for worlds i am a weak constitution mr noggs but my spirit would no more let me ask a favour where i thought there was a chance of its being refused than it would let me submit to see my children trampled down and trod upon by envy and lowness  newman was too goodnatured not to have consented even without this avowal of confidence on the part of mrs kenwigs accordingly a very few minutes had elapsed when he and miss morleena were on their way to the hairdressers  it was not exactly a hairdressers that is to say people of a coarse and vulgar turn of mind might have called it a barbers for they not only cut and curled ladies elegantly and children carefully but shaved gentlemen easily still it was a highly genteel establishmentquite firstrate in factand there were displayed in the window besides other elegancies waxen busts of a light lady and a dark gentleman which were the admiration of the whole neighbourhood indeed some ladies had gone so far as to assert that the dark gentleman was actually a portrait of the spirted young proprietor and the great similarity between their headdressesboth wore very glossy hair with a narrow walk straight down the middle and a profusion of flat circular curls on both sidesencouraged the idea the better informed among the sex however made light of this assertion for however willing they were and they were very willing to do full justice to the handsome face and figure of the proprietor they held the countenance of the dark gentleman in the window to be an exquisite and abstract idea of masculine beauty realised sometimes perhaps among angels and military men but very rarely embodied to gladden the eyes of mortals  it was to this establishment that newman noggs led miss kenwigs in safety the proprietor knowing that miss kenwigs had three sisters each with two flaxen tails and all good for sixpence apiece once a month at least promptly deserted an old gentleman whom he had just lathered for shaving and handing him over to the journeyman who was not very popular among the ladies by reason of his obesity and middle age waited on the young lady himself  just as this change had been effected there presented himself for shaving a big burly goodhumoured coalheaver with a pipe in his mouth who drawing his hand across his chin requested to know when a shaver would be disengaged  the journeyman to whom this question was put looked doubtfully at the young proprietor and the young proprietor looked scornfully at the coalheaver observing at the same time  you wont get shaved here my man  why not said the coalheaver  we dont shave gentlemen in your line remarked the young proprietor  why i see you a shaving of a baker when i was a looking through the winder last week said the coalheaver  its necessary to draw the line somewheres my fine feller replied the principal we draw the line there we cant go beyond bakers if we was to get any lower than bakers our customers would desert us and we might shut up shop you must try some other establishment sir we couldnt do it here  the applicant stared grinned at newman noggs who appeared highly entertained looked slightly round the shop as if in depreciation of the pomatum pots and other articles of stock took his pipe out of his mouth and gave a very loud whistle and then put it in again and walked out  the old gentleman who had just been lathered and who was sitting in a melancholy manner with his face turned towards the wall appeared quite unconscious of this incident and to be insensible to everything around him in the depth of a reveriea very mournful one to judge from the sighs he occasionally ventedin which he was absorbed affected by this example the proprietor began to clip miss kenwigs the journeyman to scrape the old gentleman and newman noggs to read last sundays paper all three in silence when miss kenwigs uttered a shrill little scream and newman raising his eyes saw that it had been elicited by the circumstance of the old gentleman turning his head and disclosing the features of mr lillyvick the collector  the features of mr lillyvick they were but strangely altered if ever an old gentleman had made a point of appearing in public shaved close and clean that old gentleman was mr lillyvick if ever a collector had borne himself like a collector and assumed before all men a solemn and portentous dignity as if he had the world on his books and it was all two quarters in arrear that collector was mr lillyvick and now there he sat with the remains of a beard at least a week old encumbering his chin a soiled and crumpled shirtfrill crouching as it were upon his breast instead of standing boldly out a demeanour so abashed and drooping so despondent and expressive of such humiliation grief and shame that if the souls of forty unsubstantial housekeepers all of whom had had their water cut off for nonpayment of the rate could have been concentrated in one body that one body could hardly have expressed such mortification and defeat as were now expressed in the person of mr lillyvick the collector  newman noggs uttered his name and mr lillyvick groaned then coughed to hide it but the groan was a fullsized groan and the cough was but a wheeze  is anything the matter said newman noggs  matter sir cried mr lillyvick the plug of life is dry sir and but the mud is left  this speechthe style of which newman attributed to mr lillyvicks recent association with theatrical charactersnot being quite explanatory newman looked as if he were about to ask another question when mr lillyvick prevented him by shaking his hand mournfully and then waving his own  let me be shaved said mr lillyvick it shall be done before morleena it is morleena isnt it  yes said newman  kenwigses have got a boy havent they inquired the collector  again newman said yes  is it a nice boy demanded the collector  it aint a very nasty one returned newman rather embarrassed by the question  susan kenwigs used to say observed the collector that if ever she had another boy she hoped it might be like me is this one like me mr noggs  this was a puzzling inquiry but newman evaded it by replying to mr lillyvick that he thought the baby might possibly come like him in time  i should be glad to have somebody like me somehow said mr lillyvick before i die  you dont mean to do that yet awhile said newman  unto which mr lillyvick replied in a solemn voice let me be shaved and again consigning himself to the hands of the journeyman said no more  this was remarkable behaviour so remarkable did it seem to miss morleena that that young lady at the imminent hazard of having her ear sliced off had not been able to forbear looking round some score of times during the foregoing colloquy of her however mr lillyvick took no notice rather striving so at least it seemed to newman noggs to evade her observation and to shrink into himself whenever he attracted her regards newman wondered very much what could have occasioned this altered behaviour on the part of the collector but philosophically reflecting that he would most likely know sooner or later and that he could perfectly afford to wait he was very little disturbed by the singularity of the old gentlemans deportment  the cutting and curling being at last concluded the old gentleman who had been some time waiting rose to go and walking out with newman and his charge took newmans arm and proceeded for some time without making any observation newman who in power of taciturnity was excelled by few people made no attempt to break silence and so they went on until they had very nearly reached miss morleenas home when mr lillyvick said  were the kenwigses very much overpowered mr noggs by that news  what news returned newman  that aboutmybeing  married suggested newman  ah replied mr lillyvick with another groan this time not even disguised by a wheeze  it made ma cry when she knew it interposed miss morleena but we kept it from her for a long time and pa was very low in his spirits but he is better now and i was very ill but i am better too  would you give your greatuncle lillyvick a kiss if he was to ask you morleena said the collector with some hesitation  yes uncle lillyvick i would returned miss morleena with the energy of both her parents combined but not aunt lillyvick shes not an aunt of mine and ill never call her one  immediately upon the utterance of these words mr lillyvick caught miss morleena up in his arms and kissed her and being by this time at the door of the house where mr kenwigs lodged which as has been before mentioned usually stood wide open he walked straight up into mr kenwigss sittingroom and put miss morleena down in the midst mr and mrs kenwigs were at supper at sight of their perjured relative mrs kenwigs turned faint and pale and mr kenwigs rose majestically  kenwigs said the collector shake hands  sir said mr kenwigs the time has been when i was proud to shake hands with such a man as that man as now surweys me the time has been sir said mr kenwigs when a wisit from that man has excited in me and my familys boozums sensations both nateral and awakening but now i look upon that man with emotions totally surpassing everythink and i ask myself where is his honour where is his straightforardness and where is his human natur  susan kenwigs said mr lillyvick turning humbly to his niece dont you say anything to me  she is not equal to it sir said mr kenwigs striking the table emphatically what with the nursing of a healthy babby and the reflections upon your cruel conduct four pints of malt liquor a day is hardly able to sustain her  i am glad said the poor collector meekly that the baby is a healthy one i am very glad of that  this was touching the kenwigses on their tenderest point mrs kenwigs instantly burst into tears and mr kenwigs evinced great emotion  my pleasantest feeling all the time that child was expected said mr kenwigs mournfully was a thinking if its a boy as i hope it may be for i have heard its uncle lillyvick say again and again he would prefer our having a boy next if its a boy what will his uncle lillyvick say what will he like him to be called will he be peter or alexander or pompey or diorgeenes or what will he be and now when i look at him a precious unconscious helpless infant with no use in his little arms but to tear his little cap and no use in his little legs but to kick his little selfwhen i see him a lying on his mothers lap cooing and cooing and in his innocent state almost a choking hisself with his little fistwhen i see him such a infant as he is and think that that uncle lillyvick as was once agoing to be so fond of him has withdrawed himself away such a feeling of wengeance comes over me as no language can depicter and i feel as if even that holy babe was a telling me to hate him  this affecting picture moved mrs kenwigs deeply after several imperfect words which vainly attempted to struggle to the surface but were drowned and washed away by the strong tide of her tears she spake  uncle said mrs kenwigs to think that you should have turned your back upon me and my dear children and upon kenwigs which is the author of their beingyou who was once so kind and affectionate and who if anybody had told us such a thing of we should have withered with scorn like lightningyou that little lillyvick our first and earliest boy was named after at the very altar oh gracious  was it money that we cared for said mr kenwigs was it property that we ever thought of  no cried mrs kenwigs i scorn it  so do i said mr kenwigs and always did  my feelings have been lancerated said mrs kenwigs my heart has been torn asunder with anguish i have been thrown back in my confinement my unoffending infant has been rendered uncomfortable and fractious morleena has pined herself away to nothing all this i forget and forgive and with you uncle i never can quarrel but never ask me to receive her never do it uncle for i will not i will not i wont i wont i wont  susan my dear said mr kenwigs consider your child  yes shrieked mrs kenwigs i will consider my child i will consider my child my own child that no uncles can deprive me of my own hated despised deserted cutoff little child and here the emotions of mrs kenwigs became so violent that mr kenwigs was fain to administer hartshorn internally and vinegar externally and to destroy a staylace four petticoat strings and several small buttons  newman had been a silent spectator of this scene for mr lillyvick had signed to him not to withdraw and mr kenwigs had further solicited his presence by a nod of invitation when mrs kenwigs had been in some degree restored and newman as a person possessed of some influence with her had remonstrated and begged her to compose herself mr lillyvick said in a faltering voice  i never shall ask anybody here to receive myi neednt mention the word you know what i mean kenwigs and susan yesterday was a week she eloped with a halfpay captain  mr and mrs kenwigs started together  eloped with a halfpay captain repeated mr lillyvick basely and falsely eloped with a halfpay captain with a bottlenosed captain that any man might have considered himself safe from it was in this room said mr lillyvick looking sternly round that i first see henrietta petowker it is in this room that i turn her off for ever  this declaration completely changed the whole posture of affairs mrs kenwigs threw herself upon the old gentlemans neck bitterly reproaching herself for her late harshness and exclaiming if she had suffered what must his sufferings have been mr kenwigs grasped his hand and vowed eternal friendship and remorse mrs kenwigs was horrorstricken to think that she should ever have nourished in her bosom such a snake adder viper serpent and base crocodile as henrietta petowker mr kenwigs argued that she must have been bad indeed not to have improved by so long a contemplation of mrs kenwigss virtue mrs kenwigs remembered that mr kenwigs had often said that he was not quite satisfied of the propriety of miss petowkers conduct and wondered how it was that she could have been blinded by such a wretch mr kenwigs remembered that he had had his suspicions but did not wonder why mrs kenwigs had not had hers as she was all chastity purity and truth and henrietta all baseness falsehood and deceit and mr and mrs kenwigs both said with strong feelings and tears of sympathy that everything happened for the best and conjured the good collector not to give way to unavailing grief but to seek consolation in the society of those affectionate relations whose arms and hearts were ever open to him  out of affection and regard for you susan and kenwigs said mr lillyvick and not out of revenge and spite against her for she is below it i shall tomorrow morning settle upon your children and make payable to the survivors of them when they come of age of marry that money that i once meant to leave em in my will the deed shall be executed tomorrow and mr noggs shall be one of the witnesses he hears me promise this and he shall see it done  overpowered by this noble and generous offer mr kenwigs mrs kenwigs and miss morleena kenwigs all began to sob together and the noise of their sobbing communicating itself to the next room where the children lay abed and causing them to cry too mr kenwigs rushed wildly in and bringing them out in his arms by two and two tumbled them down in their nightcaps and gowns at the feet of mr lillyvick and called upon them to thank and bless him  and now said mr lillyvick when a heartrending scene had ensued and the children were cleared away again give me some supper this took place twenty mile from town i came up this morning and have being lingering about all day without being able to make up my mind to come and see you i humoured her in everything she had her own way she did just as she pleased and now she has done this there was twelve teaspoons and twentyfour pound in sovereignsi missed them firstits a triali feel i shall never be able to knock a double knock again when i go my roundsdont say anything more about it pleasethe spoons were worthnever mindnever mind  with such muttered outpourings as these the old gentleman shed a few tears but they got him into the elbowchair and prevailed upon him without much pressing to make a hearty supper and by the time he had finished his first pipe and disposed of halfadozen glasses out of a crown bowl of punch ordered by mr kenwigs in celebration of his return to the bosom of his family he seemed though still very humble quite resigned to his fate and rather relieved than otherwise by the flight of his wife  when i see that man said mr kenwigs with one hand round mrs kenwigss waist his other hand supporting his pipe which made him wink and cough very much for he was no smoker and his eyes on morleena who sat upon her uncles knee when i see that man as mingling once again in the spear which he adorns and see his affections deweloping themselves in legitimate sitiwations i feel that his nature is as elewated and expanded as his standing afore society as a public character is unimpeached and the woices of my infant children purvided for in life seem to whisper to me softly this is an ewent at which evins itself looks down    chapter 53  containing the further progress of the plot contrived by mr ralph nickleby and mr arthur gride   with that settled resolution and steadiness of purpose to which extreme circumstances so often give birth acting upon far less excitable and more sluggish temperaments than that which was the lot of madeline brays admirer nicholas started at dawn of day from the restless couch which no sleep had visited on the previous night and prepared to make that last appeal by whose slight and fragile thread her only remaining hope of escape depended  although to restless and ardent minds morning may be the fitting season for exertion and activity it is not always at that time that hope is strongest or the spirit most sanguine and buoyant in trying and doubtful positions youth custom a steady contemplation of the difficulties which surround us and a familiarity with them imperceptibly diminish our apprehensions and beget comparative indifference if not a vague and reckless confidence in some relief the means or nature of which we care not to foresee but when we come fresh upon such things in the morning with that dark and silent gap between us and yesterday with every link in the brittle chain of hope to rivet afresh our hot enthusiasm subdued and cool calm reason substituted in its stead doubt and misgiving revive as the traveller sees farthest by day and becomes aware of rugged mountains and trackless plains which the friendly darkness had shrouded from his sight and mind together so the wayfarer in the toilsome path of human life sees with each returning sun some new obstacle to surmount some new height to be attained distances stretch out before him which last night were scarcely taken into account and the light which gilds all nature with its cheerful beams seems but to shine upon the weary obstacles that yet lie strewn between him and the grave  so thought nicholas when with the impatience natural to a situation like his he softly left the house and feeling as though to remain in bed were to lose most precious time and to be up and stirring were in some way to promote the end he had in view wandered into london perfectly well knowing that for hours to come he could not obtain speech with madeline and could do nothing but wish the intervening time away  and even now as he paced the streets and listlessly looked round on the gradually increasing bustle and preparation for the day everything appeared to yield him some new occasion for despondency last night the sacrifice of a young affectionate and beautiful creature to such a wretch and in such a cause had seemed a thing too monstrous to succeed and the warmer he grew the more confident he felt that some interposition must save her from his clutches but now when he thought how regularly things went on from day to day in the same unvarying round how youth and beauty died and ugly griping age lived tottering on how crafty avarice grew rich and manly honest hearts were poor and sad how few they were who tenanted the stately houses and how many of those who lay in noisome pens or rose each day and laid them down each night and lived and died father and son mother and child race upon race and generation upon generation without a home to shelter them or the energies of one single man directed to their aid how in seeking not a luxurious and splendid life but the bare means of a most wretched and inadequate subsistence there were women and children in that one town divided into classes numbered and estimated as regularly as the noble families and folks of great degree and reared from infancy to drive most criminal and dreadful trades how ignorance was punished and never taught how jaildoors gaped and gallows loomed for thousands urged towards them by circumstances darkly curtaining their very cradles heads and but for which they might have earned their honest bread and lived in peace how many died in soul and had no chance of life how many who could scarcely go astray be they vicious as they would turned haughtily from the crushed and stricken wretch who could scarce do otherwise and who would have been a greater wonder had he or she done well than even they had they done ill how much injustice misery and wrong there was and yet how the world rolled on from year to year alike careless and indifferent and no man seeking to remedy or redress it when he thought of all this and selected from the mass the one slight case on which his thoughts were bent he felt indeed that there was little ground for hope and little reason why it should not form an atom in the huge aggregate of distress and sorrow and add one small and unimportant unit to swell the great amount  but youth is not prone to contemplate the darkest side of a picture it can shift at will by dint of reflecting on what he had to do and reviving the train of thought which night had interrupted nicholas gradually summoned up his utmost energy and when the morning was sufficiently advanced for his purpose had no thought but that of using it to the best advantage a hasty breakfast taken and such affairs of business as required prompt attention disposed of he directed his steps to the residence of madeline bray whither he lost no time in arriving  it had occurred to him that very possibly the young lady might be denied although to him she never had been and he was still pondering upon the surest method of obtaining access to her in that case when coming to the door of the house he found it had been left ajarprobably by the last person who had gone out the occasion was not one upon which to observe the nicest ceremony therefore availing himself of this advantage nicholas walked gently upstairs and knocked at the door of the room into which he had been accustomed to be shown receiving permission to enter from some person on the other side he opened the door and walked in  bray and his daughter were sitting there alone it was nearly three weeks since he had seen her last but there was a change in the lovely girl before him which told nicholas in startling terms how much mental suffering had been compressed into that short time there are no words which can express nothing with which can be compared the perfect pallor the clear transparent whiteness of the beautiful face which turned towards him when he entered her hair was a rich deep brown but shading that face and straying upon a neck that rivalled it in whiteness it seemed by the strong contrast raven black something of wildness and restlessness there was in the dark eye but there was the same patient look the same expression of gentle mournfulness which he well remembered and no trace of a single tear most beautifulmore beautiful perhaps than everthere was something in her face which quite unmanned him and appeared far more touching than the wildest agony of grief it was not merely calm and composed but fixed and rigid as though the violent effort which had summoned that composure beneath her fathers eye while it mastered all other thoughts had prevented even the momentary expression they had communicated to the features from subsiding and had fastened it there as an evidence of its triumph  the father sat opposite to her not looking directly in her face but glancing at her as he talked with a gay air which ill disguised the anxiety of his thoughts the drawing materials were not on their accustomed table nor were any of the other tokens of her usual occupations to be seen the little vases which nicholas had always seen filled with fresh flowers were empty or supplied only with a few withered stalks and leaves the bird was silent the cloth that covered his cage at night was not removed his mistress had forgotten him  there are times when the mind being painfully alive to receive impressions a great deal may be noted at a glance this was one for nicholas had but glanced round him when he was recognised by mr bray who said impatiently  now sir what do you want name your errand here quickly if you please for my daughter and i are busily engaged with other and more important matters than those you come about come sir address yourself to your business at once  nicholas could very well discern that the irritability and impatience of this speech were assumed and that bray in his heart was rejoiced at any interruption which promised to engage the attention of his daughter he bent his eyes involuntarily upon the father as he spoke and marked his uneasiness for he coloured and turned his head away  the device however so far as it was a device for causing madeline to interfere was successful she rose and advancing towards nicholas paused halfway and stretched out her hand as expecting a letter  madeline said her father impatiently my love what are you doing  miss bray expects an inclosure perhaps said nicholas speaking very distinctly and with an emphasis she could scarcely misunderstand my employer is absent from england or i should have brought a letter with me i hope she will give me timea little time i ask a very little time  if that is all you come about sir said mr bray you may make yourself easy on that head madeline my dear i didnt know this person was in your debt  aa trifle i believe returned madeline faintly  i suppose you think now said bray wheeling his chair round and confronting nicholas that but for such pitiful sums as you bring here because my daughter has chosen to employ her time as she has we should starve  i have not thought about it returned nicholas  you have not thought about it sneered the invalid you know you have thought about it and have thought that and think so every time you come here do you suppose young man that i dont know what little purseproud tradesmen are when through some fortunate circumstances they get the upper hand for a brief dayor think they get the upper handof a gentleman  my business said nicholas respectfully is with a lady  with a gentlemans daughter sir returned the sick man and the pettifogging spirit is the same but perhaps you bring orders eh have you any fresh orders for my daughter sir  nicholas understood the tone of triumph in which this interrogatory was put but remembering the necessity of supporting his assumed character produced a scrap of paper purporting to contain a list of some subjects for drawings which his employer desired to have executed and with which he had prepared himself in case of any such contingency  oh said mr bray these are the orders are they  since you insist upon the term sir yes replied nicholas  then you may tell your master said bray tossing the paper back again with an exulting smile that my daughter miss madeline bray condescends to employ herself no longer in such labours as these that she is not at his beck and call as he supposes her to be that we dont live upon his money as he flatters himself we do that he may give whatever he owes us to the first beggar that passes his shop or add it to his own profits next time he calculates them and that he may go to the devil for me thats my acknowledgment of his orders sir  and this is the independence of a man who sells his daughter as he has sold that weeping girl thought nicholas  the father was too much absorbed with his own exultation to mark the look of scorn which for an instant nicholas could not have suppressed had he been upon the rack there he continued after a short silence you have your message and can retireunless you have any furtherhaany further orders  i have none said nicholas nor in the consideration of the station you once held have i used that or any other word which however harmless in itself could be supposed to imply authority on my part or dependence on yours i have no orders but i have fearsfears that i will express chafe as you mayfears that you may be consigning that young lady to something worse than supporting you by the labour of her hands had she worked herself dead these are my fears and these fears i found upon your own demeanour your conscience will tell you sir whether i construe it well or not  for heavens sake cried madeline interposing in alarm between them remember sir he is ill  ill cried the invalid gasping and catching for breath ill ill i am bearded and bullied by a shopboy and she beseeches him to pity me and remember i am ill  he fell into a paroxysm of his disorder so violent that for a few moments nicholas was alarmed for his life but finding that he began to recover he withdrew after signifying by a gesture to the young lady that he had something important to communicate and would wait for her outside the room he could hear that the sick man came gradually but slowly to himself and that without any reference to what had just occurred as though he had no distinct recollection of it as yet he requested to be left alone  oh thought nicholas that this slender chance might not be lost and that i might prevail if it were but for one weeks time and reconsideration  you are charged with some commission to me sir said madeline presenting herself in great agitation do not press it now i beg and pray you the day after tomorrow come here then  it will be too latetoo late for what i have to say rejoined nicholas and you will not be here oh madam if you have but one thought of him who sent me here but one last lingering care for your own peace of mind and heart i do for gods sake urge you to give me a hearing  she attempted to pass him but nicholas gently detained her  a hearing said nicholas i ask you but to hear me not me alone but him for whom i speak who is far away and does not know your danger in the name of heaven hear me  the poor attendant with her eyes swollen and red with weeping stood by and to her nicholas appealed in such passionate terms that she opened a sidedoor and supporting her mistress into an adjoining room beckoned nicholas to follow them  leave me sir pray said the young lady  i cannot will not leave you thus returned nicholas i have a duty to discharge and either here or in the room from which we have just now come at whatever risk or hazard to mr bray i must beseech you to contemplate again the fearful course to which you have been impelled  what course is this you speak of and impelled by whom sir demanded the young lady with an effort to speak proudly  i speak of this marriage returned nicholas of this marriage fixed for tomorrow by one who never faltered in a bad purpose or lent his aid to any good design of this marriage the history of which is known to me better far better than it is to you i know what web is wound about you i know what men they are from whom these schemes have come you are betrayed and sold for money for gold whose every coin is rusted with tears if not red with the blood of ruined men who have fallen desperately by their own mad hands  you say you have a duty to discharge said madeline and so have i and with the help of heaven i will perform it  say rather with the help of devils replied nicholas with the help of men one of them your destined husband who are  i must not hear this cried the young lady striving to repress a shudder occasioned as it seemed even by this slight allusion to arthur gride this evil if evil it be has been of my own seeking i am impelled to this course by no one but follow it of my own free will you see i am not constrained or forced report this said madeline to my dear friend and benefactor and taking with you my prayers and thanks for him and for yourself leave me for ever  not until i have besought you with all the earnestness and fervour by which i am animated cried nicholas to postpone this marriage for one short week not until i have besought you to think more deeply than you can have done influenced as you are upon the step you are about to take although you cannot be fully conscious of the villainy of this man to whom you are about to give your hand some of his deeds you know you have heard him speak and have looked upon his face reflect reflect before it is too late on the mockery of plighting to him at the altar faith in which your heart can have no shareof uttering solemn words against which nature and reason must rebelof the degradation of yourself in your own esteem which must ensue and must be aggravated every day as his detested character opens upon you more and more shrink from the loathsome companionship of this wretch as you would from corruption and disease suffer toil and labour if you will but shun him shun him and be happy for believe me i speak the truth the most abject poverty the most wretched condition of human life with a pure and upright mind would be happiness to that which you must undergo as the wife of such a man as this  long before nicholas ceased to speak the young lady buried her face in her hands and gave her tears free way in a voice at first inarticulate with emotion but gradually recovering strength as she proceeded she answered him  i will not disguise from you sirthough perhaps i oughtthat i have undergone great pain of mind and have been nearly brokenhearted since i saw you last i do not love this gentleman the difference between our ages tastes and habits forbids it this he knows and knowing still offers me his hand by accepting it and by that step alone i can release my father who is dying in this place prolong his life perhaps for many years restore him to comforti may almost call it affluence and relieve a generous man from the burden of assisting one by whom i grieve to say his noble heart is little understood do not think so poorly of me as to believe that i feign a love i do not feel do not report so ill of me for that i could not bear if i cannot in reason or in nature love the man who pays this price for my poor hand i can discharge the duties of a wife i can be all he seeks in me and will he is content to take me as i am i have passed my word and should rejoice not weep that it is so i do the interest you take in one so friendless and forlorn as i the delicacy with which you have discharged your trust the faith you have kept with me have my warmest thanks and while i make this last feeble acknowledgment move me to tears as you see but i do not repent nor am i unhappy i am happy in the prospect of all i can achieve so easily i shall be more so when i look back upon it and all is done i know  your tears fall faster as you talk of happiness said nicholas and you shun the contemplation of that dark future which must be laden with so much misery to you defer this marriage for a week for but one week  he was talking when you came upon us just now with such smiles as i remember to have seen of old and have not seen for many and many a day of the freedom that was to come tomorrow said madeline with momentary firmness of the welcome change the fresh air all the new scenes and objects that would bring fresh life to his exhausted frame his eye grew bright and his face lightened at the thought i will not defer it for an hour  these are but tricks and wiles to urge you on cried nicholas  ill hear no more said madeline hurriedly i have heard too muchmore than i shouldalready what i have said to you sir i have said as to that dear friend to whom i trust in you honourably to repeat it some time hence when i am more composed and reconciled to my new mode of life if i should live so long i will write to him meantime all holy angels shower blessings on his head and prosper and preserve him  she was hurrying past nicholas when he threw himself before her and implored her to think but once again upon the fate to which she was precipitately hastening  there is no retreat said nicholas in an agony of supplication no withdrawing all regret will be unavailing and deep and bitter it must be what can i say that will induce you to pause at this last moment what can i do to save you  nothing she incoherently replied this is the hardest trial i have had have mercy on me sir i beseech and do not pierce my heart with such appeals as these ii hear him calling iimust not will not remain here for another instant  if this were a plot said nicholas with the same violent rapidity with which she spoke a plot not yet laid bare by me but which with time i might unravel if you were not knowing it entitled to fortune of your own which being recovered would do all that this marriage can accomplish would you not retract  no no no it is impossible it is a childs tale time would bring his death he is calling again  it may be the last time we shall ever meet on earth said nicholas it may be better for me that we should never meet more  for both for both replied madeline not heeding what she said the time will come when to recall the memory of this one interview might drive me mad be sure to tell them that you left me calm and happy and god be with you sir and my grateful heart and blessing  she was gone nicholas staggering from the house thought of the hurried scene which had just closed upon him as if it were the phantom of some wild unquiet dream the day wore on at night having been enabled in some measure to collect his thoughts he issued forth again  that night being the last of arthur grides bachelorship found him in tiptop spirits and great glee the bottlegreen suit had been brushed ready for the morrow peg sliderskew had rendered the accounts of her past housekeeping the eighteenpence had been rigidly accounted for she was never trusted with a larger sum at once and the accounts were not usually balanced more than twice a day every preparation had been made for the coming festival and arthur might have sat down and contemplated his approaching happiness but that he preferred sitting down and contemplating the entries in a dirty old vellumbook with rusty clasps  welladay he chuckled as sinking on his knees before a strong chest screwed down to the floor he thrust in his arm nearly up to the shoulder and slowly drew forth this greasy volume welladay now this is all my library but its one of the most entertaining books that were ever written its a delightful book and all true and realthats the best of ittrue as the bank of england and real as its gold and silver written by arthur gride he he he none of your storybook writers will ever make as good a book as this i warrant me its composed for private circulation for my own particular reading and nobody elses he he he  muttering this soliloquy arthur carried his precious volume to the table and adjusting it upon a dusty desk put on his spectacles and began to pore among the leaves  its a large sum to mr nickleby he said in a dolorous voice debt to be paid in full nine hundred and seventyfive four three additional sum as per bond five hundred pound one thousand four hundred and seventyfive pounds four shillings and threepence tomorrow at twelve oclock on the other side though theres the per contra by means of this pretty chick but again theres the question whether i mightnt have brought all this about myself faint heart never won fair lady why was my heart so faint why didnt i boldly open it to bray myself and save one thousand four hundred and seventyfive four three  these reflections depressed the old usurer so much as to wring a feeble groan or two from his breast and cause him to declare with uplifted hands that he would die in a workhouse remembering on further cogitation however that under any circumstances he must have paid or handsomely compounded for ralphs debt and being by no means confident that he would have succeeded had he undertaken his enterprise alone he regained his equanimity and chattered and mowed over more satisfactory items until the entrance of peg sliderskew interrupted him  aha peg said arthur what is it what is it now peg  its the fowl replied peg holding up a plate containing a little a very little one quite a phenomenon of a fowl so very small and skinny  a beautiful bird said arthur after inquiring the price and finding it proportionate to the size with a rasher of ham and an egg made into sauce and potatoes and greens and an apple pudding peg and a little bit of cheese we shall have a dinner for an emperor therell only be she and meand you peg when weve done  dont you complain of the expense afterwards said mrs sliderskew sulkily  i am afraid we must live expensively for the first week returned arthur with a groan and then we must make up for it i wont eat more than i can help and i know you love your old master too much to eat more than you can help dont you peg  dont i what said peg  love your old master too much  no not a bit too much said peg  oh dear i wish the devil had this woman cried arthur love him too much to eat more than you can help at his expense  at his what said peg  oh dear she can never hear the most important word and hears all the others whined gride at his expenseyou catamaran  the lastmentioned tribute to the charms of mrs sliderskew being uttered in a whisper that lady assented to the general proposition by a harsh growl which was accompanied by a ring at the streetdoor  theres the bell said arthur  ay ay i know that rejoined peg  then why dont you go bawled arthur  go where retorted peg i aint doing any harm here am i  arthur gride in reply repeated the word bell as loud as he could roar and his meaning being rendered further intelligible to mrs sliderskews dull sense of hearing by pantomime expressive of ringing at a streetdoor peg hobbled out after sharply demanding why he hadnt said there was a ring before instead of talking about all manner of things that had nothing to do with it and keeping her halfpint of beer waiting on the steps  theres a change come over you mrs peg said arthur following her out with his eyes what it means i dont quite know but if it lasts we shant agree together long i see you are turning crazy i think if you are you must take yourself off mrs pegor be taken off alls one to me turning over the leaves of his book as he muttered this he soon lighted upon something which attracted his attention and forgot peg sliderskew and everything else in the engrossing interest of its pages  the room had no other light than that which it derived from a dim and dirtclogged lamp whose lazy wick being still further obscured by a dark shade cast its feeble rays over a very little space and left all beyond in heavy shadow this lamp the moneylender had drawn so close to him that there was only room between it and himself for the book over which he bent and as he sat with his elbows on the desk and his sharp cheekbones resting on his hands it only served to bring out his ugly features in strong relief together with the little table at which he sat and to shroud all the rest of the chamber in a deep sullen gloom raising his eyes and looking vacantly into this gloom as he made some mental calculation arthur gride suddenly met the fixed gaze of a man  thieves thieves shrieked the usurer starting up and folding his book to his breast robbers murder  what is the matter said the form advancing  keep off cried the trembling wretch is it a man or aa  for what do you take me if not for a man was the inquiry  yes yes cried arthur gride shading his eyes with his hand it is a man and not a spirit it is a man robbers robbers  for what are these cries raised unless indeed you know me and have some purpose in your brain said the stranger coming close up to him i am no thief  what then and how come you here cried gride somewhat reassured but still retreating from his visitor what is your name and what do you want  my name you need not know was the reply i came here because i was shown the way by your servant i have addressed you twice or thrice but you were too profoundly engaged with your book to hear me and i have been silently waiting until you should be less abstracted what i want i will tell you when you can summon up courage enough to hear and understand me  arthur gride venturing to regard his visitor more attentively and perceiving that he was a young man of good mien and bearing returned to his seat and muttering that there were bad characters about and that this with former attempts upon his house had made him nervous requested his visitor to sit down this however he declined  good god i dont stand up to have you at an advantage said nicholas for nicholas it was as he observed a gesture of alarm on the part of gride listen to me you are to be married tomorrow morning  nnno rejoined gride who said i was how do you know that  no matter how replied nicholas i know it the young lady who is to give you her hand hates and despises you her blood runs cold at the mention of your name the vulture and the lamb the rat and the dove could not be worse matched than you and she you see i know her  gride looked at him as if he were petrified with astonishment but did not speak perhaps lacking the power  you and another man ralph nickleby by name have hatched this plot between you pursued nicholas you pay him for his share in bringing about this sale of madeline bray you do a lie is trembling on your lips i see  he paused but arthur making no reply resumed again  you pay yourself by defrauding her how or by what meansfor i scorn to sully her cause by falsehood or deceiti do not know at present i do not know but i am not alone or singlehanded in this business if the energy of man can compass the discovery of your fraud and treachery before your death if wealth revenge and just hatred can hunt and track you through your windings you will yet be called to a dear account for this we are on the scent already judge you who know what we do not when we shall have you down  he paused again and still arthur gride glared upon him in silence  if you were a man to whom i could appeal with any hope of touching his compassion or humanity said nicholas i would urge upon you to remember the helplessness the innocence the youth of this lady her worth and beauty her filial excellence and last and more than all as concerning you more nearly the appeal she has made to your mercy and your manly feeling but i take the only ground that can be taken with men like you and ask what money will buy you off remember the danger to which you are exposed you see i know enough to know much more with very little help bate some expected gain for the risk you save and say what is your price  old arthur gride moved his lips but they only formed an ugly smile and were motionless again  you think said nicholas that the price would not be paid miss bray has wealthy friends who would coin their very hearts to save her in such a strait as this name your price defer these nuptials for but a few days and see whether those i speak of shrink from the payment do you hear me  when nicholas began arthur grides impression was that ralph nickleby had betrayed him but as he proceeded he felt convinced that however he had come by the knowledge he possessed the part he acted was a genuine one and that with ralph he had no concern all he seemed to know for certain was that he gride paid ralphs debt but that to anybody who knew the circumstances of brays detentioneven to bray himself on ralphs own statementmust be perfectly notorious as to the fraud on madeline herself his visitor knew so little about its nature or extent that it might be a lucky guess or a haphazard accusation whether or no he had clearly no key to the mystery and could not hurt him who kept it close within his own breast the allusion to friends and the offer of money gride held to be mere empty vapouring for purposes of delay and even if money were to be had thought arthur gride as he glanced at nicholas and trembled with passion at his boldness and audacity id have that dainty chick for my wife and cheat you of her young smoothface  long habit of weighing and noting well what clients said and nicely balancing chances in his mind and calculating odds to their faces without the least appearance of being so engaged had rendered gride quick in forming conclusions and arriving from puzzling intricate and often contradictory premises at very cunning deductions hence it was that as nicholas went on he followed him closely with his own constructions and when he ceased to speak was as well prepared as if he had deliberated for a fortnight  i hear you he cried starting from his seat casting back the fastenings of the windowshutters and throwing up the sash help here help help  what are you doing said nicholas seizing him by the arm  ill cry robbers thieves murder alarm the neighbourhood struggle with you let loose some blood and swear you came to rob me if you dont quit my house replied gride drawing in his head with a frightful grin i will  wretch cried nicholas  youll bring your threats here will you said gride whom jealousy of nicholas and a sense of his own triumph had converted into a perfect fiend you the disappointed lover oh dear he he he but you shant have her nor she you shes my wife my doting little wife do you think shell miss you do you think shell weep i shall like to see her weep i shant mind it she looks prettier in tears  villain said nicholas choking with his rage  one minute more cried arthur gride and ill rouse the street with such screams as if they were raised by anybody else should wake me even in the arms of pretty madeline  you hound said nicholas if you were but a younger man  oh yes sneered arthur gride if i was but a younger man it wouldnt be so bad but for me so old and ugly to be jilted by little madeline for me  hear me said nicholas and be thankful i have enough command over myself not to fling you into the street which no aid could prevent my doing if i once grappled with you i have been no lover of this ladys no contract or engagement no word of love has ever passed between us she does not even know my name  ill ask it for all that ill beg it of her with kisses said arthur gride yes and shell tell me and pay them back and well laugh together and hug ourselves and be very merry when we think of the poor youth that wanted to have her but couldnt because she was bespoke by me  this taunt brought such an expression into the face of nicholas that arthur gride plainly apprehended it to be the forerunner of his putting his threat of throwing him into the street in immediate execution for he thrust his head out of the window and holding tight on with both hands raised a pretty brisk alarm not thinking it necessary to abide the issue of the noise nicholas gave vent to an indignant defiance and stalked from the room and from the house arthur gride watched him across the street and then drawing in his head fastened the window as before and sat down to take breath  if she ever turns pettish or illhumoured ill taunt her with that spark he said when he had recovered shell little think i know about him and if i manage it well i can break her spirit by this means and have her under my thumb im glad nobody came i didnt call too loud the audacity to enter my house and open upon me but i shall have a very good triumph tomorrow and hell be gnawing his fingers off perhaps drown himself or cut his throat i shouldnt wonder that would make it quite complete that would quite  when he had become restored to his usual condition by these and other comments on his approaching triumph arthur gride put away his book and having locked the chest with great caution descended into the kitchen to warn peg sliderskew to bed and scold her for having afforded such ready admission to a stranger  the unconscious peg however not being able to comprehend the offence of which she had been guilty he summoned her to hold the light while he made a tour of the fastenings and secured the streetdoor with his own hands  top bolt muttered arthur fastening as he spoke bottom bolt chain bar double lock and key out to put under my pillow so if any more rejected admirers come they may come through the keyhole and now ill go to sleep till halfpast five when i must get up to be married peg  with that he jocularly tapped mrs sliderskew under the chin and appeared for the moment inclined to celebrate the close of his bachelor days by imprinting a kiss on her shrivelled lips thinking better of it however he gave her chin another tap in lieu of that warmer familiarity and stole away to bed    chapter 54  the crisis of the project and its result   there are not many men who lie abed too late or oversleep themselves on their wedding morning a legend there is of somebody remarkable for absence of mind who opened his eyes upon the day which was to give him a young wife and forgetting all about the matter rated his servants for providing him with such fine clothes as had been prepared for the festival there is also a legend of a young gentleman who not having before his eyes the fear of the canons of the church for such cases made and provided conceived a passion for his grandmother both cases are of a singular and special kind and it is very doubtful whether either can be considered as a precedent likely to be extensively followed by succeeding generations  arthur gride had enrobed himself in his marriage garments of bottlegreen a full hour before mrs sliderskew shaking off her more heavy slumbers knocked at his chamber door and he had hobbled downstairs in full array and smacked his lips over a scanty taste of his favourite cordial ere that delicate piece of antiquity enlightened the kitchen with her presence  faugh said peg grubbing in the discharge of her domestic functions among a scanty heap of ashes in the rusty grate wedding indeed a precious wedding he wants somebody better than his old peg to take care of him does he and what has he said to me many and many a time to keep me content with short food small wages and little fire my will peg my will says he im a bachelorno friendsno relations peg lies and now hes to bring home a new mistress a babyfaced chit of a girl if he wanted a wife the fool why couldnt he have one suitable to his age and that knew his ways she wont come in my way he says no that she wont but you little think why arthur boy  while mrs sliderskew influenced possibly by some lingering feelings of disappointment and personal slight occasioned by her old masters preference for another was giving loose to these grumblings below stairs arthur gride was cogitating in the parlour upon what had taken place last night  i cant think how he can have picked up what he knows said arthur unless i have committed myselflet something drop at brays for instancewhich has been overheard perhaps i may i shouldnt be surprised if that was it mr nickleby was often angry at my talking to him before we got outside the door i mustnt tell him that part of the business or hell put me out of sorts and make me nervous for the day  ralph was universally looked up to and recognised among his fellows as a superior genius but upon arthur gride his stern unyielding character and consummate art had made so deep an impression that he was actually afraid of him cringing and cowardly to the core by nature arthur gride humbled himself in the dust before ralph nickleby and even when they had not this stake in common would have licked his shoes and crawled upon the ground before him rather than venture to return him word for word or retort upon him in any other spirit than one of the most slavish and abject sycophancy  to ralph nicklebys arthur gride now betook himself according to appointment and to ralph nickleby he related how last night some young blustering blade whom he had never seen forced his way into his house and tried to frighten him from the proposed nuptials told in short what nicholas had said and done with the slight reservation upon which he had determined  well and what then said ralph  oh nothing more rejoined gride  he tried to frighten you said ralph and you were frightened i suppose is that it  i frightened him by crying thieves and murder replied gride once i was in earnest i tell you that for i had more than half a mind to swear he uttered threats and demanded my life or my money  oho said ralph eyeing him askew jealous too  dear now see that cried arthur rubbing his hands and affecting to laugh  why do you make those grimaces man said ralph you are jealousand with good cause i think  no no no not with good cause hey you dont think with good cause do you cried arthur faltering do you though hey  why how stands the fact returned ralph here is an old man about to be forced in marriage upon a girl and to this old man there comes a handsome young fellowyou said he was handsome didnt you  no snarled arthur gride  oh rejoined ralph i thought you did well handsome or not handsome to this old man there comes a young fellow who casts all manner of fierce defiances in his teethgums i should rather sayand tells him in plain terms that his mistress hates him what does he do that for philanthropys sake  not for love of the lady replied gride for he said that no word of lovehis very wordshad ever passed between em  he said repeated ralph contemptuously but i like him for one thing and that is his giving you this fair warning to keep yourwhat is ittittit or dainty chickwhichunder lock and key be careful gride be careful its a triumph too to tear her away from a gallant young rival a great triumph for an old man it only remains to keep her safe when you have herthats all  what a man it is cried arthur gride affecting in the extremity of his torture to be highly amused and then he added anxiously yes to keep her safe thats all and that isnt much is it  much said ralph with a sneer why everybody knows what easy things to understand and to control women are but come its very nearly time for you to be made happy youll pay the bond now i suppose to save us trouble afterwards  oh what a man you are croaked arthur  why not said ralph nobody will pay you interest for the money i suppose between this and twelve oclock will they  but nobody would pay you interest for it either you know returned arthur leering at ralph with all the cunning and slyness he could throw into his face  besides which said ralph suffering his lip to curl into a smile you havent the money about you and you werent prepared for this or youd have brought it with you and theres nobody youd so much like to accommodate as me i see we trust each other in about an equal degree are you ready  gride who had done nothing but grin and nod and chatter during this last speech of ralphs answered in the affirmative and producing from his hat a couple of large white favours pinned one on his breast and with considerable difficulty induced his friend to do the like thus accoutred they got into a hired coach which ralph had in waiting and drove to the residence of the fair and most wretched bride  gride whose spirits and courage had gradually failed him more and more as they approached nearer and nearer to the house was utterly dismayed and cowed by the mournful silence which pervaded it the face of the poor servant girl the only person they saw was disfigured with tears and want of sleep there was nobody to receive or welcome them and they stole upstairs into the usual sittingroom more like two burglars than the bridegroom and his friend  one would think said ralph speaking in spite of himself in a low and subdued voice that there was a funeral going on here and not a wedding  he he tittered his friend you are soso very funny  i need be remarked ralph drily for this is rather dull and chilling look a little brisker man and not so hangdog like  yes yes i will said gride butbutyou dont think shes coming just yet do you  why i suppose shell not come till she is obliged returned ralph looking at his watch and she has a good halfhour to spare yet curb your impatience  iiam not impatient stammered arthur i wouldnt be hard with her for the world oh dear dear not on any account let her take her timeher own time her time shall be ours by all means  while ralph bent upon his trembling friend a keen look which showed that he perfectly understood the reason of this great consideration and regard a footstep was heard upon the stairs and bray himself came into the room on tiptoe and holding up his hand with a cautious gesture as if there were some sick person near who must not be disturbed  hush he said in a low voice she was very ill last night i thought she would have broken her heart she is dressed and crying bitterly in her own room but shes better and quite quiet thats everything  she is ready is she said ralph  quite ready returned the father  and not likely to delay us by any younglady weaknessesfainting or so forth said ralph  she may be safely trusted now returned bray i have been talking to her this morning here come a little this way  he drew ralph nickleby to the further end of the room and pointed towards gride who sat huddled together in a corner fumbling nervously with the buttons of his coat and exhibiting a face of which every skulking and base expression was sharpened and aggravated to the utmost by his anxiety and trepidation  look at that man whispered bray emphatically this seems a cruel thing after all  what seems a cruel thing inquired ralph with as much stolidity of face as if he really were in utter ignorance of the others meaning  this marriage answered bray dont ask me what you know as well as i do  ralph shrugged his shoulders in silent deprecation of brays impatience and elevated his eyebrows and pursed his lips as men do when they are prepared with a sufficient answer to some remark but wait for a more favourable opportunity of advancing it or think it scarcely worth while to answer their adversary at all  look at him does it not seem cruel said bray  no replied ralph boldly  i say it does retorted bray with a show of much irritation it is a cruel thing by all thats bad and treacherous  when men are about to commit or to sanction the commission of some injustice it is not uncommon for them to express pity for the object either of that or some parallel proceeding and to feel themselves at the time quite virtuous and moral and immensely superior to those who express no pity at all this is a kind of upholding of faith above works and is very comfortable to do ralph nickleby justice he seldom practised this sort of dissimulation but he understood those who did and therefore suffered bray to say again and again with great vehemence that they were jointly doing a very cruel thing before he again offered to interpose a word  you see what a dry shrivelled withered old chip it is returned ralph when the other was at length silent if he were younger it might be cruel but as it isharkee mr bray hell die soon and leave her a rich young widow miss madeline consults your tastes this time let her consult her own next  true true said bray biting his nails and plainly very ill at ease i couldnt do anything better for her than advise her to accept these proposals could i now i ask you nickleby as a man of the world could i  surely not answered ralph i tell you what sir there are a hundred fathers within a circuit of five miles from this place well off good rich substantial men who would gladly give their daughters and their own ears with them to that very man yonder ape and mummy as he looks  so there are exclaimed bray eagerly catching at anything which seemed a justification of himself and so i told her both last night and today  you told her truth said ralph and did well to do so though i must say at the same time that if i had a daughter and my freedom pleasure nay my very health and life depended on her taking a husband whom i pointed out i should hope it would not be necessary to advance any other arguments to induce her to consent to my wishes  bray looked at ralph as if to see whether he spoke in earnest and having nodded twice or thrice in unqualified assent to what had fallen from him said  i must go upstairs for a few minutes to finish dressing when i come down ill bring madeline with me do you know i had a very strange dream last night which i have not remembered till this instant i dreamt that it was this morning and you and i had been talking as we have been this minute that i went upstairs for the very purpose for which i am going now and that as i stretched out my hand to take madelines and lead her down the floor sunk with me and after falling from such an indescribable and tremendous height as the imagination scarcely conceives except in dreams i alighted in a grave  and you awoke and found you were lying on your back or with your head hanging over the bedside or suffering some pain from indigestion said ralph pshaw mr bray do as i do you will have the opportunity now that a constant round of pleasure and enjoyment opens upon you and occupying yourself a little more by day have no time to think of what you dream by night  ralph followed him with a steady look to the door and turning to the bridegroom when they were again alone said  mark my words gride you wont have to pay his annuity very long you have the devils luck in bargains always if he is not booked to make the long voyage before many months are past and gone i wear an orange for a head  to this prophecy so agreeable to his ears arthur returned no answer than a cackle of great delight ralph throwing himself into a chair they both sat waiting in profound silence ralph was thinking with a sneer upon his lips on the altered manner of bray that day and how soon their fellowship in a bad design had lowered his pride and established a familiarity between them when his attentive ear caught the rustling of a female dress upon the stairs and the footstep of a man  wake up he said stamping his foot impatiently upon the ground and be something like life man will you they are here urge those dry old bones of yours this way quick man quick  gride shambled forward and stood leering and bowing close by ralphs side when the door opened and there entered in hastenot bray and his daughter but nicholas and his sister kate  if some tremendous apparition from the world of shadows had suddenly presented itself before him ralph nickleby could not have been more thunderstricken than he was by this surprise his hands fell powerless by his side he reeled back and with open mouth and a face of ashy paleness stood gazing at them in speechless rage his eyes so prominent and his face so convulsed and changed by the passions which raged within him that it would have been difficult to recognise in him the same stern composed hardfeatured man he had been not a minute ago  the man that came to me last night whispered gride plucking at his elbow the man that came to me last night  i see muttered ralph i know i might have guessed as much before across my every path at every turn go where i will do what i may he comes  the absence of all colour from the face the dilated nostril the quivering of the lips which though set firmly against each other would not be still showed what emotions were struggling for the mastery with nicholas but he kept them down and gently pressing kates arm to reassure her stood erect and undaunted front to front with his unworthy relative  as the brother and sister stood side by side with a gallant bearing which became them well a close likeness between them was apparent which many had they only seen them apart might have failed to remark the air carriage and very look and expression of the brother were all reflected in the sister but softened and refined to the nicest limit of feminine delicacy and attraction more striking still was some indefinable resemblance in the face of ralph to both while they had never looked more handsome nor he more ugly while they had never held themselves more proudly nor he shrunk half so low there never had been a time when this resemblance was so perceptible or when all the worst characteristics of a face rendered coarse and harsh by evil thoughts were half so manifest as now  away was the first word he could utter as he literally gnashed his teeth away what brings you here liar scoundrel dastard thief  i come here said nicholas in a low deep voice to save your victim if i can liar and scoundrel you are in every action of your life theft is your trade and double dastard you must be or you were not here today hard words will not move me nor would hard blows here i stand and will till i have done my errand  girl said ralph retire we can use force to him but i would not hurt you if i could help it retire you weak and silly wench and leave this dog to be dealt with as he deserves  i will not retire cried kate with flashing eyes and the red blood mantling in her cheeks you will do him no hurt that he will not repay you may use force with me i think you will for i am a girl and that would well become you but if i have a girls weakness i have a womans heart and it is not you who in a cause like this can turn that from its purpose  and what may your purpose be most lofty lady said ralph  to offer to the unhappy subject of your treachery at this last moment replied nicholas a refuge and a home if the near prospect of such a husband as you have provided will not prevail upon her i hope she may be moved by the prayers and entreaties of one of her own sex at all events they shall be tried i myself avowing to her father from whom i come and by whom i am commissioned will render it an act of greater baseness meanness and cruelty in him if he still dares to force this marriage on here i wait to see him and his daughter for this i came and brought my sister even into your presence our purpose is not to see or speak with you therefore to you we stoop to say no more  indeed said ralph you persist in remaining here maam do you  his nieces bosom heaved with the indignant excitement into which he had lashed her but she gave him no reply  now gride see here said ralph this fellowi grieve to say my brothers son a reprobate and profligate stained with every mean and selfish crimethis fellow coming here today to disturb a solemn ceremony and knowing that the consequence of his presenting himself in another mans house at such a time and persisting in remaining there must be his being kicked into the streets and dragged through them like the vagabond he isthis fellow mark you brings with him his sister as a protection thinking we would not expose a silly girl to the degradation and indignity which is no novelty to him and even after i have warned her of what must ensue he still keeps her by him as you see and clings to her apronstrings like a cowardly boy to his mothers is not this a pretty fellow to talk as big as you have heard him now  and as i heard him last night said arthur gride as i heard him last night when he sneaked into my house andhe he hevery soon sneaked out again when i nearly frightened him to death and he wanting to marry miss madeline too oh dear is there anything else hed like anything else we can do for him besides giving her up would he like his debts paid and his house furnished and a few bank notes for shaving paper if he shaves at all he he he  you will remain girl will you said ralph turning upon kate again to be hauled downstairs like a drunken drab as i swear you shall if you stop here no answer thank your brother for what follows gride call down brayand not his daughter let them keep her above  if you value your head said nicholas taking up a position before the door and speaking in the same low voice in which he had spoken before and with no more outward passion than he had before displayed stay where you are  mind me and not him and call down bray said ralph  mind yourself rather than either of us and stay where you are said nicholas  will you call down bray cried ralph  remember that you come near me at your peril said nicholas  gride hesitated ralph being by this time as furious as a baffled tiger made for the door and attempting to pass kate clasped her arm roughly with his hand nicholas with his eyes darting fire seized him by the collar at that moment a heavy body fell with great violence on the floor above and in an instant afterwards was heard a most appalling and terrific scream  they all stood still and gazed upon each other scream succeeded scream a heavy pattering of feet succeeded and many shrill voices clamouring together were heard to cry he is dead  stand off cried nicholas letting loose all the passion he had restrained till now if this is what i scarcely dare to hope it is you are caught villains in your own toils  he burst from the room and darting upstairs to the quarter from whence the noise proceeded forced his way through a crowd of persons who quite filled a small bedchamber and found bray lying on the floor quite dead his daughter clinging to the body  how did this happen he cried looking wildly about him  several voices answered together that he had been observed through the halfopened door reclining in a strange and uneasy position upon a chair that he had been spoken to several times and not answering was supposed to be asleep until some person going in and shaking him by the arm he fell heavily to the ground and was discovered to be dead  who is the owner of this house said nicholas hastily  an elderly woman was pointed out to him and to her he said as he knelt down and gently unwound madelines arms from the lifeless mass round which they were entwined i represent this ladys nearest friends as her servant here knows and must remove her from this dreadful scene this is my sister to whose charge you confide her my name and address are upon that card and you shall receive from me all necessary directions for the arrangements that must be made stand aside every one of you and give me room and air for gods sake  the people fell back scarce wondering more at what had just occurred than at the excitement and impetuosity of him who spoke nicholas taking the insensible girl in his arms bore her from the chamber and downstairs into the room he had just quitted followed by his sister and the faithful servant whom he charged to procure a coach directly while he and kate bent over their beautiful charge and endeavoured but in vain to restore her to animation the girl performed her office with such expedition that in a very few minutes the coach was ready  ralph nickleby and gride stunned and paralysed by the awful event which had so suddenly overthrown their schemes it would not otherwise perhaps have made much impression on them and carried away by the extraordinary energy and precipitation of nicholas which bore down all before him looked on at these proceedings like men in a dream or trance it was not until every preparation was made for madelines immediate removal that ralph broke silence by declaring she should not be taken away  who says so cried nicholas rising from his knee and confronting them but still retaining madelines lifeless hand in his  i answered ralph hoarsely  hush hush cried the terrified gride catching him by the arm again hear what he says  ay said nicholas extending his disengaged hand in the air hear what he says that both your debts are paid in the one great debt of nature that the bond due today at twelve is now waste paper that your contemplated fraud shall be discovered yet that your schemes are known to man and overthrown by heaven wretches that he defies you both to do your worst  this man said ralph in a voice scarcely intelligible this man claims his wife and he shall have her  that man claims what is not his and he should not have her if he were fifty men with fifty more to back him said nicholas  who shall prevent him  i will  by what right i should like to know said ralph by what right i ask  by this right that knowing what i do you dare not tempt me further said nicholas and by this better right that those i serve and with whom you would have done me base wrong and injury are her nearest and her dearest friends in their name i bear her hence give way  one word cried ralph foaming at the mouth  not one replied nicholas i will not hear of onesave this look to yourself and heed this warning that i give you your day is past and night is comin on  my curse my bitter deadly curse upon you boy  whence will curses come at your command or what avails a curse or blessing from a man like you i tell you that misfortune and discovery are thickening about your head that the structures you have raised through all your illspent life are crumbling into dust that your path is beset with spies that this very day ten thousand pounds of your hoarded wealth have gone in one great crash  tis false cried ralph shrinking back  tis true and you shall find it so i have no more words to waste stand from the door kate do you go first lay not a hand on her or on that woman or on me or so much a brush their garments as they pass you byyou let them pass and he blocks the door again  arthur gride happened to be in the doorway but whether intentionally or from confusion was not quite apparent nicholas swung him away with such violence as to cause him to spin round the room until he was caught by a sharp angle of the wall and there knocked down and then taking his beautiful burden in his arms rushed out no one cared to stop him if any were so disposed making his way through a mob of people whom a report of the circumstances had attracted round the house and carrying madeline in his excitement as easily as if she were an infant he reached the coach in which kate and the girl were already waiting and confiding his charge to them jumped up beside the coachman and bade him drive away    chapter 55  of family matters cares hopes disappointments and sorrows   although mrs nickleby had been made acquainted by her son and daughter with every circumstance of madeline brays history which was known to them although the responsible situation in which nicholas stood had been carefully explained to her and she had been prepared even for the possible contingency of having to receive the young lady in her own house improbable as such a result had appeared only a few minutes before it came about still mrs nickleby from the moment when this confidence was first reposed in her late on the previous evening had remained in an unsatisfactory and profoundly mystified state from which no explanations or arguments could relieve her and which every fresh soliloquy and reflection only aggravated more and more  bless my heart kate so the good lady argued if the mr cheerybles dont want this young lady to be married why dont they file a bill against the lord chancellor make her a chancery ward and shut her up in the fleet prison for safetyi have read of such things in the newspapers a hundred times or if they are so very fond of her as nicholas says they are why dont they marry her themselvesone of them i mean and even supposing they dont want her to be married and dont want to marry her themselves why in the name of wonder should nicholas go about the world forbidding peoples banns  i dont think you quite understand said kate gently  well i am sure kate my dear youre very polite replied mrs nickleby i have been married myself i hope and i have seen other people married not understand indeed  i know you have had great experience dear mama said kate i mean that perhaps you dont quite understand all the circumstances in this instance we have stated them awkwardly i dare say  that i dare say you have retorted her mother briskly thats very likely i am not to be held accountable for that though at the same time as the circumstances speak for themselves i shall take the liberty my love of saying that i do understand them and perfectly well too whatever you and nicholas may choose to think to the contrary why is such a great fuss made because this miss magdalen is going to marry somebody who is older than herself your poor papa was older than i was four years and a half older jane dibabsthe dibabses lived in the beautiful little thatched white house one story high covered all over with ivy and creeping plants with an exquisite little porch with twining honysuckles and all sorts of things where the earwigs used to fall into ones tea on a summer evening and always fell upon their backs and kicked dreadfully and where the frogs used to get into the rushlight shades when one stopped all night and sit up and look through the little holes like christiansjane dibabs she married a man who was a great deal older than herself and would marry him notwithstanding all that could be said to the contrary and she was so fond of him that nothing was ever equal to it there was no fuss made about jane dibabs and her husband was a most honourable and excellent man and everybody spoke well of him then why should there by any fuss about this magdalen  her husband is much older he is not her own choice his character is the very reverse of that which you have just described dont you see a broad destinction between the two cases said kate  to this mrs nickleby only replied that she durst say she was very stupid indeed she had no doubt she was for her own children almost as much as told her so every day of her life to be sure she was a little older than they and perhaps some foolish people might think she ought reasonably to know best however no doubt she was wrong of course she was she always was she couldnt be right she couldnt be expected to be so she had better not expose herself any more and to all kates conciliations and concessions for an hour ensuing the good lady gave no other replies than oh certainly why did they ask her her opinion was of no consequence it didnt matter what she said with many other rejoinders of the same class  in this frame of mind expressed when she had become too resigned for speech by nods of the head upliftings of the eyes and little beginnings of groans converted as they attracted attention into short coughs mrs nickleby remained until nicholas and kate returned with the object of their solicitude when having by this time asserted her own importance and becoming besides interested in the trials of one so young and beautiful she not only displayed the utmost zeal and solicitude but took great credit to herself for recommending the course of procedure which her son had adopted frequently declaring with an expressive look that it was very fortunate things were as they were and hinting that but for great encouragement and wisdom on her own part they never could have been brought to that pass  not to strain the question whether mrs nickleby had or had not any great hand in bringing matters about it is unquestionable that she had strong ground for exultation the brothers on their return bestowed such commendations on nicholas for the part he had taken and evinced so much joy at the altered state of events and the recovery of their young friend from trials so great and dangers so threatening that as she more than once informed her daughter she now considered the fortunes of the family as good as made mr charles cheeryble indeed mrs nickleby positively asserted had in the first transports of his surprise and delight as good as said so without precisely explaining what this qualification meant she subsided whenever she mentioned the subject into such a mysterious and important state and had such visions of wealth and dignity in perspective that vague and clouded though they were she was at such times almost as happy as if she had really been permanently provided for on a scale of great splendour  the sudden and terrible shock she had received combined with the great affliction and anxiety of mind which she had for a long time endured proved too much for madelines strength recovering from the state of stupefaction into which the sudden death of her father happily plunged her she only exchanged that condition for one of dangerous and active illness when the delicate physical powers which have been sustained by an unnatural strain upon the mental energies and a resolute determination not to yield at last give way their degree of prostration is usually proportionate to the strength of the effort which has previously upheld them thus it was that the illness which fell on madeline was of no slight or temporary nature but one which for a time threatened her reason andscarcely worseher life itself  who slowly recovering from a disorder so severe and dangerous could be insensible to the unremitting attentions of such a nurse as gentle tender earnest kate on whom could the sweet soft voice the light step the delicate hand the quiet cheerful noiseless discharge of those thousand little offices of kindness and relief which we feel so deeply when we are ill and forget so lightly when we are wellon whom could they make so deep an impression as on a young heart stored with every pure and true affection that women cherish almost a stranger to the endearments and devotion of its own sex save as it learnt them from itself and rendered by calamity and suffering keenly susceptible of the sympathy so long unknown and so long sought in vain what wonder that days became as years in knitting them together what wonder if with every hour of returning health there came some stronger and sweeter recognition of the praises which kate when they recalled old scenesthey seemed old now and to have been acted years agowould lavish on her brother where would have been the wonder even if those praises had found a quick response in the breast of madeline and if with the image of nicholas so constantly recurring in the features of his sister that she could scarcely separate the two she had sometimes found it equally difficult to assign to each the feelings they had first inspired and had imperceptibly mingled with her gratitude to nicholas some of that warmer feeling which she had assigned to kate  my dear mrs nickleby would say coming into the room with an elaborate caution calculated to discompose the nerves of an invalid rather more than the entry of a horsesoldier at full gallop how do you find yourself tonight i hope you are better  almost well mama kate would reply laying down her work and taking madelines hand in hers  kate mrs nickleby would say reprovingly dont talk so loud the worthy lady herself talking in a whisper that would have made the blood of the stoutest man run cold in his veins  kate would take this reproof very quietly and mrs nickleby making every board creak and every thread rustle as she moved stealthily about would add  my son nicholas has just come home and i have come according to custom my dear to know from your own lips exactly how you are for he wont take my account and never will  he is later than usual tonight perhaps madeline would reply nearly half an hour  well i never saw such people in all my life as you are for time up here mrs nickleby would exclaim in great astonishment i declare i never did i had not the least idea that nicholas was after his time not the smallest mr nickleby used to sayyour poor papa i am speaking of kate my dearused to say that appetite was the best clock in the world but you have no appetite my dear miss bray i wish you had and upon my word i really think you ought to take something that would give you one i am sure i dont know but i have heard that two or three dozen native lobsters give an appetite though that comes to the same thing after all for i suppose you must have an appetite before you can take em if i said lobsters i meant oysters but of course its all the same though really how you came to know about nicholas  we happened to be just talking about him mama that was it  you never seem to me to be talking about anything else kate and upon my word i am quite surprised at your being so very thoughtless you can find subjects enough to talk about sometimes and when you know how important it is to keep up miss brays spirits and interest her and all that it really is quite extraordinary to me what can induce you to keep on prose prose prose din din din everlastingly upon the same theme you are a very kind nurse kate and a very good one and i know you mean very well but i will say thisthat if it wasnt for me i really dont know what would become of miss brays spirits and so i tell the doctor every day he says he wonders how i sustain my own and i am sure i very often wonder myself how i can contrive to keep up as i do of course its an exertion but still when i know how much depends upon me in this house i am obliged to make it theres nothing praiseworthy in that but its necessary and i do it  with that mrs nickleby would draw up a chair and for some threequarters of an hour run through a great variety of distracting topics in the most distracting manner possible tearing herself away at length on the plea that she must now go and amuse nicholas while he took his supper after a preliminary raising of his spirits with the information that she considered the patient decidedly worse she would further cheer him up by relating how dull listless and lowspirited miss bray was because kate foolishly talked about nothing else but him and family matters when she had made nicholas thoroughly comfortable with these and other inspiriting remarks she would discourse at length on the arduous duties she had performed that day and sometimes be moved to tears in wondering how if anything were to happen to herself the family would ever get on without her  at other times when nicholas came home at night he would be accompanied by mr frank cheeryble who was commissioned by the brothers to inquire how madeline was that evening on such occasions and they were of very frequent occurrence mrs nickleby deemed it of particular importance that she should have her wits about her for from certain signs and tokens which had attracted her attention she shrewdly suspected that mr frank interested as his uncles were in madeline came quite as much to see kate as to inquire after her the more especially as the brothers were in constant communication with the medical man came backwards and forwards very frequently themselves and received a full report from nicholas every morning these were proud times for mrs nickleby never was anybody half so discreet and sage as she or half so mysterious withal and never were there such cunning generalship and such unfathomable designs as she brought to bear upon mr frank with the view of ascertaining whether her suspicions were well founded and if so of tantalising him into taking her into his confidence and throwing himself upon her merciful consideration extensive was the artillery heavy and light which mrs nickleby brought into play for the furtherance of these great schemes various and opposite the means which she employed to bring about the end she had in view at one time she was all cordiality and ease at another all stiffness and frigidity now she would seem to open her whole heart to her unhappy victim the next time they met she would receive him with the most distant and studious reserve as if a new light had broken in upon her and guessing his intentions she had resolved to check them in the bud as if she felt it her bounden duty to act with spartan firmness and at once and for ever to discourage hopes which never could be realised at other times when nicholas was not there to overhear and kate was upstairs busily tending her sick friend the worthy lady would throw out dark hints of an intention to send her daughter to france for three or four years or to scotland for the improvement of her health impaired by her late fatigues or to america on a visit or anywhere that threatened a long and tedious separation nay she even went so far as to hint obscurely at an attachment entertained for her daughter by the son of an old neighbour of theirs one horatio peltirogus a young gentleman who might have been at that time four years old or thereabouts and to represent it indeed as almost a settled thing between the familiesonly waiting for her daughters final decision to come off with the sanction of the church and to the unspeakable happiness and content of all parties  it was in the full pride and glory of having sprung this last mine one night with extraordinary success that mrs nickleby took the opportunity of being left alone with her son before retiring to rest to sound him on the subject which so occupied her thoughts not doubting that they could have but one opinion respecting it to this end she approached the question with divers laudatory and appropriate remarks touching the general amiability of mr frank cheeryble  you are quite right mother said nicholas quite right he is a fine fellow  goodlooking too said mrs nickleby  decidedly goodlooking answered nicholas  what may you call his nose now my dear pursued mrs nickleby wishing to interest nicholas in the subject to the utmost  call it repeated nicholas  ah returned his mother what style of nose what order of architecture if one may say so i am not very learned in noses do you call it a roman or a grecian  upon my word mother said nicholas laughing as well as i remember i should call it a kind of composite or mixed nose but i have no very strong recollection on the subject if it will afford you any gratification ill observe it more closely and let you know  i wish you would my dear said mrs nickleby with an earnest look  very well returned nicholas i will  nicholas returned to the perusal of the book he had been reading when the dialogue had gone thus far mrs nickleby after stopping a little for consideration resumed  he is very much attached to you nicholas my dear  nicholas laughingly said as he closed his book that he was glad to hear it and observed that his mother seemed deep in their new friends confidence already  hem said mrs nickleby i dont know about that my dear but i think it is very necessary that somebody should be in his confidence highly necessary  elated by a look of curiosity from her son and the consciousness of possessing a great secret all to herself mrs nickleby went on with great animation  i am sure my dear nicholas how you can have failed to notice it is to me quite extraordinary though i dont know why i should say that either because of course as far as it goes and to a certain extent there is a great deal in this sort of thing especially in this early stage which however clear it may be to females can scarcely be expected to be so evident to men i dont say that i have any particular penetration in such matters i may have those about me should know best about that and perhaps do know upon that point i shall express no opinion it wouldnt become me to do so its quite out of the question quite  nicholas snuffed the candles put his hands in his pockets and leaning back in his chair assumed a look of patient suffering and melancholy resignation  i think it my duty nicholas my dear resumed his mother to tell you what i know not only because you have a right to know it too and to know everything that happens in this family but because you have it in your power to promote and assist the thing very much and there is no doubt that the sooner one can come to a clear understanding on such subjects it is always better every way there are a great many things you might do such as taking a walk in the garden sometimes or sitting upstairs in your own room for a little while or making believe to fall asleep occasionally or pretending that you recollected some business and going out for an hour or so and taking mr smike with you these seem very slight things and i dare say you will be amused at my making them of so much importance at the same time my dear i can assure you and youll find this out nicholas for yourself one of these days if you ever fall in love with anybody as i trust and hope you will provided she is respectable and well conducted and of course youd never dream of falling in love with anybody who was not i say i can assure you that a great deal more depends upon these little things than you would suppose possible if your poor papa was alive he would tell you how much depended on the parties being left alone of course you are not to go out of the room as if you meant it and did it on purpose but as if it was quite an accident and to come back again in the same way if you cough in the passage before you open the door or whistle carelessly or hum a tune or something of that sort to let them know youre coming its always better because of course though its not only natural but perfectly correct and proper under the circumstances still it is very confusing if you interrupt young people when they arewhen they are sitting on the sofa andand all that sort of thing which is very nonsensical perhaps but still they will do it  the profound astonishment with which her son regarded her during this long address gradually increasing as it approached its climax in no way discomposed mrs nickleby but rather exalted her opinion of her own cleverness therefore merely stopping to remark with much complacency that she had fully expected him to be surprised she entered on a vast quantity of circumstantial evidence of a particularly incoherent and perplexing kind the upshot of which was to establish beyond the possibility of doubt that mr frank cheeryble had fallen desperately in love with kate  with whom cried nicholas  mrs nickleby repeated with kate  what our kate my sister  lord nicholas returned mrs nickleby whose kate should it be if not ours or what should i care about it or take any interest in it for if it was anybody but your sister  dear mother said nicholas surely it cant be  very good my dear replied mrs nickleby with great confidence wait and see  nicholas had never until that moment bestowed a thought upon the remote possibility of such an occurrence as that which was now communicated to him for besides that he had been much from home of late and closely occupied with other matters his own jealous fears had prompted the suspicion that some secret interest in madeline akin to that which he felt himself occasioned those visits of frank cheeryble which had recently become so frequent even now although he knew that the observation of an anxious mother was much more likely to be correct in such a case than his own and although she reminded him of many little circumstances which taken together were certainly susceptible of the construction she triumphantly put upon them he was not quite convinced but that they arose from mere goodnatured thoughtless gallantry which would have dictated the same conduct towards any other girl who was young and pleasing at all events he hoped so and therefore tried to believe it  i am very much disturbed by what you tell me said nicholas after a little reflection though i yet hope you may be mistaken  i dont understand why you should hope so said mrs nickleby i confess but you may depend upon it i am not  what of kate inquired nicholas  why that my dear returned mrs nickleby is just the point upon which i am not yet satisfied during this sickness she has been constantly at madelines bedsidenever were two people so fond of each other as they have grownand to tell you the truth nicholas i have rather kept her away now and then because i think its a good plan and urges a young man on he doesnt get too sure you know  she said this with such a mingling of high delight and selfcongratulation that it was inexpressibly painful to nicholas to dash her hopes but he felt that there was only one honourable course before him and that he was bound to take it  dear mother he said kindly dont you see that if there were really any serious inclination on the part of mr frank towards kate and we suffered ourselves for a moment to encourage it we should be acting a most dishonourable and ungrateful part i ask you if you dont see it but i need not say that i know you dont or you would have been more strictly on your guard let me explain my meaning to you remember how poor we are  mrs nickleby shook her head and said through her tears that poverty was not a crime  no said nicholas and for that reason poverty should engender an honest pride that it may not lead and tempt us to unworthy actions and that we may preserve the selfrespect which a hewer of wood and drawer of water may maintain and does better in maintaining than a monarch in preserving his think what we owe to these two brothers remember what they have done and what they do every day for us with a generosity and delicacy for which the devotion of our whole lives would be a most imperfect and inadequate return what kind of return would that be which would be comprised in our permitting their nephew their only relative whom they regard as a son and for whom it would be mere childishness to suppose they have not formed plans suitably adapted to the education he has had and the fortune he will inheritin our permitting him to marry a portionless girl so closely connected with us that the irresistible inference must be that he was entrapped by a plot that it was a deliberate scheme and a speculation amongst us three bring the matter clearly before yourself mother now how would you feel if they were married and the brothers coming here on one of those kind errands which bring them here so often you had to break out to them the truth would you be at ease and feel that you had played an open part  poor mrs nickleby crying more and more murmured that of course mr frank would ask the consent of his uncles first  why to be sure that would place him in a better situation with them said nicholas but we should still be open to the same suspicions the distance between us would still be as great the advantages to be gained would still be as manifest as now we may be reckoning without our host in all this he added more cheerfully and i trust and almost believe we are if it be otherwise i have that confidence in kate that i know she will feel as i doand in you dear mother to be assured that after a little consideration you will do the same  after many more representations and entreaties nicholas obtained a promise from mrs nickleby that she would try all she could to think as he did and that if mr frank persevered in his attentions she would endeavour to discourage them or at the least would render him no countenance or assistance he determined to forbear mentioning the subject to kate until he was quite convinced that there existed a real necessity for his doing so and resolved to assure himself as well as he could by close personal observation of the exact position of affairs this was a very wise resolution but he was prevented from putting it in practice by a new source of anxiety and uneasiness  smike became alarmingly ill so reduced and exhausted that he could scarcely move from room to room without assistance and so worn and emaciated that it was painful to look upon him nicholas was warned by the same medical authority to whom he had at first appealed that the last chance and hope of his life depended on his being instantly removed from london that part of devonshire in which nicholas had been himself bred was named as the most favourable spot but this advice was cautiously coupled with the information that whoever accompanied him thither must be prepared for the worst for every token of rapid consumption had appeared and he might never return alive  the kind brothers who were acquainted with the poor creatures sad history dispatched old tim to be present at this consultation that same morning nicholas was summoned by brother charles into his private room and thus addressed  my dear sir no time must be lost this lad shall not die if such human means as we can use can save his life neither shall he die alone and in a strange place remove him tomorrow morning see that he has every comfort that his situation requires and dont leave him dont leave him my dear sir until you know that there is no longer any immediate danger it would be hard indeed to part you now no no no tim shall wait upon you tonight sir tim shall wait upon you tonight with a parting word or two brother ned my dear fellow mr nickleby waits to shake hands and say goodbye mr nickleby wont be long gone this poor chap will soon get better very soon get better and then hell find out some nice homely countrypeople to leave him with and will go backwards and forwards sometimesbackwards and forwards you know ned and theres no cause to be downhearted for hell very soon get better very soon wont he wont he ned  what tim linkinwater said or what he brought with him that night needs not to be told next morning nicholas and his feeble companion began their journey  and who but oneand that one he who but for those who crowded round him then had never met a look of kindness or known a word of pitycould tell what agony of mind what blighted thoughts what unavailing sorrow were involved in that sad parting  see cried nicholas eagerly as he looked from the coach window they are at the corner of the lane still and now theres kate poor kate whom you said you couldnt bear to say goodbye to waving her handkerchief dont go without one gesture of farewell to kate  i cannot make it cried his trembling companion falling back in his seat and covering his eyes do you see her now is she there still  yes yes said nicholas earnestly there she waves her hand again i have answered it for youand now they are out of sight do not give way so bitterly dear friend dont you will meet them all again  he whom he thus encouraged raised his withered hands and clasped them fervently together  in heaven i humbly pray to god in heaven  it sounded like the prayer of a broken heart    chapter 56  ralph nickleby baffled by his nephew in his late design hatches a scheme of retaliation which accident suggests to him and takes into his counsels a tried auxiliary   the course which these adventures shape out for themselves and imperatively call upon the historian to observe now demands that they should revert to the point they attained previously to the commencement of the last chapter when ralph nickleby and arthur gride were left together in the house where death had so suddenly reared his dark and heavy banner  with clenched hands and teeth ground together so firm and tight that no locking of the jaws could have fixed and riveted them more securely ralph stood for some minutes in the attitude in which he had last addressed his nephew breathing heavily but as rigid and motionless in other respects as if he had been a brazen statue after a time he began by slow degrees as a man rousing himself from heavy slumber to relax for a moment he shook his clasped fist towards the door by which nicholas had disappeared and then thrusting it into his breast as if to repress by force even this show of passion turned round and confronted the less hardy usurer who had not yet risen from the ground  the cowering wretch who still shook in every limb and whose few grey hairs trembled and quivered on his head with abject dismay tottered to his feet as he met ralphs eye and shielding his face with both hands protested while he crept towards the door that it was no fault of his  who said it was man returned ralph in a suppressed voice who said it was  you looked as if you thought i was to blame said gride timidly  pshaw ralph muttered forcing a laugh i blame him for not living an hour longer one hour longer would have been long enough i blame no one else  nnno one else said gride  not for this mischance replied ralph i have an old score to clear with that young fellow who has carried off your mistress but that has nothing to do with his blustering just now for we should soon have been quit of him but for this cursed accident  there was something so unnatural in the calmness with which ralph nickleby spoke when coupled with his face the expression of the features to which every nerve and muscle as it twitched and throbbed with a spasm whose workings no effort could conceal gave every instant some new and frightful aspectthere was something so unnatural and ghastly in the contrast between his harsh slow steady voice only altered by a certain halting of the breath which made him pause between almost every word like a drunken man bent upon speaking plainly and these evidences of the most intense and violent passion and the struggle he made to keep them under that if the dead body which lay above had stood instead of him before the cowering gride it could scarcely have presented a spectacle which would have terrified him more  the coach said ralph after a time during which he had struggled like some strong man against a fit we came in a coach is it waiting  gride gladly availed himself of the pretext for going to the window to see ralph keeping his face steadily the other way tore at his shirt with the hand which he had thrust into his breast and muttered in a hoarse whisper  ten thousand pounds he said ten thousand the precise sum paid in but yesterday for the two mortgages and which would have gone out again at heavy interest tomorrow if that house has failed and he the first to bring the newsis the coach there  yes yes said gride startled by the fierce tone of the inquiry its here dear dear what a fiery man you are  come here said ralph beckoning to him we mustnt make a show of being disturbed well go down arm in arm  but you pinch me black and blue urged gride  ralph let him go impatiently and descending the stairs with his usual firm and heavy tread got into the coach arthur gride followed after looking doubtfully at ralph when the man asked where he was to drive and finding that he remained silent and expressed no wish upon the subject arthur mentioned his own house and thither they proceeded  on their way ralph sat in the furthest corner with folded arms and uttered not a word with his chin sunk upon his breast and his downcast eyes quite hidden by the contraction of his knotted brows he might have been asleep for any sign of consciousness he gave until the coach stopped when he raised his head and glancing through the window inquired what place that was  my house answered the disconsolate gride affected perhaps by its loneliness oh dear my house  true said ralph i have not observed the way we came i should like a glass of water you have that in the house i suppose  you shall have a glass ofof anything you like answered gride with a groan its no use knocking coachman ring the bell  the man rang and rang and rang again then knocked until the street reechoed with the sounds then listened at the keyhole of the door nobody came the house was silent as the grave  hows this said ralph impatiently  peg is so very deaf answered gride with a look of anxiety and alarm oh dear ring again coachman she sees the bell  again the man rang and knocked and knocked and rang again some of the neighbours threw up their windows and called across the street to each other that old grides housekeeper must have dropped down dead others collected round the coach and gave vent to various surmises some held that she had fallen asleep some that she had burnt herself to death some that she had got drunk and one very fat man that she had seen something to eat which had frightened her so much not being used to it that she had fallen into a fit this last suggestion particularly delighted the bystanders who cheered it rather uproariously and were with some difficulty deterred from dropping down the area and breaking open the kitchen door to ascertain the fact nor was this all rumours having gone abroad that arthur was to be married that morning very particular inquiries were made after the bride who was held by the majority to be disguised in the person of mr ralph nickleby which gave rise to much jocose indignation at the public appearance of a bride in boots and pantaloons and called forth a great many hoots and groans at length the two moneylenders obtained shelter in a house next door and being accommodated with a ladder clambered over the wall of the backyardwhich was not a high oneand descended in safety on the other side  i am almost afraid to go in i declare said arthur turning to ralph when they were alone suppose she should be murdered lying with her brains knocked out by a poker eh  suppose she were said ralph i tell you i wish such things were more common than they are and more easily done you may stare and shiver i do  he applied himself to a pump in the yard and having taken a deep draught of water and flung a quantity on his head and face regained his accustomed manner and led the way into the house gride following close at his heels  it was the same dark place as ever every room dismal and silent as it was wont to be and every ghostly article of furniture in its customary place the iron heart of the grim old clock undisturbed by all the noise without still beat heavily within its dusty case the tottering presses slunk from the sight as usual in their melancholy corners the echoes of footsteps returned the same dreary sound the longlegged spider paused in his nimble run and scared by the sight of men in that his dull domain hung motionless on the wall counterfeiting death until they should have passed him by  from cellar to garret went the two usurers opening every creaking door and looking into every deserted room but no peg was there at last they sat them down in the apartment which arthur gride usually inhabited to rest after their search  the hag is out on some preparation for your wedding festivities i suppose said ralph preparing to depart see here i destroy the bond we shall never need it now  gride who had been peering narrowly about the room fell at that moment upon his knees before a large chest and uttered a terrible yell  how now said ralph looking sternly round  robbed robbed screamed arthur gride  robbed of money  no no no worse far worse  of what then demanded ralph  worse than money worse than money cried the old man casting the papers out of the chest like some beast tearing up the earth she had better have stolen moneyall my moneyi havent much she had better have made me a beggar than have done this  done what said ralph done what you devils dotard  still gride made no answer but tore and scratched among the papers and yelled and screeched like a fiend in torment  there is something missing you say said ralph shaking him furiously by the collar what is it  papers deeds i am a ruined man lost lost i am robbed i am ruined she saw me reading itreading it of latei did very oftenshe watched me saw me put it in the box that fitted into this the box is gone she has stolen it damnation seize her she has robbed me  of what cried ralph on whom a sudden light appeared to break for his eyes flashed and his frame trembled with agitation as he clutched gride by his bony arm of what  she dont know what it is she cant read shrieked gride not heeding the inquiry theres only one way in which money can be made of it and that is by taking it to her somebody will read it for her and tell her what to do she and her accomplice will get money for it and be let off besides theyll make a merit of itsay they found itknew itand be evidence against me the only person it will fall upon is me me me  patience said ralph clutching him still tighter and eyeing him with a sidelong look so fixed and eager as sufficiently to denote that he had some hidden purpose in what he was about to say hear reason she cant have been gone long ill call the police do you but give information of what she has stolen and theyll lay hands upon her trust me here help  no no no screamed the old man putting his hand on ralphs mouth i cant i darent  help help cried ralph  no no no shrieked the other stamping on the ground with the energy of a madman i tell you no i darent i darent  darent make this robbery public said ralph  no rejoined gride wringing his hands hush hush not a word of this not a word must be said i am undone whichever way i turn i am undone i am betrayed i shall be given up i shall die in newgate  with frantic exclamations such as these and with many others in which fear grief and rage were strangely blended the panicstricken wretch gradually subdued his first loud outcry until it had softened down into a low despairing moan chequered now and then by a howl as going over such papers as were left in the chest he discovered some new loss with very little excuse for departing so abruptly ralph left him and greatly disappointing the loiterers outside the house by telling them there was nothing the matter got into the coach and was driven to his own home  a letter lay on his table he let it lie there for some time as if he had not the courage to open it but at length did so and turned deadly pale  the worst has happened he said the house has failed i see the rumour was abroad in the city last night and reached the ears of those merchants well well  he strode violently up and down the room and stopped again  ten thousand pounds and only lying there for a dayfor one day how many anxious years how many pinching days and sleepless nights before i scraped together that ten thousand poundsten thousand pounds how many proud painted dames would have fawned and smiled and how many spendthrift blockheads done me lipservice to my face and cursed me in their hearts while i turned that ten thousand pounds into twenty while i ground and pinched and used these needy borrowers for my pleasure and profit what smoothtongued speeches and courteous looks and civil letters they would have given me the cant of the lying world is that men like me compass our riches by dissimulation and treachery by fawning cringing and stooping why how many lies what mean and abject evasions what humbled behaviour from upstarts who but for my money would spurn me aside as they do their betters every day would that ten thousand pounds have brought me in grant that i had doubled itmade cent per centfor every sovereign told anotherthere would not be one piece of money in all the heap which wouldnt represent ten thousand mean and paltry lies told not by the moneylender oh no but by the moneyborrowers your liberal thoughtless generous dashing folks who wouldnt be so mean as save a sixpence for the world  striving as it would seem to lose part of the bitterness of his regrets in the bitterness of these other thoughts ralph continued to pace the room there was less and less of resolution in his manner as his mind gradually reverted to his loss at length dropping into his elbowchair and grasping its sides so firmly that they creaked again he said  the time has been when nothing could have moved me like the loss of this great sum nothing for births deaths marriages and all the events which are of interest to most men have unless they are connected with gain or loss of money no interest for me but now i swear i mix up with the loss his triumph in telling it if he had brought it abouti almost feel as if he hadi couldnt hate him more let me but retaliate upon him by degrees however slowlet me but begin to get the better of him let me but turn the scaleand i can bear it  his meditations were long and deep they terminated in his dispatching a letter by newman addressed to mr squeers at the saracens head with instructions to inquire whether he had arrived in town and if so to wait an answer newman brought back the information that mr squeers had come by mail that morning and had received the letter in bed but that he sent his duty and word that he would get up and wait upon mr nickleby directly  the interval between the delivery of this message and the arrival of mr squeers was very short but before he came ralph had suppressed every sign of emotion and once more regained the hard immovable inflexible manner which was habitual to him and to which perhaps was ascribable no small part of the influence which over many men of no very strong prejudices on the score of morality he could exert almost at will  well mr squeers he said welcoming that worthy with his accustomed smile of which a sharp look and a thoughtful frown were part and parcel how do you do  why sir said mr squeers im pretty well sos the family and sos the boys except for a sort of rash as is a running through the school and rather puts em off their feed but its a ill wind as blows no good to nobody thats what i always say when them lads has a wisitation a wisitation sir is the lot of mortality mortality itself sir is a wisitation the world is chock full of wisitations and if a boy repines at a wisitation and makes you uncomfortable with his noise he must have his head punched thats going according to the scripter that is  mr squeers said ralph drily  sir  well avoid these precious morsels of morality if you please and talk of business  with all my heart sir rejoined squeers and first let me say  first let me say if you pleasenoggs  newman presented himself when the summons had been twice or thrice repeated and asked if his master called  i did go to your dinner and go at once do you hear  it ant time said newman doggedly  my time is yours and i say it is returned ralph  you alter it every day said newman it isnt fair  you dont keep many cooks and can easily apologise to them for the trouble retorted ralph begone sir  ralph not only issued this order in his most peremptory manner but under pretence of fetching some papers from the little office saw it obeyed and when newman had left the house chained the door to prevent the possibility of his returning secretly by means of his latchkey  i have reason to suspect that fellow said ralph when he returned to his own office therefore until i have thought of the shortest and least troublesome way of ruining him i hold it best to keep him at a distance  it wouldnt take much to ruin him i should think said squeers with a grin  perhaps not answered ralph nor to ruin a great many people whom i know you were going to say  ralphs summary and matterofcourse way of holding up this example and throwing out the hint that followed it had evidently an effect as doubtless it was designed to have upon mr squeers who said after a little hesitation and in a much more subdued tone  why what i was agoing to say sir is that this here business regarding of that ungrateful and hardhearted chap snawley senior puts me out of my way and occasions a inconveniency quite unparalleled besides as i may say making for whole weeks together mrs squeers a perfect widder its a pleasure to me to act with you of course  of course said ralph drily  yes i say of course resumed mr squeers rubbing his knees but at the same time when one comes as i do now better than two hundred and fifty mile to take a afferdavid it does put a man out a good deal letting alone the risk  and where may the risk be mr squeers said ralph  i said letting alone the risk replied squeers evasively  and i said where was the risk  i wasnt complaining you know mr nickleby pleaded squeers upon my word i never see such a  i ask you where is the risk repeated ralph emphatically  where the risk returned squeers rubbing his knees still harder why it ant necessary to mention certain subjects is best awoided oh you know what risk i mean  how often have i told you said ralph and how often am i to tell you that you run no risk what have you sworn or what are you asked to swear but that at such and such a time a boy was left with you in the name of smike that he was at your school for a given number of years was lost under such and such circumstances is now found and has been identified by you in such and such keeping this is all true is it not  yes replied squeers thats all true  well then said ralph what risk do you run who swears to a lie but snawley a man whom i have paid much less than i have you  he certainly did it cheap did snawley observed squeers  he did it cheap retorted ralph testily yes and he did it well and carries it off with a hypocritical face and a sanctified air but you risk what do you mean by risk the certificates are all genuine snawley had another son he has been married twice his first wife is dead none but her ghost could tell that she didnt write that letter none but snawley himself can tell that this is not his son and that his son is food for worms the only perjury is snawleys and i fancy he is pretty well used to it wheres your risk  why you know said squeers fidgeting in his chair if you come to that i might say wheres yours  you might say wheres mine returned ralph you may say wheres mine i dont appear in the business neither do you all snawleys interest is to stick well to the story he has told and all his risk is to depart from it in the least talk of your risk in the conspiracy  i say remonstrated squeers looking uneasily round dont call it that just as a favour dont  call it what you like said ralph irritably but attend to me this tale was originally fabricated as a means of annoyance against one who hurt your trade and half cudgelled you to death and to enable you to obtain repossession of a halfdead drudge whom you wished to regain because while you wreaked your vengeance on him for his share in the business you knew that the knowledge that he was again in your power would be the best punishment you could inflict upon your enemy is that so mr squeers  why sir returned squeers almost overpowered by the determination which ralph displayed to make everything tell against him and by his stern unyielding manner in a measure it was  what does that mean said ralph  why in a measure means returned squeers as it may be that it wasnt all on my account because you had some old grudge to satisfy too  if i had not had said ralph in no way abashed by the reminder do you think i should have helped you  why no i dont suppose you would squeers replied i only wanted that point to be all square and straight between us  how can it ever be otherwise retorted ralph except that the account is against me for i spend money to gratify my hatred and you pocket it and gratify yours at the same time you are at least as avaricious as you are revengeful so am i which is best off you who win money and revenge at the same time and by the same process and who are at all events sure of money if not of revenge or i who am only sure of spending money in any case and can but win bare revenge at last  as mr squeers could only answer this proposition by shrugs and smiles ralph bade him be silent and thankful that he was so well off and then fixing his eyes steadily upon him proceeded to say  first that nicholas had thwarted him in a plan he had formed for the disposal in marriage of a certain young lady and had in the confusion attendant on her fathers sudden death secured that lady himself and borne her off in triumph  secondly that by some will or settlementcertainly by some instrument in writing which must contain the young ladys name and could be therefore easily selected from others if access to the place where it was deposited were once securedshe was entitled to property which if the existence of this deed ever became known to her would make her husband and ralph represented that nicholas was certain to marry her a rich and prosperous man and most formidable enemy  thirdly that this deed had been with others stolen from one who had himself obtained or concealed it fraudulently and who feared to take any steps for its recovery and that he ralph knew the thief  to all this mr squeers listened with greedy ears that devoured every syllable and with his one eye and his mouth wide open marvelling for what special reason he was honoured with so much of ralphs confidence and to what it all tended  now said ralph leaning forward and placing his hand on squeerss arm hear the design which i have conceived and which i musti say must if i can ripen ithave carried into execution no advantage can be reaped from this deed whatever it is save by the girl herself or her husband and the possession of this deed by one or other of them is indispensable to any advantage being gained that i have discovered beyond the possibility of doubt i want that deed brought here that i may give the man who brings it fifty pounds in gold and burn it to ashes before his face  mr squeers after following with his eye the action of ralphs hand towards the fireplace as if he were at that moment consuming the paper drew a long breath and said  yes but whos to bring it  nobody perhaps for much is to be done before it can be got at said ralph but if anybodyyou  mr squeerss first tokens of consternation and his flat relinquishment of the task would have staggered most men if they had not immediately occasioned an utter abandonment of the proposition on ralph they produced not the slightest effect resuming when the schoolmaster had quite talked himself out of breath as coolly as if he had never been interrupted ralph proceeded to expatiate on such features of the case as he deemed it most advisable to lay the greatest stress on  these were the age decrepitude and weakness of mrs sliderskew the great improbability of her having any accomplice or even acquaintance taking into account her secluded habits and her long residence in such a house as grides the strong reason there was to suppose that the robbery was not the result of a concerted plan otherwise she would have watched an opportunity of carrying off a sum of money the difficulty she would be placed in when she began to think on what she had done and found herself encumbered with documents of whose nature she was utterly ignorant and the comparative ease with which somebody with a full knowledge of her position obtaining access to her and working on her fears if necessary might worm himself into her confidence and obtain under one pretence or another free possession of the deed to these were added such considerations as the constant residence of mr squeers at a long distance from london which rendered his association with mrs sliderskew a mere masquerading frolic in which nobody was likely to recognise him either at the time or afterwards the impossibility of ralphs undertaking the task himself he being already known to her by sight and various comments on the uncommon tact and experience of mr squeers which would make his overreaching one old woman a mere matter of childs play and amusement in addition to these influences and persuasions ralph drew with his utmost skill and power a vivid picture of the defeat which nicholas would sustain should they succeed in linking himself to a beggar where he expected to wed an heiressglanced at the immeasurable importance it must be to a man situated as squeers to preserve such a friend as himselfdwelt on a long train of benefits conferred since their first acquaintance when he had reported favourably of his treatment of a sickly boy who had died under his hands and whose death was very convenient to ralph and his clients but this he did not say and finally hinted that the fifty pounds might be increased to seventyfive or in the event of very great success even to a hundred  these arguments at length concluded mr squeers crossed his legs uncrossed them scratched his head rubbed his eye examined the palms of his hands and bit his nails and after exhibiting many other signs of restlessness and indecision asked whether one hundred pound was the highest that mr nickleby could go being answered in the affirmative he became restless again and after some thought and an unsuccessful inquiry whether he couldnt go another fifty said he supposed he must try and do the most he could for a friend which was always his maxim and therefore he undertook the job  but how are you to get at the woman he said thats what it is as puzzles me  i may not get at her at all replied ralph but ill try i have hunted people in this city before now who have been better hid than she and i know quarters in which a guinea or two carefully spent will often solve darker riddles than this ay and keep them close too if need be i hear my man ringing at the door we may as well part you had better not come to and fro but wait till you hear from me  good returned squeers i say if you shouldnt find her out youll pay expenses at the saracen and something for loss of time  well said ralph testily yes you have nothing more to say  squeers shaking his head ralph accompanied him to the streetdoor and audibly wondering for the edification of newman why it was fastened as if it were night let him in and squeers out and returned to his own room  now he muttered come what come may for the present i am firm and unshaken let me but retrieve this one small portion of my loss and disgrace let me but defeat him in this one hope dear to his heart as i know it must be let me but do this and it shall be the first link in such a chain which i will wind about him as never man forged yet    chapter 57  how ralph nicklebys auxiliary went about his work and how he prospered with it   it was a dark wet gloomy night in autumn when in an upper room of a mean house situated in an obscure street or rather court near lambeth there sat all alone a oneeyed man grotesquely habited either for lack of better garments or for purposes of disguise in a loose greatcoat with arms half as long again as his own and a capacity of breadth and length which would have admitted of his winding himself in it head and all with the utmost ease and without any risk of straining the old and greasy material of which it was composed  so attired and in a place so far removed from his usual haunts and occupations and so very poor and wretched in its character perhaps mrs squeers herself would have had some difficulty in recognising her lord quickened though her natural sagacity doubtless would have been by the affectionate yearnings and impulses of a tender wife but mrs squeerss lord it was and in a tolerably disconsolate mood mrs squeerss lord appeared to be as helping himself from a black bottle which stood on the table beside him he cast round the chamber a look in which very slight regard for the objects within view was plainly mingled with some regretful and impatient recollection of distant scenes and persons  there were certainly no particular attractions either in the room over which the glance of mr squeers so discontentedly wandered or in the narrow street into which it might have penetrated if he had thought fit to approach the window the attic chamber in which he sat was bare and mean the bedstead and such few other articles of necessary furniture as it contained were of the commonest description in a most crazy state and of a most uninviting appearance the street was muddy dirty and deserted having but one outlet it was traversed by few but the inhabitants at any time and the night being one of those on which most people are glad to be within doors it now presented no other signs of life than the dull glimmering of poor candles from the dirty windows and few sounds but the pattering of the rain and occasionally the heavy closing of some creaking door  mr squeers continued to look disconsolately about him and to listen to these noises in profound silence broken only by the rustling of his large coat as he now and then moved his arm to raise his glass to his lips mr squeers continued to do this for some time until the increasing gloom warned him to snuff the candle seeming to be slightly roused by this exertion he raised his eye to the ceiling and fixing it upon some uncouth and fantastic figures traced upon it by the wet and damp which had penetrated through the roof broke into the following soliloquy  well this is a pretty go is this here an uncommon pretty go here have i been a matter of how many weekshard upon sixa follering up this here blessed old dowager petty larcenerermr squeers delivered himself of this epithet with great difficulty and effortand dotheboys hall arunning itself regularly to seed the while thats the worst of ever being in with a owdacious chap like that old nickleby you never know when hes done with you and if youre in for a penny youre in for a pound  this remark perhaps reminded mr squeers that he was in for a hundred pound at any rate his countenance relaxed and he raised his glass to his mouth with an air of greater enjoyment of its contents than he had before evinced  i never see soliloquised mr squeers in continuation i never see nor come across such a file as that old nickleby never hes out of everybodys depth he is hes what you may call a rasper is nickleby to see how sly and cunning he grubbed on day after day aworming and plodding and tracing and turning and twining of hisself about till he found out where this precious mrs peg was hid and cleared the ground for me to work upon creeping and crawling and gliding like a ugly old brighteyed stagnationblooded adder ah hed have made a good un in our line but it would have been too limited for him his genius would have busted all bonds and coming over every obstacle broke down all before it till it erected itself into a monneyment ofwell ill think of the rest and say it when conwenient  making a halt in his reflections at this place mr squeers again put his glass to his lips and drawing a dirty letter from his pocket proceeded to con over its contents with the air of a man who had read it very often and now refreshed his memory rather in the absence of better amusement than for any specific information  the pigs is well said mr squeers the cows is well and the boys is bobbish young sprouter has been awinking has he ill wink him when i get back cobbey would persist in sniffing while he was aeating his dinner and said that the beef was so strong it made himvery good cobbey well see if we cant make you sniff a little without beef pitcher was took with another feverof course he wasand being fetched by his friends died the day after he got homeof course he did and out of aggravation its part of a deeplaid system there ant another chap in the school but that boy as would have died exactly at the end of the quarter taking it out of me to the very last and then carrying his spite to the utmost extremity the juniorest palmer said he wished he was in heaven i really dont know i do not know whats to be done with that young fellow hes always awishing something horrid he said once he wished he was a donkey because then he wouldnt have a father as didnt love him pretty wicious that for a child of six  mr squeers was so much moved by the contemplation of this hardened nature in one so young that he angrily put up the letter and sought in a new train of ideas a subject of consolation  its a long time to have been alingering in london he said and this is a precious hole to come and live in even if it has been only for a week or so still one hundred pound is five boys and five boys takes a whole year to pay one hundred pounds and theres their keep to be substracted besides theres nothing lost neither by ones being here because the boys money comes in just the same as if i was at home and mrs squeers she keeps them in order therell be some lost time to make up of course therell be an arrear of flogging asll have to be gone through still a couple of days makes that all right and one dont mind a little extra work for one hundred pound its pretty nigh the time to wait upon the old woman from what she said last night i suspect that if im to succeed at all i shall succeed tonight so ill have half a glass more to wish myself success and put myself in spirits mrs squeers my dear your health  leering with his one eye as if the lady to whom he drank had been actually present mr squeersin his enthusiasm no doubtpoured out a full glass and emptied it and as the liquor was raw spirits and he had applied himself to the same bottle more than once already it is not surprising that he found himself by this time in an extremely cheerful state and quite enough excited for his purpose  what this purpose was soon appeared for after a few turns about the room to steady himself he took the bottle under his arm and the glass in his hand and blowing out the candle as if he purposed being gone some time stole out upon the staircase and creeping softly to a door opposite his own tapped gently at it  but whats the use of tapping he said shell never hear i suppose she isnt doing anything very particular and if she is it dont much matter that i see  with this brief preface mr squeers applied his hand to the latch of the door and thrusting his head into a garret far more deplorable than that he had just left and seeing that there was nobody there but an old woman who was bending over a wretched fire for although the weather was still warm the evening was chilly walked in and tapped her on the shoulder  well my slider said mr squeers jocularly  is that you inquired peg  ah its me and mes the first person singular nominative case agreeing with the verb its and governed by squeers understood as a acorn a hour but when the h is sounded the a only is to be used as a and a art a ighway replied mr squeers quoting at random from the grammar at least if it isnt you dont know any better and if it is ive done it accidentally  delivering this reply in his accustomed tone of voice in which of course it was inaudible to peg mr squeers drew a stool to the fire and placing himself over against her and the bottle and glass on the floor between them roared out again very loud  well my slider  i hear you said peg receiving him very graciously  ive come according to promise roared squeers  so they used to say in that part of the country i come from observed peg complacently but i think oils better  better than what roared squeers adding some rather strong language in an undertone  no said peg of course not  i never saw such a monster as you are muttered squeers looking as amiable as he possibly could the while for pegs eye was upon him and she was chuckling fearfully as though in delight at having made a choice repartee do you see this this is a bottle  i see it answered peg  well and do you see this bawled squeers this is a glass peg saw that too  see here then said squeers accompanying his remarks with appropriate action i fill the glass from the bottle and i say your health slider and empty it then i rinse it genteelly with a little drop which im forced to throw into the firehallo we shall have the chimbley alight nextfill it again and hand it over to you  your health said peg  she understands that anyways muttered squeers watching mrs sliderskew as she dispatched her portion and choked and gasped in a most awful manner after so doing now then lets have a talk hows the rheumatics  mrs sliderskew with much blinking and chuckling and with looks expressive of her strong admiration of mr squeers his person manners and conversation replied that the rheumatics were better  whats the reason said mr squeers deriving fresh facetiousness from the bottle whats the reason of rheumatics what do they mean what do people haveem foreh  mrs sliderskew didnt know but suggested that it was possibly because they couldnt help it  measles rheumatics hoopingcough fevers agers and lumbagers said mr squeers is all philosophy together thats what it is the heavenly bodies is philosophy and the earthly bodies is philosophy if theres a screw loose in a heavenly body thats philosophy and if theres screw loose in a earthly body thats philosophy too or it may be that sometimes theres a little metaphysics in it but thats not often philosophys the chap for me if a parent asks a question in the classical commercial or mathematical line says i gravely why sir in the first place are you a philosopherno mr squeers he says i ant then sir says i i am sorry for you for i shant be able to explain it naturally the parent goes away and wishes he was a philosopher and equally naturally thinks im one  saying this and a great deal more with tipsy profundity and a seriocomic air and keeping his eye all the time on mrs sliderskew who was unable to hear one word mr squeers concluded by helping himself and passing the bottle to which peg did becoming reverence  thats the time of day said mr squeers you look twenty pound ten better than you did  again mrs sliderskew chuckled but modesty forbade her assenting verbally to the compliment  twenty pound ten better repeated mr squeers than you did that day when i first introduced myself dont you know  ah said peg shaking her head but you frightened me that day  did i said squeers well it was rather a startling thing for a stranger to come and recommend himself by saying that he knew all about you and what your name was and why you were living so quiet here and what you had boned and who you boned it from wasnt it  peg nodded her head in strong assent  but i know everything that happens in that way you see continued squeers nothing takes place of that kind that i ant up to entirely im a sort of a lawyer slider of firstrate standing and understanding too im the intimate friend and confidential adwiser of pretty nigh every man woman and child that gets themselves into difficulties by being too nimble with their fingers im  mr squeerss catalogue of his own merits and accomplishments which was partly the result of a concerted plan between himself and ralph nickleby and flowed in part from the black bottle was here interrupted by mrs sliderskew  ha ha ha she cried folding her arms and wagging her head and so he wasnt married after all wasnt he not married after all  no replied squeers that he wasnt  and a young lover come and carried off the bride eh said peg  from under his very nose replied squeers and im told the young chap cut up rough besides and broke the winders and forced him to swaller his wedding favour which nearly choked him  tell me all about it again cried peg with a malicious relish of her old masters defeat which made her natural hideousness something quite fearful lets hear it all again beginning at the beginning now as if youd never told me lets have it every wordnownowbeginning at the very first you know when he went to the house that morning  mr squeers plying mrs sliderskew freely with the liquor and sustaining himself under the exertion of speaking so loud by frequent applications to it himself complied with this request by describing the discomfiture of arthur gride with such improvements on the truth as happened to occur to him and the ingenious invention and application of which had been very instrumental in recommending him to her notice in the beginning of their acquaintance mrs sliderskew was in an ecstasy of delight rolling her head about drawing up her skinny shoulders and wrinkling her cadaverous face into so many and such complicated forms of ugliness as awakened the unbounded astonishment and disgust even of mr squeers  hes a treacherous old goat said peg and cozened me with cunning tricks and lying promises but never mind im even with him im even with him  more than even slider returned squeers youd have been even with him if hed got married but with the disappointment besides youre a long way ahead out of sight slider quite out of sight and that reminds me he added handing her the glass if you want me to give you my opinion of them deeds and tell you what youd better keep and what youd better burn why nows your time slider  there ant no hurry for that said peg with several knowing looks and winks  oh very well observed squeers it dont matter to me you asked me you know i shouldnt charge you nothing being a friend youre the best judge of course but youre a bold woman slider  how do you mean bold said peg  why i only mean that if it was me i wouldnt keep papers as might hang me littering about when they might be turned into moneythem as wasnt useful made away with and them as was laid by somewheres safe thats all returned squeers but everybodys the best judge of their own affairs all i say is slider i wouldnt do it  come said peg then you shall see em  i dont want to see em replied squeers affecting to be out of humour dont talk as if it was a treat show em to somebody else and take their advice  mr squeers would very likely have carried on the farce of being offended a little longer if mrs sliderskew in her anxiety to restore herself to her former high position in his good graces had not become so extremely affectionate that he stood at some risk of being smothered by her caresses repressing with as good a grace as possible these little familiaritiesfor which there is reason to believe the black bottle was at least as much to blame as any constitutional infirmity on the part of mrs sliderskewhe protested that he had only been joking and in proof of his unimpaired goodhumour that he was ready to examine the deeds at once if by so doing he could afford any satisfaction or relief of mind to his fair friend  and now youre up my slider bawled squeers as she rose to fetch them bolt the door  peg trotted to the door and after fumbling at the bolt crept to the other end of the room and from beneath the coals which filled the bottom of the cupboard drew forth a small deal box having placed this on the floor at squeerss feet she brought from under the pillow of her bed a small key with which she signed to that gentleman to open it mr squeers who had eagerly followed her every motion lost no time in obeying this hint and throwing back the lid gazed with rapture on the documents which lay within  now you see said peg kneeling down on the floor beside him and staying his impatient hand whats of no use well burn what we can get any money by well keep and if theres any we could get him into trouble by and fret and waste away his heart to shreds those well take particular care of for thats what i want to do and what i hoped to do when i left him  i thought said squeers that you didnt bear him any particular goodwill but i say why didnt you take some money besides  some what asked peg  some money roared squeers i do believe the woman hears me and wants to make me break a wessel so that she may have the pleasure of nursing me some money slider money  why what a man you are to ask cried peg with some contempt if i had taken money from arthur gride hed have scoured the whole earth to find meaye and hed have smelt it out and raked it up somehow if i had buried it at the bottom of the deepest well in england no no i knew better than that i took what i thought his secrets were hid in and them he couldnt afford to make public letem be worth ever so much money hes an old dog a sly old cunning thankless dog he first starved and then tricked me and if i could id kill him  all right and very laudable said squeers but first and foremost slider burn the box you should never keep things as may lead to discovery always mind that so while you pull it to pieces which you can easily do for its very old and rickety and burn it in little bits ill look over the papers and tell you what they are  peg expressing her acquiescence in this arrangement mr squeers turned the box bottom upwards and tumbling the contents upon the floor handed it to her the destruction of the box being an extemporary device for engaging her attention in case it should prove desirable to distract it from his own proceedings  there said squeers you poke the pieces between the bars and make up a good fire and ill read the while let me see let me see and taking the candle down beside him mr squeers with great eagerness and a cunning grin overspreading his face entered upon his task of examination  if the old woman had not been very deaf she must have heard when she last went to the door the breathing of two persons close behind it and if those two persons had been unacquainted with her infirmity they must probably have chosen that moment either for presenting themselves or taking to flight but knowing with whom they had to deal they remained quite still and now not only appeared unobserved at the doorwhich was not bolted for the bolt had no haspbut warily and with noiseless footsteps advanced into the room  as they stole farther and farther in by slight and scarcely perceptible degrees and with such caution that they scarcely seemed to breathe the old hag and squeers little dreaming of any such invasion and utterly unconscious of there being any soul near but themselves were busily occupied with their tasks the old woman with her wrinkled face close to the bars of the stove puffing at the dull embers which had not yet caught the wood squeers stooping down to the candle which brought out the full ugliness of his face as the light of the fire did that of his companion both intently engaged and wearing faces of exultation which contrasted strongly with the anxious looks of those behind who took advantage of the slightest sound to cover their advance and almost before they had moved an inch and all was silent stopped again this with the large bare room damp walls and flickering doubtful light combined to form a scene which the most careless and indifferent spectator could any have been present could scarcely have failed to derive some interest from and would not readily have forgotten  of the stealthy comers frank cheeryble was one and newman noggs the other newman had caught up by the rusty nozzle an old pair of bellows which were just undergoing a flourish in the air preparatory to a descent upon the head of mr squeers when frank with an earnest gesture stayed his arm and taking another step in advance came so close behind the schoolmaster that by leaning slightly forward he could plainly distinguish the writing which he held up to his eye  mr squeers not being remarkably erudite appeared to be considerably puzzled by this first prize which was in an engrossing hand and not very legible except to a practised eye having tried it by reading from left to right and from right to left and finding it equally clear both ways he turned it upside down with no better success  ha ha ha chuckled peg who on her knees before the fire was feeding it with fragments of the box and grinning in most devilish exultation whats that writing about eh  nothing particular replied squeers tossing it towards her its only an old lease as well as i can make out throw it in the fire  mrs sliderskew complied and inquired what the next one was  this said squeers is a bundle of overdue acceptances and renewed bills of six or eight young gentlemen but theyre all mps so its of no use to anybody throw it in the fire peg did as she was bidden and waited for the next  this said squeers seems to be some deed of sale of the right of presentation to the rectory of purechurch in the valley of cashup take care of that slider literally for gods sake itll fetch its price at the auction mart  whats the next inquired peg  why this said squeers seems from the two letters thats with it to be a bond from a curate down in the country to pay half a years wages of forty pound for borrowing twenty take care of that for if he dont pay it his bishop will very soon be down upon him we know what the camel and the needles eye means no man as cant live upon his income whatever it is must expect to go to heaven at any price its very odd i dont see anything like it yet  whats the matter said peg  nothing replied squeers only im looking for  newman raised the bellows again once more frank by a rapid motion of his arm unaccompanied by any noise checked him in his purpose  here you are said squeers bondstake care of them warrant of attorneytake care of that two cognovitstake care of them lease and releaseburn that ah madeline braycome of age or marrythe said madelinehere burn that  eagerly throwing towards the old woman a parchment that he caught up for the purpose squeers as she turned her head thrust into the breast of his large coat the deed in which these words had caught his eye and burst into a shout of triumph  ive got it said squeers ive got it hurrah the plan was a good one though the chance was desperate and the days our own at last  peg demanded what he laughed at but no answer was returned newmans arm could no longer be restrained the bellows descending heavily and with unerring aim on the very centre of mr squeerss head felled him to the floor and stretched him on it flat and senseless    chapter 58  in which one scene of this history is closed   dividing the distance into two days journey in order that his charge might sustain the less exhaustion and fatigue from travelling so far nicholas at the end of the second day from their leaving home found himself within a very few miles of the spot where the happiest years of his life had been passed and which while it filled his mind with pleasant and peaceful thoughts brought back many painful and vivid recollections of the circumstances in which he and his had wandered forth from their old home cast upon the rough world and the mercy of strangers  it needed no such reflections as those which the memory of old days and wanderings among scenes where our childhood has been passed usually awaken in the most insensible minds to soften the heart of nicholas and render him more than usually mindful of his drooping friend by night and day at all times and seasons always watchful attentive and solicitous and never varying in the discharge of his selfimposed duty to one so friendless and helpless as he whose sands of life were now fast running out and dwindling rapidly away he was ever at his side he never left him to encourage and animate him administer to his wants support and cheer him to the utmost of his power was now his constant and unceasing occupation  they procured a humble lodging in a small farmhouse surrounded by meadows where nicholas had often revelled when a child with a troop of merry schoolfellows and here they took up their rest  at first smike was strong enough to walk about for short distances at a time with no other support or aid than that which nicholas could afford him at this time nothing appeared to interest him so much as visiting those places which had been most familiar to his friend in bygone days yielding to this fancy and pleased to find that its indulgence beguiled the sick boy of many tedious hours and never failed to afford him matter for thought and conversation afterwards nicholas made such spots the scenes of their daily rambles driving him from place to place in a little ponychair and supporting him on his arm while they walked slowly among these old haunts or lingered in the sunlight to take long parting looks of those which were most quiet and beautiful  it was on such occasions as these that nicholas yielding almost unconsciously to the interest of old associations would point out some tree that he had climbed a hundred times to peep at the young birds in their nest and the branch from which he used to shout to little kate who stood below terrified at the height he had gained and yet urging him higher still by the intensity of her admiration there was the old house too which they would pass every day looking up at the tiny window through which the sun used to stream in and wake him on the summer morningsthey were all summer mornings thenand climbing up the gardenwall and looking over nicholas could see the very rosebush which had come a present to kate from some little lover and she had planted with her own hands there were the hedgerows where the brother and sister had so often gathered wild flowers together and the green fields and shady paths where they had so often strayed there was not a lane or brook or copse or cottage near with which some childish event was not entwined and back it came upon the mindas events of childhood donothing in itself perhaps a word a laugh a look some slight distress a passing thought or fear and yet more strongly and distinctly marked and better remembered than the hardest trials or severest sorrows of a year ago  one of these expeditions led them through the churchyard where was his fathers grave even here said nicholas softly we used to loiter before we knew what death was and when we little thought whose ashes would rest beneath and wondering at the silence sit down to rest and speak below our breath once kate was lost and after an hour of fruitless search they found her fast asleep under that tree which shades my fathers grave he was very fond of her and said when he took her up in his arms still sleeping that whenever he died he would wish to be buried where his dear little child had laid her head you see his wish was not forgotten  nothing more passed at the time but that night as nicholas sat beside his bed smike started from what had seemed to be a slumber and laying his hand in his prayed as the tears coursed down his face that he would make him one solemn promise  what is that said nicholas kindly if i can redeem it or hope to do so you know i will  i am sure you will was the reply promise me that when i die i shall be buried nearas near as they can make my graveto the tree we saw today  nicholas gave the promise he had few words to give it in but they were solemn and earnest his poor friend kept his hand in his and turned as if to sleep but there were stifled sobs and the hand was pressed more than once or twice or thrice before he sank to rest and slowly loosed his hold  in a fortnights time he became too ill to move about once or twice nicholas drove him out propped up with pillows but the motion of the chaise was painful to him and brought on fits of fainting which in his weakened state were dangerous there was an old couch in the house which was his favourite restingplace by day and when the sun shone and the weather was warm nicholas had this wheeled into a little orchard which was close at hand and his charge being well wrapped up and carried out to it they used to sit there sometimes for hours together  it was on one of these occasions that a circumstance took place which nicholas at the time thoroughly believed to be the mere delusion of an imagination affected by disease but which he had afterwards too good reason to know was of real and actual occurrence  he had brought smike out in his armspoor fellow a child might have carried him thento see the sunset and having arranged his couch had taken his seat beside it he had been watching the whole of the night before and being greatly fatigued both in mind and body gradually fell asleep  he could not have closed his eyes five minutes when he was awakened by a scream and starting up in that kind of terror which affects a person suddenly roused saw to his great astonishment that his charge had struggled into a sitting posture and with eyes almost starting from their sockets cold dew standing on his forehead and in a fit of trembling which quite convulsed his frame was calling to him for help  good heaven what is this said nicholas bending over him be calm you have been dreaming  no no no cried smike clinging to him hold me tight dont let me go there there behind the tree  nicholas followed his eyes which were directed to some distance behind the chair from which he himself had just risen but there was nothing there  this is nothing but your fancy he said as he strove to compose him nothing else indeed  i know better i saw as plain as i see now was the answer oh say youll keep me with you swear you wont leave me for an instant  do i ever leave you returned nicholas lie down againthere you see im here now tell me what was it  do you remember said smike in a low voice and glancing fearfully round do you remember my telling you of the man who first took me to the school  yes surely  i raised my eyes just now towards that treethat one with the thick trunkand there with his eyes fixed on me he stood  only reflect for one moment said nicholas granting for an instant that its likely he is alive and wandering about a lonely place like this so far removed from the public road do you think that at this distance of time you could possibly know that man again  anywherein any dress returned smike but just now he stood leaning upon his stick and looking at me exactly as i told you i remembered him he was dusty with walking and poorly dressedi think his clothes were raggedbut directly i saw him the wet night his face when he left me the parlour i was left in and the people that were there all seemed to come back together when he knew i saw him he looked frightened for he started and shrunk away i have thought of him by day and dreamt of him by night he looked in my sleep when i was quite a little child and has looked in my sleep ever since as he did just now  nicholas endeavoured by every persuasion and argument he could think of to convince the terrified creature that his imagination had deceived him and that this close resemblance between the creation of his dreams and the man he supposed he had seen was but a proof of it but all in vain when he could persuade him to remain for a few moments in the care of the people to whom the house belonged he instituted a strict inquiry whether any stranger had been seen and searched himself behind the tree and through the orchard and upon the land immediately adjoining and in every place near where it was possible for a man to lie concealed but all in vain satisfied that he was right in his original conjecture he applied himself to calming the fears of smike which after some time he partially succeeded in doing though not in removing the impression upon his mind for he still declared again and again in the most solemn and fervid manner that he had positively seen what he had described and that nothing could ever remove his conviction of its reality  and now nicholas began to see that hope was gone and that upon the partner of his poverty and the sharer of his better fortune the world was closing fast there was little pain little uneasiness but there was no rallying no effort no struggle for life he was worn and wasted to the last degree his voice had sunk so low that he could scarce be heard to speak nature was thoroughly exhausted and he had lain him down to die  on a fine mild autumn day when all was tranquil and at peace when the soft sweet air crept in at the open window of the quiet room and not a sound was heard but the gentle rustling of the leaves nicholas sat in his old place by the bedside and knew that the time was nearly come so very still it was that every now and then he bent down his ear to listen for the breathing of him who lay asleep as if to assure himself that life was still there and that he had not fallen into that deep slumber from which on earth there is no waking  while he was thus employed the closed eyes opened and on the pale face there came a placid smile  thats well said nicholas the sleep has done you good  i have had such pleasant dreams was the answer such pleasant happy dreams  of what said nicholas  the dying boy turned towards him and putting his arm about his neck made answer i shall soon be there  after a short silence he spoke again  i am not afraid to die he said i am quite contented i almost think that if i could rise from this bed quite well i would not wish to do so now you have so often told me we shall meet againso very often lately and now i feel the truth of that so stronglythat i can even bear to part from you  the trembling voice and tearful eye and the closer grasp of the arm which accompanied these latter words showed how they filled the speakers heart nor were there wanting indications of how deeply they had touched the heart of him to whom they were addressed  you say well returned nicholas at length and comfort me very much dear fellow let me hear you say you are happy if you can  i must tell you something first i should not have a secret from you you would not blame me at a time like this i know  i blame you exclaimed nicholas  i am sure you would not you asked me why i was so changed andand sat so much alone shall i tell you why  not if it pains you said nicholas i only asked that i might make you happier if i could  i know i felt that at the time he drew his friend closer to him you will forgive me i could not help it but though i would have died to make her happy it broke my heart to seei know he loves her dearlyoh who could find that out so soon as i  the words which followed were feebly and faintly uttered and broken by long pauses but from them nicholas learnt for the first time that the dying boy with all the ardour of a nature concentrated on one absorbing hopeless secret passion loved his sister kate  he had procured a lock of her hair which hung at his breast folded in one or two slight ribbons she had worn he prayed that when he was dead nicholas would take it off so that no eyes but his might see it and that when he was laid in his coffin and about to be placed in the earth he would hang it round his neck again that it might rest with him in the grave  upon his knees nicholas gave him this pledge and promised again that he should rest in the spot he had pointed out they embraced and kissed each other on the cheek  now he murmured i am happy  he fell into a light slumber and waking smiled as before then spoke of beautiful gardens which he said stretched out before him and were filled with figures of men women and many children all with light upon their faces then whispered that it was edenand so died    chapter 59  the plots begin to fail and doubts and dangers to disturb the plotter   ralph sat alone in the solitary room where he was accustomed to take his meals and to sit of nights when no profitable occupation called him abroad before him was an untasted breakfast and near to where his fingers beat restlessly upon the table lay his watch it was long past the time at which for many years he had put it in his pocket and gone with measured steps downstairs to the business of the day but he took as little heed of its monotonous warning as of the meat and drink before him and remained with his head resting on one hand and his eyes fixed moodily on the ground  this departure from his regular and constant habit in one so regular and unvarying in all that appertained to the daily pursuit of riches would almost of itself have told that the usurer was not well that he laboured under some mental or bodily indisposition and that it was one of no slight kind so to affect a man like him was sufficiently shown by his haggard face jaded air and hollow languid eyes which he raised at last with a start and a hasty glance around him as one who suddenly awakes from sleep and cannot immediately recognise the place in which he finds himself  what is this he said that hangs over me and i cannot shake off i have never pampered myself and should not be ill i have never moped and pined and yielded to fancies but what can a man do without rest  he pressed his hand upon his forehead  night after night comes and goes and i have no rest if i sleep what rest is that which is disturbed by constant dreams of the same detested faces crowding round meof the same detested people in every variety of action mingling with all i say and do and always to my defeat waking what rest have i constantly haunted by this heavy shadow ofi know not whatwhich is its worst character i must have rest one nights unbroken rest and i should be a man again  pushing the table from him while he spoke as though he loathed the sight of food he encountered the watch the hands of which were almost upon noon  this is strange he said noon and noggs not here what drunken brawl keeps him away i would give something nowsomething in money even after that dreadful lossif he had stabbed a man in a tavern scuffle or broken into a house or picked a pocket or done anything that would send him abroad with an iron ring upon his leg and rid me of him better still if i could throw temptation in his way and lure him on to rob me he should be welcome to what he took so i brought the law upon him for he is a traitor i swear how or when or where i dont know though i suspect  after waiting for another halfhour he dispatched the woman who kept his house to newmans lodging to inquire if he were ill and why he had not come or sent she brought back answer that he had not been home all night and that no one could tell her anything about him  but there is a gentleman sir she said below who was standing at the door when i came in and he says  what says he demanded ralph turning angrily upon her i told you i would see nobody  he says replied the woman abashed by his harshness that he comes on very particular business which admits of no excuse and i thought perhaps it might be about  about what in the devils name said ralph you spy and speculate on peoples business with me do you  dear no sir i saw you were anxious and thought it might be about mr noggs thats all  saw i was anxious muttered ralph they all watch me now where is this person you did not say i was not down yet i hope  the woman replied that he was in the little office and that she had said her master was engaged but she would take the message  well said ralph ill see him go you to your kitchen and keep there do you mind me  glad to be released the woman quickly disappeared collecting himself and assuming as much of his accustomed manner as his utmost resolution could summon ralph descended the stairs after pausing for a few moments with his hand upon the lock he entered newmans room and confronted mr charles cheeryble  of all men alive this was one of the last he would have wished to meet at any time but now that he recognised in him only the patron and protector of nicholas he would rather have seen a spectre one beneficial effect however the encounter had upon him it instantly roused all his dormant energies rekindled in his breast the passions that for many years had found an improving home there called up all his wrath hatred and malice restored the sneer to his lip and the scowl to his brow and made him again in all outward appearance the same ralph nickleby whom so many had bitter cause to remember  humph said ralph pausing at the door this is an unexpected favour sir  and an unwelcome one said brother charles an unwelcome one i know  men say you are truth itself sir replied ralph you speak truth now at all events and ill not contradict you the favour is at least as unwelcome as it is unexpected i can scarcely say more  plainly sir began brother charles  plainly sir interrupted ralph i wish this conference to be a short one and to end where it begins i guess the subject upon which you are about to speak and ill not hear you you like plainness i believe there it is here is the door as you see our way lies in very different directions take yours i beg of you and leave me to pursue mine in quiet  in quiet repeated brother charles mildly and looking at him with more of pity than reproach to pursue his way in quiet  you will scarcely remain in my house i presume sir against my will said ralph or you can scarcely hope to make an impression upon a man who closes his ears to all that you can say and is firmly and resolutely determined not to hear you  mr nickleby sir returned brother charles no less mildly than before but firmly too i come here against my will sorely and grievously against my will i have never been in this house before and to speak my mind sir i dont feel at home or easy in it and have no wish ever to be here again you do not guess the subject on which i come to speak to you you do not indeed i am sure of that or your manner would be a very different one  ralph glanced keenly at him but the clear eye and open countenance of the honest old merchant underwent no change of expression and met his look without reserve  shall i go on said mr cheeryble  oh by all means if you please returned ralph drily here are walls to speak to sir a desk and two stools most attentive auditors and certain not to interrupt you go on i beg make my house yours and perhaps by the time i return from my walk you will have finished what you have to say and will yield me up possession again  so saying he buttoned his coat and turning into the passage took down his hat the old gentleman followed and was about to speak when ralph waved him off impatiently and said  not a word i tell you sir not a word virtuous as you are you are not an angel yet to appear in mens houses whether they will or no and pour your speech into unwilling ears preach to the walls i tell you not to me  i am no angel heaven knows returned brother charles shaking his head but an erring and imperfect man nevertheless there is one quality which all men have in common with the angels blessed opportunities of exercising if they will mercy it is an errand of mercy that brings me here pray let me discharge it  i show no mercy retorted ralph with a triumphant smile and i ask none seek no mercy from me sir in behalf of the fellow who has imposed upon your childish credulity but let him expect the worst that i can do  he ask mercy at your hands exclaimed the old merchant warmly ask it at his sir ask it at his if you will not hear me now when you may hear me when you must or anticipate what i would say and take measures to prevent our ever meeting again your nephew is a noble lad sir an honest noble lad what you are mr nickleby i will not say but what you have done i know now sir when you go about the business in which you have been recently engaged and find it difficult of pursuing come to me and my brother ned and tim linkinwater sir and well explain it for youand come soon or it may be too late and you may have it explained with a little more roughness and a little less delicacyand never forget sir that i came here this morning in mercy to you and am still ready to talk to you in the same spirit  with these words uttered with great emphasis and emotion brother charles put on his broadbrimmed hat and passing ralph nickleby without any other remark trotted nimbly into the street ralph looked after him but neither moved nor spoke for some time when he broke what almost seemed the silence of stupefaction by a scornful laugh  this he said from its wildness should be another of those dreams that have so broken my rest of late in mercy to me pho the old simpleton has gone mad  although he expressed himself in this derisive and contemptuous manner it was plain that the more ralph pondered the more ill at ease he became and the more he laboured under some vague anxiety and alarm which increased as the time passed on and no tidings of newman noggs arrived after waiting until late in the afternoon tortured by various apprehensions and misgivings and the recollection of the warning which his nephew had given him when they last met the further confirmation of which now presented itself in one shape of probability now in another and haunted him perpetually he left home and scarcely knowing why save that he was in a suspicious and agitated mood betook himself to snawleys house his wife presented herself and of her ralph inquired whether her husband was at home  no she said sharply he is not indeed and i dont think he will be at home for a very long time thats more  do you know who i am asked ralph  oh yes i know you very well too well perhaps and perhaps he does too and sorry am i that i should have to say it  tell him that i saw him through the windowblind above as i crossed the road just now and that i would speak to him on business said ralph do you hear  i hear rejoined mrs snawley taking no further notice of the request  i knew this woman was a hypocrite in the way of psalms and scripture phrases said ralph passing quietly by but i never knew she drank before  stop you dont come in here said mr snawleys betterhalf interposing her person which was a robust one in the doorway you have said more than enough to him on business before now i always told him what dealing with you and working out your schemes would come to it was either you or the schoolmasterone of you or the two between youthat got the forged letter done remember that that wasnt his doing so dont lay it at his door  hold your tongue you jezebel said ralph looking fearfully round  ah i know when to hold my tongue and when to speak mr nickleby retorted the dame take care that other people know when to hold theirs  you jade said ralph if your husband has been idiot enough to trust you with his secrets keep them keep them shedevil that you are  not so much his secrets as other peoples secrets perhaps retorted the woman not so much his secrets as yours none of your black looks at me youll want em all perhaps for another time you had better keep em  will you said ralph suppressing his passion as well as he could and clutching her tightly by the wrist will you go to your husband and tell him that i know he is at home and that i must see him and will you tell me what it is that you and he mean by this new style of behaviour  no replied the woman violently disengaging herself ill do neither  you set me at defiance do you said ralph  yes was the answer i do  for an instant ralph had his hand raised as though he were about to strike her but checking himself and nodding his head and muttering as though to assure her he would not forget this walked away  thence he went straight to the inn which mr squeers frequented and inquired when he had been there last in the vague hope that successful or unsuccessful he might by this time have returned from his mission and be able to assure him that all was safe but mr squeers had not been there for ten days and all that the people could tell about him was that he had left his luggage and his bill  disturbed by a thousand fears and surmises and bent upon ascertaining whether squeers had any suspicion of snawley or was in any way a party to this altered behaviour ralph determined to hazard the extreme step of inquiring for him at the lambeth lodging and having an interview with him even there bent upon this purpose and in that mood in which delay is insupportable he repaired at once to the place and being by description perfectly acquainted with the situation of his room crept upstairs and knocked gently at the door  not one nor two nor three nor yet a dozen knocks served to convince ralph against his wish that there was nobody inside he reasoned that he might be asleep and listening almost persuaded himself that he could hear him breathe even when he was satisfied that he could not be there he sat patiently on a broken stair and waited arguing that he had gone out upon some slight errand and must soon return  many feet came up the creaking stairs and the step of some seemed to his listening ear so like that of the man for whom he waited that ralph often stood up to be ready to address him when he reached the top but one by one each person turned off into some room short of the place where he was stationed and at every such disappointment he felt quite chilled and lonely  at length he felt it was hopeless to remain and going downstairs again inquired of one of the lodgers if he knew anything of mr squeerss movementsmentioning that worthy by an assumed name which had been agreed upon between them by this lodger he was referred to another and by him to someone else from whom he learnt that late on the previous night he had gone out hastily with two men who had shortly afterwards returned for the old woman who lived on the same floor and that although the circumstance had attracted the attention of the informant he had not spoken to them at the time nor made any inquiry afterwards  this possessed him with the idea that perhaps peg sliderskew had been apprehended for the robbery and that mr squeers being with her at the time had been apprehended also on suspicion of being a confederate if this were so the fact must be known to gride and to grides house he directed his steps now thoroughly alarmed and fearful that there were indeed plots afoot tending to his discomfiture and ruin  arrived at the usurers house he found the windows close shut the dingy blinds drawn down all was silent melancholy and deserted but this was its usual aspect he knockedgently at firstthen loud and vigorously nobody came he wrote a few words in pencil on a card and having thrust it under the door was going away when a noise above as though a windowsash were stealthily raised caught his ear and looking up he could just discern the face of gride himself cautiously peering over the house parapet from the window of the garret seeing who was below he drew it in again not so quickly however but that ralph let him know he was observed and called to him to come down  the call being repeated gride looked out again so cautiously that no part of the old mans body was visible the sharp features and white hair appearing alone above the parapet looked like a severed head garnishing the wall  hush he cried go away go away  come down said ralph beckoning him  go away squeaked gride shaking his head in a sort of ecstasy of impatience dont speak to me dont knock dont call attention to the house but go away  ill knock i swear till i have your neighbours up in arms said ralph if you dont tell me what you mean by lurking there you whining cur  i cant hear what you saydont talk to meit isnt safego awaygo away returned gride  come down i say will you come down said ralph fiercely  nooooo snarled gride he drew in his head and ralph left standing in the street could hear the sash closed as gently and carefully as it had been opened  how is this said he that they all fall from me and shun me like the plague these men who have licked the dust from my feet is my day past and is this indeed the coming on of night ill know what it means i will at any cost i am firmer and more myself just now than i have been these many days  turning from the door which in the first transport of his rage he had meditated battering upon until grides very fears should impel him to open it he turned his face towards the city and working his way steadily through the crowd which was pouring from it it was by this time between five and six oclock in the afternoon went straight to the house of business of the brothers cheeryble and putting his head into the glass case found tim linkinwater alone  my names nickleby said ralph  i know it replied tim surveying him through his spectacles  which of your firm was it who called on me this morning demanded ralph  mr charles  then tell mr charles i want to see him  you shall see said tim getting off his stool with great agility you shall see not only mr charles but mr ned likewise  tim stopped looked steadily and severely at ralph nodded his head once in a curt manner which seemed to say there was a little more behind and vanished after a short interval he returned and ushering ralph into the presence of the two brothers remained in the room himself  i want to speak to you who spoke to me this morning said ralph pointing out with his finger the man whom he addressed  i have no secrets from my brother ned or from tim linkinwater observed brother charles quietly  i have said ralph  mr nickleby sir said brother ned the matter upon which my brother charles called upon you this morning is one which is already perfectly well known to us three and to others besides and must unhappily soon become known to a great many more he waited upon you sir this morning alone as a matter of delicacy and consideration we feel now that further delicacy and consideration would be misplaced and if we confer together it must be as we are or not at all  well gentlemen said ralph with a curl of the lip talking in riddles would seem to be the peculiar forte of you two and i suppose your clerk like a prudent man has studied the art also with a view to your good graces talk in company gentlemen in gods name ill humour you  humour cried tim linkinwater suddenly growing very red in the face hell humour us hell humour cheeryble brothers do you hear that do you hear him do you hear him say hell humour cheeryble brothers  tim said charles and ned together pray tim pray now dont  tim taking the hint stifled his indignation as well as he could and suffered it to escape through his spectacles with the additional safetyvalve of a short hysterical laugh now and then which seemed to relieve him mightily  as nobody bids me to a seat said ralph looking round ill take one for i am fatigued with walking and now if you please gentlemen i wish to knowi demand to know i have the rightwhat you have to say to me which justifies such a tone as you have assumed and that underhand interference in my affairs which i have reason to suppose you have been practising i tell you plainly gentlemen that little as i care for the opinion of the world as the slang goes i dont choose to submit quietly to slander and malice whether you suffer yourselves to be imposed upon too easily or wilfully make yourselves parties to it the result to me is the same in either case you cant expect from a plain man like myself much consideration or forbearance  so coolly and deliberately was this said that nine men out of ten ignorant of the circumstances would have supposed ralph to be really an injured man there he sat with folded arms paler than usual certainly and sufficiently illfavoured but quite collectedfar more so than the brothers or the exasperated timand ready to face out the worst  very well sir said brother charles very well brother ned will you ring the bell  charles my dear fellow stop one instant returned the other it will be better for mr nickleby and for our object that he should remain silent if he can till we have said what we have to say i wish him to understand that  quite right quite right said brother charles  ralph smiled but made no reply the bell was rung the roomdoor opened a man came in with a halting walk and looking round ralphs eyes met those of newman noggs from that moment his heart began to fail him  this is a good beginning he said bitterly oh this is a good beginning you are candid honest openhearted fairdealing men i always knew the real worth of such characters as yours to tamper with a fellow like this who would sell his soul if he had one for drink and whose every word is a lie what men are safe if this is done oh its a good beginning  i will speak cried newman standing on tiptoe to look over tims head who had interposed to prevent him hallo you sirold nicklebywhat do you mean when you talk of a fellow like this who made me a fellow like this if i would sell my soul for drink why wasnt i a thief swindler housebreaker area sneak robber of pence out of the trays of blind mens dogs rather than your drudge and packhorse if my every word was a lie why wasnt i a pet and favourite of yours lie when did i ever cringe and fawn to you tell me that i served you faithfully i did more work because i was poor and took more hard words from you because i despised you and them than any man you could have got from the parish workhouse i did i served you because i was proud because i was a lonely man with you and there were no other drudges to see my degradation and because nobody knew better than you that i was a ruined man that i hadnt always been what i am and that i might have been better off if i hadnt been a fool and fallen into the hands of you and others who were knaves do you deny that  gently reasoned tim you said you wouldnt  i said i wouldnt cried newman thrusting him aside and moving his hand as tim moved so as to keep him at arms length dont tell me here you nickleby dont pretend not to mind me it wont do i know better you were talking of tampering just now who tampered with yorkshire schoolmasters and while they sent the drudge out that he shouldnt overhear forgot that such great caution might render him suspicious and that he might watch his master out at nights and might set other eyes to watch the schoolmaster who tampered with a selfish father urging him to sell his daughter to old arthur gride and tampered with gride too and did so in the little office with a closet in the room  ralph had put a great command upon himself but he could not have suppressed a slight start if he had been certain to be beheaded for it next moment  aha cried newman you mind me now do you what first set this fag to be jealous of his masters actions and to feel that if he hadnt crossed him when he might he would have been as bad as he or worse that masters cruel treatment of his own flesh and blood and vile designs upon a young girl who interested even his brokendown drunken miserable hack and made him linger in his service in the hope of doing her some good as thank god he had done others once or twice before when he would otherwise have relieved his feelings by pummelling his master soundly and then going to the devil he wouldmark that and mark thisthat im here now because these gentlemen thought it best when i sought them out as i did there was no tampering with me i told them i wanted help to find you out to trace you down to go through with what i had begun to help the right and that when i had done it id burst into your room and tell you all face to face man to man and like a man now ive said my say and let anybody else say theirs and fire away  with this concluding sentiment newman noggs who had been perpetually sitting down and getting up again all through his speech which he had delivered in a series of jerks and who was from the violent exercise and the excitement combined in a state of most intense and fiery heat became without passing through any intermediate stage stiff upright and motionless and so remained staring at ralph nickleby with all his might and main  ralph looked at him for an instant and for an instant only then waved his hand and beating the ground with his foot said in a choking voice  go on gentlemen go on im patient you see theres law to be had theres law i shall call you to an account for this take care what you say i shall make you prove it  the proof is ready returned brother charles quite ready to our hands the man snawley last night made a confession  who may the man snawley be returned ralph and what may his confession have to do with my affairs  to this inquiry put with a dogged inflexibility of manner the old gentleman returned no answer but went on to say that to show him how much they were in earnest it would be necessary to tell him not only what accusations were made against him but what proof of them they had and how that proof had been acquired this laying open of the whole question brought up brother ned tim linkinwater and newman noggs all three at once who after a vast deal of talking together and a scene of great confusion laid before ralph in distinct terms the following statement  that newman having been solemnly assured by one not then producible that smike was not the son of snawley and this person having offered to make oath to that effect if necessary they had by this communication been first led to doubt the claim set up which they would otherwise have seen no reason to dispute supported as it was by evidence which they had no power of disproving that once suspecting the existence of a conspiracy they had no difficulty in tracing back its origin to the malice of ralph and the vindictiveness and avarice of squeers that suspicion and proof being two very different things they had been advised by a lawyer eminent for his sagacity and acuteness in such practice to resist the proceedings taken on the other side for the recovery of the youth as slowly and artfully as possible and meanwhile to beset snawley with whom it was clear the main falsehood must rest to lead him if possible into contradictory and conflicting statements to harass him by all available means and so to practise on his fears and regard for his own safety as to induce him to divulge the whole scheme and to give up his employer and whomsoever else he could implicate that all this had been skilfully done but that snawley who was well practised in the arts of low cunning and intrigue had successfully baffled all their attempts until an unexpected circumstance had brought him last night upon his knees  it thus arose when newman noggs reported that squeers was again in town and that an interview of such secrecy had taken place between him and ralph that he had been sent out of the house plainly lest he should overhear a word a watch was set upon the schoolmaster in the hope that something might be discovered which would throw some light upon the suspected plot it being found however that he held no further communication with ralph nor any with snawley and lived quite alone they were completely at fault the watch was withdrawn and they would have observed his motions no longer if it had not happened that one night newman stumbled unobserved on him and ralph in the street together following them he discovered to his surprise that they repaired to various low lodginghouses and taverns kept by broken gamblers to more than one of whom ralph was known and that they were in pursuitso he found by inquiries when they had leftof an old woman whose description exactly tallied with that of deaf mrs sliderskew affairs now appearing to assume a more serious complexion the watch was renewed with increased vigilance an officer was procured who took up his abode in the same tavern with squeers and by him and frank cheeryble the footsteps of the unconscious schoolmaster were dogged until he was safely housed in the lodging at lambeth mr squeers having shifted his lodging the officer shifted his and lying concealed in the same street and indeed in the opposite house soon found that mr squeers and mrs sliderskew were in constant communication  in this state of things arthur gride was appealed to the robbery partly owing to the inquisitiveness of the neighbours and partly to his own grief and rage had long ago become known but he positively refused to give his sanction or yield any assistance to the old womans capture and was seized with such a panic at the idea of being called upon to give evidence against her that he shut himself up close in his house and refused to hold communication with anybody upon this the pursuers took counsel together and coming so near the truth as to arrive at the conclusion that gride and ralph with squeers for their instrument were negotiating for the recovery of some of the stolen papers which would not bear the light and might possibly explain the hints relative to madeline which newman had overheard resolved that mrs sliderskew should be taken into custody before she had parted with them and squeers too if anything suspicious could be attached to him accordingly a searchwarrant being procured and all prepared mr squeerss window was watched until his light was put out and the time arrived when as had been previously ascertained he usually visited mrs sliderskew this done frank cheeryble and newman stole upstairs to listen to their discourse and to give the signal to the officer at the most favourable time at what an opportune moment they arrived how they listened and what they heard is already known to the reader mr squeers still half stunned was hurried off with a stolen deed in his possession and mrs sliderskew was apprehended likewise the information being promptly carried to snawley that squeers was in custodyhe was not told for whatthat worthy first extorting a promise that he should be kept harmless declared the whole tale concerning smike to be a fiction and forgery and implicated ralph nickleby to the fullest extent as to mr squeers he had that morning undergone a private examination before a magistrate and being unable to account satisfactorily for his possession of the deed or his companionship with mrs sliderskew had been with her remanded for a week  all these discoveries were now related to ralph circumstantially and in detail whatever impression they secretly produced he suffered no sign of emotion to escape him but sat perfectly still not raising his frowning eyes from the ground and covering his mouth with his hand when the narrative was concluded he raised his head hastily as if about to speak but on brother charles resuming fell into his old attitude again  i told you this morning said the old gentleman laying his hand upon his brothers shoulder that i came to you in mercy how far you may be implicated in this last transaction or how far the person who is now in custody may criminate you you best know but justice must take its course against the parties implicated in the plot against this poor unoffending injured lad it is not in my power or in the power of my brother ned to save you from the consequences the utmost we can do is to warn you in time and to give you an opportunity of escaping them we would not have an old man like you disgraced and punished by your near relation nor would we have him forget like you all ties of blood and nature we entreat youbrother ned you join me i know in this entreaty and so tim linkinwater do you although you pretend to be an obstinate dog sir and sit there frowning as if you didntwe entreat you to retire from london to take shelter in some place where you will be safe from the consequences of these wicked designs and where you may have time sir to atone for them and to become a better man  and do you think returned ralph rising and do you think you will so easily crush me do you think that a hundred wellarranged plans or a hundred suborned witnesses or a hundred false curs at my heels or a hundred canting speeches full of oily words will move me i thank you for disclosing your schemes which i am now prepared for you have not the man to deal with that you think try me and remember that i spit upon your fair words and false dealings and dare youprovoke youtaunt youto do to me the very worst you can  thus they parted for that time but the worst had not come yet    chapter 60  the dangers thicken and the worst is told   instead of going home ralph threw himself into the first street cabriolet he could find and directing the driver towards the policeoffice of the district in which mr squeerss misfortunes had occurred alighted at a short distance from it and discharging the man went the rest of his way thither on foot inquiring for the object of his solicitude he learnt that he had timed his visit well for mr squeers was in fact at that moment waiting for a hackney coach he had ordered and in which he purposed proceeding to his weeks retirement like a gentleman  demanding speech with the prisoner he was ushered into a kind of waitingroom in which by reason of his scholastic profession and superior respectability mr squeers had been permitted to pass the day here by the light of a guttering and blackened candle he could barely discern the schoolmaster fast asleep on a bench in a remote corner an empty glass stood on a table before him which with his somnolent condition and a very strong smell of brandy and water forewarned the visitor that mr squeers had been seeking in creature comforts a temporary forgetfulness of his unpleasant situation  it was not a very easy matter to rouse him so lethargic and heavy were his slumbers regaining his faculties by slow and faint glimmerings he at length sat upright and displaying a very yellow face a very red nose and a very bristly beard the joint effect of which was considerably heightened by a dirty white handkerchief spotted with blood drawn over the crown of his head and tied under his chin stared ruefully at ralph in silence until his feelings found a vent in this pithy sentence  i say young fellow youve been and done it now you have  whats the matter with your head asked ralph  why your man your informing kidnapping man has been and broke it rejoined squeers sulkily thats whats the matter with it youve come at last have you  why have you not sent to me said ralph how could i come till i knew what had befallen you  my family hiccuped mr squeers raising his eye to the ceiling my daughter as is at that age when all the sensibilities is acoming out strong in blowmy son as is the young norval of private life and the pride and ornament of a doting willageheres a shock for my family the coatofarms of the squeerses is tore and their sun is gone down into the ocean wave  you have been drinking said ralph and have not yet slept yourself sober  i havent been drinking your health my codger replied mr squeers so you have nothing to do with that  ralph suppressed the indignation which the schoolmasters altered and insolent manner awakened and asked again why he had not sent to him  what should i get by sending to you returned squeers to be known to be in with you wouldnt do me a deal of good and they wont take bail till they know something more of the case so here am i hard and fast and there are you loose and comfortable  and so must you be in a few days retorted ralph with affected goodhumour they cant hurt you man  why i suppose they cant do much to me if i explain how it was that i got into the good company of that there cadaverous old slider replied squeers viciously who i wish was dead and buried and resurrected and dissected and hung upon wires in a anatomical museum before ever id had anything to do with her this is what him with the powdered head says this morning in so many words prisoner as you have been found in company with this woman as you were detected in possession of this document as you were engaged with her in fraudulently destroying others and can give no satisfactory account of yourself i shall remand you for a week in order that inquiries may be made and evidence got and meanwhile i cant take any bail for your appearance well then what i say now is that i can give a satisfactory account of myself i can hand in the card of my establishment and say i am the wackford squeers as is therein named sir i am the man as is guaranteed by unimpeachable references to be a outandouter in morals and uprightness of principle whatever is wrong in this business is no fault of mine i had no evil design in it sir i was not aware that anything was wrong i was merely employed by a friend my friend mr ralph nickleby of golden square send for him sir and ask him what he has to say hes the man not me  what document was it that you had asked ralph evading for the moment the point just raised  what document why the document replied squeers the madeline whatshername one it was a will thats what it was  of what nature whose will when dated how benefiting her to what extent asked ralph hurriedly  a will in her favour thats all i know rejoined squeers and thats more than youd have known if youd had them bellows on your head its all owing to your precious caution that they got hold of it if you had let me burn it and taken my word that it was gone it would have been a heap of ashes behind the fire instead of being whole and sound inside of my greatcoat  beaten at every point muttered ralph  ah sighed squeers who between the brandy and water and his broken head wandered strangely at the delightful village of dotheboys near greta bridge in yorkshire youth are boarded clothed booked washed furnished with pocketmoney provided with all necessaries instructed in all languages living and dead mathematics orthography geometry astronomy trigonometrythis is a altered state of trigonomics this is a double 1all everythinga cobblers weapon upup adjective not down squdouble erssqueers noun substantive a educator of youth total all up with squeers  his running on in this way had afforded ralph an opportunity of recovering his presence of mind which at once suggested to him the necessity of removing as far as possible the schoolmasters misgivings and leading him to believe that his safety and best policy lay in the preservation of a rigid silence  i tell you once again he said they cant hurt you you shall have an action for false imprisonment and make a profit of this yet we will devise a story for you that should carry you through twenty times such a trivial scrape as this and if they want security in a thousand pounds for your reappearance in case you should be called upon you shall have it all you have to do is to keep back the truth youre a little fuddled tonight and may not be able to see this as clearly as you would at another time but this is what you must do and youll need all your senses about you for a slip might be awkward  oh said squeers who had looked cunningly at him with his head stuck on one side like an old raven thats what im to do is it now then just you hear a word or two from me i ant agoing to have any stories made for me and i ant agoing to stick to any if i find matters going again me i shall expect you to take your share and ill take care you do you never said anything about danger i never bargained for being brought into such a plight as this and i dont mean to take it as quiet as you think i let you lead me on from one thing to another because we had been mixed up together in a certain sort of a way and if you had liked to be illnatured you might perhaps have hurt the business and if you liked to be goodnatured you might throw a good deal in my way well if all goes right now thats quite correct and i dont mind it but if anything goes wrong then times are altered and i shall just say and do whatever i think may serve me most and take advice from nobody my moral influence with them lads added mr squeers with deeper gravity is a tottering to its basis the images of mrs squeers my daughter and my son wackford all short of vittles is perpetually before me every other consideration melts away and vanishes in front of these the only number in all arithmetic that i know of as a husband and a father is number one under this here most fatal go  how long mr squeers might have declaimed or how stormy a discussion his declamation might have led to nobody knows being interrupted at this point by the arrival of the coach and an attendant who was to bear him company he perched his hat with great dignity on the top of the handkerchief that bound his head and thrusting one hand in his pocket and taking the attendants arm with the other suffered himself to be led forth  as i supposed from his not sending thought ralph this fellow i plainly see through all his tipsy fooling has made up his mind to turn upon me i am so beset and hemmed in that they are not only all struck with fear but like the beasts in the fable have their fling at me now though time was and no longer ago than yesterday too when they were all civility and compliance but they shall not move me ill not give way i will not budge one inch  he went home and was glad to find his housekeeper complaining of illness that he might have an excuse for being alone and sending her away to where she lived which was hard by then he sat down by the light of a single candle and began to think for the first time on all that had taken place that day  he had neither eaten nor drunk since last night and in addition to the anxiety of mind he had undergone had been travelling about from place to place almost incessantly for many hours he felt sick and exhausted but could taste nothing save a glass of water and continued to sit with his head upon his hand not resting nor thinking but laboriously trying to do both and feeling that every sense but one of weariness and desolation was for the time benumbed  it was nearly ten oclock when he heard a knocking at the door and still sat quiet as before as if he could not even bring his thoughts to bear upon that it had been often repeated and he had several times heard a voice outside saying there was a light in the window meaning as he knew his own candle before he could rouse himself and go downstairs  mr nickleby there is terrible news for you and i am sent to beg you will come with me directly said a voice he seemed to recognise he held his hand above his eyes and looking out saw tim linkinwater on the steps  come where demanded ralph  to our house where you came this morning i have a coach here  why should i go there said ralph  dont ask me why but pray come with me  another edition of today returned ralph making as though he would shut the door  no no cried tim catching him by the arm and speaking most earnestly it is only that you may hear something that has occurred something very dreadful mr nickleby which concerns you nearly do you think i would tell you so or come to you like this if it were not the case  ralph looked at him more closely seeing that he was indeed greatly excited he faltered and could not tell what to say or think  you had better hear this now than at any other time said tim it may have some influence with you for heavens sake come  perhaps at another time ralphs obstinacy and dislike would have been proof against any appeal from such a quarter however emphatically urged but now after a moments hesitation he went into the hall for his hat and returning got into the coach without speaking a word  tim well remembered afterwards and often said that as ralph nickleby went into the house for this purpose he saw him by the light of the candle which he had set down upon a chair reel and stagger like a drunken man he well remembered too that when he had placed his foot upon the coachsteps he turned round and looked upon him with a face so ashy pale and so very wild and vacant that it made him shudder and for the moment almost afraid to follow people were fond of saying that he had some dark presentiment upon him then but his emotion might perhaps with greater show of reason be referred to what he had undergone that day  a profound silence was observed during the ride arrived at their place of destination ralph followed his conductor into the house and into a room where the two brothers were he was so astounded not to say awed by something of a mute compassion for himself which was visible in their manner and in that of the old clerk that he could scarcely speak  having taken a seat however he contrived to say though in broken words whatwhat have you to say to memore than has been said already  the room was old and large very imperfectly lighted and terminated in a bay window about which hung some heavy drapery casting his eyes in this direction as he spoke he thought he made out the dusky figure of a man he was confirmed in this impression by seeing that the object moved as if uneasy under his scrutiny  whos that yonder he said  one who has conveyed to us within these two hours the intelligence which caused our sending to you replied brother charles let him be sir let him be for the present  more riddles said ralph faintly well sir  in turning his face towards the brothers he was obliged to avert it from the window but before either of them could speak he had looked round again it was evident that he was rendered restless and uncomfortable by the presence of the unseen person for he repeated this action several times and at length as if in a nervous state which rendered him positively unable to turn away from the place sat so as to have it opposite him muttering as an excuse that he could not bear the light  the brothers conferred apart for a short time their manner showing that they were agitated ralph glanced at them twice or thrice and ultimately said with a great effort to recover his selfpossession now what is this if i am brought from home at this time of night let it be for something what have you got to tell me after a short pause he added is my niece dead  he had struck upon a key which rendered the task of commencement an easier one brother charles turned and said that it was a death of which they had to tell him but that his niece was well  you dont mean to tell me said ralph as his eyes brightened that her brothers dead no thats too good id not believe it if you told me so it would be too welcome news to be true  shame on you you hardened and unnatural man cried the other brother warmly prepare yourself for intelligence which if you have any human feeling in your breast will make even you shrink and tremble what if we tell you that a poor unfortunate boy a child in everything but never having known one of those tender endearments or one of those lightsome hours which make our childhood a time to be remembered like a happy dream through all our after life a warmhearted harmless affectionate creature who never offended you or did you wrong but on whom you have vented the malice and hatred you have conceived for your nephew and whom you have made an instrument for wreaking your bad passions upon him what if we tell you that sinking under your persecution sir and the misery and illusage of a life short in years but long in suffering this poor creature has gone to tell his sad tale where for your part in it you must surely answer  if you tell me said ralph if you tell me that he is dead i forgive you all else if you tell me that he is dead i am in your debt and bound to you for life he is i see it in your faces who triumphs now is this your dreadful news this your terrible intelligence you see how it moves me you did well to send i would have travelled a hundred miles afoot through mud mire and darkness to hear this news just at this time  even then moved as he was by this savage joy ralph could see in the faces of the two brothers mingling with their look of disgust and horror something of that indefinable compassion for himself which he had noticed before  and he brought you the intelligence did he said ralph pointing with his finger towards the recess already mentioned and sat there no doubt to see me prostrated and overwhelmed by it ha ha ha but i tell him that ill be a sharp thorn in his side for many a long day to come and i tell you two again that you dont know him yet and that youll rue the day you took compassion on the vagabond  you take me for your nephew said a hollow voice it would be better for you and for me too if i were he indeed  the figure that he had seen so dimly rose and came slowly down he started back for he found that he confrontednot nicholas as he had supposed but brooker  ralph had no reason that he knew to fear this man he had never feared him before but the pallor which had been observed in his face when he issued forth that night came upon him again he was seen to tremble and his voice changed as he said keeping his eyes upon him  what does this fellow here do you know he is a convict a felon a common thief  hear what he has to tell you oh mr nickleby hear what he has to tell you be he what he may cried the brothers with such emphatic earnestness that ralph turned to them in wonder they pointed to brooker ralph again gazed at him as it seemed mechanically  that boy said the man that these gentlemen have been talking of  that boy repeated ralph looking vacantly at him  whom i saw stretched dead and cold upon his bed and who is now in his grave  who is now in his grave echoed ralph like one who talks in his sleep  the man raised his eyes and clasped his hands solemnly together  was your only son so help me god in heaven  in the midst of a dead silence ralph sat down pressing his two hands upon his temples he removed them after a minute and never was there seen part of a living man undisfigured by any wound such a ghastly face as he then disclosed he looked at brooker who was by this time standing at a short distance from him but did not say one word or make the slightest sound or gesture  gentlemen said the man i offer no excuses for myself i am long past that if in telling you how this has happened i tell you that i was harshly used and perhaps driven out of my real nature i do it only as a necessary part of my story and not to shield myself i am a guilty man  he stopped as if to recollect and looking away from ralph and addressing himself to the brothers proceeded in a subdued and humble tone  among those who once had dealings with this man gentlementhats from twenty to fiveandtwenty years agothere was one a rough foxhunting harddrinking gentleman who had run through his own fortune and wanted to squander away that of his sister they were both orphans and she lived with him and managed his house i dont know whether it was originally to back his influence and try to overpersuade the young woman or not but he pointing to ralph used to go down to the house in leicestershire pretty often and stop there many days at a time they had had a great many dealings together and he may have gone on some of those or to patch up his clients affairs which were in a ruinous state of course he went for profit the gentlewoman was not a girl but she was i have heard say handsome and entitled to a pretty large property in course of time he married her the same love of gain which led him to contract this marriage led to its being kept strictly private for a clause in her fathers will declared that if she married without her brothers consent the property in which she had only some life interest while she remained single should pass away altogether to another branch of the family the brother would give no consent that the sister didnt buy and pay for handsomely mr nickleby would consent to no such sacrifice and so they went on keeping their marriage secret and waiting for him to break his neck or die of a fever he did neither and meanwhile the result of this private marriage was a son the child was put out to nurse a long way off his mother never saw him but once or twice and then by stealth and his fatherso eagerly did he thirst after the money which seemed to come almost within his grasp now for his brotherinlaw was very ill and breaking more and more every daynever went near him to avoid raising any suspicion the brother lingered on mr nicklebys wife constantly urged him to avow their marriage he peremptorily refused she remained alone in a dull country house seeing little or no company but riotous drunken sportsmen he lived in london and clung to his business angry quarrels and recriminations took place and when they had been married nearly seven years and were within a few weeks of the time when the brothers death would have adjusted all she eloped with a younger man and left him  here he paused but ralph did not stir and the brothers signed to him to proceed  it was then that i became acquainted with these circumstances from his own lips they were no secrets then for the brother and others knew them but they were communicated to me not on this account but because i was wanted he followed the fugitives some said to make money of his wifes shame but i believe to take some violent revenge for that was as much his character as the other perhaps more he didnt find them and she died not long after i dont know whether he began to think he might like the child or whether he wished to make sure that it should never fall into its mothers hands but before he went he intrusted me with the charge of bringing it home and i did so  he went on from this point in a still more humble tone and spoke in a very low voice pointing to ralph as he resumed  he had used me illcruellyi reminded him in what not long ago when i met him in the streetand i hated him i brought the child home to his own house and lodged him in the front garret neglect had made him very sickly and i was obliged to call in a doctor who said he must be removed for change of air or he would die i think that first put it in my head i did it then he was gone six weeks and when he came back i told himwith every circumstance well planned and proved nobody could have suspected methat the child was dead and buried he might have been disappointed in some intention he had formed or he might have had some natural affection but he was grieved at that and i was confirmed in my design of opening up the secret one day and making it a means of getting money from him i had heard like most other men of yorkshire schools i took the child to one kept by a man named squeers and left it there i gave him the name of smike year by year i paid twenty pounds ayear for him for six years never breathing the secret all the time for i had left his fathers service after more hard usage and quarrelled with him again i was sent away from this country i have been away nearly eight years directly i came home again i travelled down into yorkshire and skulking in the village of an eveningtime made inquiries about the boys at the school and found that this one whom i had placed there had run away with a young man bearing the name of his own father i sought his father out in london and hinting at what i could tell him tried for a little money to support life but he repulsed me with threats i then found out his clerk and going on from little to little and showing him that there were good reasons for communicating with me learnt what was going on and it was i who told him that the boy was no son of the man who claimed to be his father all this time i had never seen the boy at length i heard from this same source that he was very ill and where he was i travelled down there that i might recall myself if possible to his recollection and confirm my story i came upon him unexpectedly but before i could speak he knew mehe had good cause to remember me poor ladand i would have sworn to him if i had met him in the indies i knew the piteous face i had seen in the little child after a few days indecision i applied to the young gentleman in whose care he was and i found that he was dead he knows how quickly he recognised me again how often he had described me and my leaving him at the school and how he told him of a garret he recollected which is the one i have spoken of and in his fathers house to this day this is my story i demand to be brought face to face with the schoolmaster and put to any possible proof of any part of it and i will show that its too true and that i have this guilt upon my soul  unhappy man said the brothers what reparation can you make for this  none gentlemen none i have none to make and nothing to hope now i am old in years and older still in misery and care this confession can bring nothing upon me but new suffering and punishment but i make it and will abide by it whatever comes i have been made the instrument of working out this dreadful retribution upon the head of a man who in the hot pursuit of his bad ends has persecuted and hunted down his own child to death it must descend upon me too i know it must fall my reparation comes too late and neither in this world nor in the next can i have hope again  he had hardly spoken when the lamp which stood upon the table close to where ralph was seated and which was the only one in the room was thrown to the ground and left them in darkness there was some trifling confusion in obtaining another light the interval was a mere nothing but when the light appeared ralph nickleby was gone  the good brothers and tim linkinwater occupied some time in discussing the probability of his return and when it became apparent that he would not come back they hesitated whether or no to send after him at length remembering how strangely and silently he had sat in one immovable position during the interview and thinking he might possibly be ill they determined although it was now very late to send to his house on some pretence finding an excuse in the presence of brooker whom they knew not how to dispose of without consulting his wishes they concluded to act upon this resolution before going to bed    chapter 61  wherein nicholas and his sister forfeit the good opinion of all worldly and prudent people   on the next morning after brookers disclosure had been made nicholas returned home the meeting between him and those whom he had left there was not without strong emotion on both sides for they had been informed by his letters of what had occurred and besides that his griefs were theirs they mourned with him the death of one whose forlorn and helpless state had first established a claim upon their compassion and whose truth of heart and grateful earnest nature had every day endeared him to them more and more  i am sure said mrs nickleby wiping her eyes and sobbing bitterly i have lost the best the most zealous and most attentive creature that has ever been a companion to me in my lifeputting you my dear nicholas and kate and your poor papa and that wellbehaved nurse who ran away with the linen and the twelve small forks out of the question of course of all the tractable equaltempered attached and faithful beings that ever lived i believe he was the most so to look round upon the garden now that he took so much pride in or to go into his room and see it filled with so many of those little contrivances for our comfort that he was so fond of making and made so well and so little thought he would leave unfinishedi cant bear it i cannot really ah this is a great trial to me a great trial it will be comfort to you my dear nicholas to the end of your life to recollect how kind and good you always were to himso it will be to me to think what excellent terms we were always upon and how fond he always was of me poor fellow it was very natural you should have been attached to him my dearveryand of course you were and are very much cut up by this i am sure its only necessary to look at you and see how changed you are to see that but nobody knows what my feelings arenobody canits quite impossible  while mrs nickleby with the utmost sincerity gave vent to her sorrows after her own peculiar fashion of considering herself foremost she was not the only one who indulged such feelings kate although well accustomed to forget herself when others were to be considered could not repress her grief madeline was scarcely less moved than she and poor hearty honest little miss la creevy who had come upon one of her visits while nicholas was away and had done nothing since the sad news arrived but console and cheer them all no sooner beheld him coming in at the door than she sat herself down upon the stairs and bursting into a flood of tears refused for a long time to be comforted  it hurts me so cried the poor body to see him come back alone i cant help thinking what he must have suffered himself i wouldnt mind so much if he gave way a little more but he bears it so manfully  why so i should said nicholas should i not  yes yes replied the little woman and bless you for a good creature but this does seem at first to a simple soul like mei know its wrong to say so and i shall be sorry for it presentlythis does seem such a poor reward for all you have done  nay said nicholas gently what better reward could i have than the knowledge that his last days were peaceful and happy and the recollection that i was his constant companion and was not prevented as i might have been by a hundred circumstances from being beside him  to be sure sobbed miss la creevy its very true and im an ungrateful impious wicked little fool i know  with that the good soul fell to crying afresh and endeavouring to recover herself tried to laugh the laugh and the cry meeting each other thus abruptly had a struggle for the mastery the result was that it was a drawn battle and miss la creevy went into hysterics  waiting until they were all tolerably quiet and composed again nicholas who stood in need of some rest after his long journey retired to his own room and throwing himself dressed as he was upon the bed fell into a sound sleep when he awoke he found kate sitting by his bedside who seeing that he had opened his eyes stooped down to kiss him  i came to tell you how glad i am to see you home again  but i cant tell you how glad i am to see you kate  we have been wearying so for your return said kate mama and i andand madeline  you said in your last letter that she was quite well said nicholas rather hastily and colouring as he spoke has nothing been said since i have been away about any future arrangements that the brothers have in contemplation for her  oh not a word replied kate i cant think of parting from her without sorrow and surely nicholas you dont wish it  nicholas coloured again and sitting down beside his sister on a little couch near the window said  no kate no i do not i might strive to disguise my real feelings from anybody but you but i will tell you thatbriefly and plainly katethat i love her  kates eyes brightened and she was going to make some reply when nicholas laid his hand upon her arm and went on  nobody must know this but you she last of all  dear nicholas  last of all never though never is a long day sometimes i try to think that the time may come when i may honestly tell her this but it is so far off in such distant perspective so many years must elapse before it comes and when it does come if ever i shall be so unlike what i am now and shall have so outlived my days of youth and romancethough not i am sure of love for herthat even i feel how visionary all such hopes must be and try to crush them rudely myself and have the pain over rather than suffer time to wither them and keep the disappointment in store no kate since i have been absent i have had in that poor fellow who is gone perpetually before my eyes another instance of the munificent liberality of these noble brothers as far as in me lies i will deserve it and if i have wavered in my bounden duty to them before i am now determined to discharge it rigidly and to put further delays and temptations beyond my reach  before you say another word dear nicholas said kate turning pale you must hear what i have to tell you i came on purpose but i had not the courage what you say now gives me new heart she faltered and burst into tears  there was that in her manner which prepared nicholas for what was coming kate tried to speak but her tears prevented her  come you foolish girl said nicholas why kate kate be a woman i think i know what you would tell me it concerns mr frank does it not  kate sunk her head upon his shoulder and sobbed out yes  and he has offered you his hand perhaps since i have been away said nicholas is that it yes well well it is not so difficult you see to tell me after all he offered you his hand  which i refused said kate  yes and why  i told him she said in a trembling voice all that i have since found you told mama and while i could not conceal from him and cannot from you thatthat it was a pang and a great trial i did so firmly and begged him not to see me any more  thats my own brave kate said nicholas pressing her to his breast i knew you would  he tried to alter my resolution said kate and declared that be my decision what it might he would not only inform his uncles of the step he had taken but would communicate it to you also directly you returned i am afraid she added her momentary composure forsaking her i am afraid i may not have said strongly enough how deeply i felt such disinterested love and how earnestly i prayed for his future happiness if you do talk together i shouldi should like him to know that  and did you suppose kate when you had made this sacrifice to what you knew was right and honourable that i should shrink from mine said nicholas tenderly  oh no not if your position had been the same but  but it is the same interrupted nicholas madeline is not the near relation of our benefactors but she is closely bound to them by ties as dear and i was first intrusted with her history specially because they reposed unbounded confidence in me and believed that i was as true as steel how base would it be of me to take advantage of the circumstances which placed her here or of the slight service i was happily able to render her and to seek to engage her affections when the result must be if i succeeded that the brothers would be disappointed in their darling wish of establishing her as their own child and that i must seem to hope to build my fortunes on their compassion for the young creature whom i had so meanly and unworthily entrapped turning her very gratitude and warmth of heart to my own purpose and account and trading in her misfortunes i too whose duty and pride and pleasure kate it is to have other claims upon me which i will never forget and who have the means of a comfortable and happy life already and have no right to look beyond it i have determined to remove this weight from my mind i doubt whether i have not done wrong even now and today i will without reserve or equivocation disclose my real reasons to mr cherryble and implore him to take immediate measures for removing this young lady to the shelter of some other roof  today so very soon  i have thought of this for weeks and why should i postpone it if the scene through which i have just passed has taught me to reflect and has awakened me to a more anxious and careful sense of duty why should i wait until the impression has cooled you would not dissuade me kate now would you  you may grow rich you know said kate  i may grow rich repeated nicholas with a mournful smile ay and i may grow old but rich or poor or old or young we shall ever be the same to each other and in that our comfort lies what if we have but one home it can never be a solitary one to you and me what if we were to remain so true to these first impressions as to form no others it is but one more link to the strong chain that binds us together it seems but yesterday that we were playfellows kate and it will seem but tomorrow when we are staid old people looking back to these cares as we look back now to those of our childish days and recollecting with a melancholy pleasure that the time was when they could move us perhaps then when we are quaint old folks and talk of the times when our step was lighter and our hair not grey we may be even thankful for the trials that so endeared us to each other and turned our lives into that current down which we shall have glided so peacefully and calmly and having caught some inkling of our story the young people about usas young as you and i are now katemay come to us for sympathy and pour distresses which hope and inexperience could scarcely feel enough for into the compassionate ears of the old bachelor brother and his maiden sister  kate smiled through her tears as nicholas drew this picture but they were not tears of sorrow although they continued to fall when he had ceased to speak  am i not right kate he said after a short silence  quite quite dear brother and i cannot tell you how happy i am that i have acted as you would have had me  you dont regret  nnno said kate timidly tracing some pattern upon the ground with her little foot i dont regret having done what was honourable and right of course but i do regret that this should have ever happenedat least sometimes i regret it and sometimes ii dont know what i say i am but a weak girl nicholas and it has agitated me very much  it is no vaunt to affirm that if nicholas had had ten thousand pounds at the minute he would in his generous affection for the owner of the blushing cheek and downcast eye have bestowed its utmost farthing in perfect forgetfulness of himself to secure her happiness but all he could do was to comfort and console her by kind words and words they were of such love and kindness and cheerful encouragement that poor kate threw her arms about his neck and declared she would weep no more  what man thought nicholas proudly while on his way soon afterwards to the brothers house would not be sufficiently rewarded for any sacrifice of fortune by the possession of such a heart as kates which but that hearts weigh light and gold and silver heavy is beyond all praise frank has money and wants no more where would it buy him such a treasure as kate and yet in unequal marriages the rich party is always supposed to make a great sacrifice and the other to get a good bargain but i am thinking like a lover or like an ass which i suppose is pretty nearly the same  checking thoughts so little adapted to the business on which he was bound by such selfreproofs as this and many others no less sturdy he proceeded on his way and presented himself before tim linkinwater  ah mr nickleby cried tim god bless you how dye do well say youre quite well and never better do now  quite said nicholas shaking him by both hands  ah said tim you look tired though now i come to look at you hark there he is dye hear him that was dick the blackbird he hasnt been himself since youve been gone hed never get on without you now he takes as naturally to you as he does to me  dick is a far less sagacious fellow than i supposed him if he thinks i am half so well worthy of his notice as you replied nicholas  why ill tell you what sir said tim standing in his favourite attitude and pointing to the cage with the feather of his pen its a very extraordinary thing about that bird that the only people he ever takes the smallest notice of are mr charles and mr ned and you and me  here tim stopped and glanced anxiously at nicholas then unexpectedly catching his eye repeated and you and me sir and you and me and then he glanced at nicholas again and squeezing his hand said i am a bad one at putting off anything i am interested in i didnt mean to ask you but i should like to hear a few particulars about that poor boy did he mention cheeryble brothers at all  yes said nicholas many and many a time  that was right of him returned tim wiping his eyes that was very right of him  and he mentioned your name a score of times said nicholas and often bade me carry back his love to mr linkinwater  no no did he though rejoined tim sobbing outright poor fellow i wish we could have had him buried in town there isnt such a buryingground in all london as that little one on the other side of the squarethere are countinghouses all round it and if you go in there on a fine day you can see the books and safes through the open windows and he sent his love to me did he i didnt expect he would have thought of me poor fellow poor fellow his love too  tim was so completely overcome by this little mark of recollection that he was quite unequal to any more conversation at the moment nicholas therefore slipped quietly out and went to brother charless room  if he had previously sustained his firmness and fortitude it had been by an effort which had cost him no little pain but the warm welcome the hearty manner the homely unaffected commiseration of the good old man went to his heart and no inward struggle could prevent his showing it  come come my dear sir said the benevolent merchant we must not be cast down no no we must learn to bear misfortune and we must remember that there are many sources of consolation even in death every day that this poor lad had lived he must have been less and less qualified for the world and more and more unhappy in is own deficiencies it is better as it is my dear sir yes yes yes its better as it is  i have thought of all that sir replied nicholas clearing his throat i feel it i assure you  yes thats well replied mr cheeryble who in the midst of all his comforting was quite as much taken aback as honest old tim thats well where is my brother ned tim linkinwater sir where is my brother ned  gone out with mr trimmers about getting that unfortunate man into the hospital and sending a nurse to his children said tim  my brother ned is a fine fellow a great fellow exclaimed brother charles as he shut the door and returned to nicholas he will be overjoyed to see you my dear sir we have been speaking of you every day  to tell you the truth sir i am glad to find you alone said nicholas with some natural hesitation for i am anxious to say something to you can you spare me a very few minutes  surely surely returned brother charles looking at him with an anxious countenance say on my dear sir say on  i scarcely know how or where to begin said nicholas if ever one mortal had reason to be penetrated with love and reverence for another with such attachment as would make the hardest service in his behalf a pleasure and delight with such grateful recollections as must rouse the utmost zeal and fidelity of his nature those are the feelings which i should entertain for you and do from my heart and soul believe me  i do believe you replied the old gentleman and i am happy in the belief i have never doubted it i never shall i am sure i never shall  your telling me that so kindly said nicholas emboldens me to proceed when you first took me into your confidence and dispatched me on those missions to miss bray i should have told you that i had seen her long before that her beauty had made an impression upon me which i could not efface and that i had fruitlessly endeavoured to trace her and become acquainted with her history i did not tell you so because i vainly thought i could conquer my weaker feelings and render every consideration subservient to my duty to you  mr nickleby said brother charles you did not violate the confidence i placed in you or take an unworthy advantage of it i am sure you did not  i did not said nicholas firmly although i found that the necessity for selfcommand and restraint became every day more imperious and the difficulty greater i never for one instant spoke or looked but as i would have done had you been by i never for one moment deserted my trust nor have i to this instant but i find that constant association and companionship with this sweet girl is fatal to my peace of mind and may prove destructive to the resolutions i made in the beginning and up to this time have faithfully kept in short sir i cannot trust myself and i implore and beseech you to remove this young lady from under the charge of my mother and sister without delay i know that to anyone but myselfto you who consider the immeasurable distance between me and this young lady who is now your ward and the object of your peculiar caremy loving her even in thought must appear the height of rashness and presumption i know it is so but who can see her as i have seen who can know what her life has been and not love her i have no excuse but that and as i cannot fly from this temptation and cannot repress this passion with its object constantly before me what can i do but pray and beseech you to remove it and to leave me to forget her  mr nickleby said the old man after a short silence you can do no more i was wrong to expose a young man like you to this trial i might have foreseen what would happen thank you sir thank you madeline shall be removed  if you would grant me one favour dear sir and suffer her to remember me with esteem by never revealing to her this confession  i will take care said mr cheeryble and now is this all you have to tell me  no returned nicholas meeting his eye it is not  i know the rest said mr cheeryble apparently very much relieved by this prompt reply when did it come to your knowledge  when i reached home this morning  you felt it your duty immediately to come to me and tell me what your sister no doubt acquainted you with  i did said nicholas though i could have wished to have spoken to mr frank first  frank was with me last night replied the old gentleman you have done well mr nicklebyvery well sirand i thank you again  upon this head nicholas requested permission to add a few words he ventured to hope that nothing he had said would lead to the estrangement of kate and madeline who had formed an attachment for each other any interruption of which would he knew be attended with great pain to them and most of all with remorse and pain to him as its unhappy cause when these things were all forgotten he hoped that frank and he might still be warm friends and that no word or thought of his humble home or of her who was well contented to remain there and share his quiet fortunes would ever again disturb the harmony between them he recounted as nearly as he could what had passed between himself and kate that morning speaking of her with such warmth of pride and affection and dwelling so cheerfully upon the confidence they had of overcoming any selfish regrets and living contented and happy in each others love that few could have heard him unmoved more moved himself than he had been yet he expressed in a few hurried wordsas expressive perhaps as the most eloquent phraseshis devotion to the brothers and his hope that he might live and die in their service  to all this brother charles listened in profound silence and with his chair so turned from nicholas that his face could not be seen he had not spoken either in his accustomed manner but with a certain stiffness and embarrassment very foreign to it nicholas feared he had offended him he said no no he had done quite right but that was all  frank is a heedless foolish fellow he said after nicholas had paused for some time a very heedless foolish fellow i will take care that this is brought to a close without delay let us say no more upon the subject its a very painful one to me come to me in half an hour i have strange things to tell you my dear sir and your uncle has appointed this afternoon for your waiting upon him with me  waiting upon him with you sir cried nicholas  ay with me replied the old gentleman return to me in half an hour and ill tell you more  nicholas waited upon him at the time mentioned and then learnt all that had taken place on the previous day and all that was known of the appointment ralph had made with the brothers which was for that night and for the better understanding of which it will be requisite to return and follow his own footsteps from the house of the twin brothers therefore we leave nicholas somewhat reassured by the restored kindness of their manner towards him and yet sensible that it was different from what it had been though he scarcely knew in what respect so he was full of uneasiness uncertainty and disquiet    chapter 62  ralph makes one last appointmentand keeps it   creeping from the house and slinking off like a thief groping with his hands when first he got into the street as if he were a blind man and looking often over his shoulder while he hurried away as though he were followed in imagination or reality by someone anxious to question or detain him ralph nickleby left the city behind him and took the road to his own home  the night was dark and a cold wind blew driving the clouds furiously and fast before it there was one black gloomy mass that seemed to follow him not hurrying in the wild chase with the others but lingering sullenly behind and gliding darkly and stealthily on he often looked back at this and more than once stopped to let it pass over but somehow when he went forward again it was still behind him coming mournfully and slowly up like a shadowy funeral train  he had to pass a poor mean burialgrounda dismal place raised a few feet above the level of the street and parted from it by a low parapetwall and an iron railing a rank unwholesome rotten spot where the very grass and weeds seemed in their frouzy growth to tell that they had sprung from paupers bodies and had struck their roots in the graves of men sodden while alive in steaming courts and drunken hungry dens and here in truth they lay parted from the living by a little earth and a board or twolay thick and closecorrupting in body as they had in minda dense and squalid crowd here they lay cheek by jowl with life no deeper down than the feet of the throng that passed there every day and piled high as their throats here they lay a grisly family all these dear departed brothers and sisters of the ruddy clergyman who did his task so speedily when they were hidden in the ground  as he passed here ralph called to mind that he had been one of a jury long before on the body of a man who had cut his throat and that he was buried in this place he could not tell how he came to recollect it now when he had so often passed and never thought about him or how it was that he felt an interest in the circumstance but he did both and stopping and clasping the iron railings with his hands looked eagerly in wondering which might be his grave  while he was thus engaged there came towards him with noise of shouts and singing some fellows full of drink followed by others who were remonstrating with them and urging them to go home in quiet they were in high goodhumour and one of them a little weazen humpbacked man began to dance he was a grotesque fantastic figure and the few bystanders laughed ralph himself was moved to mirth and echoed the laugh of one who stood near and who looked round in his face when they had passed on and he was left alone again he resumed his speculation with a new kind of interest for he recollected that the last person who had seen the suicide alive had left him very merry and he remembered how strange he and the other jurors had thought that at the time  he could not fix upon the spot among such a heap of graves but he conjured up a strong and vivid idea of the man himself and how he looked and what had led him to do it all of which he recalled with ease by dint of dwelling upon this theme he carried the impression with him when he went away as he remembered when a child to have had frequently before him the figure of some goblin he had once seen chalked upon a door but as he drew nearer and nearer home he forgot it again and began to think how very dull and solitary the house would be inside  this feeling became so strong at last that when he reached his own door he could hardly make up his mind to turn the key and open it when he had done that and gone into the passage he felt as though to shut it again would be to shut out the world but he let it go and it closed with a loud noise there was no light how very dreary cold and still it was  shivering from head to foot he made his way upstairs into the room where he had been last disturbed he had made a kind of compact with himself that he would not think of what had happened until he got home he was at home now and suffered himself to consider it  his own child his own child he never doubted the tale he felt it was true knew it as well now as if he had been privy to it all along his own child and dead too dying beside nicholas loving him and looking upon him as something like an angel that was the worst  they had all turned from him and deserted him in his very first need even money could not buy them now everything must come out and everybody must know all here was the young lord dead his companion abroad and beyond his reach ten thousand pounds gone at one blow his plot with gride overset at the very moment of triumph his afterschemes discovered himself in danger the object of his persecution and nicholass love his own wretched boy everything crumbled and fallen upon him and he beaten down beneath the ruins and grovelling in the dust  if he had known his child to be alive if no deceit had been ever practised and he had grown up beneath his eye he might have been a careless indifferent rough harsh fatherlike enoughhe felt that but the thought would come that he might have been otherwise and that his son might have been a comfort to him and they two happy together he began to think now that his supposed death and his wifes flight had had some share in making him the morose hard man he was he seemed to remember a time when he was not quite so rough and obdurate and almost thought that he had first hated nicholas because he was young and gallant and perhaps like the stripling who had brought dishonour and loss of fortune on his head  but one tender thought or one of natural regret in his whirlwind of passion and remorse was as a drop of calm water in a stormy maddened sea his hatred of nicholas had been fed upon his own defeat nourished on his interference with his schemes fattened upon his old defiance and success there were reasons for its increase it had grown and strengthened gradually now it attained a height which was sheer wild lunacy that his of all others should have been the hands to rescue his miserable child that he should have been his protector and faithful friend that he should have shown him that love and tenderness which from the wretched moment of his birth he had never known that he should have taught him to hate his own parent and execrate his very name that he should now know and feel all this and triumph in the recollection was gall and madness to the usurers heart the dead boys love for nicholas and the attachment of nicholas to him was insupportable agony the picture of his deathbed with nicholas at his side tending and supporting him and he breathing out his thanks and expiring in his arms when he would have had them mortal enemies and hating each other to the last drove him frantic he gnashed his teeth and smote the air and looking wildly round with eyes which gleamed through the darkness cried aloud  i am trampled down and ruined the wretch told me true the night has come is there no way to rob them of further triumph and spurn their mercy and compassion is there no devil to help me  swiftly there glided again into his brain the figure he had raised that night it seemed to lie before him the head was covered now so it was when he first saw it the rigid upturned marble feet too he remembered well then came before him the pale and trembling relatives who had told their tale upon the inquestthe shrieks of womenthe silent dread of menthe consternation and disquietthe victory achieved by that heap of clay which with one motion of its hand had let out the life and made this stir among them  he spoke no more but after a pause softly groped his way out of the room and up the echoing stairsup to the topto the front garretwhere he closed the door behind him and remained  it was a mere lumberroom now but it yet contained an old dismantled bedstead the one on which his son had slept for no other had ever been there he avoided it hastily and sat down as far from it as he could  the weakened glare of the lights in the street below shining through the window which had no blind or curtain to intercept it was enough to show the character of the room though not sufficient fully to reveal the various articles of lumber old corded trunks and broken furniture which were scattered about it had a shelving roof high in one part and at another descending almost to the floor it was towards the highest part that ralph directed his eyes and upon it he kept them fixed steadily for some minutes when he rose and dragging thither an old chest upon which he had been seated mounted on it and felt along the wall above his head with both hands at length they touched a large iron hook firmly driven into one of the beams  at that moment he was interrupted by a loud knocking at the door below after a little hesitation he opened the window and demanded who it was  i want mr nickleby replied a voice  what with him  thats not mr nicklebys voice surely was the rejoinder  it was not like it but it was ralph who spoke and so he said  the voice made answer that the twin brothers wished to know whether the man whom he had seen that night was to be detained and that although it was now midnight they had sent in their anxiety to do right  yes cried ralph detain him till tomorrow then let them bring him herehim and my nephewand come themselves and be sure that i will be ready to receive them  at what hour asked the voice  at any hour replied ralph fiercely in the afternoon tell them at any hour at any minute all times will be alike to me  he listened to the mans retreating footsteps until the sound had passed and then gazing up into the sky saw or thought he saw the same black cloud that had seemed to follow him home and which now appeared to hover directly above the house  i know its meaning now he muttered and the restless nights the dreams and why i have quailed of late all pointed to this oh if men by selling their own souls could ride rampant for a term for how short a term would i barter mine tonight  the sound of a deep bell came along the wind one  lie on cried the usurer with your iron tongue ring merrily for births that make expectants writhe and marriages that are made in hell and toll ruefully for the dead whose shoes are worn already call men to prayers who are godly because not found out and ring chimes for the coming in of every year that brings this cursed world nearer to its end no bell or book for me throw me on a dunghill and let me rot there to infect the air  with a wild look around in which frenzy hatred and despair were horribly mingled he shook his clenched hand at the sky above him which was still dark and threatening and closed the window  the rain and hail pattered against the glass the chimneys quaked and rocked the crazy casement rattled with the wind as though an impatient hand inside were striving to burst it open but no hand was there and it opened no more   hows this cried one the gentleman say they cant make anybody hear and have been trying these two hours  and yet he came home last night said another for he spoke to somebody out of that window upstairs  they were a little knot of men and the window being mentioned went out into the road to look up at it this occasioned their observing that the house was still close shut as the housekeeper had said she had left it on the previous night and led to a great many suggestions which terminated in two or three of the boldest getting round to the back and so entering by a window while the others remained outside in impatient expectation  they looked into all the rooms below opening the shutters as they went to admit the fading light and still finding nobody and everything quiet and in its place doubted whether they should go farther one man however remarking that they had not yet been into the garret and that it was there he had been last seen they agreed to look there too and went up softly for the mystery and silence made them timid  after they had stood for an instant on the landing eyeing each other he who had proposed their carrying the search so far turned the handle of the door and pushing it open looked through the chink and fell back directly  its very odd he whispered hes hiding behind the door look  they pressed forward to see but one among them thrusting the others aside with a loud exclamation drew a claspknife from his pocket and dashing into the room cut down the body  he had torn a rope from one of the old trunks and hung himself on an iron hook immediately below the trapdoor in the ceilingin the very place to which the eyes of his son a lonely desolate little creature had so often been directed in childish terror fourteen years before    chapter 63  the brothers cheeryble make various declarations for themselves and others tim linkinwater makes a declaration for himself   some weeks had passed and the first shock of these events had subsided madeline had been removed frank had been absent and nicholas and kate had begun to try in good earnest to stifle their own regrets and to live for each other and for their motherwho poor lady could in nowise be reconciled to this dull and altered state of affairswhen there came one evening per favour of mr linkinwater an invitation from the brothers to dinner on the next day but one comprehending not only mrs nickleby kate and nicholas but little miss la creevy who was most particularly mentioned  now my dears said mrs nickleby when they had rendered becoming honour to the bidding and tim had taken his departure what does this mean  what do you mean mother asked nicholas smiling  i say my dear rejoined that lady with a face of unfathomable mystery what does this invitation to dinner mean what is its intention and object  i conclude it means that on such a day we are to eat and drink in their house and that its intent and object is to confer pleasure upon us said nicholas  and thats all you conclude it is my dear  i have not yet arrived at anything deeper mother  then ill just tell you one thing said mrs nickleby youll find yourself a little surprised thats all you may depend upon it that this means something besides dinner  tea and supper perhaps suggested nicholas  i wouldnt be absurd my dear if i were you replied mrs nickleby in a lofty manner because its not by any means becoming and doesnt suit you at all what i mean to say is that the mr cheerybles dont ask us to dinner with all this ceremony for nothing never mind wait and see you wont believe anything i say of course its much better to wait a great deal better its satisfactory to all parties and there can be no disputing all i say is remember what i say now and when i say i said so dont say i didnt  with this stipulation mrs nickleby who was troubled night and day with a vision of a hot messenger tearing up to the door to announce that nicholas had been taken into partnership quitted that branch of the subject and entered upon a new one  its a very extraordinary thing she said a most extraordinary thing that they should have invited miss la creevy it quite astonishes me upon my word it does of course its very pleasant that she should be invited very pleasant and i have no doubt that shell conduct herself extremely well she always does its very gratifying to think that we should have been the means of introducing her into such society and im quite glad of itquite rejoicedfor she certainly is an exceedingly wellbehaved and goodnatured little person i could wish that some friend would mention to her how very badly she has her cap trimmed and what very preposterous bows those are but of course thats impossible and if she likes to make a fright of herself no doubt she has a perfect right to do so we never see ourselvesnever do and never didand i suppose we never shall  this moral reflection reminding her of the necessity of being peculiarly smart on the occasion so as to counterbalance miss la creevy and be herself an effectual setoff and atonement led mrs nickleby into a consultation with her daughter relative to certain ribbons gloves and trimmings which being a complicated question and one of paramount importance soon routed the previous one and put it to flight  the great day arriving the good lady put herself under kates hands an hour or so after breakfast and dressing by easy stages completed her toilette in sufficient time to allow of her daughters making hers which was very simple and not very long though so satisfactory that she had never appeared more charming or looked more lovely miss la creevy too arrived with two bandboxes whereof the bottoms fell out as they were handed from the coach and something in a newspaper which a gentleman had sat upon coming down and which was obliged to be ironed again before it was fit for service at last everybody was dressed including nicholas who had come home to fetch them and they went away in a coach sent by the brothers for the purpose mrs nickleby wondering very much what they would have for dinner and crossexamining nicholas as to the extent of his discoveries in the morning whether he had smelt anything cooking at all like turtle and if not what he had smelt and diversifying the conversation with reminiscences of dinners to which she had gone some twenty years ago concerning which she particularised not only the dishes but the guests in whom her hearers did not feel a very absorbing interest as not one of them had ever chanced to hear their names before  the old butler received them with profound respect and many smiles and ushered them into the drawingroom where they were received by the brothers with so much cordiality and kindness that mrs nickleby was quite in a flutter and had scarcely presence of mind enough even to patronise miss la creevy kate was still more affected by the reception for knowing that the brothers were acquainted with all that had passed between her and frank she felt her position a most delicate and trying one and was trembling on the arm of nicholas when mr charles took her in his and led her to another part of the room  have you seen madeline my dear he said since she left your house  no sir replied kate not once  and not heard from her eh not heard from her  i have only had one letter rejoined kate gently i thought she would not have forgotten me quite so soon  ah said the old man patting her on the head and speaking as affectionately as if she had been his favourite child poor dear what do you think of this brother ned madeline has only written to her once only once ned and she didnt think she would have forgotten her quite so soon ned  oh sad sad very sad said ned  the brothers interchanged a glance and looking at kate for a little time without speaking shook hands and nodded as if they were congratulating each other on something very delightful  well well said brother charles go into that room my dearthat door yonderand see if theres not a letter for you from her i think theres one upon the table you neednt hurry back my love if there is for we dont dine just yet and theres plenty of time plenty of time  kate retired as she was directed brother charles having followed her graceful figure with his eyes turned to mrs nickleby and said  we took the liberty of naming one hour before the real dinnertime maam because we had a little business to speak about which would occupy the interval ned my dear fellow will you mention what we agreed upon mr nickleby sir have the goodness to follow me  without any further explanation mrs nickleby miss la creevy and brother ned were left alone together and nicholas followed brother charles into his private room where to his great astonishment he encountered frank whom he supposed to be abroad  young men said mr cheeryble shake hands  i need no bidding to do that said nicholas extending his  nor i rejoined frank as he clasped it heartily  the old gentleman thought that two handsomer or finer young fellows could scarcely stand side by side than those on whom he looked with so much pleasure suffering his eyes to rest upon them for a short time in silence he said while he seated himself at his desk  i wish to see you friendsclose and firm friendsand if i thought you otherwise i should hesitate in what i am about to say frank look here mr nickleby will you come on the other side  the young men stepped up on either hand of brother charles who produced a paper from his desk and unfolded it  this he said is a copy of the will of madelines maternal grandfather bequeathing her the sum of twelve thousand pounds payable either upon her coming of age or marrying it would appear that this gentleman angry with her his only relation because she would not put herself under his protection and detach herself from the society of her father in compliance with his repeated overtures made a will leaving this property which was all he possessed to a charitable institution he would seem to have repented this determination however for three weeks afterwards and in the same month he executed this by some fraud it was abstracted immediately after his decease and the otherthe only will foundwas proved and administered friendly negotiations which have only just now terminated have been proceeding since this instrument came into our hands and as there is no doubt of its authenticity and the witnesses have been discovered after some trouble the money has been refunded madeline has therefore obtained her right and is or will be when either of the contingencies which i have mentioned has arisen mistress of this fortune you understand me  frank replied in the affirmative nicholas who could not trust himself to speak lest his voice should be heard to falter bowed his head  now frank said the old gentleman you were the immediate means of recovering this deed the fortune is but a small one but we love madeline and such as it is we would rather see you allied to her with that than to any other girl we know who has three times the money will you become a suitor to her for her hand  no sir i interested myself in the recovery of that instrument believing that her hand was already pledged to one who has a thousand times the claims upon her gratitude and if i mistake not upon her heart that i or any other man can ever urge in this it seems i judged hastily  as you always do sir cried brother charles utterly forgetting his assumed dignity as you always do how dare you think frank that we would have you marry for money when youth beauty and every amiable virtue and excellence were to be had for love how dared you frank go and make love to mr nicklebys sister without telling us first what you meant to do and letting us speak for you  i hardly dared to hope  you hardly dared to hope then so much the greater reason for having our assistance mr nickleby sir frank although he judged hastily judged for once correctly madelines heart is occupied give me your hand sir it is occupied by you and worthily and naturally this fortune is destined to be yours but you have a greater fortune in her sir than you would have in money were it forty times told she chooses you mr nickleby she chooses as we her dearest friends would have her choose frank chooses as we would have him choose he should have your sisters little hand sir if she had refused it a score of times ay he should and he shall you acted nobly not knowing our sentiments but now you know them sir you must do as you are bid what you are the children of a worthy gentleman the time was sir when my dear brother ned and i were two poor simplehearted boys wandering almost barefoot to seek our fortunes are we changed in anything but years and worldly circumstances since that time no god forbid oh ned ned ned what a happy day this is for you and me if our poor mother had only lived to see us now ned how proud it would have made her dear heart at last  thus apostrophised brother ned who had entered with mrs nickleby and who had been before unobserved by the young men darted forward and fairly hugged brother charles in his arms  bring in my little kate said the latter after a short silence bring her in ned let me see kate let me kiss her i have a right to do so now i was very near it when she first came i have often been very near it ah did you find the letter my bird did you find madeline herself waiting for you and expecting you did you find that she had not quite forgotten her friend and nurse and sweet companion why this is almost the best of all  come come said ned frank will be jealous and we shall have some cutting of throats before dinner  then let him take her away ned let him take her away madelines in the next room let all the lovers get out of the way and talk among themselves if theyve anything to say turn em out ned every one  brother charles began the clearance by leading the blushing girl to the door and dismissing her with a kiss frank was not very slow to follow and nicholas had disappeared first of all so there only remained mrs nickleby and miss la creevy who were both sobbing heartily the two brothers and tim linkinwater who now came in to shake hands with everybody his round face all radiant and beaming with smiles  well tim linkinwater sir said brother charles who was always spokesman now the young folks are happy sir  you didnt keep em in suspense as long as you said you would though returned tim archly why mr nickleby and mr frank were to have been in your room for i dont know how long and i dont know what you werent to have told them before you came out with the truth  now did you ever know such a villain as this ned said the old gentleman did you ever know such a villain as tim linkinwater he accusing me of being impatient and he the very man who has been wearying us morning noon and night and torturing us for leave to go and tell em what was in store before our plans were half complete or we had arranged a single thing a treacherous dog  so he is brother charles returned ned tim is a treacherous dog tim is not to be trusted tim is a wild young fellow he wants gravity and steadiness he must sow his wild oats and then perhaps hell become in time a respectable member of society  this being one of the standing jokes between the old fellows and tim they all three laughed very heartily and might have laughed much longer but that the brothers seeing that mrs nickleby was labouring to express her feelings and was really overwhelmed by the happiness of the time took her between them and led her from the room under pretence of having to consult her on some most important arrangements  now tim and miss la creevy had met very often and had always been very chatty and pleasant togetherhad always been great friendsand consequently it was the most natural thing in the world that tim finding that she still sobbed should endeavour to console her as miss la creevy sat on a large oldfashioned windowseat where there was ample room for two it was also natural that tim should sit down beside her and as to tims being unusually spruce and particular in his attire that day why it was a high festival and a great occasion and that was the most natural thing of all  tim sat down beside miss la creevy and crossing one leg over the other so that his foothe had very comely feet and happened to be wearing the neatest shoes and black silk stockings possibleshould come easily within the range of her eye said in a soothing way  dont cry  i must rejoined miss la creevy  no dont said tim please dont pray dont  i am so happy sobbed the little woman  then laugh said tim do laugh  what in the world tim was doing with his arm it is impossible to conjecture but he knocked his elbow against that part of the window which was quite on the other side of miss la creevy and it is clear that it could have no business there  do laugh said tim or ill cry  why should you cry asked miss la creevy smiling  because im happy too said tim we are both happy and i should like to do as you do  surely there never was a man who fidgeted as tim must have done then for he knocked the window againalmost in the same placeand miss la creevy said she was sure hed break it  i knew said tim that you would be pleased with this scene  it was very thoughtful and kind to remember me returned miss la creevy nothing could have delighted me half so much  why on earth should miss la creevy and tim linkinwater have said all this in a whisper it was no secret and why should tim linkinwater have looked so hard at miss la creevy and why should miss la creevy have looked so hard at the ground  its a pleasant thing said tim to people like us who have passed all our lives in the world alone to see young folks that we are fond of brought together with so many years of happiness before them  ah cried the little woman with all her heart that it is  although pursued tim although it makes one feel quite solitary and cast away now dont it  miss la creevy said she didnt know and why should she say she didnt know because she must have known whether it did or not  its almost enough to make us get married after all isnt it said tim  oh nonsense replied miss la creevy laughing we are too old  not a bit said tim we are too old to be single why shouldnt we both be married instead of sitting through the long winter evenings by our solitary firesides why shouldnt we make one fireside of it and marry each other  oh mr linkinwater youre joking  no no im not im not indeed said tim i will if you will do my dear  it would make people laugh so  let em laugh cried tim stoutly we have good tempers i know and well laugh too why what hearty laughs we have had since weve known each other  so we have cried miss la creevygiving way a little as tim thought  it has been the happiest time in all my life at least away from the countinghouse and cheeryble brothers said tim do my dear now say you will  no no we mustnt think of it returned miss la creevy what would the brothers say  why god bless your soul cried tim innocently you dont suppose i should think of such a thing without their knowing it why they left us here on purpose  i can never look em in the face again exclaimed miss la creevy faintly  come said tim lets be a comfortable couple we shall live in the old house here where i have been for fourandforty year we shall go to the old church where ive been every sunday morning all through that time we shall have all my old friends about usdick the archway the pump the flowerpots and mr franks children and mr nicklebys children that we shall seem like grandfather and grandmother to lets be a comfortable couple and take care of each other and if we should get deaf or lame or blind or bedridden how glad we shall be that we have somebody we are fond of always to talk to and sit with lets be a comfortable couple now do my dear  five minutes after this honest and straightforward speech little miss la creevy and tim were talking as pleasantly as if they had been married for a score of years and had never once quarrelled all the time and five minutes after that when miss la creevy had bustled out to see if her eyes were red and put her hair to rights tim moved with a stately step towards the drawingroom exclaiming as he went there ant such another woman in all london i know there ant  by this time the apoplectic butler was nearly in fits in consequence of the unheardof postponement of dinner nicholas who had been engaged in a manner in which every reader may imagine for himself or herself was hurrying downstairs in obedience to his angry summons when he encountered a new surprise  on his way down he overtook in one of the passages a stranger genteelly dressed in black who was also moving towards the diningroom as he was rather lame and walked slowly nicholas lingered behind and was following him step by step wondering who he was when he suddenly turned round and caught him by both hands  newman noggs cried nicholas joyfully  ah newman your own newman your own old faithful newman my dear boy my dear nick i give you joyhealth happiness every blessing i cant bear itits too much my dear boyit makes a child of me  where have you been said nicholas what have you been doing how often have i inquired for you and been told that i should hear before long  i know i know returned newman they wanted all the happiness to come together ive been helping em iilook at me nick look at me  you would never let me do that said nicholas in a tone of gentle reproach  i didnt mind what i was then i shouldnt have had the heart to put on gentlemans clothes they would have reminded me of old times and made me miserable i am another man now nick my dear boy i cant speak dont say anything to me dont think the worse of me for these tears you dont know what i feel today you cant and never will  they walked in to dinner arminarm and sat down side by side  never was such a dinner as that since the world began there was the superannuated bank clerk tim linkinwaters friend and there was the chubby old lady tim linkinwaters sister and there was so much attention from tim linkinwaters sister to miss la creevy and there were so many jokes from the superannuated bank clerk and tim linkinwater himself was in such tiptop spirits and little miss la creevy was in such a comical state that of themselves they would have composed the pleasantest party conceivable then there was mrs nickleby so grand and complacent madeline and kate so blushing and beautiful nicholas and frank so devoted and proud and all four so silently and tremblingly happy there was newman so subdued yet so overjoyed and there were the twin brothers so delighted and interchanging such looks that the old servant stood transfixed behind his masters chair and felt his eyes grow dim as they wandered round the table  when the first novelty of the meeting had worn off and they began truly to feel how happy they were the conversation became more general and the harmony and pleasure if possible increased the brothers were in a perfect ecstasy and their insisting on saluting the ladies all round before they would permit them to retire gave occasion to the superannuated bank clerk to say so many good things that he quite outshone himself and was looked upon as a prodigy of humour  kate my dear said mrs nickleby taking her daughter aside as soon as they got upstairs you dont really mean to tell me that this is actually true about miss la creevy and mr linkinwater  indeed it is mama  why i never heard such a thing in my life exclaimed mrs nickleby  mr linkinwater is a most excellent creature reasoned kate and for his age quite young still  for his age my dear returned mrs nickleby yes nobody says anything against him except that i think he is the weakest and most foolish man i ever knew its her age i speak of that he should have gone and offered himself to a woman who must beah half as old again as i amand that she should have dared to accept him it dont signify kate im disgusted with her  shaking her head very emphatically indeed mrs nickleby swept away and all the evening in the midst of the merriment and enjoyment that ensued and in which with that exception she freely participated conducted herself towards miss la creevy in a stately and distant manner designed to mark her sense of the impropriety of her conduct and to signify her extreme and cutting disapprobation of the misdemeanour she had so flagrantly committed    chapter 64  an old acquaintance is recognised under melancholy circumstances and dotheboys hall breaks up for ever   nicholas was one of those whose joy is incomplete unless it is shared by the friends of adverse and less fortunate days surrounded by every fascination of love and hope his warm heart yearned towards plain john browdie he remembered their first meeting with a smile and their second with a tear saw poor smike once again with the bundle on his shoulder trudging patiently by his side and heard the honest yorkshiremans rough words of encouragement as he left them on their road to london  madeline and he sat down very many times jointly to produce a letter which should acquaint john at full length with his altered fortunes and assure him of his friendship and gratitude it so happened however that the letter could never be written although they applied themselves to it with the best intentions in the world it chanced that they always fell to talking about something else and when nicholas tried it by himself he found it impossible to write onehalf of what he wished to say or to pen anything indeed which on reperusal did not appear cold and unsatisfactory compared with what he had in his mind at last after going on thus from day to day and reproaching himself more and more he resolved the more readily as madeline strongly urged him to make a hasty trip into yorkshire and present himself before mr and mrs browdie without a word of notice  thus it was that between seven and eight oclock one evening he and kate found themselves in the saracens head bookingoffice securing a place to greta bridge by the next mornings coach they had to go westward to procure some little necessaries for his journey and as it was a fine night they agreed to walk there and ride home  the place they had just been in called up so many recollections and kate had so many anecdotes of madeline and nicholas so many anecdotes of frank and each was so interested in what the other said and both were so happy and confiding and had so much to talk about that it was not until they had plunged for a full halfhour into that labyrinth of streets which lies between seven dials and soho without emerging into any large thoroughfare that nicholas began to think it just possible they might have lost their way  the possibility was soon converted into a certainty for on looking about and walking first to one end of the street and then to the other he could find no landmark he could recognise and was fain to turn back again in quest of some place at which he could seek a direction  it was a bystreet and there was nobody about or in the few wretched shops they passed making towards a faint gleam of light which streamed across the pavement from a cellar nicholas was about to descend two or three steps so as to render himself visible to those below and make his inquiry when he was arrested by a loud noise of scolding in a womans voice  oh come away said kate they are quarrelling youll be hurt  wait one instant kate let us hear if theres anything the matter returned her brother hush  you nasty idle vicious goodfornothing brute cried the woman stamping on the ground why dont you turn the mangle  so i am my life and soul replied the mans voice i am always turning i am perpetually turning like a demd old horse in a demnition mill my life is one demd horrid grind  then why dont you go and list for a soldier retorted the woman youre welcome to  for a soldier cried the man for a soldier would his joy and gladness see him in a coarse red coat with a little tail would she hear of his being slapped and beat by drummers demnebly would she have him fire off real guns and have his hair cut and his whiskers shaved and his eyes turned right and left and his trousers pipeclayed  dear nicholas whispered kate you dont know who that is its mr mantalini i am confident  do make sure peep at him while i ask the way said nicholas come down a step or two come  drawing her after him nicholas crept down the steps and looked into a small boarded cellar there amidst clothesbaskets and clothes stripped up to his shirtsleeves but wearing still an old patched pair of pantaloons of superlative make a once brilliant waistcoat and moustache and whiskers as of yore but lacking their lustrous dyethere endeavouring to mollify the wrath of a buxom femalenot the lawful madame mantalini but the proprietress of the concernand grinding meanwhile as if for very life at the mangle whose creaking noise mingled with her shrill tones appeared almost to deafen himthere was the graceful elegant fascinating and once dashing mantalini  oh you false traitor cried the lady threatening personal violence on mr mantalinis face  false oh dem now my soul my gentle captivating bewitching and most demnebly enslaving chickabiddy be calm said mr mantalini humbly  i wont screamed the woman ill tear your eyes out  oh what a demd savage lamb cried mr mantalini  youre never to be trusted screamed the woman you were out all day yesterday and gallivanting somewhere i know you know you were isnt it enough that i paid two pound fourteen for you and took you out of prison and let you live here like a gentleman but must you go on like this breaking my heart besides  i will never break its heart i will be a good boy and never do so any more i will never be naughty again i beg its little pardon said mr mantalini dropping the handle of the mangle and folding his palms together it is all up with its handsome friend he has gone to the demnition bowwows it will have pity it will not scratch and claw but pet and comfort oh demmit  very little affected to judge from her action by this tender appeal the lady was on the point of returning some angry reply when nicholas raising his voice asked his way to piccadilly  mr mantalini turned round caught sight of kate and without another word leapt at one bound into a bed which stood behind the door and drew the counterpane over his face kicking meanwhile convulsively  demmit he cried in a suffocating voice its little nickleby shut the door put out the candle turn me up in the bedstead oh dem dem dem  the woman looked first at nicholas and then at mr mantalini as if uncertain on whom to visit this extraordinary behaviour but mr mantalini happening by illluck to thrust his nose from under the bedclothes in his anxiety to ascertain whether the visitors were gone she suddenly and with a dexterity which could only have been acquired by long practice flung a pretty heavy clothesbasket at him with so good an aim that he kicked more violently than before though without venturing to make any effort to disengage his head which was quite extinguished thinking this a favourable opportunity for departing before any of the torrent of her wrath discharged itself upon him nicholas hurried kate off and left the unfortunate subject of this unexpected recognition to explain his conduct as he best could  the next morning he began his journey it was now cold winter weather forcibly recalling to his mind under what circumstances he had first travelled that road and how many vicissitudes and changes he had since undergone he was alone inside the greater part of the way and sometimes when he had fallen into a doze and rousing himself looked out of the window and recognised some place which he well remembered as having passed either on his journey down or in the long walk back with poor smike he could hardly believe but that all which had since happened had been a dream and that they were still plodding wearily on towards london with the world before them  to render these recollections the more vivid it came on to snow as night set in and passing through stamford and grantham and by the little alehouse where he had heard the story of the bold baron of grogzwig everything looked as if he had seen it but yesterday and not even a flake of the white crust on the roofs had melted away encouraging the train of ideas which flocked upon him he could almost persuade himself that he sat again outside the coach with squeers and the boys that he heard their voices in the air and that he felt again but with a mingled sensation of pain and pleasure now that old sinking of the heart and longing after home while he was yet yielding himself up to these fancies he fell asleep and dreaming of madeline forgot them  he slept at the inn at greta bridge on the night of his arrival and rising at a very early hour next morning walked to the market town and inquired for john browdies house john lived in the outskirts now he was a family man and as everbody knew him nicholas had no difficulty in finding a boy who undertook to guide him to his residence  dismissing his guide at the gate and in his impatience not even stopping to admire the thriving look of cottage or garden either nicholas made his way to the kitchen door and knocked lustily with his stick  halloa cried a voice inside waet be the matther noo be the toon afire ding but thou makst noise eneaf  with these words john browdie opened the door himself and opening his eyes too to their utmost width cried as he clapped his hands together and burst into a hearty roar  ecod it be the godfeyther it be the godfeyther tilly here be misther nickleby gi us thee hond mun coom awa coom awa in wi un doon beside the fire tak a soop o thot dinnot say a word till thoust droonk it a oop wi it mun ding but im reeght glod to see thee  adapting his action to his text john dragged nicholas into the kitchen forced him down upon a huge settle beside a blazing fire poured out from an enormous bottle about a quarter of a pint of spirits thrust it into his hand opened his mouth and threw back his head as a sign to him to drink it instantly and stood with a broad grin of welcome overspreading his great red face like a jolly giant  i might ha knowad said john that nobody but thou would ha coom wi sike a knock as you thot was the wa thou knocked at schoolmeasthers door eh ha ha ha but i say waat be a this aboot schoolmeasther  you know it then said nicholas  they were talking aboot it doon toon last neeght replied john but neane on em seemed quite to unerstan it loike  after various shiftings and delays said nicholas he has been sentenced to be transported for seven years for being in the unlawful possession of a stolen will and after that he has to suffer the consequence of a conspiracy  whew cried john a conspiracy soomat in the pooderplot wa eh soomat in the guy faux line  no no no a conspiracy connected with his school ill explain it presently  thots reeght said john explain it arter breakfast not noo for thou beest hoongry and so am i and tilly she mun be at the bottom o a explanations for she says thots the mutual confidence ha ha ha ecod its a room start is the mutual confidence  the entrance of mrs browdie with a smart cap on and very many apologies for their having been detected in the act of breakfasting in the kitchen stopped john in his discussion of this grave subject and hastened the breakfast which being composed of vast mounds of toast newlaid eggs boiled ham yorkshire pie and other cold substantials of which heavy relays were constantly appearing from another kitchen under the direction of a very plump servant was admirably adapted to the cold bleak morning and received the utmost justice from all parties at last it came to a close and the fire which had been lighted in the best parlour having by this time burnt up they adjourned thither to hear what nicholas had to tell  nicholas told them all and never was there a story which awakened so many emotions in the breasts of two eager listeners at one time honest john groaned in sympathy and at another roared with joy at one time he vowed to go up to london on purpose to get a sight of the brothers cheeryble and at another swore that tim linkinwater should receive such a ham by coach and carriage free as mortal knife had never carved when nicholas began to describe madeline he sat with his mouth wide open nudging mrs browdie from time to time and exclaiming under his breath that she must be raather a tidy sart and when he heard at last that his young friend had come down purposely to communicate his good fortune and to convey to him all those assurances of friendship which he could not state with sufficient warmth in writingthat the only object of his journey was to share his happiness with them and to tell them that when he was married they must come up to see him and that madeline insisted on it as well as hejohn could hold out no longer but after looking indignantly at his wife and demanding to know what she was whimpering for drew his coat sleeve over his eyes and blubbered outright  tellee waat though said john seriously when a great deal had been said on both sides to return to schoolmeasther if this news aboot un has reached school today the old ooman weant have a whole boan in her boddy nor fanny neither  oh john cried mrs browdie  ah and oh john agean replied the yorkshireman i dinnot know what they lads mightnt do when it first got aboot that schoolmeasther was in trouble some feythers and moothers sent and took their young chaps awa if them as is left should know waats coom tivun therell be sike a revolution and rebelding but i think theyll a gang daft and spill bluid like wather  in fact john browdies apprehensions were so strong that he determined to ride over to the school without delay and invited nicholas to accompany him which however he declined pleading that his presence might perhaps aggravate the bitterness of their adversity  thots true said john i should neer ha thought o thot  i must return tomorrow said nicholas but i mean to dine with you today and if mrs browdie can give me a bed  bed cried john i wish thou couldst sleep in fower beds at once ecod thou shouldst have em a bide till i coom back ony bide till i coom back and ecod well make a day of it  giving his wife a hearty kiss and nicholas a no less hearty shake of the hand john mounted his horse and rode off leaving mrs browdie to apply herself to hospitable preparations and his young friend to stroll about the neighbourhood and revisit spots which were rendered familiar to him by many a miserable association  john cantered away and arriving at dotheboys hall tied his horse to a gate and made his way to the schoolroom door which he found locked on the inside a tremendous noise and riot arose from within and applying his eye to a convenient crevice in the wall he did not remain long in ignorance of its meaning  the news of mr squeerss downfall had reached dotheboys that was quite clear to all appearance it had very recently become known to the young gentlemen for the rebellion had just broken out  it was one of the brimstoneandtreacle mornings and mrs squeers had entered school according to custom with the large bowl and spoon followed by miss squeers and the amiable wackford who during his fathers absence had taken upon him such minor branches of the executive as kicking the pupils with his nailed boots pulling the hair of some of the smaller boys pinching the others in aggravating places and rendering himself in various similar ways a great comfort and happiness to his mother their entrance whether by premeditation or a simultaneous impulse was the signal of revolt while one detachment rushed to the door and locked it and another mounted on the desks and forms the stoutest and consequently the newest boy seized the cane and confronting mrs squeers with a stern countenance snatched off her cap and beaver bonnet put them on his own head armed himself with the wooden spoon and bade her on pain of death go down upon her knees and take a dose directly before that estimable lady could recover herself or offer the slightest retaliation she was forced into a kneeling posture by a crowd of shouting tormentors and compelled to swallow a spoonful of the odious mixture rendered more than usually savoury by the immersion in the bowl of master wackfords head whose ducking was intrusted to another rebel the success of this first achievement prompted the malicious crowd whose faces were clustered together in every variety of lank and halfstarved ugliness to further acts of outrage the leader was insisting upon mrs squeers repeating her dose master squeers was undergoing another dip in the treacle and a violent assault had been commenced on miss squeers when john browdie bursting open the door with a vigorous kick rushed to the rescue the shouts screams groans hoots and clapping of hands suddenly ceased and a dead silence ensued  ye be noice chaps said john looking steadily round whats to do here thou yoong dogs  squeers is in prison and we are going to run away cried a score of shrill voices we wont stop we wont stop  weel then dinnot stop replied john who waants thee to stop roon awa loike men but dinnot hurt the women  hurrah cried the shrill voices more shrilly still  hurrah repeated john weel hurrah loike men too noo then look out hiphiphiphurrah  hurrah cried the voices  hurrah agean said john looder still  the boys obeyed  anoother said john dinnot be afeared on it lets have a good un  hurrah  noo then said john lets have yan more to end wi and then coot off as quick as you loike taka good breath noosqueers be in jailthe schools brokken oopits a owerpast and ganethink o thot and let it be a hearty un hurrah  such a cheer arose as the walls of dotheboys hall had never echoed before and were destined never to respond to again when the sound had died away the school was empty and of the busy noisy crowd which had peopled it but five minutes before not one remained  very well mr browdie said miss squeers hot and flushed from the recent encounter but vixenish to the last youve been and excited our boys to run away now see if we dont pay you out for that sir if my pa is unfortunate and trod down by henemies were not going to be basely crowed and conquered over by you and tilda  noa replied john bluntly thou beant tak thy oath o thot think betther o us fanny i tell ee both that im glod the auld man has been caught out at lastdomd glodbut yell sooffer eneaf wiout any crowin fra me and i be not the mun to crow nor be tilly the lass so i tell ee flat more than thot i tell ee noo that if thou needst friends to help thee awa from this placedinnot turn up thy nose fanny thou maystthoult foind tilly and i wi a thout o old times aboot us ready to lend thee a hond and when i say thot dinnot think i be asheamed of waat ive deane for i say again hurrah and dom the schoolmeasther there  his parting words concluded john browdie strode heavily out remounted his nag put him once more into a smart canter and carolling lustily forth some fragments of an old song to which the horses hoofs rang a merry accompaniment sped back to his pretty wife and to nicholas  for some days afterwards the neighbouring country was overrun with boys who the report went had been secretly furnished by mr and mrs browdie not only with a hearty meal of bread and meat but with sundry shillings and sixpences to help them on their way to this rumour john always returned a stout denial which he accompanied however with a lurking grin that rendered the suspicious doubtful and fully confirmed all previous believers  there were a few timid young children who miserable as they had been and many as were the tears they had shed in the wretched school still knew no other home and had formed for it a sort of attachment which made them weep when the bolder spirits fled and cling to it as a refuge of these some were found crying under hedges and in such places frightened at the solitude one had a dead bird in a little cage he had wandered nearly twenty miles and when his poor favourite died lost courage and lay down beside him another was discovered in a yard hard by the school sleeping with a dog who bit at those who came to remove him and licked the sleeping childs pale face  they were taken back and some other stragglers were recovered but by degrees they were claimed or lost again and in course of time dotheboys hall and its last breakingup began to be forgotten by the neighbours or to be only spoken of as among the things that had been    chapter 65  conclusion   when her term of mourning had expired madeline gave her hand and fortune to nicholas and on the same day and at the same time kate became mrs frank cheeryble it was expected that tim linkinwater and miss la creevy would have made a third couple on the occasion but they declined and two or three weeks afterwards went out together one morning before breakfast and coming back with merry faces were found to have been quietly married that day  the money which nicholas acquired in right of his wife he invested in the firm of cheeryble brothers in which frank had become a partner before many years elapsed the business began to be carried on in the names of cheeryble and nickleby so that mrs nicklebys prophetic anticipations were realised at last  the twin brothers retired who needs to be told that they were happy they were surrounded by happiness of their own creation and lived but to increase it  tim linkinwater condescended after much entreaty and browbeating to accept a share in the house but he could never be prevailed upon to suffer the publication of his name as a partner and always persisted in the punctual and regular discharge of his clerkly duties  he and his wife lived in the old house and occupied the very bedchamber in which he had slept for fourandforty years as his wife grew older she became even a more cheerful and lighthearted little creature and it was a common saying among their friends that it was impossible to say which looked the happier tim as he sat calmly smiling in his elbowchair on one side of the fire or his brisk little wife chatting and laughing and constantly bustling in and out of hers on the other  dick the blackbird was removed from the countinghouse and promoted to a warm corner in the common sittingroom beneath his cage hung two miniatures of mrs linkinwaters execution one representing herself and the other tim and both smiling very hard at all beholders tims head being powdered like a twelfth cake and his spectacles copied with great nicety strangers detected a close resemblance to him at the first glance and this leading them to suspect that the other must be his wife and emboldening them to say so without scruple mrs linkinwater grew very proud of these achievements in time and considered them among the most successful likenesses she had ever painted tim had the profoundest faith in them likewise for on this as on all other subjects they held but one opinion and if ever there were a comfortable couple in the world it was mr and mrs linkinwater  ralph having died intestate and having no relations but those with whom he had lived in such enmity they would have become in legal course his heirs but they could not bear the thought of growing rich on money so acquired and felt as though they could never hope to prosper with it they made no claim to his wealth and the riches for which he had toiled all his days and burdened his soul with so many evil deeds were swept at last into the coffers of the state and no man was the better or the happier for them  arthur gride was tried for the unlawful possession of the will which he had either procured to be stolen or had dishonestly acquired and retained by other means as bad by dint of an ingenious counsel and a legal flaw he escaped but only to undergo a worse punishment for some years afterwards his house was broken open in the night by robbers tempted by the rumours of his great wealth and he was found murdered in his bed  mrs sliderskew went beyond the seas at nearly the same time as mr squeers and in the course of nature never returned brooker died penitent sir mulberry hawk lived abroad for some years courted and caressed and in high repute as a fine dashing fellow ultimately returning to this country he was thrown into jail for debt and there perished miserably as such high spirits generally do  the first act of nicholas when he became a rich and prosperous merchant was to buy his fathers old house as time crept on and there came gradually about him a group of lovely children it was altered and enlarged but none of the old rooms were ever pulled down no old tree was ever rooted up nothing with which there was any association of bygone times was ever removed or changed  within a stones throw was another retreat enlivened by childrens pleasant voices too and here was kate with many new cares and occupations and many new faces courting her sweet smile and one so like her own that to her mother she seemed a child again the same true gentle creature the same fond sister the same in the love of all about her as in her girlish days  mrs nickleby lived sometimes with her daughter and sometimes with her son accompanying one or other of them to london at those periods when the cares of business obliged both families to reside there and always preserving a great appearance of dignity and relating her experiences especially on points connected with the management and bringingup of children with much solemnity and importance it was a very long time before she could be induced to receive mrs linkinwater into favour and it is even doubtful whether she ever thoroughly forgave her  there was one greyhaired quiet harmless gentleman who winter and summer lived in a little cottage hard by nicholass house and when he was not there assumed the superintendence of affairs his chief pleasure and delight was in the children with whom he was a child himself and master of the revels the little people could do nothing without dear newman noggs  the grass was green above the dead boys grave and trodden by feet so small and light that not a daisy drooped its head beneath their pressure through all the spring and summertime garlands of fresh flowers wreathed by infant hands rested on the stone and when the children came to change them lest they should wither and be pleasant to him no longer their eyes filled with tears and they spoke low and softly of their poor dead cousin
