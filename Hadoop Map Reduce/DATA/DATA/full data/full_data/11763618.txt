edition of the vision of sir launfal is to furnish the material that must be used in any adequate treatment of the poem in the class room and to suggest other material that may be used in the more leisurely and fruitful method of study that is sometimes possible in spite of the restrictions of arbitrary courses of study  in interpreting the poem with young students special emphasis should be given to the ethical significance the broad appeal to human sympathy and the sense of a common brotherhood of men an appeal that is in accord with the altruistic tendencies of the present time to the intimate appreciation and love of nature expressed in the poem feelings also in accord with the present movement of cultured minds toward the natural world to the lofty and inspiring idealism of lowell as revealed in the poems included in this volume and in his biography and also as contrasted with current materialism and finally to the romantic sources of the story in the legends of king arthur and his table round a region of literary delight too generally unknown to presentday students  after these general topics it is assumed that such matters as literary structure and poetic beauty will receive due attention if the technical faults of the poem which critics are at much pains to point out are not discovered by the student his knowledge will be quite as profitable additional reading in lowells works should be secured and can be through the sympathetic interest and enthusiasm of the instructor the following selections may be used for rapid examination and discussion under

sure to find their way soon after passing the harvard gates craigie house the home of longfellow and elmwood the home of lowell though their hallowed retirement has been profaned by the encroachments of the growing city yet in their simple dignity these fine old colonial mansions still bespeak the noble associations of the past and stand as memorials of the finest products of american culture  elmwood was built before the revolution by thomas oliver the tory governor who signed his abdication at the invitation of a committee of about four thousand people who surrounded his house at cambridge the property was confiscated by the commonwealth and used by the american army during the war in 1818 it was purchased by the rev charles lowell pastor of the west congregational church in boston and after ninety years it is still the family home here was born february 22 1819 james russell lowell with surroundings most propitious for the nurturing of a poetsoul within the stately home there was a refined family life the father had profited by the unusual privilege of three years study abroad and his library of some four thousand volumes was not limited to theology the mother whose maiden name was spence and who traced her scotch ancestry back to the hero of the ballad of sir patrick spens taught her children the good old ballads and the romantic stories in the fairie queen and it was one of the poets earliest delights to recount the adventures of spensers heroes and heroines to his playmates  an equally important influence upon his early youth was the outofdoor life at elmwood to the love of nature his soul was early dedicated and no american poet has more truthfully and beautifully interpreted the inspired teachings of nature whispered through the solemn treetops or caroled by the happy birds the open fields surrounding elmwood and the farms for miles around were his familiar playground and furnished daily adventures for his curious and eager mind the mere delight of this experience with nature he says made my childhood the richest part of my life it seems to me as if i had never seen nature again since those old days when the balancing of a yellow butterfly over a thistle bloom was spiritual food and lodging for a whole forenoon in the cathedral is an autobiographic passage describing in a series of charming pictures some of those choice hours of childhood      one summer hour abides what time i perched     dappled with noonday under simmering leaves     and pulled the pulpy oxhearts while aloof     an oriole clattered and the robins shrilled     denouncing me an alien and a thief  quite like other boys lowell was subjected to the processes of the more formal education of books he was first sent to a dame school and then to the private school of william wells under whose rigid tuition he became thoroughly grounded in the classics among his schoolfellows was ww story the poetsculptor who continued his lifelong friend thomas wentworth higginson who was one of the younger boys of the school recalls the high talk of story and lowell about the fairie queen at fifteen he entered harvard college then an institution with about two hundred students the course of study in those days was narrow and dull a pretty steady diet of greek latin and mathematics with an occasional dessert of paleys evidences of christianity or butlers analogy lowell was not distinguished for scholarship but he read omnivorously and wrote copiously often in smooth flowing verse fashioned after the accepted english models of the period he was an editor of harvardiana the college magazine and was elected class poet in his senior year but his habit of lounging with the poets in the secluded alcoves of the old library in preference to attending recitations finally became too scandalous for official forbearance and he was rusticated on account of constant neglect of his college duties as the faculty records state he was sent to concord where his exile was not without mitigating profit as he became acquainted with emerson and thoreau here he wrote the class poem which he was permitted to circulate in print at his commencement this production which now stands at the head of the list of his published works was curiously unprophetic of his later tendencies it was written in the neatly polished couplets of the pope type and other imitative metres and aimed to satirize the radical movements of the period especially the transcendentalists and abolitionists with both of whom he was soon to be in active sympathy  lowells first two years out of college were troubled with rather more than the usual doubts and questionings that attend a young mans choice of a profession he studied for a bachelors degree in law which he obtained in two years but the work was done reluctantly law books he says i am reading with as few wry faces as i may though he was nominally practicing law for two years there is no evidence that he ever had a client except the fictitious one so pleasantly described in his first magazine article entitled my first client from coke and blackstone his mind would inevitably slip away to hold more congenial communion with the poets he became intensely interested in the old english dramatists an interest that resulted in his first series of literary articles the old english dramatists published in the boston miscellany the favor with which these articles were received increased he writes the hope of being able one day to support myself by my pen and to leave a calling which i hate and for which i am not well fitted to say the least  during this struggle between law and literature an influence came into lowells life that settled his purposes directed his aspirations and essentially determined his career in 1839 he writes to a friend about a very pleasant young lady who knows more poetry than any one i am acquainted with this pleasant young lady was maria white who became his wife in 1844 the loves of this young couple constitute one of the most pleasing episodes in the history of our literature idyllic in its simple beauty and inspiring in its spiritual perfectness miss white was a woman of unusual loveliness says mr norton and of gifts of mind and heart still more unusual which enabled her to enter with complete sympathy into her lovers intellectual life and to direct his genius to its highest aims she was herself a poet and a little volume of her poems published privately after her death is an evidence of her refined intellectual gifts and lofty spirit  in 1841 lowell published his first collection of poems entitled a years life the volume was dedicated to una a veiled admission of indebtedness for its inspiration to miss white two poems particularly irene and my love and the best in the volume are rapturous expressions of his new inspiration in later years he referred to the collection as poor windfalls of unripe experience only nine of the sixtyeight poems were preserved in subsequent collections in 1843 with a young friend robert carter lowell launched a new magazine the pioneer with the high purpose as the prospectus stated of giving the public a rational substitute for the nambypamby love tales and sketches monthly poured out to them by many of our popular magazines these young reformers did not know how strongly the great reading public is attached to its literary fleshpots and so the pioneer proved itself too good to live in just three months the result of the venture to lowell was an interesting lesson in editorial work and a debt of eighteen hundred dollars his next venture was a second volume of poems issued in 1844 in which the permanent lines of his poetic development appear more clearly than in a years life the tone of the first volume was uniformly serious but in the second his muses face begins to brighten with the occasional play of wit and humor the volume was heartily praised by the critics and his reputation as a new poet of convincing distinction was established in the following year appeared conversations on some of the old poets a volume of literary criticism interesting now mainly as pointing to maturer work in this field  it is generally stated that the influence of maria white made lowell an abolitionist but this is only qualifiedly true a year before he had met her he wrote to a friend the abolitionists are the only ones with whom i sympathize of the present extant parties freedom justice humanitarianism were fundamental to his native idealism maria whites enthusiasm and devotion to the cause served to crystallize his sentiments and to stimulate him to a practical participation in the movement both wrote for the liberty bell an annual published in the interests of the antislavery agitation immediately after their marriage they went to philadelphia where lowell for a time was an editorial writer for the pennsylvania freeman an antislavery journal once edited by whittier during the next six years he was a regular contributor to the antislavery standard published in new york in all of this prose writing lowell exhibited the ardent spirit of the reformer although he never adopted the extreme views of garrison and others of the ultraradical wing of the party  but lowells greatest contribution to the antislavery cause was the biglow papers a series of satirical poems in the yankee dialect aimed at the politicians who were responsible for the mexican war a war undertaken as he believed in the interests of the southern slaveholders hitherto the abolitionists had been regarded with contempt by the conservative complacent advocates of peace and compromise and to join them was essentially to lose caste in the best society but now a laughing prophet had arisen whose tongue was tipped with fire the biglow papers was an unexpected blow to the slave power never before had humor been used directly as a weapon in political warfare soon the whole country was ringing with the homely phrases of hosea biglows satiric humor and deriding conservatism began to change countenance no speech no plea no appeal says george william curtis was comparable in popular and permanent effect with this pitiless tempest of fire and hail in the form of wit argument satire knowledge insight learning commonsense and patriotism it was humor of the purest strain but humor in deadly earnest as an embodiment of the elemental yankee character and speech it is a classic of final authority says curtis burns did not give to the scotch tongue a nobler immortality than lowell gave to the dialect of new england  the year 1848 was one of remarkably productive results for lowell besides the biglow papers and some forty magazine articles and poems he published a third collection of poems the vision of sir launfal and the fable for critics the various phases of his composite genius were nearly all represented in these volumes the fable was a goodnatured satire upon his fellow authors in which he touched up in rollicking rhymed couplets the merits and weaknesses of each not omitting himself with witty characterization and acute critical judgment and it is still read for its delicious humor and sterling criticism for example the lines on poe will always be quoted      there comes poe with his raven like barnaby rudge     threefifths of him genius and twofifths sheer fudge  and so the sketch of hawthorne      there is hawthorne with genius so shrinking and rare     that you hardly at first see the strength that is there     a frame so robust with a nature so sweet     so earnest so graceful so lithe and so fleet     is worth a descent from olympus to meet  lowell was now living in happy content at elmwood his father whom he once speaks of as a dr primrose in the comparative degree had lost a large portion of his property and literary journals in those days sent very small checks to young authors so humble frugality was an attendant upon the high thinking of the poet couple but this did not matter since the richest objects of their ideal world could be had without price but clouds suddenly gathered over their beautiful lives four children were born three of whom died in infancy lowells deep and lasting grief for his firstborn is tenderly recorded in the poems she came and went and the first snowfall the volume of poems published in 1848 was reverently dedicated to the memory of our little blanche and in the introductory poem addressed to mwl he poured forth his sorrow like a libation of tears      i thought our love at fall but i did err     joys wreath drooped oer mine eyes i could not see     that sorrow in our happy world must be     loves deepest spokesman and interpreter  the year 185152 was spent abroad for the benefit of mrs lowells health which was now precarious at rome their little son walter died and one year after their return to elmwood sorrows crown of sorrow came to the poet in the death of mrs lowell october 1853 for years after the dear old home was to him the dead house as he wrote of it      for it died that autumn morning       when she its soul was borne     to lie all dark on the hillside       that looks over woodland and corn  before 1854 lowells literary success had been won mainly in verse with the appearance in the magazines of a moosehead journal fireside travels and leaves from my italian journal his success as a prose essayist began henceforth and against his will his prose was a stronger literary force than his poetry he now gave a course of lectures on the english poets at the lowell institute and during the progress of these lectures he received notice of his appointment to succeed longfellow in the professorship of the french and spanish languages and belleslettres in harvard college a year was spent in europe in preparation for his new work and during the next twenty years he faithfully performed the duties of the professorship pouring forth the ripening fruits of his varied studies in lectures such as it is not often the privilege of college students to hear that pulling in the yoke of this steady occupation was sometimes galling is shown in his private letters to wd howells he wrote regretfully of the time and energy given to teaching and of his conviction that he would have been a better poet if he had not estranged the muse by donning a professors gown but a good teacher always bears in his left hand the lamp of sacrifice  in 1857 lowell was married to miss frances dunlap a woman of remarkable gifts and grace of person and character says charles eliot norton in the same year the atlantic monthly was launched and lowell became its first editor this position he held four years under his painstaking and wise management the magazine quickly became what it has continued to be the finest representative of true literature among periodicals in 1864 he joined his friend professor norton in the editorship of the north american review to which he gave much of the distinction for which this periodical was once so worthily famous in this first appeared his masterly essays on the great poets chaucer dante shakespeare spenser milton dryden and the others which were gathered into the three volumes among my books first and second series and my study windows variety was given to this critical writing by such charming essays as a good word for winter and the deliciously caustic paper on a certain condescension in foreigners  one of the strongest elements of lowells character was patriotism his love of country and his native soil was not merely a principle it was a passion no american author has done so much to enlarge and exalt the ideals of democracy an intense interest in the welfare of the nation broadened the scope of his literary work and led him at times into active public life during the civil war he published a second series of biglow papers in which says mr greenslet we feel the vital stirring of the mind of lowell as it was moved by the great war and if they never had quite the popular reverberation of the first series they made deeper impression and are a more priceless possession of our literature when peace was declared in april 1865 he wrote to professor norton the news my dear charles is from heaven i felt a strange and tender exaltation i wanted to laugh and i wanted to cry and ended by holding my peace and feeling devoutly thankful there is something magnificent in having a country to love on july 21 a solemn service was held at harvard college in memory of her sons who had died in the war in which lowell gave the commemoration ode a poem which is now regarded not as popular but as marking the highest reach of his poetic power the famous passage characterizing lincoln is unquestionably the finest tribute ever paid to lincoln by an american author  in the presidential campaign of 1876 lowell was active making speeches serving as delegate to the republican convention and later as presidential elector there was even much talk of sending him to congress through the friendly offices of mr howells who was in intimate personal relations with president hayes he was appointed minister to spain this honor was the more gratifying to him because he had long been devoted to the spanish literature and language and he could now read his beloved calderon with new joys in 1880 he was promoted to the english mission and during the next four years represented his country at the court of st james in a manner that raised him to the highest point of honor and esteem in both nations his career in england was an extraordinary in most respects an unparalleled success he was our first official representative to win completely the heart of the english people and a great part of his permanent achievement was to establish more cordial relations between the two countries his literary reputation had prepared the ground for his personal popularity he was greeted as his excellency the ambassador of american literature to the court of shakespeare his fascinating personality won friends in every circle of society queen victoria declared that during her long reign no ambassador had created so much interest or won so much regard he had already been honored by degrees from oxford and cambridge and now many similar honors were thrust upon him he was acknowledged to be the best afterdinner speaker in england and no one was called upon so often for addresses at dedications the unveiling of tablets and other civic occasions it is not strange that he became attached to england with an increasing affection but there was no diminution of his intense americanism his celebrated birmingham address on democracy is yet our clearest and noblest exposition of american political principles and ideals  with the inauguration of cleveland in 1885 lowells official residence in england came to an end he returned to america and for a time lived with his daughter at deerfoot farm mrs lowell had died in england and he could not carry his sorrow back to elmwood alone he now leisurely occupied himself with literary work making an occasional address upon literature or politics which was always distinguished by grace and dignity of style and richness of thought  in november 1886 he delivered the oration at the 250th anniversary of the founding of harvard university and rising to the requirements of this notable occasion he captivated his hearers among whom were many distinguished delegates from the great universities of europe as well as of america by the power of his thought and the felicity of his expression  during the period of his diplomatic service he added almost nothing to his permanent literary product in 1869 he had published under the willows a collection that contains some of his finest poems in the same year the cathedral was published a stately poem in blank verse profound in thought with many passages of great poetic beauty in 1888 a final collection of poems was published entitled heartsease and rue which opened with the memorial poem agassiz an elegy that would not be too highly honored by being bound in a golden volume with lycidas adonais and thyrsis going back to his earliest literary studies he again 1887 lectured at the lowell institute on the old dramatists occasionally he gave a poem to the magazines and a collection of these last poems was made in 1895 by professor norton during these years were written many of the charming letters to personal friends which rank with the finest literary letters ever printed and must always be regarded as an important part of his prose works  it was a gracious boon of providence that lowell was permitted to spend his last years at elmwood with his daughter mrs burnett and his grandchildren there again as in the early days he watched the orioles building their nests and listened to the tricksy catbirds call to an english friend he writes i watch the moon rise behind the same trees through which i first saw it seventy years ago and have a strange feeling of permanence as if i should watch it seventy years longer in the old library by the familiar fireplace he sat when the shadows were playing among his beloved books communing with the beautiful past what unwritten poems of pathos and sweetness may have ministered to his great soul we cannot know in 1890 a fatal disease came upon him and after long and heroic endurance of pain he died august 12 1891 and under the trees of mt auburn he rests as in life still near his great neighbor longfellow in a memorial poem oliver wendell holmes spoke for the thousands who mourned      peace to thy slumber in the forest shade       poet and patriot every gift was thine     thy name shall live while summers bloom and fade       and grateful memory guard thy leafy shrine  lowells rich and varied personality presents a type of cultured manhood that is the finest product of american democracy the largeness of his interests and the versatility of his intellectual powers give him a unique eminence among american authors his genius was undoubtedly embarrassed by the diffusive tendency of his interests he might have been a greater poet had he been less the reformer and statesman and his creative impulses were often absorbed in the mere enjoyment of exercising his critical faculty although he achieved only a qualified eminence as poet or as prose writer yet because of the breadth and variety of his permanent achievement he must be regarded as our greatest man of letters his sympathetic interest always outflowing toward concrete humanity was a quality      with such large range as from the alehouse bench     can reach the stars and be with both at home  with marvelous versatility and equal ease he could talk with the downeast farmer and salty seamen and exchange elegant compliments with old world royalty in the cathedral he says significantly      i thank benignant nature most for this     a force of sympathy or call it lack     of character firmplanted loosing me     from the pent chamber of habitual self     to dwell enlarged in alien modes of thought     haply distasteful wholesomer for that     and through imagination to possess     as they were mine the lives of other men  in the delightful little poem the nightingale in the study we have a fanciful expression of the conflict between lowells love of books and love of nature his friend the catbird calls him out beneath the unmastered sky where the buttercups brim with wine beyond all lesbian juice but there are ampler skies he answers in fancys land and the singers though dead so long      give its best sweetness to all song     to natures self her better glory  his love of reading is manifest in all his work giving to his style a bookishness that is sometimes excessive and often troublesome his expression though generally direct and clear and happily colored by personal frankness is often burdened with learning to be able to read his essays with full appreciation is in itself evidence of a liberal education his scholarship was broad and profound but it was not scholarship in the german sense exhaustive and exhausting he studied for the joy of knowing never for the purpose of being known and he cared more to know the spirit and meaning of things than to know their causes and origins a language he learned for the sake of its literature rather than its philology as mr brownell observes he shows little interest in the large movements of the worlds history he seemed to prefer history as sublimated in the poets song the field of belleslettres was his native province its atmosphere was most congenial to his tastes in bookland it was always june for him               springtime neer denied     indoors by vernal chaucer whose fresh woods     throb thick with merle and mavis all the year  but books could never divert his soul from its early endearments with outofdoor nature the older i grow he says the more i am convinced that there are no satisfactions so deep and so permanent as our sympathies with outward nature and in the preface to my study windows he speaks of himself as one who has always found his most fruitful study in the open air the most charming element of his poetry is the nature element that everywhere cheers and stimulates the reader it is full of sunshine and bird music so genuine spontaneous and sympathetic are his descriptions that we feel the very heart throbs of nature in his verse and in the prose of such records of intimacies with outdoor friends as the essay my garden acquaintance how i do love the earth he exclaims i feel it thrill under my feet i feel somehow as if it were conscious of my love as if something passed into my dancing blood from it it is this sensitive nearness to nature that makes him a better interpreter of her visible forms than bryant even moreover unlike bryant he always catches the notes of joy in natures voices and feels the uplift of a happy inspiration  in the presence of the immense popularity of mark twain it may seem paradoxical to call lowell our greatest american humorist yet in the refined and artistic qualities of humorous writing and in the genuineness of the native flavor his work is certainly superior to any other humorous writing that is likely to compete with it for permanent interest indeed mr greenslet thinks that it is as the author of the biglow papers that he is likely to be longest remembered the perpetual play of humor gave to his work even to the last the freshness of youth we love him for his boyish love of pure fun the two large volumes of his letters are delicious reading because he put into them good wholesome nonsense as he says keeping my seriousness to bore myself with  but this sparkling and overflowing humor never obscures the deep seriousness that is the undercurrent of all his writing a high idealism characterizes all his work one of his greatest services to his country was the effort to create a saner and sounder political life as he himself realized he often moralized his work too much with a purposeful idealism in middle life he said i shall never be a poet until i get out of the pulpit and new england was all meetinghouse when i was growing up in religion and philosophy he was conservative deprecating the radical and scientific tendencies of the age with its knife and glass      that make thought physical and thrust far off     the heaven so neighborly with man of old  the moral impulse and the poetic impulse were often in conflict and much of his early poetry for this reason was condemned by his later judgment his maturer poems are filled with deepthoughted lines phrases of high aspiration and soulstirring ecstasies though his thought is spiritual and ideal it is always firmly rooted in the experience of common humanity all can climb the heights with him and catch inspiring glimpses at least of the ideal and the infinite     critical appreciations   the proportion of his poetry that can be so called is small but a great deal of it is very fine very noble and at times very beautiful and it discloses the distinctly poetic faculty of which rhythmic and figurative is native expression it is impressionable rather than imaginative in the large sense it is felicitous in detail rather than in design and of a general rather than individual a representative rather than original inspiration there is a field of poetry assuredly not the highest but ample and admirablein which these qualities more or less unsatisfactory in prose are legitimately and fruitfully exercised all poetry is in the realm of feeling and thus less exclusively dependent on the thought that is the sole reliance of prose being genuine poetry lowells profits by this advantage feeling is fitly genuinely its inspiration its range and limitations correspond to the character of his susceptibility as those of his prose do to that of his thought the fusion of the two in the crucible of the imagination is infrequent with him because with him it is the fancy rather than the imagination that is luxuriant and highly developed for the architectonics of poetry he had not the requisite reach and grasp the comprehensive and constructing vision nothing of his has any large design or effective interdependent proportions in a technical way an exception should be noted in his skilful building of the odea form in which he was extremely successful and for which he evidently had a native aptitude  lowells constitutes on the whole the most admirable american contribution to the nature poetry of english literaturefar beyond that of bryant whittier or longfellow i think and only occasionally excelled here and there by the magic touch of emersonw c brownell in scribners magazine february 1907                                       lowell is a poet who seems to represent new england more variously than either of his comrades we find in his work as in theirs her loyalty and moral purpose she has been at cost for his training and he in turn has read her heart honoring her as a mother before the world and seeing beauty in her common garb and speech if lowell be not first of all an original genius i know not where to look for one judged by his personal bearing who is brighter more persuasive more equal to the occasion than himselfless open to doudans stricture upon writers who hoard and store up their thoughts for the betterment of their printed works lowells treasury can stand the drafts of both speech and composition judged by his works as a poet in the end must be he is one who might gain by revision and compression but think as is his due upon the highwater marks of his abundant tide and see how enviable the record of a poet who is our most brilliant and learned critic and who has given us our best native idyll our best and most complete work in dialectic verse and the noblest heroic ode that america has producedeach and all ranking with the first of their kinds in english literature of the modern timeedmund clarence stedman                                       as a racy humorist and a brilliant wit using verse as an instrument of expression he has no clear superior probably no equal so far at least as american readers are concerned among writers who have employed the english language as a satirist he has superiors but scarcely as an inventor of jeux desprit as a patriotic lyrist he has few equals and very few superiors in what is probably the highest function of such a poetthat of stimulating to a noble height the national instincts of his countrymen the rest of his poetry may fairly be said to gain on that of any of his american contemporaries save poe in more sensuous rhythm in choicer diction in a more refined and subtilized imagination and in a deeper a more brooding intelligenceprof william p trent                                       in originality in virility in manysidedness lowell is the first of american poets he not only possessed at times in nearly equal measure many of the qualities most notable in his fellowpoets rivaling bryant as a painter of nature and holmes in pathos having a touch too of emersons transcendentalism and rising occasionally to whittiers moral fervor but he brought to all this much beside in one vein he produced such a masterpiece of mingled pathos and nature painting as we find in the tenth biglow letter of the second series in another such a lyric gem as the fountain in another the first snowfall and after the burial in another again the noble harvard commemoration ode he had plainly a most defective ear for rhythm and verbal harmony except when he confines himself to simple metres we rarely find five consecutive lines which do not in some way jar on us his blank verse and the irregular metres which he unfortunately so often employs have little or no music and are often quite intolerable but after all the deductions which the most exacting criticism can make it still remains that as a serious poet lowell stands high as a painter of nature he has when at his best few superiors and in his own country none whatever be their esthetic and technical deficiencies he has written many poems of sentiment and pathos which can never fail to come home to all to whom such poetry appeals his hortatory and didactic poetry as it expresses itself in the commemoration ode is worthy if not of the music and felicity of milton and wordsworth at least of their tone when that tone is most exalted as a humorist he is inimitable his humor is rooted in a fine sense of the becoming and in a profounder insight into the character of his countrymen than that of any other american writerjohn churton collins                                       he was a brilliant wit and a delightful humorist a discursive essayist of unfailing charm the best american critic of his time a scholar of wide learning deep also when his interest was most engaged a powerful writer on great public questions a patriot passionately pure but first last and always he was a poet never so happy as when he was looking at the world from the poets mount of vision and seeking for fit words and musical to tell what he had seen but his emotion was not sufficiently recollected in tranquillity had he been more an artist he would have been a better poet for then he would have challenged the invasions of his literary memory his humor his animal spirits within limits where they had no right of way if his humor was his rarest it was his most dangerous gift so often did it tempt him to laugh out in some holy place less charming than longfellow less homely than whittier less artistic than holmes less grave than bryant less vivid than emerson less unique than poe his qualities intellectual moral and esthetic in their assemblage and coördination assign him to a place among american men of letters which is only a little lower than that which is emersons and his alonejohn white chadwick     the vision of sir launfal   early in 1848 in a letter to his friend briggs lowell speaks of the vision of sir launfal as a sort of story and more likely to be popular than what i write generally maria thinks very highly of it and in another letter he calls it a little narrative poem in december 1848 it was published in a thin volume alone and at once justified the poets expectations of popularity the poem was an improvisation like that of his musing organist for it was written we are told almost at a single sitting entirely within two days the theme may have been suggested by tennysons sir galahad but his familiarity with the old romances and his love of the mystical and symbolic sense of these good oldtime tales were a quite ample source for such suggestion moreover lowell in his early years was much given to seeing visions and dreaming dreams during that part of my life he says which i lived most alone i was never a single night unvisited by visions and once i thought i had a personal revelation from god himself the fairie queen was the first poem i ever read he says and the bosky glades of elmwood were often transformed into an enchanted forest where the knight of the red cross and una and others in medieval costume passed up and down before his wondering eyes this medieval romanticism was a perfectly natural accompaniment of his intense idealism  the vision of sir launfal and the fable for critics published in the same year illustrate the two dominant and strikingly contrasted qualities of his nature a contrast of opposites which he himself clearly perceived i find myself very curiously compounded of two utterly distinct characters one half of me is clear mystic and enthusiast and the other humorist and he adds that it would have taken very little to have made a saint francis of him it was the saint francis of new england the moral and spiritual enthusiast in lowells nature that produced the poem and gave it power thus we see that notwithstanding its antique style and artificial structure it was a perfectly direct and spontaneous expression of himself  the allegory of the vision is easily interpreted in its main significance there is nothing original in the lesson the humility of true charity and it is a common criticism that the moral purpose of the poem is lost sight of in the beautiful nature pictures but a knowledge of the events which were commanding lowells attention at this time and quickening his native feelings into purposeful utterance gives to the poem a much deeper significance in 1844 when the discussion over the annexation of texas was going on he wrote the present crisis a noble appeal to his countrymen to improve and elevate their principles during the next four years he was writing editorially for the standard the official organ of the antislavery society at the same time he was bringing out the biglow papers in all these forms of expression he voiced constantly the sentiment of reform which now filled his heart like a holy zeal the national disgrace of slavery rested heavily upon his soul he burned with the desire to make gods justice prevail where mans justice had failed in 1846 he said in a letter it seems as if my heart would break in pouring out one glorious song that should be the gospel of reform full of consolation and strength to the oppressed yet falling gently and restoringly as dew on the withered youthflowers of the oppressor that way my madness lies if any this passionate yearning for reform is embodied poetically in the vision in a broad sense therefore the poem is an expression of ideal democracy in which equality sympathy and a sense of the common brotherhood of man are the basis of all ethical actions and standards it is the christlike conception of human society that is always so alluring in the poetry and so discouraging in the prose of life  the following explanation appeared in the early editions of the poem as an introductory note       according to the mythology of the romancers the san greal      or holy grail was the cup out of which jesus christ partook      of the last supper with his disciples it was brought into      england by joseph of arimathea and remained there an      object of pilgrimage and adoration for many years in the      keeping of his lineal descendants it was incumbent upon      those who had charge of it to be chaste in thought word      and deed but one of the keepers having broken this      condition the holy grail disappeared from that time it was      a favorite enterprise of the knights of arthurs court to go      in search of it sir galahad was at last successful in      finding it as may be read in the seventeenth book of the      romance of king arthur tennyson has made sir galahad the      subject of one of the most exquisite of his poems       the plot if i may give that name to anything so slight of      the following poem is my own and to serve its purposes i      have enlarged the circle of competition in search of the      miraculous cup in such a manner as to include not only other      persons than the heroes of the round table but also a      period of time subsequent to the date of king arthurs      reign  in the last sentence there is a sly suggestion of lowells playfulness of course every one may compete in the search for the grail and the time subsequent to king arthurs reign includes the present time the romance of king arthur is the morte darthur of sir thomas malory lowells specific indebtedness to the medieval romances extended only to the use of the symbol of consecration to some noble purpose in the search for the grail and to the name of his hero it is a free version of older french romances belonging to the arthurian cycle sir launfal is the title of a poem written by sir thomas chestre in the reign of henry vi which may be found in ritsons ancient english metrical romances there is nothing suggestive of lowells poem except the quality of generosity in the hero who          gaf gyftys largelyche     gold and sylver and clodes ryche       to squyer and to knight  one of lowells earlier poems the search contains the germ of the vision of sir launfal it represents a search for christ first in natures fair woods and fields then in the proud world amid power and wealth and the search finally ends in a hovel rude where        the king i sought for meekly stood         a naked hungry child         clung round his gracious knee     and a poor hunted slave looked up and smiled       to bless the smile that set him free  and christ the seeker learns is not to be found by wandering through the world      his throne is with the outcast and the weak  a similar fancy also is embodied in a little poem entitled a parable christ goes through the world to see how the men my brethren believe in me and he finds in church and palace and judgmenthall a disregard for the primary principles of his teaching      have ye founded your throne and altars then     on the bodies and souls of living men     and think ye that building shall endure     which shelters the noble and crushes the poor  these early poems and passages in others written at about the same time taken in connection with the vision show how strongly the theme had seized upon lowells mind  the structure of the poem is complicated and sometimes confusing at the outset the student must notice that there is a story within a story the action of the major story covers only a single night and the hero of this story is the real sir launfal who in his sleep dreams the minor story the vision the action of this story covers the lifetime of the hero the imaginary sir launfal from early manhood to old age and includes his wanderings in distant lands the poem is constructed on the principles of contrast and parallelism by holding to this method of structure throughout lowell sacrificed the important artistic element of unity especially in breaking the narrative with the prelude to the second part the first prelude describing the beauty and inspiring joy of spring typifying the buoyant youth and aspiring soul of sir launfal corresponds to the second prelude describing the bleakness and desolation of winter typifying the old age and desolated life of the hero but beneath the surface of this wintry age there is a new soul of summer beauty the warm love of suffering humanity just as beneath the surface of the frozen brook there is an icepalace of summer beauty in part first the gloomy castle with its joyless interior stands as the only cold and forbidding thing in the landscape like an outpost of winter so in part second the same castle with christmas joys within is the only bright and gladsome object in the landscape in part first the castle gates never might opened be in part second the castle gates stand open now and thus the student may find various details contrasted and paralleled the symbolic meaning must be kept constantly in mind or it will escape unobserved for example the cost of earthly things in comparison with the generosity of june corresponds to the churlish castle opposed to the inviting warmth of summer and each symbolizes the proud selfish misguided heart of sir launfal in youth in comparison with the humility and large christian charity in old age the student should search for these symbolic hints passages in which more is meant than meets the ear but if he does not find all that the poet may or may not have intended in his dreamy design there need be no detraction from the enjoyment of the poem  critical judgment upon the vision of sir launfal is generally severe in respect to its structural faults mr greenslet declares that through half a century nine readers out of ten have mistaken lowells meaning even the numerous commentators have interpreted the poem as if the young knight actually adventured the quest and returned from it at the end of years broken and old this however must be regarded as a rather exaggerated estimate of the lack of unity and consistency in the poem stedman says i think that the vision of sir launfal owed its success quite as much to a presentation of nature as to its misty legend it really is a landscape poem of which the lovely passage and what is so rare as a day in june and the wintry prelude to part second are the specific features and the english critic j churton collins thinks that sir launfal except for the beautiful nature pictures scarcely rises above the level of an ingoldsby legend  the popular judgment of the poem which after all is the important judgment is fairly stated by mr greenslet there is probably no poem in american literature in which a visionary faculty like that of lowell is expressed with such a firm command of poetic background and variety of music as in sir launfal  its structure is far from perfect yet for all that it has stood the searching test of time it is beloved now by thousands of young american readers for whom it has been a first initiation to the beauty of poetic idealism  while studying the vision of sir launfal the student should be made familiar with tennysons sir galahad and the holy grail and the libretto of wagners parsifal also henry a abbeys magnificent series of mural paintings in the boston public library representing the quest of the holy grail may be utilized in the copley prints if possible the story of sir galahads search for the grail in the seventeenth book of sir thomas malorys morte darthur should be read it would be well also to read longfellows king robert of sicily which to some extent presents a likeness of motive and treatment     the commemoration ode   in april 1865 the civil war was ended and peace was declared on july 21 harvard college held a solemn service in commemoration of her ninetythree sons who had been killed in the war eight of these fallen young heroes were of lowells own kindred personal grief thus added intensity to the deep passion of his utterance upon this great occasion he was invited to give a poem and the ode which he presented proved to be the supreme event of the noble service the scene is thus described by francis h underwood who was in the audience  the services took place in the open air in the presence of a great assembly prominent among the speakers were majorgeneral meade the hero of gettysburg and majorgeneral devens the wounds of the war were still fresh and bleeding and the interest of the occasion was deep and thrilling the summer afternoon was drawing to its close when the poet began the recital of the ode no living audience could for the first time follow with intelligent appreciation the delivery of such a poem to be sure it had its obvious strong points and its sonorous charms but like all the later poems of the author it is full of condensed thought and requires study the reader today finds many passages whose force and beauty escaped him during the recital but the effect of the poem at the time was overpowering the face of the poet always singularly expressive was on this occasion almost transfiguredglowing as if with an inward light it was impossible to look away from it our age has furnished many great historic scenes but this commemoration combined the elements of grandeur and pathos and produced an impression as lasting as life  of the delivery and immediate effect of the poem mr greenslet says some in the audience were thrilled and shaken by it as lowell himself was shaken in its delivery yet he seems to have felt with some reason that it was not a complete and immediate success nor is this cause for wonder the passion of the poem was too ideal its woven harmonies too subtle to be readily communicated to so large an audience mastered and mellowed though it was by a single deep mood nor was lowells elocution quite that of the deepmouthed odist capable of interpreting such organ tones of verse but no sooner was the poem published with the matchless lincoln strophe inserted than its greatness and nobility were manifest  the circumstances connected with the writing of the ode have been described by lowell in his private letters it appears that he was reluctant to undertake the task and for several weeks his mind utterly refused to respond to the high duty put upon it at last the sublime thought came to him upon the swift wings of inspiration the ode itself he says was an improvisation two days before the commemoration i had told my friend child that it was impossiblethat i was dull as a doormat but the next day something gave me a jog and the whole thing came out of me with a rush i sat up all night writing it out clear and took it on the morning of the day to child in another letter he says the poem was written with a vehement speed which i thought i had lost in the skirts of my professors gown till within two days of the celebration i was hopelessly dumb and then it all came with a rush literally making me lean mi fece magro and so nervous that i was weeks in getting over it in a note in scudders biography of lowell vol ii p 65 it is stated upon the authority of mrs lowell that the poem was begun at ten oclock the night before the commemoration day and finished at four oclock in the morning she opened her eyes to see him standing haggard actually wasted by the stress of labor and the excitement which had carried him through a poem full of passion and fire of five hundred and twentythree lines in the space of six hours  critical estimates are essentially in accord as to the deep significance and permanent poetic worth of this poem greenslet the latest biographer of lowell says that the ode if not his most perfect is surely his noblest and most splendid work and adds until the dream of human brotherhood is forgotten the echo of its large music will not wholly die away professor beers declares it to be although uneven one of the finest occasional poems in the language and the most important contribution which our civil war has made to song of its exalted patriotism george william curtis says the patriotic heart of america throbs forever in lincolns gettysburg address but nowhere in literature is there a more magnificent and majestic personification of a country whose name is sacred to its children nowhere a profounder passion of patriotic loyalty than in the closing lines of the commemoration ode the american whose heart swayed by that lofty music does not thrill and palpitate with solemn joy and high resolve does not yet know what it is to be an american  with the praise of a discriminating criticism stedman discusses the ode in his poets of america another poet would have composed a less unequal ode no american could have glorified it with braver passages with whiter heat with language and imagery so befitting impassioned thought tried by the rule that a true poet is at his best with the greatest theme lowells strength is indisputable the ode is no smoothcut verse from pentelicus but a mass of rugged quartz beautiful with prismatic crystals and deep veined here and there with virgin gold the early strophes though opening with a fine abrupt line weakwinged is song are scarcely firm and incisive lowell had to work up to his theme in the third division many loved truth and lavished lifes best oil he struck upon a new and musical intonation of the tenderest thoughts the quaver of this melodious interlude carries the ode along until the great strophe is reached      such was he our martyrchief  in which the man abraham lincoln whose death had but just closed the national tragedy is delineated in a manner that gives this poet a preëminence among those who capture likeness in enduring verse that we award to velasquez among those who fasten it upon the canvas one of plutarchs men is before us face to face an historic character whom lowell fully comprehended and to whose height he reached in this great strophe scarcely less fine is his tearful yet transfiguring avete to the sacred dead of the commemoration the weaker divisions of the production furnish a background to these passages and at the close the poet rises with the invocation      bow down dear land for thou hast found release  a strain which shows that when lowell determinedly sets his mouth to the trumpet the blast is that of roncesvalles  wc brownell the latest critic of lowells poetry says of this poem the ode is too long its evolution is defective it contains verbiage it preaches but passages of itthe most famous having characteristically been interpolated after its deliveryare equal to anything of the kind the temptation to quote from it is hard to withstand it is the capsheaf of lowells achievement in this ode he reaches if he does not throughout maintain his own clearethered height and his verse has the elevation of ecstasy and the splendor of the sublime  the versification of this poem should be studied with some particularity of the forms of lyric expression the ode is the most elaborate and dignified it is adapted only to lofty themes and stately occasions great liberty is allowed in the choice and arrangement of its meter rhymes and stanzaic forms that its varied form and movement may follow the changing phases of the sentiment and passion called forth by the theme lowell has given us an account of his own consideration of this matter my problem he says was to contrive a measure which should not be tedious by uniformity which should vary with varying moods in which the transitions including those of the voice should be managed without jar i at first thought of mixed rhymed and blank verses of unequal measures like those in the choruses of samson agonistes which are in the main masterly of course milton deliberately departed from that stricter form of greek chorus to which it was bound quite as much i suspect by the law of its musical accompaniment as by any sense of symmetry i wrote some stanzas of the commemoration ode on this theory at first leaving some verses without a rhyme to match but my ear was better pleased when the rhyme coming at a longer interval as a faroff echo rather than instant reverberation produced the same effect almost and yet was gratified by unexpectedly recalling an

winter dull and gray                   115     t was the proudest hall in the north countree     and never its gates might opened be     save to lord or lady of high degree     summer besieged it on every side     but the churlish stone her assaults defied                 120     she could not scale the chilly wall     though around it for leagues her pavilions tall     stretched left and right     over the hills and out of sight       green and broad was every tent                           125       and out of each a murmur went     till the breeze fell off at night   iii       the drawbridge dropped with a surly clang     and through the dark arch a charger sprang     bearing sir launfal the maiden knight                     130     in his gilded mail that flamed so bright     it seemed the dark castle had gathered all     those shafts the fierce sun had shot over its wall       in his siege of three hundred summers long     and binding them all in one blazing sheaf                 135       had cast them forth so young and strong     and lightsome as a locust leaf     sir launfal flashed forth in his maiden mail     to seek in all climes for the holy grail   iv       it was morning on hill and stream and tree                 140       and morning in the young knights heart     only the castle moodily     rebuffed the gifts of the sunshine free       and gloomed by itself apart     the season brimmed all other things up                      145     full as the rain fills the pitcherplants cup   v       as sir launfal made morn through the darksome gate       he was ware of a leper crouched by the same     who begged with his hand and moaned as he sate       and a loathing over sir launfal came                     150     the sunshine went out of his soul with a thrill       the flesh neath his armor gan shrink and crawl     and midway its leap his heart stood still       like a frozen waterfall     for this man so foul and bent of stature                  155     rasped harshly against his dainty nature     and seemed the one blot on the summer morn     so he tossed him a piece of gold in scorn   vi       the leper raised not the gold from the dust

gives only the worthless gold       who gives from a sense of duty                           165     but he who gives a slender mite     and gives to that which is out of sight       that thread of

summers old                  175     on open wold and hilltop bleak       it had gathered all the cold     and whirled it like sleet on the wanderers cheek     it carried a shiver everywhere     from the unleafed boughs and pastures bare                 180     the little brook heard it and built a roof     neath which he could house him winterproof     all night by the white stars frosty gleams     he groined his arches and matched his beams     slender and clear were his crystal spars                    185     as the lashes of light that trim the stars     he sculptured every summer delight     in his halls and chambers out of sight     sometimes his tinkling waters slipt     down through a frostleaved forestcrypt                   190     long sparkling aisles of steelstemmed trees     bending to counterfeit a breeze     sometimes the roof no fretwork knew     but silvery mosses that downward grew     sometimes it was carved in sharp relief                     195     with quaint arabesques of icefern leaf     sometimes it was simply smooth and clear     for the gladness of heaven to shine through and here     he had caught the nodding bulrushtops     and hung them thickly with diamonddrops                   200     that crystalled the beams of moon and sun     and made a star of every one     no mortal builders most rare device     could match this winterpalace of ice

 had been mimicked in fairy masonry       by the elfin builders of the frost                       210      within the hall are song and laughter       the cheeks of christmas glow red and jolly     and sprouting is every corbel and rafter       with lightsome green of ivy and holly     through the deep gulf of the chimney wide                   215     wallows the yulelogs roaring tide     the

swift little troops of silent sparks       now pausing now scattering away as in fear     go threading the sootforests tangled darks       like herds of startled deer      but the wind without was eager and sharp                   225     of sir launfals gray hair it makes a harp            and rattles and wrings            the icy strings     singing in dreary monotone     a christmas carol of its own                               230     whose burden still as he might guess     wasshelterless shelterless shelterless      the voice of the seneschal flared like a torch     as he shouted the wanderer away from the porch     and he sat in the gateway and saw all night                 235       the great hallfire so cheery and bold       through the windowslits of the castle old     build out its piers of ruddy light       against the drift of the cold   part second  i       there was never a leaf on bush or tree                     240     the bare boughs rattled shudderingly     the river was dumb and could not speak       for the weaver winter its shroud had spun     a single crow on the treetop bleak       from his shining feathers shed off the cold sun          245     again it was morning but shrunk and cold     as if her veins were sapless and old     and she rose up decrepitly     for a last dim look at earth and sea   ii       sir launfal turned from his own hard gate                  250     for another heir in his earldom sate     an old bent man worn out and frail     he came back from seeking the holy grail     little he recked of his earldoms loss     no more on his surcoat was blazoned the cross              255     but deep in his soul the sign he wore     the badge of the suffering and the poor   iii       sir launfals raiment thin and spare     was idle mail gainst the barbed air     for it was just at the christmas time                      260     so he mused as he sat of a sunnier clime     and sought for a shelter from cold and snow     in the light and warmth of long ago     he sees the snakelike caravan crawl     oer the edge of the desert black and small               265     then nearer and nearer till one by one     he can count the camels in the sun     as over the redhot sands they pass     to where in its slender necklace of grass     the little spring laughed and leapt in the shade           270     and with its own self like an infant played     and waved its signal of palms   iv       for christs sweet sake i beg an alms     the happy camels may reach the spring     but sir launfal sees only the grewsome thing               275     the leper lank as the rainblanched bone     that cowers beside him a thing as lone     and white as the iceisles of northern seas     in the desolate horror of his disease   v       and sir launfal saidi behold in thee                    280     an image of him who died on the tree     thou also hast had thy crown of thorns     thou also hast had the worlds buffets and scorns     and to thy life were not denied     the wounds in the hands and feet and side                  285     mild marys son acknowledge me     behold through him i give to thee   vi       then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes       and looked at sir launfal and straightway he     remembered in what a haughtier guise                        290       he had flung an alms to leprosie     when he girt his young life up in gilded mail     and set forth in search of the holy grail     the heart within him was ashes and dust     he parted in twain his single crust                        295     he broke the ice on the streamlets brink     and gave the leper to eat and drink     t was a moldy crust of coarse brown bread       t was water out of a wooden bowl     yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed              300       and t was red wine he drank with his thirsty soul   vii       as sir launfal mused with a downcast face     a light shone round about the place     the leper no longer crouched at his side     but stood before him glorified                             305     shining and tall and fair and straight     as the pillar that stood by the beautiful gate     himself the gate whereby men can     enter the temple of god in man   viii       his words were shed softer than leaves from the pine       310     and they fell on sir launfal as snows on the brine     that mingle their softness and quiet in one     with the shaggy unrest they float down upon     and the voice that was softer than silence said     lo it is i be not afraid                                315     in many climes without avail     thou hast spent thy life for the holy grail     behold it is herethis cup which thou     didst fill at the streamlet for me but now     this crust is my body broken for thee                      320     this water his blood that died on the tree     the holy supper is kept indeed     in whatso we share with anothers need     not what we give but what we share     for the gift without the giver is bare                     325     who gives himself with his alms feeds three     himself his hungering neighbor and me   ix       sir launfal awoke as from a swound     the grail in my castle here is found     hang my idle armor up on the wall                          330     let it be the spiders banquethall     he must be fenced with stronger mail     who would seek and find the holy grail   x       the castle gate stands open now       and the wanderer is welcome to the hall                   335     as the hangbird is to the elmtree bough       no longer scowl the turrets tall     the summers long siege at last is oer     when the first poor outcast went in at the door     she entered with him in disguise                           340     and mastered the fortress by surprise     there is no spot she loves so well on ground     she lingers and smiles there the whole year round     the meanest serf on sir launfals land     has hall and bower at his command                          345     and theres no poor man in the north countree     but is lord of the earldom as much as he     the shepherd of king admetus       there came a youth upon the earth       some thousand years ago     whose slender hands were nothing worth     whether to plow or reap or sow      he made a lyre and drew therefrom                  5       music so strange and rich     that all men loved to hearand some     muttered of fagots for a witch      but king admetus one who had       pure taste by right divine                      10     decreed his singing not too bad     to hear between the cups of wine      and so well pleased with being soothed       into a sweet halfsleep     three times his kingly beard he smoothed          15     and made him viceroy oer his sheep      his words were simple words enough       and yet he used them so     that what in other mouths were rough     in his seemed musical and low                     20      men called him but a shiftless youth       in whom no good they saw     and yet unwittingly in truth     they made his careless words their law      they knew not how he learned at all               25       for long hour after hour     he sat and watched the dead leaves fall     or mused upon a common flower      it seemed the loveliness of things       did teach him all their use                     30     for in mere weeds and stones and springs     he found a healing power profuse      men granted that his speech was wise       but when a glance they caught     of his slim grace and womans eyes                35     they laughed and called him goodfornaught      yet after he was dead and gone       and een his memory dim     earth seemed more sweet to live upon     more full of love because of him                 40      and day by day more holy grew       each spot where he had trod     till afterpoets only knew     their firstborn brother as a god     an incident in a railroad

forward leaned             5       drinking with eager hearts and ears     his brooklike songs whom glory never weaned       from humble smiles and tears      slowly there grew a tender awe       sunlike oer faces brown and hard              10     as if in him who read they felt and saw       some presence of the bard      it was a sight for sin and wrong       and slavish tyranny to see     a sight to make our faith more pure and strong     15       in high humanity      i thought these men will carry hence       promptings their former life above     and something of a finer reverence

it would pierce through pride and fear       to the lives of coarsest men      it may be glorious to write       thoughts that shall glad the two or three     high souls like those far stars that come

                 5       might in some dim wise divine     the depth of his infinite patience       to this wayward soul of mine      i know not how others saw her       but to me she was wholly fair                   10     and the light of the heaven she came from       still lingered and gleamed in her hair     for it was as wavy and golden       and as many changes took     as the shadows of sungilt ripples                 15       on the yellow bed of a brook      to what can i liken her smiling       upon me her kneeling lover     how it leaped from her lips to her eyelids       and dimpled her wholly over                     20     till her outstretched hands smiled also       and i almost seemed to see     the very heart of her mother       sending sun through her veins to me      she had been with us scarce a twelvemonth        25       and it hardly seemed a day     when a troop of wandering angels       stole my little daughter away     or perhaps those heavenly zingari       but loosed the hampering strings                30     and when they had opened her cagedoor       my little bird used her wings      but they left in her stead a changeling       a little angel child     that seems like her bud in full blossom           35       and smiles as she never smiled     when i wake in the morning i see it       where she always used to lie     and i feel as weak as a violet       alone neath the awful sky                      40      as weak yet as trustful also       for the whole year long i see     all the wonders of faithful nature       still worked for the love of me     winds wander and dews drip earthward             45       rain falls suns rise and set     earth whirls and all but to prosper       a poor little violet      this child is not mine as the first was       i cannot sing it to rest                        50     i cannot lift it up fatherly       and bliss it upon my breast     yet it lies in my little ones cradle       and sits in my little ones chair     and the light of the heaven shes gone to          55       transfigures its golden hair     an indiansummer reverie           what visionary tints the year puts on       when falling leaves falter through motionless air         or numbly cling and shiver to be gone       how shimmer the low flats and pastures bare         as with her nectar hebe autumn fills                      5         the bowl between me and those distanthills     and smiles and shakes abroad her misty tremulous hair          no more the landscape holds its wealth apart       making me poorer in my poverty         but mingles with my senses and my heart                 10       my own projected spirit seems to me         in her own reverie the world to steep         t is she that waves to sympathetic sleep     moving as she is moved each field and hill and tree          how fuse and mix with what unfelt degrees              15       clasped by the faint horizons languid arms

    and floating in mirage seem all the glimmering farms          far distant sounds the hidden chickadee       close at my side far distant sound the leaves         the fields seem fields of dream where memory       wanders like gleaning ruth and as the sheaves             25         of wheat and barley wavered in the eye         of boaz as the maidens glow went by     so tremble and seem

country ours once more     smoothing thy gold of wardishevelled hair     oer such sweet brows as never other wore         and letting thy set lips         freed from wraths pale eclipse                            345     the rosy edges of their smile lay bare     what words divine of lover or of poet     could tell our love and make thee know it     among the nations bright beyond compare         what were our lives without thee                           350         what all our lives to save thee         we reck not what we gave thee         we will not dare to doubt thee     but ask whatever else and we will dare     notes  the vision of sir launfal   1 the musing organist there is a peculiar felicity in this musical introduction the poem is like an improvisation and was indeed composed much as a musician improvises with swift grasp of the subtle suggestions of musical tones it is a dream an elaborate and somewhat tangled metaphor full of hidden meaning for the accordant mind and the poet appropriately gives it a setting of music the most symbolic of all the arts it is an allegory like any one of the adventures in the fairie queen and from the very beginning the reader must be alive to the symbolic meaning upon which lowell unlike spenser places chief emphasis rather than upon the narrative compare the similar musical device in brownings abt vogler and adelaide proctors lost chord  6 theme the theme subject or underlying thought of the poem is expressed in line 12 below      we sinais climb and know it not  or more comprehensively in the group of four lines of which this is the conclusion the organists fingers wander listlessly over the keys at first then come forms and figures from out of dreamland over the bridge of his careless melody and gradually the vision takes consistent and expressive shape so the poet comes upon his central subject or theme shaped from his wandering thought and imagination  7 auroral flushes like the first faint glimmerings of light in the east that point out the pathway of the rising sun the uncertain wavering outlines of the poets vision precede the perfected theme that is drawing near  9 not only around our infancy etc the allusion is to wordsworths ode on the intimations of immortality especially these lines      heaven lies about us in our infancy     shades of the prisonhouse begin to close         upon the growing boy     but he beholds the light and whence it flows         he sees it in his joy     the youth who daily farther from the east         must travel still is natures priest         and by the vision splendid         is on his way attended     at length the man perceives it die away     and fade into the light of common day  as lowells central theme is so intimately associated with that of wordsworths poem if not directly suggested by it the two poems should be read together and compared lowell maintains that heaven lies about us not only in our infancy but at all times if only we have the soul to comprehend it  12 we sinais climb etc mount sinai was the mountain in arabia on which moses talked with god exodus xix xx gods miracles are taking place about us all the time if only we can emancipate our souls sufficiently to see them from out of our materialized daily lives we may rise at any moment if we will to ideal and spiritual things in a letter to his nephew lowell says this same name of god is written all over the world in little phenomena that occur under our eyes every moment and i confess that i feel very much inclined to hang my head with pizarro when i cannot translate those hieroglyphics into my own vernacular letters i 164  compare the following passage in the poem bibliolatres      if thou hast wanderings in the wilderness     and findst not sinai t is thy soul is poor     there towers the mountain of the voice no less     which whoso seeks shall find but he who bends     intent on manna still and mortal ends     sees it not neither hears its thundered lore  15 prophecies prophecy is not only prediction but also any inspired discourse or teaching compare the following lines from the poem freedom written the same year      are we then wholly fallen can it be     that thou north wind that from thy mountains bringest     their spirit to our plains and thou blue sea     who on our rocks thy wreaths of freedom flingest     as on an altarcan it be that ye     have wasted inspiration on dead ears     dulled with the too familiar clank of chains  at the end of this poem lowell gives his view of fallen and traitor lives he speaks of the boundless future of our country                                    ours if we be strong     or if we shrink better remount our ships     and fleeing gods express design trace back     the herofreighted mayflowers prophettrack     to europe entering her bloodred eclipse  while reading sir launfal the fact must be kept in mind that lowell was at the time of writing the poem filled with the spirit of freedom and reform and was writing fiery articles in prose for the antislavery standard expressing his bitter indignation at the indifference and lukewarmness of the northern people on the subject of slavery  17 druid wood the druids were the aged priests of the celts who performed their religious ceremonies in the forests especially among oaks which were peculiarly sacred to them hence the venerable woods like the aged priests offer their benediction every power of nature the winds the mountain the wood the sea has a symbolic meaning which we should be able to interpret for our inspiration and uplifting read bryants a forest hymn  18 benedicite an invocation of blessing imperative form of the latin benedicere to bless longfellow speaks of the power of songs that             come like the benediction     that follows after prayer  1920 compare these lines with the ninth strophe of wordsworths ode the inspiring sea is wordsworths immortal sea both poets rejoice that some of the impulses and ideals of youth are kept alive in old age  21 earth gets its price etc notice the special meaning given to earth here in contrast with heaven in line 29 here again the thought is suggested by wordsworths ode sixth strophe      earth fills our lap with pleasures of her own  23 shrives the priest shrives one when he hears confession and grants absolution  25 devils booth expand this metaphor and unfold its application to everyday life  27 cap and bells the conventional dress of the court fool or jester of the middle ages and after him of the stage clown consisted of the fools cap and suit of motley ornamented with little tinkling bells  28 bubbles we buy etc this line as first published had earn for buy  31 this line read originally there is no price set etc the next line began with and  3295 this rapturous passage descriptive of june is unquestionably the most familiar and most celebrated piece of nature poetry in our literature it is not only beautiful and inspiring in its felicitous phrasings of external nature but it is especially significant as a true expression of the heart and soul of the poet himself it was always the hightide of the year with lowell in june when his spirits were in fine accord with the universal joy of nature wherever in his poetry he refers to spring and its associations he always expresses the same ecstasy of delight the passage must be compared with the opening lines of under the willows which he at first named a june idyll      june is the pearl of our new england year     still a surprisal though expected long     her coming startles long she lies in wait     makes many a feint peeps forth draws coyly back     then from some southern ambush in the sky     with one great gush of blossom storms the world etc  and in sunthin in the pastoral line the coming of spring is delightfully pictured                         our spring gets everything in tune     an gives one leap from april into june etc  in a letter written in june 1867 lowell says there never is such a season and that shows what a poet god is he says the same thing over to us so often and always new here ive been reading the same poem for near half a century and never had a notion what the buttercup in the third stanza meant before  it is worth noting that lowells happy june corresponds to may in the english poets as in wordsworths ode             with the heart of may     doth every beast keep holiday  in new england where northern natur is slow an apt to doubt      may is a pious fraud of the almanac  or as hosea biglow says          half our may is so awfully like may nt     t would rile a shaker or an evrige saint  41 the original edition has grasping instead of groping  42 climbs to a soul etc in his intimate sympathy with nature lowell endows her forms with conscious life as wordsworth did who says in lines written in early spring      and t is my faith that every flower     enjoys the air it breathes  so lowell in the cathedral says      and i believe the brown earth takes delight     in the new snowdrop looking back at her     to think that by some vernal alchemy     it could transmute her darkness into pearl  so again he says in under the willows            i in june am midway to believe     a tree among my far progenitors     such sympathy is mine with all the race     such mutual recognition vaguely sweet     there is between us  it must be remembered that this humanizing of nature is an attitude toward natural objects characteristic only of modern poetry being practically unknown in english poetry before the period of burns and wordsworth  45 the cowslip startles surprises the eye with its bright patches of green sprinkled with golden blossoms cowslip is the common name in new england for the marshmarigold which appears early in spring in low wet meadows and furnishes not infrequently a savory mess of greens for the farmers dinnertable  46 compare al fresco lines 3439      the rich milktingeing buttercup     its tiny polished urn holds up     filled with ripe summer to the edge     the sun in his own wine to pledge  56 nice delicately discriminating  62 this line originally read because god so wills it  71 maize has sprouted there is an anxious period for the farmer after his corn is planted for if the spring is backward and the weather cold his seed may decay in the ground before sprouting  73 so in sunthin in the pastoral line when robinredbreast sees the hosschesnuts leetle hands unfold he knows      thet arter this ther s only blossomsnows     so choosin out a handy crotch an spouse     he goes to plastrin his adobë house  77 note the happy effect of the internal rhyme in this line  93 healed with snow explain the appropriateness of the metaphor  9495 is the transition here from the prelude to the story abrupt or do the preceding lines lead up to it appropriately just why does sir launfal now remember his vow do these lines introduce the theme that the musing organist has finally found in dreamland or the symbolic illustration of his theme  97 richest mail the knights coat of mail was usually of polished steel often richly decorated with inlaid patterns of gold and jewels to serve his high purpose sir launfal brings forth his most precious treasures  99 holy grail according to medieval legend the sangreal was the cup or chalice made of emerald which was used by christ at the last supper and in which joseph of arimathea caught the last drops of christs blood when he was taken down from the cross the quest of the grail is the central theme of the arthurian romances tennysons holy grail should be read and the student should also be made familiar with the beautiful versions of the legend in abbeys series of mural paintings in the boston public library and in wagners parsifal  103 on the rushes in ancient halls and castles the floors were commonly strewn with rushes in taming of the shrew when preparing for the homecoming of petruchio and his bride grumio says is supper ready the house trimmed rushes strewed cobwebs swept  109 the crows flapped etc suggestive of the quiet heavy flight of the crow in a warm day the beginning and the end of the stanza suggest drowsy quiet the vision begins in this stanza the nature pictures are continued but with new symbolical meaning  114 like an outpost of winter the cold gloomy castle stands in strong contrast to the surrounding landscape filled with the joyous sunshine of summer so the proud knights heart is still inaccessible to true charity and warm human sympathy so aristocracy in its power and pride stands aloof from democracy with its humility and aspiration for human brotherhood this stanza is especially figurative the poet is unfolding the main theme the underlying moral purpose of the whole poem but it is still kept in vague dreamy symbolism  116 north countree the north of england the home of the border ballads this form of the word countree with accent on the last syllable is common in the old ballads here it gives a flavor of antiquity in keeping with the story  122 pavilions tall the trees as in line 125 the broad green tents note how the military figure beginning with outposts in line 115 is continued and developed throughout the stanza and reverted to in the word siege in the next stanza  130 maiden knight a young untried unpracticed knight the expression occurs in tennysons sir galahad so maiden mail below  137 as a locustleaf the small delicate leaflets of the compound locustleaf seem always in a lightsome movement  138 the original edition has unscarred mail  138139 compare the last lines of tennysons sir galahad      by bridge and ford by park and pale     allarmed i ride whateer betide     until i find the holy grail  147 made morn let in the morning or came into the full morning light as the huge gate opened  148 leper why did the poet make the crouching beggar a leper  152 for gan shrink the original has did shrink  155 bent of stature criticise this phrase  158 so he tossed  in scorn this is the turningpoint of the moral movement of the story sir launfal at the very beginning makes his fatal mistake his noble spirit and lofty purposes break down with the first test he refuses to see a brother in the loathsome leper the light and warmth of human brotherhood had not yet entered his soul just as the summer sunshine had not entered the frowning castle the regeneration of his soul must be worked out through wandering and suffering compare the similar plot of the ancient mariner  163 no true alms the alms must also be in the heart  164 originally he gives nothing but worthless gold  166 slender mite an allusion to the widows two mites luke xxi 14  168 the allsustaining beauty the allpervading spirit of god that unites all things in one sympathetic whole this divinity in humanity is its highest beauty in the oak lowell says      lord all thy works are lessons each contains     some emblem of mans allcontaining soul  172 a god goes with it the godlike quality of real charity of heart to heart sympathy in a letter written a little after the composition of this poem lowell speaks of love and freedom as being the sides which beauty presented to him then  172 store plenty abundance  175 summers what is gained by the use of this word instead of winters  176 wold a high open and barren field that catches the full sweep of the wind the wolds of north england are like the downs of the south  181 the little brook in a letter written in december 1848 lowell says last night i walked to watertown over the snow with the new moon before me and a sky exactly like that in pages evening landscape orion was rising behind me and as i stood on the hill just before you enter the village the stillness of the fields around me was delicious broken only by the tinkle of a little brook which runs too swiftly for frost to catch it my picture of the brook in sir launfal was drawn from it see the poem beaver brook originally called the mill and the winter picture in an indiansummer reverie lines 148196  184 groined groined arches are formed by the intersection of two arches crossing at any angle forming a ribbed vault a characteristic feature of gothic architecture  190 forestcrypt the crypt of a church is the basement filled with arched pillars that sustain the building the cavern of the brook as the poet will have us imagine it is like this subterranean crypt where the pillars are like trees and the groined arches like interlacing branches decorated with frost leaves the poet seems to have had in mind throughout the description the interior of the gothic cathedrals as shown by the many suggestive terms used groined crypt aisles fretwork and carvings  193 fretwork the ornamental work carved in intricate patterns in oak or stone on the ceilings of old halls and churches  195 sharp relief when a figure stands out prominently from the marble or other material from which it is cut it is said to be in high relief in distinction from low relief bas relief  196 arabesques complicated patterns of interwoven foliage flowers and fruits derived from arabian art lowell had undoubtedly studied many times the frost designs on the window panes  201 that crystalled the beams etc that caught the beams of moon and sun as in a crystal for that the original edition has which  204 winterpalace of ice an allusion apparently to the icepalace built by the empress of russia catherine ii most magnificent and mighty freak the wonder of the north cowper called it compare lowells description of the frost work with cowpers similar description in the task in the beginning of book v  205210 twas as if every image etc note the exquisite fancy in these lines the elves have preserved in the ice the pictures of summer foliage and clouds that were mirrored in the water as models for another summer  211 the hall in the old castles the hall was always the large banqueting room originally the common living room here all large festivities would take place  213 corbel a bracketlike support projecting from a wall from which an arch springs or on which a beam rests the poet has in mind an ancient hall in which the ceiling is the exposed woodwork of the roof  214 this line at first read with the lightsome etc why did lowells refining taste strike out the  216 yulelog the great log sometimes the root of a tree burned in the huge fireplace on christmas eve with special ceremonies and merrymakings it was lighted with a brand preserved from the last years log and connected with its burning were many quaint superstitions and customs the celebration is a survival through our scandinavian ancestors of the winter festival in honor of the god thor herrick describes it trippingly in one of his songs           come bring with a noise          my merrie merrie boys     the christmas log to the firing          while my good dame she          bids ye all be free     and drink to your hearts desiring  219 like a locust etc only one who has heard both sounds frequently can appreciate the close truth of this simile the metaphors and similes in this stanza are deserving of special study  226 harp prof william vaughn moody questions whether the use of sir launfals hair as a harp for the wind to play a christmas carol on is not a bit grotesque does the picture of sir launfal in these two stanzas belong in the prelude or in the story in part second  230 carol of its own contrasted with the carols that are being sung inside the castle  231 burden the burden or refrain is the part repeated at the end of each stanza of a ballad or song expressing the main theme or sentiment still is in the sense of always ever  233 seneschal an officer of the castle who had charge of feasts and ceremonies like the modern lord chamberlain of the kings palace note the effect of the striking figure in this line  237 windowslits narrow perpendicular openings in the wall serving both as windows and as loopholes from which to fire at an enemy  238 build out its piers the beams of light are like the piers or jetties that extend out from shore into the water to protect ships such piers are also built out to protect the shore from the violent wash of the ocean the poet may possibly however have had in mind the piers of a bridge that support the arches and stand against the sweep of the stream  243 in this line instead of the weaver winter the original has the frosts swift shuttles was the change an improvement  244 a single crow note the effect of introducing this lone crow into the bleak landscape  250 it must not be forgotten that this old sir launfal is only in the dream of the real sir launfal who is still lying on the rushes within his own castle as the poor had often been turned away with cold heartless selfishness so he is now turned away from his own hard gate  251 sate the use of this archaic form adds to the antique flavor of the poem so with the use of the word tree for cross in line 281 below lowell was passionately fond of the old poets and the quaint language of the early centuries of english literature and loved to introduce into his own poetry words and phrases from these sources of this habit he says      if some small savor creep into my rhyme     of the old poets if some words i use     neglected long which have the lusty thews     of that goldhaired and earnesthearted time     whose loving joy and sorrow all sublime     have given our tongue its starry eminence     it is not pride god knows but reverence     which hath grown in me since my childhoods prime  254 recked cared for  255 surcoat a long flowing garment worn over the armor on which was emblazoned the coat of arms if the knight were a crusader a red cross was embroidered thus on the surcoat  256 the sign the sign of the cross the symbol of humility and love this is the first real intimation the keynote of the transformation that has taken place in sir launfals soul  259 idle mail useless ineffectual protection this figure carries us back to the gilded mail line 131 in which sir launfal flashed forth at the beginning of his quest the poem is full of these minor antitheses which should be traced by the student  264272 he sees etc this description is not only beautiful in itself but it serves an important purpose in the plan of the poem it is a kind of condensation or symbolic expression of sir launfals many years of wandering in oriental lands the hint or brief outline is given which must be expanded by the imagination of the reader otherwise the story would be inconsistent and incomplete notice how deftly the picture is introduced  272 signal of palms a group of palm trees seen afar off over the desert is a welcome signal of an oasis with water for the relief of the suffering traveler some critics have objected that so small a spring could not have waved so large a signal  273 notice the abruptness with which the leper is here introduced just as before at the beginning of the story the vision of a sunnier clime is quickly swept away the shock of surprise now has a very different effect upon sir launfal  275 this line at first read but sir launfal sees naught save the grewsome thing  278 white and behold miriam became leprous white as snow numbers xii 10  279 desolate horror the adjective suggests the outcast isolated condition of lepers they were permitted no contact with other people the ten lepers who met jesus in samaria stood afar off and lifted up their voices  281 on the tree on the cross whom they slew and hanged on a tree him god raised up the third day acts x 39 this use of the word is common in early literature especially in the ballads  285 see john xx 2527  287 through him the leper note that the address is changed in these two lines compare matthew xxv 3440 this gift to the leper differs how from the gift in part first  291 leprosie the antiquated spelling is used for the perfect rhyme and to secure the antique flavor  292 girt the original word here was caged  294 ashes and dust explain the metaphor compare with sackcloth and ashes see esther iv 3 jonah iii 6 job ii 8  300 301 the figurative character of the lines is emphasized by the word soul at the end the miracle of cana seems to have been in the poets mind  304 305 the leper is transfigured and christ himself appears in the vision of the sleeping sir launfal  307 the beautiful gate the gate of the temple which is called beautiful where peter healed the lame man acts iii 2  308 himself the gate see john x 7 9 i am the door  310 temple of god know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you i corinthians iii 16 17 vi 19  312 this line at first began with which  313 shaggy is this term applicable to sir launfals present condition or is the whole simile carried a little beyond the point of true likeness  314 softer lowell originally wrote calmer here the change increased the effect of the alliteration was it otherwise an improvement  315 lo it is i john vi 20  316 without avail was sir launfals long quest entirely without avail compare the last lines of tennysons holy grail where arthur complains that his knights who went upon the holy quest have followed wandering fires lost in the quagmire and leaving human wrongs to right themselves  320 321 matthew xxvi 2628 mark xiv 2224  322 holy supper the last supper of christ and his disciples upon which is instituted the communion service of the churches the spirit of the holy supper the communion of true brotherhood is realized when the christlike spirit triumphs in the man inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me matthew xxv 40  326 the

siege at last is oer the return to this figure rounds out the story and serves to give unity to the plan of the poem the siege is successful summer has conquered and entered the castle warming and lighting its cold cheerless interior  342 343 is lowell expressing here his own convictions about ideal democracy     the shepherd of king admetus   apollo the god of music having given offense to zeus was condemned to serve for the space of one year as a shepherd under admetus king of thessaly this is one of the most charming of the myths of apollo and has been often used by the poets remarking upon this poem and others of its period scudder says that it shows how persistently in lowells mind was present this aspect of the poet which makes him a seer a recognition of an allembracing allpenetrating power which through the poet transmutes nature into something finer and more eternal and gives him a vantage ground from which to perceive more truly the realities of life compare with this poem an incident in a railroad car  5 lyre according to mythology apollos lyre was a tortoiseshell strung with seven strings  8 fagots for a witch the introduction of this witch element into a greek legend rather mars the consistency of the poem lowell finally substituted for the stanza the following      upon an empty tortoiseshell       he stretched some chords and drew     music that made mens bosoms swell       fearless or brimmed their eyes with dew     hebe   lowell suggests in this dainty symbolical lyric his conception of the poets inspiration hebe was cupbearer to the gods of olympus in greek mythology and poured for them their nectar she was also the goddess of eternal youth by an extension of the symbolism she becomes goddess of the eternal joyousness of the poetic gift the influence fleet is the divine afflatus that fills the creative mind of the poet but pegasus cannot be made to work in harness at will true inspiration comes only in choice moments coy

bring her choicest ambrosia that is      make thyself rich and then the muse     shall court thy precious interviews     shall take thy head upon her knee     and such enchantment lilt to thee     that thou shalt hear the lifeblood flow     from farthest stars to grassblades low     to the dandelion   four stanzas were added to this poem after its first appearance the sixth seventh eighth and tenth but in the finally revised edition these were cut out very likely because lowell regarded them as too didactic indeed the poem is complete and more artistic without them  of lowells earlier pieces says stedman the one which shows the finest sense of the poetry of nature is that addressed to the dandelion the opening phrase ranks with the selectest of wordsworth and keats to whom imaginative diction came intuitively and both thought and language are felicitous throughout this poem contains many of its authors peculiar beauties and none of his faults it was the outcome of the mood that can summon a rare spirit of art to express the gladdest thought and most elusive feeling  6 eldorado the land of gold supposed to be somewhere in south america which the european adventurers especially the spaniards were constantly seeking in the sixteenth century  27 sybaris an ancient greek colony in southern italy whose inhabitants were devoted to luxury and pleasure  5254 compare sir launfal     my love   lowells love for maria white is beautifully enshrined in this little poem he wrote it at about the time of their engagement while it is thus personal in its origin it is universal in its expression of ideal womanhood and so has a permanent interest and appeal in its strong simplicity and crystal purity of style it is a little masterpiece though filled with the passion of his new and beautiful love its movement is as calm and artistically restrained as that of one of wordsworths best lyrics     the changeling   this is one of the tender little poems that refer to the death of the poets daughter blanche which occurred in march 1847 the first snowfall and she came and went embody the same personal grief when sending the former to his friend sydney h gay for publication he wrote may you never have the key which shall unlock the whole meaning of the poem to you underwood in his biographical sketch says that friends of the poet who were admitted to the study in the upper chamber remember the pairs of baby shoes that hung over a pictureframe the volume in which this poem first appeared contained this dedicationto the ever fresh and happy memory of our little blanche this volume is reverently dedicated  a changeling according to folklore and fairy tale is a fairy child that the fairies substitute for a human child that they have stolen the changeling was generally sickly shrivelled and in every way repulsive here the poet reverses the superstition substituting the angels for the mischievous fairies who bring an angel child in place of the lost one whittier has a poem on the same theme the changeling  29 zingari the gypsiessuggested by wandering angels abovewho wander about the earth and also sometimes steal children according to popular belief  52 bliss it a rather violent use of the word not recognized by the dictionaries but nevertheless felicitous     an indiansummer reverie   lowells love of elmwood and its surroundings finds expression everywhere in his writings both prose and verse but nowhere in a more direct personal manner than in this poem he was not yet thirty when the poem was written and cambridge could still be called a village but the familiar scenes already had their retrospective charms which increased with the passing years later in life he again celebrated his affection for this home environment in under the willows  there are poetic lines and phrases in the poem says scudder and more than all the veil of the season hangs tremulously over the whole so that one is gently stirred by the poetic feeling of the rambling verses yet after all the most enduring impression is of the young man himself in that still hour of his life when he was conscious not so much of a reform to which he must put his hand as of the love of beauty and of the vague melancholy which mingles with beauty in the soul of a susceptible poet the river winding through the marshes the distant sound of the ploughman the near chatter of the chipmunk the individual trees each living its own life the march of the seasons flinging lights and shadows over the broad scene the pictures of human life associated with his own experience the hurried survey of his village yearsall these pictures float before his vision and then with an abruptness which is like the choking of the singers voice with tears there wells up the thought of the little life which held as in one precious drop the love and faith of his heart  1 visionary tints the term indian summer is given to almost any autumnal period of exceptionally quiet dry and hazy weather in america these characteristic features of late fall were especially associated with the middle west at a time when the indians occupied that region  5 hebe hebe was cupbearer to the gods at their feasts on olympus like hebe autumn fills the sloping fields rimmed round with distant hills with her own delicious atmosphere of dreamy and poetic influence  11 my own projected spirit it seems to the poet that his own spirit goes out to the world steeping it in reverie like his own rather than receiving the influence from natures mood  25 gleaning ruth for the story of ruths gleaning in the fields of boaz see the book of ruth ii  38 chipmunk lowell at first had squirrel here which would be inconsistent with the underground fastness and yet are chipmunks

think the bobolink the best singer in the world even undervaluing the lark and the nightingale in the comparison and in another he writes that liquid tinkle of theirs is the true fountain of youth if one can only drink it with the right ears and i always date the new year from the day of my first draught messer roberto di lincoln with his summer alb over his shoulders is the true chorister for the

despair     runs down a brook o laughter thru the air  see also the opening lines of under the willows for another description full of the ecstasy of both bird and poet the two passages woven together appear in the essay cambridge thirty years ago as a quotation an early poem on the bobolink delightful and widely popular was omitted from later editions of his poems by lowell perhaps because to his

dips into the marsh  in a letter written twenty years after the reverie to jt fields lowell says my heart was almost broken yesterday by seeing nailed to my willow a board with these words on it these

mortal the race is the watercourse conducted from the dam in an open trough or penstock to the wheel  45 in that new childhood of the earth this poem was written a few weeks after the vision of sir launfal was published and it therefore naturally partakes of its idealism     the present crisis   this poem was written in 1844 the discussion over the annexation of texas was absorbing public attention the antislavery party opposed annexation believing that it would strengthen the slaveholding interests and for the same reason the south was urging the scheme lowell wrote several very strong antislavery poems at this time to wl garrison wendell phillips on the death of ct torrey and others which attracted attention to him as a new and powerful ally of the reform party these poems says george william curtis especially that on the present crisis have a tyrtæan resonance a stately rhetorical rhythm that make their dignity of thought their intense feeling and picturesque imagery superbly effective in recitation they sang themselves on every antislavery platform  while the poem was inspired by the political struggle of the time which lowell regarded as a crisis in the history of our national honor and progress its chief strength is due to the fact that its lofty sentiment is universal in its appeal and not applicable merely to temporal and local conditions  17 round the earths electric circle etc this prophetic figure was doubtless suggested by the first telegraph line which samuel fb morse had just erected between baltimore and washington  37 the word in the

blank page but its popularity was so great that lowell expanded it to twice its original length and finally printed it as a kind of introduction to the second series of the biglow papers it first

ninetythree sons of harvard college who have died for their country in the war of nationality the text of the poem is here given as lowell first published it in 1865 he afterward made a few verbal changes and added one new strophe after the eighth there is a special interest in studying the ode in the form in which it came rushing from the poets brain  114 the deeds of the poet are weak and trivial compared with the deeds of heroes they live their high ideals and die for them yet the gentle words of the poet may sometimes save unusual lives from that oblivion to which all common lives are destined  5 robinsleaf an allusion to the ballad of the babes in the wood  9 squadronstrophes the term strophe originally was applied to a metrical form that was repeated in a certain established way like the strophe and antistrophe of the greek ode as sung by a divided chorus it is now applied to any stanza form the poem of heroism is a battleode whose successive stanzas are marching

forgetfulness are not even disturbed by dreams  14 unventurous throng the vast majority of commonplace beings who neither achieve nor attempt deeds of high emprise  16 wisest scholars many students who had returned from the war were in the audience welcomed back by their revered mother their alma mater  20 peddling engaging in small trifling interests lowells attitude toward science is that of

commonplace fortunes by the stars  2526 clear fame compare miltons lycidas      fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise     to scorn delights and live laborious days  32 halfvirtues is lowell disparaging the virtues of peace and home in comparison with the heroic virtues of war or are these halfvirtues contrasted with the loftier virtue the devotion to truth  34 that stern device the seal of harvard college chosen by its early founders bears the device of a shield with the word veritas truth upon three open books  46 sad faith deep serious faith or there may be a slight touch

and god called the light day etc genesis i 5 we may have light from the divine fountains  110114 in shaping this elaborate battle metaphor one can easily believe the poet to have had in mind some fierce mountain struggle during the war such as the battle of lookout mountain  111 creeds here used in the broad sense of convictions principles beliefs  115118 the construction is faulty in these lines the two last clauses should be coordinated the substance of the meaning is peace has her wreath while the cannon are silent and while the sword slumbers lowells attention was called to this defective passage by tw higginson and he replied your criticism is perfectly just and i am much obliged to you for itthough i might defend myself i believe by some constructions even looser in some of the greek choruses but on the whole when i have my choice i prefer to make sense he then suggested an emendation which somehow failed to get into the published poem      ere yet the sharp decisive word     redden the cannons lips and while the sword  120 baäls stone obscene human sacrifices were offered on the altars of baäl jeremiah xix 5  147205 this strophe was not in the ode as delivered but was written immediately after the occasion and included in the published poem it is so completely imbedded in the structure of the ode says scudder that it is difficult to think of it as an afterthought it is easy to perceive that while the glow of composition and of recitation was still upon him lowell suddenly conceived this splendid illustration and indeed climax of the utterance of the ideal which is so impressive in the fifth stanza into these threescore lines lowell has poured a conception of lincoln which may justly be said to be today the accepted idea which americans hold of their great president it was the final expression of the judgment which had slowly been forming in lowells own mind  in a letter to richard watson gilder lowell says the passage about lincoln was not in the ode as originally recited but added immediately after more than eighteen months before however i had written about lincoln in the north american reviewan article that pleased him i did divine him earlier than most men of the brahmin caste  it is a singular fact that the other great new england poets longfellow whittier and holmes had almost nothing to say about lincoln  150 wept with the passion etc an article in the atlantic monthly for june 1885 began with this passage the funeral procession of the late president of the united states has passed through the land from washington to his final restingplace in the heart of the prairies along the line of more than fifteen hundred miles his remains were borne as it were through continued lines of the people and the number of mourners and the sincerity and unanimity of grief was such as never before attended the obsequies of a human being so that the terrible catastrophe of his end hardly struck more awe than the majestic sorrow of the people  170 outward grace is dust an allusion to lincolns awkward and rather unkempt outward appearance  173 suppletempered will one of the most pronounced traits of lincolns character was his kindly almost femininely gentle and sympathetic spirit with this however was combined a determination of steel  175178 nothing of europe here there was nothing of europe in him or if

of wellington      the path of duty was the way of glory  in a letter to tw higginson who was editing the harvard memorial biographies in which he was to print the ode lowell asked to have the following passage inserted at this point      virtue treads paths that end not in the grave     but through those constellations go     that shed celestial influence on the brave     if life were but to draw this dusty breath     that doth our wits enslave     and with the crowd to hurry to and fro     seeking we know not what and finding death     these did unwisely but if living be     as some are born to know     the power to ennoble and inspire     in other souls our brave desire     for fruit not leaves of times immortal tree     these truly live our thoughts essential fire     and to

morning hence youth aspiration hope the figure is continued in l 271  262 who now shall sneer in a letter to mr jb thayer who had criticized this strophe lowell admits that there is a certain narrowness in it as an expression of the popular feeling as well as my own i confess i have never got over the feeling of wrath with which just after the death of my nephew willie i read in an english paper that nothing was to be hoped of an army officered by tailors apprentices and butcher boys but lowell asks his critic to observe that this strophe leads naturally to the next and that i there justify the sentiment  265 roundhead and cavalier in a general way it is said that new england was settled by the roundheads or puritans of england and the south by the cavaliers or royalists  272273
