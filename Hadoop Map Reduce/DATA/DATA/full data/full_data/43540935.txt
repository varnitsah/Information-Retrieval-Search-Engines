chapter xxiv  rest after labor     chapter i  life in cantonments   very bright and pretty in the early springtime of the year 1857 were the british cantonments of sandynugghur as in all other british garrisons in india they stood quite apart from the town forming a suburb of their own they consisted of the barracks and of a maidan or as in england it would be called a common on which the troops drilled and exercised and round which stood the bungalows of the military and civil officers of the station of the chaplain and of the one or two merchants who completed the white population of the place  very pretty were these bungalows built entirely upon the ground floor in rustic fashion wood entering largely into their composition some were thatched others covered with slabs of wood or stone all had wide verandas running around them with tatties or blinds made of reeds or strips of wood to let down and give shade and coolness to the rooms therein in some of them the visitor walked from the compound or garden directly into the diningroom large airy with neither curtains nor carpeting nor matting but with polished boards as flooring the furniture here was generally plain and almost scanty for except at meal times the rooms were but little used  outside in the veranda is the real sittingroom of the bungalow here are placed a number of easychairs of all shapes constructed of cane or bamboolight cool and comfortable these are moved as the sun advances to the shady side of the veranda and in them the ladies read and work the gentlemen smoke in all bungalows built for the use of english families there is as was the case at sandynugghur a drawing room as well as a diningroom and this being the ladies especial domain is generally furnished in european style with a piano light chintz chaircovers and muslin curtains  the bedroom opens out of the sittingroom and almost every bedroom has its bathroomthat allimportant adjunct in the eastattached to it the windows all open down to the ground and the servants generally come in and out through the veranda each window has its venetian blind which answers all purposes of a door and yet permits the air to pass freely  the veranda in addition to serving as the general sittingroom to the family acts as a servants hall here at the side not used by the employers the servants when not otherwise engaged sit on their mats mend their clothes talk and sleep and it is wonderful how much sleep a hindoo can get through in the twentyfour hours the veranda is his bedroom as well as sittingroom here spreading a mat upon the ground and rolling themselves up in a thin rug or blanket from the very top of their head to their feet the servants sleep looking like a number of mummies ranged against the wall out by the stables they have their quarters where they cook and eat and could if they chose sleep but they prefer the coolness and freshness of the veranda where too they are ready at hand whenever called the gardens were all pretty and well kept with broad shady trees and great shrubs covered by bright masses of flower for sandynugghur had been a station for many years and with plenty of water and a hot sun vegetation is very rapid  in two of the large reclining chairs two lads of fifteen and sixteen respectively were lolling idly they had been reading for books lay open in their laps and they were now engaged in eating bananas and in talking to two young ladies some three years their senior who were sitting working beside them  you boys will really make yourselves ill if you eat so many bananas  it is not that i care for them said the eldest lad they are tasteless things and a good apple is worth a hundred of them but one must do something and i am too lazy to go on with this hindoo grammar besides a fellow cant work when you girls come out here and talk to him  thats very good ned it is you that do all the talking besides you know that you ought to shut yourselves up in the study and not sit here where you are sure to be interrupted  i have done three hours steady work this morning with that wretched moonshi kate and three hours in this climate is as much as my brain will stand  kate warrener and her brothers ned and dick were the children of the major of the one hundred and fiftyfirst bengal native infantry the regiment stationed at sandynugghur rose hertford the other young lady was their cousin the three former were born in india but had each gone to england at the age of nine for their education and to save them from the effects of the climate which english children are seldom able to endure after that age their mother had sailed for england with dick the youngest but had died soon after she reached home dick had a passion for the sea and his fathers relations having good interest had obtained for him a berth as a midshipman in the royal navy in which rank he had been serving for upward of a year his ship being now in indian waters a months leave had been granted him that he might go up the country to see his father the other lad had arrived from england three months before with his sister and cousin major warrener had sent for his daughter whose education was finished to take the head of his house and as a companion had invited rose hertford who was the orphan child of his sister to accompany her ned who had been at westminster till he left england was intended for the indian army his father thought that it would be well for him to come out to india with his sister as he himself would work with him and complete his education to enable him to pass the necessary examinationthen not a very severe onewhile he could be at the same time learning the native languages which would be of immense benefit to him after he had entered the army coming out as they had done in the cold season none of the four exhibited any of that pallor and lassitude which at any rate during the summer heats are the rule throughout the angloindian community  as ned finished his sentence the sound of the tread of two horses was heard along the road  captains dunlop and manners dick exclaimed a shilling to a penny will either of you bet girls  neither his sister nor cousin replied to this offer and the boys gave a sly nod of intelligence to each other as two horsemen rode up to the veranda and dismounted throwing their reins to the syces who whatever the pace at which their masters ride run just behind in readiness to take the horses should they dismount  goodmorning miss warrener goodmorning miss hertford we have brought you some interesting news  indeed said the girls as they shook hands with the newcomers who were two as good specimens of tall wellmade sunburnt anglosaxons as one would wish to see what is it  we have just got the news that a family of wild boars have come down and are doing a lot of damage near meanwerrie four miles off i suppose they have been disturbed somewhere further away as we have not heard of any pig here for months so tomorrow morning there is going to be grand pig sticking of course you will come out and see the fun  we shall be delighted said kate but rose put in yes but oh how unfortunate its mrs briarleys garden party  that has been put off till next day it is not often we get a chance at pig and we have always got gardens the two need not have interfered with each other as we shall start at daylight for meanwerrie but we may be out some hours and so it was thought better to put off the party to a day when there will be nothing else to do  hurrah shouted dick i am in luck i wanted above all things to see a wild boar hunt do you think my father will let me have a spear  hardly dick considering that last time you went out you tumbled off three times at some jumps two feet wide and that were you to fall in front of a pig he would rip you up before you had time to think about it besides which you would almost certainly stick somebody with your spear  dick laughed  that was the first time i had ever been on a horse he said will you ride ned  no said ned i can ride fairly enough along a straight road but it wants a firstrate rider to go across country at a gallop looking at the boar instead of where you are going and carrying a spear in one hand  do you think papa will ride kate asked  i dont know miss warrener the major is a famous spear but here he is to speak for himself  major warrener was in uniform having just come up from the orderlyroom he was a tall soldierly figure inclining to stoutness his general expression was that of cheeriness and good temper but he was looking as he drove up grave and serious his brow cleared however as his eye fell upon the group in the veranda  ah dunlop brought the news about the boar eh  you will take us with you the girls asked in a breath  oh yes you shall go i will drive you myself i am getting too heavy for pigsticking especially with such responsibilities as you about there i will get out of this uniform its hot for the time of year what are you drinking nothing boy bring some soda and brandy  then producing his cigarcase he took a cheroot  aglow he shouted and a native servant ran up with a piece of redhot charcoal held in a little pair of tongs  there sit down and make yourselves comfortable till i come back  the lads finding that their society was not particularly required strolled off to the stables where ned entered into a conversation with the syces as to the distance to meanwerrie and the direction in which that village lay like all angloindian children brought up in india the boys had when they left india spoken the language fluently they had almost entirely forgotten it during their stay in england but it speedily came back again and ned at the end of three months work found that he could get on very fairly dick had lost it altogether  when they went back to the veranda they found that the girls had gone indoors and that their father was sitting and smoking with his brother officers when the lads came up the conversation ceased and then the major said  it is as well the boys should know what is going on  what is it father ned asked struck with the grave tone in which the major spoke and at the serious expression in all their faces  well boys for some months past there have been all sorts of curious rumors running through the country chupatties have been sent round and that is always considered to portend something serious  do you mean the chupatties we eatflat cakes father  yes ned nobody knows who sends them round or the exact meaning of the signal but it seems to be an equivalent for to prepare make ready chupatties are quickly prepared they are the bread eaten on a journey and hence probably their signification at any rate these things have been circulated among the native troops all over the country strangers are known to have come and gone and there is a general uneasy and unsettled feeling prevalent among the troops a ridiculous rumor has circulated among them that the new cartridges have been greased with pigs fat in order that the caste of all who put it to their lips might be destroyed today i have received news from calcutta that the nineteenth native regiment at berhampore has behaved in a grossly mutinous manner and that it is feared the regiments at barrackpore and dumdum will follow their example the affair has been suppressed but there is an uneasy feeling abroad and all the troops in bengal proper appear tainted with paltry disaffection we have no reason for believing that the spirit has spread to the northwest and are convinced that as far as our own regiment is concerned they can be relied on but the affair taken in connection with the previous rumors is very strange and i fear that there are lots of trouble ahead i wish now that i had not had the girls out for another year but i could not foresee this and indeed until this morning although there has been a good deal of talk we all hoped it would have passed off without anything coming of it one hopes still that it will spread no further but should it do so it is impossible to say what may happen all we have to do is to be watchful and to avoid with care anything that can offend the mens prejudices we must explain to the native officers the folly of the greased cartridge story and tell them to reassure the men you dont see anything else to do dunlop  no major i trust that the regiment is to be depended upon it has always been well treated and the men have seemed attached to us all we will do our best to reassure them but if there is any insubordination i hope that the colonel will give the men a lesson which will put an end to the nonsense in the bud  of course you will stay to tiffin the major said as the kitmagar or head servant announced that tiffin was ready  many thanks major but we promised to tiff with bullen and he would be mad if we did not turn up how are you thinking of going tomorrow i intend to drive over and send my horse on so i can give one of your boys a lift in my buggy  thank you the major said that would suit us exactly i shall drive in my dogcart which will carry four of us and if you will take dick that will make it all right  what time do we start  we are to be there by seven we set it so late to give the ladies time to breakfast comfortably before starting i will call here at halfpast six for dick it will be all in my way goodmorning  two minutes later the girls ned and dick came into the diningroom and the party sat down to luncheona meal always called tiffin in india it is a great mistake to suppose that people in india cannot eat because of the heat in the extreme heat of summer their appetites do no doubt fall off but at other times they not only eat but eat more largely than is good for them and a good deal of the liver complaint which is the pest of india is in no small degree due to the fact that the appetite being unnaturally stimulated by hot and piquant food people eat more than in such a climate as this can be properly digested the meal consisted of curries with which were handed round chutney and bombay ducksa little fish about the size of a smelt cut open dried and smoked with assafoetida giving it an intolerably nasty taste to strangers but one which angloindians become accustomed to and likeno one knows why they are called bombay duckscutlets plantains sliced and fried pomegranates and watermelons they were waited upon by two servants both dressed entirely in white but wearing red turbans very broad and shallow these turbans denoted the particular tribe and sect to which their wearers belonged the castes in india are almost innumerable and each has a turban of a peculiar color or shape and by these they can be at once distinguished by a resident on their foreheads were lines and spots of a yellowish white paint indicating also their caste and the peculiar divinity to whose worship they were specially devoted on their feet they wore slippers and were as noiseless as cats in all their movements there are no better or more pleasant waiters in the world than the natives of hindostan  early as the hour named for the start would appear in england it was by no means early for india where every one is up and about soon after daylightthe morning hours up to eight oclock being the most pleasant of the whole day  kate and rose were up and all had had chota hazaree little breakfast by halfpast six and were ready when captain dunlop drew up in his buggya conveyance which will only hold two the dogcart was already at the door and the whole party were soon in motion on the road they passed several of their friends for every one was going out to the hunt and merry greetings were exchanged  the scenery round sandynugghur resembles that which is common to all the great plains of india watered by the ganges and jumna the country is for the most part perfectly flat and cut up into little fields divided by shallow ditches here and there nullahs or deep watercourses with tortuous channels and perpendicular sides wind through the fields to the nearest stream these nullahs constitute the great danger of hunting in the country in the fields men may be noticed in the scantiest of attire working with hoes among their springing crops women wrapped up in the dark blue calico cloth which forms their ordinary costume are working as hard as the men villages are scattered about generally close to groves of trees the huts are built of mud most of them are flattopped but some are thatched with rushes rising above the villages is the mosque where the population are mohammedan built of mud like the houses but whitewashed and bright the hindoo villages generally but not always have their temples the vegetation of the great plains of india is not tropical according to the ideas of tropical vegetation gathered from british hothouses there are a few palms and many bananas with their wide leaves but the groves are composed of sturdy trees whose appearance at a distance differs in no way from that of ordinary english forest trees viewed closer the banian with its many stems is indeed a vegetable wonder but were it not for the villages and natives a traveler might journey for very many miles across the plains of india without seeing anything which would specially remind him that he was out of england  there were a considerable number of traps assembled when major warrener drew up and some eight or ten gentlemen on horseback each carrying a boarspeara weapon not unlike the lance of an english cavalryman but shorter in the handle the riders were mostly dressed in coats of the norfolk jacket type and kneebreeches with thick gaiters the material of their clothes was a coarse but very strong cloth of native make gray or brown in color some wore round hats and forage caps with puggarees twisted round them  a chorus of greeting saluted the party as they drove up  well young ladies the colonel said so you have come out to see the death of the boar    the boar the boar the mighty boar  as the song says so you are not going to take a spear today major think its time to leave it to the youngsters eh  where are the wild boars mrs renwick kate asked of the colonels wife  pig my dear we always call them pig when we speak of them together though we talk of the father of the family as the boar do you see that clump of long grass and jungle right across the plain thats where they are they have been watched all night they went out to feed before daybreak and have just gone back again do you think we are in the best place for seeing the sport major warrener  i think mrs renwick that if you leave your trap and go up to the top of that knoll two hundred yards to the right you will get a really good view of the plain  mrs renwick alighted from the dogcart in which the colonel had driven her and the whole party following her example walked in a laughing group to the spot which major warrener had indicated and which was pronounced as just the place the syces stood at the heads of the horses and those who were going to take part in the sport cantered off toward the spot where the pigs were lurking making however a wide détour so as to approach it from the other side as it was desired to drive them across the plain at some distance behind the clump were stationed a number of natives with a variety of mongrel village curs when they saw the horsemen approach they came up and prepared to enter the jungle to drive out the pigs  the horsemen took up their position on either side of the patch in readiness to start as soon as the animals were fairly off a number of villagers in whose fields of young rice the family had done much damage during the few days that they had taken up their abode in their present quarters were assembled on such little rises of ground as were likely to give a good view of the proceedings there were about a dozen horsemen with spears of these three or four were novices and these intended to try their skill for the first time upon the squeakers as the young pigs are called while the others prepared for a race after the old ones  great nerve considerable skill and firstrate horsemanship are required for the sport of pigsticking the horse too must be fast steady well trained and quick for without all these advantages the sport is a dangerous one the wild boar is at the start as fast as a horse he is very quick at turning and when pressed always attacks his pursuers and as he rushes past will lay open the leg or flank of a horse with a sweeping cut with his sharp tusk if he can knock a horse down the position of his rider would be serious indeed were not help to arrive in time to draw off the attention of the enraged animal from his foe heavy falls too take place over watercourses and nullahs and in some parts of india the difficulties are greatly increased by bowlders of all kinds being scattered over the ground and by the frequent occurrence of bushes and shrubs armed with most formidable spines and thorns conspicuous among these is the bush known as the waitabit thorn which is furnished with two kinds of thornthe one long stiff and penetrating the other short and curved with a forked point almost like a fishhook when this once takes hold it is almost necessary to cut the cloth to obtain a release  scarcely had the beaters with much shouting and clamor entered the patch of bush in which the pigs were lying than the porcine family consisting of a splendid boar and sow and eight nearly fullgrown squeakers darted out on the open and in a moment the horsemen were off in pursuit the ground was deep and heavy and the pigs at the first burst gained fast upon their pursuers there was no attempt on the part of the pigs to keep together and directly after starting they began to diverge the old boar and sow both kept across the plainone bearing toward the left the other to the right the squeakers ran in all directionssome at right angles to the line that the old ones were taking the object of one and all was to gain cover of some kind  with their hats pressed well down upon their heads and their spears advanced with the head some two or three feet from the ground the hunters started after themsome making after the boar some after the sow according to the position which they occupied at the commencement of the chase while some of the young hands dashed off in pursuit of the squeakers  there were five however after the boar captain dunlop a young ensign named skinner the scotch doctor of the regiment and two civilians for a short time they kept together and then captain dunlop and skinner began to draw ahead of the others  the boar was a stanch one and a mile had been passed before his speed began sensibly to diminish the young ensign who was mounted on a very fast arab began to draw up to him three or four lengths ahead of captain dunlop bearing his horse so as to get upon the left side of the boar in order to permit him to use his spear to advantage  he was nearly up to him when captain dunlop who saw the boar glancing back savagely cried  look out skinner he will be round in a moment keep your horse well in hand  a moment later the boar was round the horse young and unbroken at the work started violently swerved and before his rider could get him round the boar was upon him in an instant the horse was upon the ground with a long gash upon his flank and skinner flying through the air fell almost directly in the boars way  fortunately for the young ensign captain dunlop as he shouted his warning had turned his horse to the left so as to cut off the boar when he turned and he was now so close that the boar in passing had only time to give a vicious blow at the fallen man which laid his arm open from his shoulder to his elbow  at that instant captain dunlop arrived and his spear pierced the animals flank his aim was however disconcerted by his horse at the moment he struck leaping over the fallen ensign the wound therefore was but a glancing one and in a moment the boar was round upon his new assailant fortunately the horse was a welltrained one and needed not the sharp touch of his masters rein to wheel sharp round on his hind legs and dart off at full speed the boar swerved off again and continued his original line of flight his object being to gain a thick patch of jungle now little over a quarter of a mile distant the detention however was fatal to him for the doctor who was close on captain dunlops heels now brought up his horse with a rush and with a wellaimed thrust ran the animal through completely pinning him to the earth the honor of his death was therefore divided between the doctor and captain dunlop for the latter had drawn first blood or as it is termed had taken first spear while the former had scored the kill  the sow had been more fortunate than her lord she had taken a line across a part of the plain which was intersected by several nullahs she too had been wounded but one of the nullahs had thrown out several of her pursuers one rider had been sent over his horses head and stunned and the sow turning sharp down a deep and precipitous gully had made her escape three of the squeakers fell to the spears of the griffsyoung handsand the rest had escaped the boar had been killed only a short distance from the rise upon which the spectators from sandynugghur were assembled and the beaters soon tied its four legs together and putting a pole through them six of them carried the beast up to the colonels wife for inspection  what a savagelooking brute it is said kate not a bit like a pig with all those long bristles and that sharp high back and those tremendous tusks  will you accept the skin miss warrener captain dunlop said to her afterward i have arranged with the doctor he is to have the hams and i am to have the hide if you will i will have it dressed and mounted  thank you captain dunlop i should like it very much but as it turned out kate warrener never got the skin  the boar killed the doctors first care was to attend to the wounded and skinners arm was soon bound up and he was sent home in a buggy the man who was stunned came to in a short time the unsuccessful ones were much laughed at by the colonel and major for allowing half the game started to get away  you ought not to grumble colonel captain manners said if we had killed them all we might not have had another run for months as it is we will have some more sport next week  there was some consultation as to the chance of getting the sow even now but it was generally agreed that she would follow the nullah down cross the stream and get into a large canebrake beyond from which it would take hours to dislodge her so a general move was made to the carriages and in a short time the whole party were on their way back to sandynugghur     chapter ii  the outbreak   a week after the boarhunt came the news that a sepoy named mangul pandy belonging to the thirtyfourth native infantry stationed at barrackpore a place only a few miles out of calcutta had on the 29th of march rushed out upon the parade ground and called upon the men to mutiny he then shot the european sergeantmajor of the regiment and cut down an officer pandy continued to exhort the men to rise to arms and although his comrades would not join him they refused to make any movement to arrest him general hearsey now arrived on the parade ground with his son and a major ross and at once rode at the man who finding that his comrades would not assist him discharged the contents of the musket into his own body  two days later the mutinous nineteenth were disbanded at barrackpore on the 3rd of april mangul pandy who had only wounded himself was hung and the same doom was allotted to a native officer of his regiment for refusing to order the men to assist the officer attacked by that mutineer and for himself inciting the men to rise against the government  what do you think of the news papa dick asked his father  i hope that the example which has been set by the execution of these ringleaders and by the disbandment of the nineteenth may have a wholesome effect dick but we shall see before long  it needed no great lapse of time to show that this lesson had been ineffectual from nearly every station throughout bengal and the northwest provinces came rumors of disaffection at agra at umballah and at other places incendiary fires broke out with alarming frequency letters were from time to time intercepted calling upon the sepoys to revolt while at lucknow serious disturbances occurred and the seventh regiment were disarmed by sir henry lawrence the commissioner of oude so the month of april passed and as it went on the feeling of disquiet and danger grew deeper and more general it was like the anxious time preceding a thunderstorm the cloud was gathering but how or when it would burst none could say many still maintained stoutly that there was no danger whatever and that the whole thing would blow over but men with wives and families were generally inclined to take a more somber view of the case nor is this to be wondered at the british form an almost inappreciable portion of the population of india they are isolated in a throng of natives outnumbered by a thousand to one a man might therefore well feel his helplessness to render any assistance to those dear to him in the event of a general uprising of the people soldiers without family ties take things lightly they are ready for danger and for death if needs be but they can always hope to get through somehow but the man with a wife and children in india at the time when a general outbreak was anticipated would have the deepest cause for anxiety not however that at this time any one at sandynugghur looked for anything so terrible there was a spirit of insubordination abroad in the native troops no doubt but no one doubted but that it would with more or less trouble be put down and so things went on as usual and the garden parties and the drives and the friendly evening visiting continued just as before it was at one of these pleasant evening gatherings that the first blow fell most of the officers of the station their wives and the two or three civilians were collected at major warreners the windows were all open the girls were playing a duet on the piano five or six other ladies were in the drawingroom and about the same number of gentlemen were standing or sitting by them some four or five were lounging in the veranda enjoying their cheroots native servants in their white dresses moved noiselessly about with iced lemonade and wine when a sepoy came up the walk  what is it asked major warrener who was one of the group in the veranda  dispatch for the colonel sahib  the colonel who was sitting next to the major held out his hand for the message and was rising when major warrener said  dont move colonel boy bring a candle  the servant brought it the colonel opened the envelope and glanced at the dispatch he uttered an exclamation which was half a groan half a cry  good heaven what is the matter colonel  the native troops at meerut have mutinied have murdered their officers and all the european men women and children they could find and are marching upon delhi look after your regiment  a low cry broke from the major this was indeed awful news and for a moment the two men sat halfstunned at the calamity while the sound of music and merry talk came in through the open window like a mockery on their ears  let us take a turn in the compound said the major where no one can hear us  for half an hour they walked up and down the garden there could be no doubt about the truth of the news for it was an official telegram from the adjutant at meerut and as to the extent of the misfortune it was terrible  there is not a single white regiment at delhi exclaimed the colonel these fiends will have it all their own way and at delhi there are scores of european families delhi once in their hands will be a center and the mutiny will spread like wildfire over india what was the general at meerut about what were the white troops up to it is as inexplicable as it is terrible is there anything to be done major do you think but major warrener could think of nothing the men at present knew nothing of the news but the tidings would reach them in two or three days for news in india spreads from village to village and town to town with almost incredible speed and meerut was but a hundred and fifty miles distant  had we better tell them inside the major asked  no answered the colonel let them be happy for tonight they will know the news tomorrow as they are breaking up ask all the officers to come round to the messroom i will meet them there and we can talk the matter over but let the ladies have one more quiet night they will want all their strength and fortitude for what is to come  and so clearing their brows they went into the house and listened to the music and joined in the talk until ten oclock struck and every one got up to go and so ended the last happy evening at sandynugghur  the next morning brought the news of the rising at delhi but it was not till two days later that letters giving any details of these terrible events arrived and the full extent of the awful calamity was known  the flame broke out at meerut at seven oclock in the evening of sunday the 10th of may on the previous day a punishment parade had been held to witness the military degradation of a number of men of the third native cavalry who had been guilty of mutinous conduct in respect to the cartridges the native regiments at the station consisted of the third cavalry the eleventh and twentieth infantry there were also in garrison the sixtieth rifles the sixth dragoon guards and two batteries of artillery a force amply sufficient if properly handled to have crushed the native troops and to have nipped the mutiny in the bud unhappily they were not well handled the cantonments of meerut were of great extent being nearly five miles in length by two in breadth the barracks of the british troops were situated at some distance from those of the native regiments and the action of the troops was paralyzed by the incompetency of the general an old man who had lost all energy and who remained in a state of indecision while the men of the native regiments shot their officers murdered all the women and children and the white inhabitants whose bungalows were situated at their end of their cantonment opened the jail doors and after setting fire to the whole of this quarter of meerut marched off toward delhi unmolested by the british troops even then an orderly sent off with dispatches to the officer commanding at delhi informing him of what had happened and bidding him beware might have saved the lives of hundreds of englishmen and women even if it were too late to save delhi but nothing whatever was done the english troops made a few meaningless and uncertain movements and marched back to their barracks no one came forward to take the lead so the white troops of meerut remained stationary under arms all night and the english population of delhi were left to their fate  from meerut to delhi is thirtytwo miles and the mutineers of meerut marching all night arrived near the town at eight in the morning singularly enough the ancient capital of india the place around which the aspiration of hindoos and mohammedans alike centered and where the exemperor and his family still resided was left entirely to the guard of native troops not a single british regiment was there not a battery of white troops as the center of the province a large white population were gathered therethe families of the officers of the native infantry and artillery of the civil officers of the province merchants bankers missionaries and others as at all other indian towns the great bulk of the white inhabitants lived in the cantonments outside the town had it not been for this not one would have escaped the slaughter that commenced as soon as the third cavalry from meerut rode into the town the fifty fourth native infantry who had hastily been marched out to meet them fraternized with them at once and standing quietly by looked on while their officers were murdered by the cavalrymen then commenced a scene of murder and atrocity which is happily without parallel in history suffice to say that with the exception of some halfdozen who in one way or other managed to escape the whole of the white population inside the walls of delhi were murdered under circumstances of the most horrible and revolting cruelty had the news of the outbreak of meerut been sent by a swift mounted messenger the whole of these hapless people would have had time to leave the town before the arrival of the mutineers those in the cantonments outside the city fared somewhat better some were killed but the greater part made their escape and although many were murdered on the way either by villagers or by bodies of mutineers the majority reached meerut or aliwal the sufferers of delhi did not die wholly unavenged inside the city walls was an immense magazine containing vast stores of powder cartridges and arms it was allimportant that this should not fall into the hands of the mutineers this was in charge of lieutenant willoughby of the royal artillery who had with him lieutenants forrest and rayner and six english warrant and noncommissioned officers buckley shaw scully crow edwards and stewart the following account was given by lieutenant forrest  the gates of the magazine were closed and barricaded and every possible arrangement that could be made was at once commenced inside the gate leading to the park were placed two sixpounders doubly charged with grape these were under acting subconductor crow and sergeant stewart with lighted matches in their hands their orders were that if any attempt was made to force the gate the guns were to be fired at once and they were to fall back to that part of the magazine where lieutenant willoughby and i were posted the principal gate of the magazine was similarly defended by two guns and by the chevauxdefrise laid down in the inside for the further defense of this gate and the magazine in its vicinity there were two sixpounders so placed as to command it and a small bastion close by within sixty yards of the gate and commanding two cross roads were three sixpounders and one twentyfour pound howitzer which could be so managed as to act upon any part of the magazine in that neighborhood after all these guns and howitzers had been placed in the several positions above named they were loaded with a double charge of grape after these arrangements had been completed a train was laid ready to be fired at a preconcerted signal on the enemy approaching the walls of the magazine which was provided with scaling ladders the native establishment at once deserted us by climbing up the sloped sheds on the inside of the magazine and descending the ladders on the outside  when the attack began the mutineers climbed the walls in great numbers and opened fire upon the little garrison these replied by an incessant fire of grapeshot which told severely upon the enemy there were but two men to each gun but they stood nobly to their pieces until all were more or less wounded by the enemys fire finding that no more could be done lieutenant willoughby gave the order conductor scully fired the several trains and in another instant a tremendous explosion took place which shook all delhi and covered the city with a cloud of black smoke it was calculated that from fifteen hundred to two thousand of the mutineers and rabble of the town were killed by the falling walls or crushed under the masses of masonry lieutenants willoughby forrest rayner and conductor buckley survived the explosion and effected their retreat in the confusion through a small sallyport on the river face the mutineers were so enraged by their misfortune that they rushed to the palace and demanded of the king a number of european officers and ladies who had sought refuge under his protection they were handed over to the mutineers and at once slaughtered  the warreners listened with pale faces as their father on his return from the orderlyroom where the news had been discussed told them the sad story  there is nothing to be done i suppose papa ned said gently  no my boy we are in the hands of god we must wait now for what may come at present the regiment professes its fidelity and has now volunteered to march against the mutineers the colonel believes them so do some of the others i do not it may be that the men mean what they say at present but we know that emissaries come and go and every fresh rising will be an incentive to them it is no use blinking the truth dear we are like men standing on a loaded mine which may at any moment explode i have been thinking indeed for the last week i have done nothing but think what is best to be done if the mutiny breaks out at night or at any time when we are not on parade we have agreed that all the whites shall make at once for mr thompsons house it is the strongest of any of the residencesfor there would of course be no getting to the messhouseand then we will sell our lives as dearly as we may if it happens when we are on parade defense by the rest of the residents would be useless there are but six civilians with you two boysfor we have counted youeight probably but few of you could gain thompsons house in time and if all did your number would be too small to defend it there remains then nothing but flight the rising will most likely take place on parade the residents have agreed that each day they will on some excuses or other have their traps at their door at that hour so that at the sound of the first shot fired they may jump in and drive off  but you papa kate asked  my dear said her father i shall be on duty so long as a vestige of the regiment remains as a regiment i shall be with it if the whole regiment breaks up and attacks us those who do not fall at the first volley will be justified in trying to save their lives the colonel the adjutant and myself are mounted officers and two or three of the others will have their dogcarts each day brought up to the messhouse as they often do if there is a mutiny on parade the unmounted officers will make for them and we who are mounted will as far as possible cover their retreat so it is arranged  but will the road be open to meerut uncle rose asked after a pause for the danger seemed so strange and terrible that they felt stunned by it  no my dear it certainly will not there are three garrison towns between us and they also will probably be up the only thing is to keep to the road for the first ten or twelve miles and then take to the woods and make your way on foot i have spoken to saba this morning we can trust her she nursed you all and has lived with me ever since as a sort of pensioner till you came out i have asked her to get two dresses of mussulman country women in those only the eyes are visible while the hindoo dress gives no concealment i have also ordered her to get me two dresses one such as a young mussulman zemindar wears the other as his retainer they are for you boys keep the bundles when you get them in that closet in the diningroom so as to be close at hand and in case of alarm be sure and take them with you remember my instructions are absolute if by day escape in the trap at the first alarm if the trap is not available escape at once on foot if you hear the enemy are close hide till nightfall in that thick clump of bushes in the corner of the compound then make for that copse of trees and try and find your way to meerut i trust i may be with you or that i may join you on the road but in any case it will relieve my anxiety greatly to know that your course is laid down if i had to return here to look for you i should bring my pursuers after me and your chance of escape would be gonefor i rely upon you all to follow my instructions to the letter  yes indeed papa was the unanimous answer of the young warreners who were deeply affected at the solemn manner in which their father spoke of the situation  i have a brace of revolvers upstairs he said and will give one to each of you boys carry them always but put them on under your coats so that they may not be noticed it would be as well for you to practice yourselves in their use but when you do so always go some distance from the station so that the sound will not be heard  can you give rose and me a pistol each too papa kate said quietly  major warrener kissed his daughter and niece tenderly  i have a pair of small doublebarreled pistols you shall each have one he answered with a deep sigh  that afternoon the young warreners and their cousin went out for a walk and fixing a piece of paper against a tree practiced pistol shooting for an hour any passerby ignorant of the circumstances would have wondered at the countenances of these young people engaged apparently in the amusement of pistol practice there was no smile on them no merry laugh when the ball went wide of the mark no triumphant shout at a successful shot their faces were set pale and earnest scarcely a word was spoken each loaded in silence took up a place at the firing point and aimed steadily and seriously the boys with an angry eye and frowning brow as if each time they were firing at a deadly foe the girls as earnestly and without any of the nervousness or timidity which would be natural in girls handling firearms for the first time each day the exercise was repeated and after a weeks practice all could hit with a fair amount of certainty a piece of paper six inches square at a distance of ten yards  during this time captains dunlop and manners spent their whole time when not engaged upon their military duties at major warreners they were now the recognized lovers of kate and rose and although in those days of tremendous anxiety and peril no formal engagements were entered upon the young people understood each other and major warrener gave his tacit approval very earnestly all the party hoped that when the dread moment came it might come when they were all together so that they might share the same fate whatever it might be the young officers buggies now stood all day in major warreners compound with the patient syces squatting near or talking with the servants while the majors horses stood ready saddled in the stables  however much the party might hope to be together when the crisis came they felt that it was improbable that they would be so for at the first symptoms of mutiny it would be the duty of the officers to hasten to the barracks to endeavor to quell it even if certain death should meet them there  in the face of the tidings from meerut and delhi all the pretense of confidence which had hitherto been kept up at the station came to an end and even had there been implicit confidence in the regiment the news of such terrible events would have caused an entire cessation of the little amusements and gatherings in which sandynugghur had previously indulged  as is usual in cases of extreme danger the various temperaments of people come strongly into relief at these awful times the pretty young wife of the doctor was nearly wild with alarm not daring to remain at home alone she passed the day in going from house to house of her female friends advice and example she obtained from these but poor comfort the colonels wife was as brave as any man in the station she hardly shared her husbands opinion that the regiment would remain faithful in the midst of an almost general defection but she was calm selfpossessed and ready for the worst  it is no use crying my dear she said to the doctors wife our husbands have enough to worry them without being shaken by our tears death after all can only come once and it is better to die with those we love than to be separated  but there were not many tears shed in sandynugghur the women were pale and quiet they shook hands with a pressure which meant much lips quivered and tears might drop when they spoke of children at home but this was not often and day after day they bore the terrible strain with that heroic fortitude which characterized english women in india during the awful period of the mutiny ten days after the news came in of the rising at delhi major warrener told his family on his return from parade that the regiment had again declared its fidelity and had offered to march against the mutineers  i am glad of it he said because it looks as if at present at least they have not made up their minds to mutiny and i shall be able to go to mess with a lighter heart as i told you yesterday it is the colonels birthday so we all dine at mess  in the meantime saba had faithfully carried out her commission as to the dresses and had added to the bundles a bottle containing a brown juice which she had extracted from some berries this was to be used for staining the skin and so completing the disguise the warreners knew that if their old nurse had any information as to any intended outbreak she would let them know but she heard nothing she was known to be so strongly attached to the majors family that had the other servants known anything of it they would have kept it from her  the hour for the messdinner was eight and the young warreners had finished their evening meal before their father started  god bless you my children and watch over and protect us all till we meet again such was the solemn leavetaking with which the major and his children had partedif only for half an hoursince the evil days began  for an hour and a half the young warreners and their cousin sat and read and occasionally talked  its time for tea kate said looking at her watch and she struck a bell upon the table  usually the response was almost instantaneous but kate waited two minutes and then rang sharply twice there was still no reply  he must be asleep she said or out of hearing but it is curious that none of the others answer  dick went out into the veranda but came in again in a minute or two  there is no one there kate and i dont hear any of them about anywhere  the four young people looked at each other what did this mean had the servants left in a body did they know that something was going to happen such were the mute questions which their looks asked each other  girls said ned put your dark shawls round you it may be nothing but it is better to be prepared get the bundles out dick put a bottle of wine in your pocket and let us all fill our pockets with biscuits  silently and quietly the others did as he told them  there is that great biscuittin full ned said when they had filled their pockets let us empty it into that cloth and tie it up now if you will put your shawls on i will look in at the stables  in a couple of minutes he returned  the horses are all unharnessed he said and not a soul is to be seen ah is that saba  the old nurse had been found asleep in her favorite place outside the door of her young mistresses room  do you know what is the matter saba all the servants are gone  the old nurse shook her head bad news no tell saba  now saba get ready to start for the nurse had declared that she would accompany them to go into the villages to buy food dick come with me we will put one of the horses into the dogcart  they were leaving the room when they heard the sound of a rifle as if it were the signal in a moment the air rang with rifle shots shouts and yells the boys leaped back into the room and caught up the bundles  quick for your lives girls some of them are not fifty yards off to the bushes come saba  saba do more good here the old nurse said and seated herself quietly in the veranda  it was but twenty yards to the bushes they had marked as the place of concealment and as they entered and crouched down there came the sound of hurrying feet and a band of sepoys led by one of the jemadars or native officers rushed up to the veranda from the back  now the jemadar shouted search the house kill the boys but keep the white women they are too pretty to hurt  two minutes searchin which furniture was upset curtains pulled down and chests ransackedand a shout of rage proclaimed that the house was empty  the jemadar shouted to his men search the compound they cant be far off some of you run out to the plain they cant have got a hundred yards away besides our guards out there will catch them  the old nurse rose to her feet just as the sepoys were rushing out on the search  it is of no use searching she said they have been gone an hour  gone an hour shouted the enraged jemadar who told them of the attack  i told them saba said steadily saba was true to her salt  there was a yell of rage on the part of the mutineers and half a dozen bayonets darted into the faithful old servants body and without a word she fell dead on the veranda a victim to her noble fidelity to the children she had nursed  now the jemadar said strip the place carry everything off it is all to be divided tomorrow and then we will have a blaze  five minutes sufficed to carry off all the portable articles from the bungalow the furniture as useless to the sepoys was left but everything else was soon cleared away and then the house was lit in half a dozen places the fire ran quickly up the muslin curtains caught the dry reeds of the tatties ran up the bamboos which formed the top of the veranda and in five minutes the house was a sheet of flame     chapter iii  the flight   the young warreners and their cousin hurrying on soon gained the thick bush toward which they were directing their steps as they cowered down in its shelter the girls pulled their shawls over their heads and with their hands to their ears to keep out the noise of the awful din around them they awaited in shuddering horror their fate the boys sat revolver in hand determined to sell their lives dearly ned translated the jemadars speech and at his order to search the compound both felt that all was over and with a grasp of each others hand prepared to sally forth and die then came sabas act of noble selfsacrifice and the boys had difficulty in restraining themselves from rushing out to avenge her  in the meantime the night was hideous with noises musket shots the sharp cracks of revolvers shouts cries and at times the long shrill screams of women it was too much to be borne and feeling that for the present sabas act had saved them the boys laying down their weapons pressed their hands to their ears to keep out the din there they sat for half an hour stunned by the awful calamity too horrorstricken at what had passed and at the probable fate of their father to find relief in tears  at the end of that time the fire had burned itself out and a few upright posts still flickering with tongues of fire and a heap of glowing embers marked where the pretty bungalow replete with every luxury and comfort had stood an hour before  dick was the first to move he touched neds arm  all is quiet here now but they may take it into their heads to come back and search we had better make for the trees by keeping close to that cactus hedge we shall be in shadow all the way  the girls were roused from their stupor of grief  now dears we must be brave said ned and carry out our orders god has protected us thus far let us pray that he will continue to do so  in another five minutes the little party stealing cautiously out from their shelter kept along close to the wall to a side door through which they issued forth into the open ten steps took them to the cactus hedge and stooping low under its shelter they moved on till they safely reached the clump of trees  for some time the little party crouched among the thick bushes the silence broken only by the sobs of the girls ned and richard said nothing but the tears fell fast down their cheeks the crackling of the flames of many of the burning bungalows could be distinctly heard and outside the shadow of the trees it was nearly as light as day yells of triumph rose on the night air but there was no firing or sounds of conflict and resistance was plainly over for a quarter of an hour they sat there crushed with the immensity of the calamity then ned roused himself and took the lead  now dears the fires have burned down and we must be moving for we should be far away from here before morning no doubt others have hidden in the woods round this place and those black fiends will be searching everywhere tomorrow remember what our orders are and he paused for a moment to choke down the sob which would come when he thought of who had given the order and how it was given we were to make for meerut be strong and brave girls as father would have had you i have gone over the course on the district map and i think i can keep pretty straight for it we need not change our clothes now we can do that when we halt before daylight we must walk all night to be as far as possible away before the search begins we know this country pretty well for some miles round which will make it easier come girls take heart it is possible yet that some of the officers have cut their way out and our father may be among them who can say  i knew that he had talked over with dunlop and manners the very best course to take whenever they might be attacked dick said in a more cheerful tone so they were sure to keep together and if any one has got away they would neither of the boys had at heart the least hope but they spoke as cheerfully as they could to give strength and courage to the girls their words had their effect kate rose and taking her cousins arm said  come rose the boys are right there is still some hope let us cling to it as long as we can now let us be moving but before we go let us all thank god for having saved us from harm so far and let us pray for his protection and help upon the road  silently the little group knelt in prayer and when they rose followed nedwho had naturally assumed the position of leaderout into the open country beyond the grove without a word being spoken the moon was as yet quite young a favorable state for the fugitives as it afforded light enough to see where they were going without giving so bright a light as to betray them to any one at a distance  the moon will be down in a couple of hours ned said but by that time we shall be beyond where any sentries are likely to have been placed on the road so we can then trust ourselves on that till it begins to get daylight we must keep in the fields till we are past nussara which is five miles by the road then we can walk straight on there is a nullah a few yards on we had better keep in that for a quarter of a mile it does not go quite the way we want but it will be safer to follow it till we are well out of sight of any one who may be watching the plain  they scrambled down into the bed of the nullah then kate said walk on as fast as you can ned we can keep up with you and if we hurry on we shant be able to think  all right ned answered i will go fast for a bit but you must not knock yourselves up we have a long journey before us  walking fast however was impossible at the bottom of the nullah for it was pitch dark between its steep banks and there were bowlders and stones lying here and there after half an hours walking ned scrambled up and looked back  it is quite safe now he said let us make as straight as we can for nussara  kate warrener and rose hertford have never been able to recall any incidents of that nights walk mechanically as in a dreadful dream they followed neds guidance stumbling across little watercourses tramping through marshy ricefields climbing into and out of deep nullahs now pausing to listen to the barking of a village dog now making their way through a thick clump of trees and at last tramping for hoursthat seemed agesalong the dead flat of the highroad this at the first faint dawn of morning they left and took refuge in a thick grove a quarter of a mile from the highway before throwing themselves down to rest the girls at neds earnest request tried to eat a piece of biscuit but tried in vain they however each sipped a little wine from the bottles and then utterly worn out and exhausted soon forgot their misery in a deep and heavy sleep  the sun was upon the point of setting when their companions aroused them and they woke up to their sorrows and dangers the day had passed quietly the boys after both sleeping for some four or five hours had watched by turns no one had approached the wood but a party of four sepoys mounted on horses had passed from sandynugghur and a larger party had later in the afternoon come along in the other direction from this the boys guessed that a successful revolt had also taken place at nalgwa the next station to sandynugghur  now girls the first thing to do is to eat here are biscuits for some days and the two bottles of wine which we must be sparing of dick and i have eaten lots of biscuits and have had some water from a well at a little distance behind the wood there was a large gourd lying by it which we have taken the liberty of borrowing you can drink some water if you like but you must each take a glass of wine you must keep up your strength there is no one in sight so if you like you can go to the well and have a wash dont be longer than you can help it would be ruin to be seen before we have changed our clothes while you are away washing dick and i will put on our dresses and when you come back you can do the same we can stain our faces and hands afterward  the girls chose to have their wash first and their meal afterward and felt refreshed and brighter after they had done so then they dressed in the clothes saba had provided for them and could at any other time have laughed at the comicality of their aspect muffled up in white with only their eyes visible the awkward shoes were the only part of the costume to which they objected but the sight of european boots below the native dress would have betrayed them instantly however they determined to adopt them for walking in at nights or when crossing the fields and to put the native shoes in a bundle to be worn in public  the boys presently joined them ned in the dress of a young mussulman zemindar dick as his follower  i should not have known you in the least rose said as far as appearances go i think we are all safe now  when it was quite dark they again started regained the road and kept steadily along it after two hours walking they approached a village after some consultation it was decided that dick whose dress was the darkest and least noticeable should steal forward and reconnoiter if every one was indoors they would push boldly through if not they would make a circuit round it in ten minutes he returned  ned there are two troopers horses standing before the largest house of the place i suppose they belong to some of the men of the cavalry regiment at nalgwa if we could but steal them  splendid dick why should we not i can get on one you on the other one of the girls can sit behind each of us with her arms round our waists what do you say girls with our dress it would be natural for us to be on horseback and no one would ask any questions we are pretty safe because if they come out there are but two of them and we are more than a match for them with our pistols  it seems a terrible risk to run ned but i do think it would be our best plan what do you say rose  i think we had better try kate  now let us settle everything before we start said ned we must mount first i think that we may be able to help you more easily and you would have less risk of falling off if you get up in front of us we can change when we have gone half a mile will you stand close to dick kate when he mounts rose you keep close to me the moment we are fairly in the saddle and have got the reins in our hands you put your foot on mine and take hold of my hand and climb up in the saddle in front of me put your arms round our necks and hold us because we shall want one hand for the reins the other for a pistol  let us cut a stick ned to give them a lick and make them start at a gallop  very gently and with bated breath they stole up the village the horses were still standing with their reins thrown over a hook in the wall very quietly the boys unhooked the reins but the horses moved uneasily and objected to their mounting them for horses accustomed to natives dislike to be touched by europeans however the boys had just managed to climb into their seats when a shutter of the house opened and a voice said in hindostanee what is fidgeting the horses then a head looked out  some one is stealing the horses he shouted  quick girls up with you ned said and the girls as light as feathers sprang up go along the boys cried bringing down their sticks on the animals sides dicks at once leaped forward but neds horse only backed ned gave his stick to rose and seized his pistol which was cocked and ready for use as he did so a native trooper rushed from the house as he came out ned fired and the man fell forward on his face  startled by the shot the horse darted off after his companion for a few minutes they went forward at a gallop the boys holding on as well as they could but expecting every moment to be thrown off for awhile shouts and cries were heard from the village and then all was quiet again the two boys reined in their horses  that was awful dick said i would rather sit on the yardarm in a storm than ride on that beast any further at the pace we have been going  the girls had not spoken a word since they started and they now slipped to the ground it was not an easy thing for them to get up behind and several slips were made before their attempts were successful once seated they were more comfortable and they again went on this time at an easy canter after half an hours ride they came to a crossroad and turned up there going now at a walk after awhile they took a wellmarked path running in a parallel direction to the road this they followed for some time passing fearlessly through one or two small villages  then feeling by the flagging walk of their horses that they were becoming fatigued they plunged deep into a thick wood dismounted and prepared for the night attached to the saddle of each horse was a nosebag with some forage these were put on the horses fastened up and the little party were soon asleep again  before starting next morning the first care of the boys was to take off the embroidery of the horsecloths and as much of the metal work on the bridles as could be possibly dispensed with in order to conceal the fact that the horses had belonged to a british cavalry regiment then they mounted with the girls behind them and rode quietly forward taking care not to travel by the main road as the news of the carrying off the horses would have been generally known there  they passed through several villages attracting but little attention as they did so for there was now nothing unusual in the appearance of a mohammedan zemindar and follower riding with two closelyveiled women en croupe late in the afternoon they stopped at a village store and ned purchased without exciting any apparent suspicion some grain for the horses that night they slept as usual in a wood and congratulated themselves on having made fully twentyfive miles of their journey toward meerut  the next morning after two miles riding they entered a large village as they were passing through it a number of peasants suddenly rushed out into the road and shouted to them to stop they were armed with sticks and hoes and a few had guns looking behind ned saw a similar body fill up the road behind them cutting off their escape  look ned at that old fellow with the gun thats the man who sold us the grain last night dick said  we must charge them dick theres nothing else to do hold tight girls now for your revolver dick now  and digging their heels into their horses side the boys rode at the crowd of peasants there was a discharge of guns and dick felt as if a hot iron had been drawn suddenly across his cheek then they were in the midst of the crowd emptying their revolvers with deadly effect among them some fell and the horses dashed forward followed by the yells of their assailants a minute later three or four more guns were discharged the rear party having now joined the other and being therefore able for the first time to fire  dick heard a little startled cry from kate  are you hurt darling he cried in alarm  nothing to speak of dick ride on  in a quarter of a mile they drew rein and found that a ball had passed through the upper part of kates arm as it went round dicks body fortunately it had gone through the flesh only without touching the bone dick was bleeding copiously from a wound across the cheek  another two inches to the right he said and it would have taken me fairly in the mouth its well its no worse  kates arm was soon bandaged up and a handkerchief tied round dicks face ned proposed that for kates sake they should make a halt at the first wood they came to but kate would not hear of it  on the contrary ned we ought to press forward as hard as we can for it is very possible that at that village where we were recognizedi suppose because they had heard about the horsesthey may have dispatched people to the main road as well as further on to stop us here and we may be pursued at any moment if there happens to be any native cavalry upon the road evidently they are very much in earnest about catching us and have sent word to look after four people on two horses all over the country or they could not have known about it at the village yesterday evening  i am afraid you are right kate if we could turn off this road i should not fear but the river cannot be far to our right and the main road is to our left there is nothing for it but to press straight on fortunately the country is not thickly populated and there is a good deal of jungle if the worst comes to the worst we must leave our horses and go on foot again i fear that is more fatiguing for you but we can hide ourselves a good deal better  it was late in the afternoon when rose cried they are coming ned there is a party of cavalry behind  ned looked round and far back along the straight road he saw a body of horsemen  they are a long distance behind he said now for a race  the boys plied their sticks and the horses sprang on at full gallop  how much are they gaining rose he asked after twenty minutes hard riding  they are nearer neda good deal nearer but they have not gained half their distance yet  the sun set fully ten minutes ago ned said in another halfhour it will be dark their horses must be done up or they would gain faster on us as ours have to carry double and are getting terribly blown but there is a wood which looks a large one a couple of miles ahead if we can get there five minutes before them we are safe  by dint of flogging their horses they entered the wood while their pursuers were half a mile behind  another hundred yards ned said and then halt now off we get  in an instant they leaped off and gave a couple of sharp blows with their sticks to the horses who dashed off at a gallop down the road  it was already perfectly dark in the wood and the fugitives hurried into the thickest part in five minutes they heard the cavalry come thundering past  we must push on ned said fortunately we have done no walking for we must be far away by tomorrow morning they will come up with the horses before very long and will know we are in the wood and they will search it through and through in the morning  a quarter of a mile and the wood grew thicker being filled with an undergrowth of jungle  if you will stop here ned i will push on through this jungle and see how far it goes the girls can never get through this i think we are near the edge of the wood it looks lighter ahead  in ten minutes he came back  ned we are on the river it is not fifty yards from here  this was serious news  what a pity we did not take to the left instead of the right when we left the horses however they wont know which way we have gone and must watch the whole wood we must push forward and by keeping as close as we can to the river shall most likely pass them besides they will be some time before they decide upon forming a chain round the wood and as there are only about twenty of them they will be a long way apart there do you hear them they are coming back now let us go on again  in ten minutes they reached the edge of the wood they could see nothing of the horsemen keeping in the fields but close to the line of jungle that bordered the river they walked onward for upward of an hour then they came upon the road the river had made a bend and the road now followed its bank  shall we cross it and keep in the open country or follow it girls  follow it as long as we can keep on walking kate said it is in the right direction and we can go on so much faster than in the fields if we hear them coming along we can get into the jungle on the bank  listen kate rose said a few minutes afterward they are following  i expect ned said they find that the wood is too big to be watched and some of them are going on to get some help from the next garrison or perhaps to rouse up a village and press them in the work trot on girls the jungle is so thick here you could hardly squeeze yourself in we have plenty of time they wont be here for five minutes yet     chapter iv  broken down   they ran at the top of their speed but the sound of the horses feet grew louder  there is a path leading to the river ned said let us turn down there we can hide under the jungle on the bank  breathlessly they ran down to the river  hurrah here is a boat jump in and in another minute they had pushed off from the bank just as they heard a body of cavalryfor that they were troops they knew by the jingling of their accoutermentspass at a gallop the stream was strong and the boys found that with the rude oars they could make no way whatever  we had better land again and get further from the river ned said we will push the boat off and it will be supposed that we have gone off in it  this was soon done and having regained the road they crossed it and struck over the fields  the moon which had been hitherto hidden under a passing cloud was soon out fully and for some time they kept across the country carefully avoiding all villages these were here more thinly scattered patches of jungle and wood occurred more frequently and it was evident that they were getting into a less highly cultivated district it was long before daybreak that rose declared that she was too fatigued to go further and they entered a large wood here they lay down and were soon fast asleep it was broad daylight when the warreners woke rose still slept on  presently kate came to her brothers i am afraid rose is going to be ill she keeps talking and moaning in her sleep her face is flushed and her hands as hot as fire  as they were looking sadly at her she opened her eyes  is it time to get up she asked oh my head it is aching terribly is the trap at the door  then she closed her eyes again and went on talking incoherently to herself  she has fever kate said and we must get her under shelter at whatever risk  i heard a dog bark not far off just as i went to sleep ned said i will go and reconnoiter dick you had better stay here  dick nodded and ned advanced cautiously to the edge of the wood there he saw a farmhouse of a better class than usual three peons were just starting for work and an elderly man with a long beard was standing at the door then he went in and after a few minutes reappeared with a long staff in his hands and went out into the fields he did not however follow the direction which the peons had taken but took a line parallel with the edge of the wood he looks a decent old fellow ned said to himself i can but try at any rate at the worst i am more than a match for him  so saying he stepped out into the field the farmer started with surprise at seeing a young mussulman appear before him  i am english ned said at once i think you are kind by your face and i tell you the truth there are two english girls in the wood and one is ill we can go no further will you give them shelter  the old man stood for some time in thought  i have no complaint against the feringhees he said in my fathers time the country was red with blood but all my life i have eaten my bread in peace and no man has injured me where are the english ladies  ned led the way to the spot where rose was still lying the old man looked at her flushed face and then at kate and said  the english ladies have suffered much and can have done harm to no one i will shelter them my wife and daughter will nurse the sick one they will be in the womens chamber and my servants will not know that there is a stranger there i believe that they would be faithful but one who knows nothing can tell no tales on the other side of the wood there is a shed it is empty now and none go near it the english sahibs can live there and each day i will bring them food when their sister is well they can go on again  ned translated the old mans words and kate who was kneeling by rose caught his hand and kissed it in her gratitude he patted her head and said poor child  how are we to carry rose i dont think she can walk kate asked  the farmer solved the difficulty by motioning them to stay where they were he then went off and in ten minutes returned bearing a dried bullocks skin on this rose was laid the hindoo took the two ends at her feet the boys each one of those by her head and then slung as in a hammock rose was carried to the house where the wife and daughter of their host prepared by him for what was coming received them with many expressions of pity and she was at once carried into the inner room the farmer then placed before the boys two bowls of milk and some freshly made chupatties and then gave them some food for the day with an expression of fervent gratitude to him and a kiss from kate who came out to tell them that rose would be well nursed and cared for the boys started for the hut in the direction the hindoo pointed out to them it was a small building and had apparently been at some time used as a cattle shed the floor was two feet deep in fodder of the stalks of indian corn above was a sort of rough loft in which grain had been stored  the boys at once agreed that to prevent suspicion it was safer to occupy this and they soon transferred enough of the fodder from below to make a comfortable bed then feeling secure from discovery even if by chance some passerby should happen to glance into the shed they were soon deep in a sounder sleep than they had enjoyed since they left sandynugghur  the next day when the old man came to see them he was accompanied by kate she looked pale and wan  how is rose was their first question  she is as bad as she can be dears she has been delirious all night and is so this morning i did not like to leave her for a moment but this kind old man wanted me to go with him as i think he has something to say to you  have you any news ned asked him  my servants tell me that the sepoys are searching the whole country some of the officers have escaped from sandynugghur and also from nalgwa where the troops rose on the same night some of the residents have escaped also there is a reward offered for them alive or dead and any one hiding them is to be punished with death the white lady is very ill she is in the hand of god she may get better she may die if she gets better it will be weeks before she can go through the hardships of the journey to meerut i think it better that you should go on alone the white ladies will be as my daughters i have told my servants that my daughter is ill so that if they hear cries and voices at night they will think that it is she who is in pain you can do no good here if the woods are searched you may be found if you are found they will search everywhere closely and may find them i will hide them here safely the orders are i hear that the captives taken are to be carried to delhi but if they should be found i will myself journey to meerut to bring you the news you will give me your names and i will find you then you may get help and rescue them on the way  ned translated the old mans opinion and kind offer to his brother and sister and said that he was very unwilling to leave the girlsa sentiment in which dick heartily joined  kate however at once expressed her warm approval of the plan  it will be weeks dears before rose can walk again and i shall have an anxious time with her it would add greatly to my anxiety if i knew that you were near and might at any time be captured and killed if dear papa has escaped he will be in a terrible state of anxiety about us and you could relieve him if you can join him at meerut and tell him how kindly we are treated here altogether boys it would be so much better for you to go for if the sepoys do come you could not defend us against more than two or three and they are sure to come in a stronger party than that  in spite of their disinclination to leave the girls without such protection as they could give them the boys saw that the course advised was the best to be pursued and told their hindoo friend that they agreed to follow his counsel thanking him in the warmest terms for his kindness  he advised them to leave their mohammedan dresses behind and to dress in the simple costume of hindoo peons with which he could supply them they would then attract far less attention and could even by day pass across the fields without any comment whatever from the natives at work there who would naturally suppose that they belonged to some village near at hand englishmen could not do this he said too much leg too much arm too much width of shoulders but boys are thinner and no one will notice the difference in half an hour i will come back with the things ned gave him the rest of the berries which they had preserved and asked him to boil them up in a little water as they would now have to color their bodies and arms and legs in addition to their faces  it was a sad parting between kate and her brothers for all felt that they might never meet again still the course decided upon was under the circumstances evidently the best that could be adopted  in an hour the hindoo returned the boys took off their clothes and stained themselves a deep brown from head to foot the farmer then produced a razor and a bowl of water and some soap and said that they must shave their hair off their heads up to a level with the top of the ears so as to leave only that which could be concealed by their turban this with some laughterthe first time they had smiled since they left sandynugghurthey proceeded to do to each other and the skin thus exposed they dyed the same color as the rest of the body they then each put on a scanty loincloth and wrapping a large piece of dark blue cotton stuff first round their waists and then over one shoulder their costume was complete with the exception of a pair of sandals and a white turban the old hindoo surveyed them gravely when their attire was completed and expressed his belief that they would pass without exciting the slightest suspicion their pistols were a trouble they were determined that come what might they would not go without these and they were finally slung behind them from a strap passing round the waist under the loincloth the spare ammunition and a supply of biscuit were stowed in stout cotton bags with which their friend provided them and which hung by a band passing over one shoulder their money and a box of matches they secured in a corner of their clothes a couple of stout staves completed their outfit  bidding a grateful farewell to their friendly hindoo the boys started on their journey the sandals they found so difficult to keep on that they took them off and carried them except when they were passing over stony ground they kept to bypaths and avoided all villages occasionally they met a native but either they passed him without speech or ned muttered a salutation in answer to that of the passer all day they walked and far into the night they had no fear of missing their way as the road on one hand and the river on the other both ran to meerut and although these were sometimes ten miles apart they served as a fair index as to the line they should take the biscuits eked out with such grain as they could pluck as they crossed the fields lasted for two days but at the end of that time it became necessary to seek another supply of food  i dont know what to ask for dick and those niggers always chatter so much that i should have to answer and then i should be found out directly i think we must try some quiet huts at a distance from the road  the wood in which they that night slept was near three or four scattered huts in the morning they waited and watched for a long time until one of the cottages was as far as they could judge deserted all its inmates being gone out to work in the fields they then entered it boldly it was empty on hunting about they found some chupatties which had apparently been newly baked a store of rice and of several other grains they took the chupatties five or six pounds of rice and a little copper cooking pot they placed in a conspicuous position two rupees which were more than equivalent to the value of the things they had taken and went on their way rejoicing  at midday they sat down lit a fire with some dried sticks and put their rice in the pot to boil as ned was stooping to pick up a stick he was startled by a simultaneous cry of look out from dick and a sharp hiss and looking up saw three or four feet ahead of him a cobra with its hood inflated and its head raised in the very act of springing just as it was darting itself forward dicks stick came down with a sharp tap on its head and killed it  that was a close shave ned the boy said laughing if you had stooped he would have bit you on the face what would have been the best thing to do if he had bitten you  the best thing is to suck the wound instantly to take out a knife and cut deeply in and then as we have no vesuvians i should break up half a dozen pistol cartridges put the powder into and on the wound and set it alight i believe that that is what they do in some parts of eastern europe in the case of the bites of mad dogs and this if no time is lost after the bite is given is almost always effectual in keeping off hydrophobia  well ned i am very thankful that we had not to put the virtue of the receipt to a practical test  would you like to eat the snake dick i believe that snake is not at all bad eating  thank you dick said i will take it on trust we have got rice and although i am not partial to rice it will do very well if we could have got nothing else we might have tried the snake but as it is i had rather not two more days ned and we shall be at meerut the old hindoo said it was a hundred miles and we go twentyfive a day even with all our bends and turns to get out of the way of villages  yes i should think we do quite that dick we walk from daylight to sunset and often two or three hours by moonlight and though we dont go very fast we ought to get over a lot of ground listen there is music both held their breath yes there are the regular beats of a big drum it is on the highroad i should say nearly abreast of us if we go to that knoll we shall have a view of them and there cannot be the least danger as they must be fully a mile away  upon gaining the rise in question they saw a regiment in scarlet winding along the road  are they mutineers dick or british  it was more than any one could say mounted officers rode at the head of the regiment perfect order was to be observed in its marching there was nothing that in any way differed from its ordinary aspect  let us go back and get our rice and lota dick we cant afford to lose that and if we go at a trot for a couple of miles we can get round into some trees near the road where we can see their faces if the mounted officers are white it is all right if not they are mutineers  half an hours trot brought them to such a point of vantage as they desired crouched in some bushes at the edge of a clump of trees not fifty yards from the road they awaited the passage of the regiment they had not been in their hidingplace five minutes when the head of the column appeared  they march in very good order ned do you think that they would keep up such discipline as that after they had mutinied  i dont know dirk but theyll want all their discipline when they come to meet our men for anything we know we may be the two last white men left in india but when the news gets to england there will be such a cry throughout the land that if it needed a million men to win back the country i believe they would be found and sent out there there are two mounted officers i cant see their color but i dont think they are white  no ned i am sure they are not white then they must be mutineers look look dont you see they have got three prisoners there they are marching in the middle of that column they are officers and oh ned i do think that the middle ones father and the excited boy with tears of joy running down his cheeks would have risen and dashed out had not ned forcibly detained him  hush dick and keep quiet yes it is father and dunlop and manners thank god he said in deep gratitude  well lets go to them ned we may as well be all together  keep quiet dick the elder said holding him down again you will destroy their chance as well as ours we must rescue them if we can  how ned how  i dont know yet dick but we must wait and see anyhow we will try there goes the bugle for a halt i expect they have done their days march come on dick we must get out of this when they have once pitched their tents they will scatter about and as likely as not some will come into this wood let us get further back so as to be able to see them pitch their tents and watch if we can where they put the prisoners  the regiment piled arms and waited until the bullockcarts came up with the tents these were taken out and pitched on the other side of the road and facing the wood the ground being marked out the men were told off to their quarters and the poles of the tents aligned with as much regularity and exactness as could have been used when the regiment possessed its white officers  near the quarterguard tentthat is the tent of the men engaged upon actual dutya small square tent was erected and into this the three officers who were handcuffed were thrust and two sentries one in front the other at the back of the tent were placed  now dick we know all about it let us get further away and talk over how it is to be managed  the task was one of extreme difficulty and the boys were a long time arranging the details had there been but one sentry the matter would have been easy enough but with two sentries and with the quarter guard close at hand it seemed at first as if no possible scheme could be hit upon the sentry at the back of the tent must be the one to be disposed of and this must be done so noiselessly as not to alarm the man in front each marched backward and forward some eight paces to the right and as much to the left of the tent halting occasionally when both marched right and left at the same time they were in sight of each other except during the time of passing before and behind the tent when they walked alternately the tent hid them altogether from each other  i suppose there is no chance of our being able to gag that fellow ned its horrid to think of killing a man in cold blood  there is no help for it dick if he were alone we might gag him as it is he must be killed these scoundrels are all mutineers and murderers this regiment has no doubt like the others killed its officers and all the men women and children at the station i would not kill the man unless it could be helped but our fathers life depends upon it and to save him i would if there were no other way cut the throats of the whole regiment while they were asleep this is no ordinary war dick it is a struggle for existence and though im sure i hate the thought of it i shall not hesitate for an instant  i shant hesitate the midshipman said but i wish the fellow could make a fight of it however as he would kill me if he had a chance he mustnt grumble if i do the same for him now ned you tell me exactly what i am to do and you may rely on my doing it  every minute detail of the scheme was discussed and arranged and then as the sun set the boys lit a fire in a nullah and boiled some rice and ate their food with lighter hearts than they had done since they left sandynugghur for the knowledge that their father had escaped death had lifted a heavy burden from their hearts as to the danger of the expedition that they were about to undertake with the happy recklessness of boys they thought but little of it  across the plain they could see the campfires but as the evening went on these gradually died away and the sounds which had come faintly across the still night air ceased altogether as patiently as might be they waited until they guessed that it must be about ten oclock the night was for the country colda favorable circumstance as the natives who are very chilly would be less likely to leave their tents if they felt restless the moon was now half full and shining brightly giving a light with which the boys could well have dispensed  now dick old boy lets be moving may god help us in our nights work  they made a considerable detour to approach the camp in the rear where they rightly judged that the sepoys having no fear whatever of any hostile body being near would have placed no sentries  listen dick said as they were pausing to reconnoiter that sounded like a cannon in the far distance  there was no doubt of it faintly but quite distinct across the air came the sound of heavy cannon fired at regular intervals  those cannon must be fired as a salute to some great chief newly arrived at delhiwe should not fire so late but i suppose they are not particular ned said we calculated it was not more than twentyfive miles off and we should hear them at that distance easily we had better wait a few minutes to see if any one comes out to listen to it  but there was no movement among the white tents then they stole quietly into the camp  the tents of the indian native regiments are large oblong tents with two poles holding thirty men each they are manufactured at the government prison at jubbalpore and are made of thick cotton canvas lined with red or blue cotton in the daytime they open right along one side the wall of the tent being propped outward with two slight poles so as to form a sort of veranda and shade the inside of the tent while admitting the air at nighttime in the cool season this flap is let down and the tent closed in front of the tents the muskets of the men inside are piled  into one of these tents dick crawled ned watching outside when dick first entered it was so dark that he could see nothing but the moonlight penetrated dimly through the double cotton and he was soon able to discover objects around the ground was all occupied by sleeping figures each wrapped up from head to foot in his blanket looking like so many mummies their uniforms were folded and placed between their heads and the wall of the tent six of these with the same number of caps and six ammunition pouches and belts and a uniform cloak taken carefully off one of the sleepers dick collected and passed out through the door of the tent to ned not a sleeper stirred while he did so and he crept quietly out with the first part of his task accomplished gathering the things together the boys made all speed back to a clump of trees half a mile in the rear of the camp here ned put on one of the uniforms and the cloak and they then started back again for the camp  the sentries upon the prisoners tent were changed at twelve oclock and a few minutes later the sentry at the rear of the tent saw one of his comrades come out of one of the large tents close to the end of his beat he was wrapped in his blanket and his face was tied up with a cloth coughing violently he squatted himself in front of his tent and rocked himself to and fro with his hands to his face uttering occasional groans this was all so naturalfor the natives of india suffer much from neuralgia in the cold weatherthat the sentry thought nothing of the matter he continued to pace his beat turning back each time when within a yard or two of the sufferer the third time he did so the figure dropped off his blanket and with a sudden bound threw himself on the sentrys back at the same moment a sepoy in uniform darted out from the tent one hand of the assailantin which was a damp clothwas pressed tightly over the mouth and nostrils of the sentry the other grasped the lock of his musket so that it could not be discharged thrown backward off his balance taken utterly by surprise the sentry was unable even to struggle and in an instant the second antagonist plunged a bayonet twice into his body and he fell a lifeless mass on the ground it was the work of an instant to drag the body a yard or two into the shadow of the tent and before the other sentry appeared from the opposite side of the prisoners tent the native was rocking himself as before the sentry wrapped in his cloak was marching calmly on his beat the whole affair had lasted but twenty seconds and had passed as noiselessly as a dream  the next time the sentry in front was hidden from view the native started from his sitting position and stole up behind the tent cautiously and quietly he cut a slit in the canvas and entered then he knelt down by the side of one of the sleepers and kissed him he moved in his sleep and his disturber putting his hand on his mouth to prevent sudden speech shook him gently the major opened his eyes  father it is irichard hush do not speak  then as the bewildered man gradually understood what was said his son fell on his neck kissing him with passionate delight  after the first rapturous joy of the recognition was over ned and the girls major warrener asked  the girls are at present safe dick said ned is outside behind he is the sentry now father wake the others and then let us steal off take off your boots the mens tents are only ten yards behind once there you are safe i will let ned know when you are ready and he will occupy the sentry we cant silence him because he is within sight of the sentry of the quarterguard  major warrener aroused his sleeping companions and in a few whispered words told them what had happened in silence they wrung dicks hand and then taking off their boots stole one by one out of the tent as ned passed he exchanged a silent embrace with his father the next time the sentry in front was passing before the tent a heavy stone hurled by ned crashed into a bush upon the other side of the road the sentry halted instantly and with gun advanced listened but he could hear nothing for his comrade was at that instant seized with a fit of coughing  after standing in a listening attitude for three or four minutes the sepoy supposed that the noise must have been caused by some large bird suddenly disturbed in the foliage  did you hear anything he asked ned as their path crossed  nothing ned answered continuing his march  for another quarter of an hour he passed backward and forward his only fear being that the sentry might take it into his head to open the tent and look in to see if the prisoners were safe in a quarter of an hour he knew that the fugitives would have gained the trees and would have time to put on the sepoy uniforms before he reached them and also by the aid of a couple of large stones have got rid of their handcuffs lie might therefore be off to join them  waiting till the sentry was at the other end of his beat he slipped round the tent stripped off his cloak lay down his musket and beltfor dick had arranged that they should carry off five muskets in their retreat threw off the sepoy jacket and in light running order darted through the tents he calculated that he should have at least a couple of minutes start before his absence was discovered another minute or two before the sentry was sufficiently sure of it to hail the quarterguard and report the circumstance then would follow the discovery of the escape of the prisoners but by that time he would be far out on the plain and even if seen which was unlikely he was confident that he could outrun any native  his anticipations turned out correct he was already some distance off when he heard the call of the sentry to the quarterguard followed almost immediately by a still louder shout that told that he had discovered the flight of the prisoners then came the sound of a musket shot a drum beat the alarm and a babel of sounds rang on the still air but by this time ned was halfway to the clump of trees and three minutes later he was in his fathers arms there was no time to talk then another coat was hurried on to him an ammunition belt and pouch thrown over his shoulder and captain manners carrying his musket until he should have quite recovered breath the five went off at a steady trot which after a quarter of an hour broke into a walkfor there was no fear of pursuitin the direction in which they knew delhi to lie     chapter v  back under the flag   how far is it to delhi we heard the guns there just now  not thirty miles  have you heard how things are going on there dick asked  according to the sepoy reports fresh regiments are pouring in from all quarters and they boast that they are going to drive us out of the country our troops are still at meerut and a force is gathering at umballah but they are after all a mere handful  do you think there is any chance of help coming to us  none for the present the sepoys say that every station has gone down except agra allahabad and benares and that these are soon to go too cawnpore and lucknow have risen  are all the whites killed everywhere  i am afraid they are all killed where there are no white troops but there we must hope that they are making a stand we shall be a long time before we know anything it is but a week yet since our station went seven days longer since delhi rose  it seems ages ago ned said you dont mean to try and get to meerut tonight i hope we could walk as far if it were absolutely necessary but we have done a long days walk already  no no ned i only want to get well away from our late camp tomorrow we will get near the river hide all next day and cross after nightfall there is a clump of trees we will pass the night there i think we are safe enough now the mutineers are too anxious to be at delhi to spend much time in looking for us now first of all let us get a fire  we have never had a fire at night dick said since we started we have been too much afraid of being seen  there is not much chance of its being observed in a wood especially if the bushes are thick we are four miles at least from the camp and we are all wet through with dew now for sticks  the whole party soon collected a pile of sticks and the major was about to scatter some powder among the dead leaves when ned said we have matches father  oh thats all right ned there we are fairly alight yes we have chosen the place well there are bushes all around now he said when the fire had burned up brightly let us hear the full story of what has passed you gave us a short account when we first got free now let us hear all about it  ned and dick told the storysometimes one taking it up sometimes the other there were many questions from their auditors and expressions of warm approval of their conduct and captain dunlop threatened under his breath that if he ever had a chance he would not leave one cake of mud upon another in the village where kate was wounded he and captain manners proposed that they should go back and afford what protection they could to the girls but major warrener at once negatived this idea  if they could come straight back with us i should say yes he said for with us five we might hope to get them through safely but even that would be very risky for the larger the party is the more easily it attracts attention and the whole country is alive with rebels marching to delhi but as rose cannot be fit to travel for weeks we have no choice in the matter they must remain where they are and we can only hope and pray for their safety our duty lies clearly at meerut where every man who can sight a rifle will be wanted most urgently now let us be off to sleep the fire has burned low and in another hour or two it will be daybreak however there will be no reveille and we can sleep on with lighter hearts than we have had for some time  what figures you are in those uniforms dick said laughing next morning you can scarcely move in them and they wont meet by eight or nine inches it does not seem to me that they are any disguise at all any one could see in a moment that they were not made for you  they are wretchedly uncomfortable dick his father said and as you say any one could see they were not made for us but they are useful as we go along any one who saw us at a distance would take us for a straggling party of mutineers making our way to delhi while the bright scarlet of our own uniform would have told its tale miles off  i shall be glad enough to get rid of mine dick i feel as if i had got into a boys jacket by mistake jack sepoy has no shoulders to speak of as far as height goes he is well enough but thirty sepoys on parade take up no more room than twenty english i had to take my jacket off last night and lay it over my shoulders i might as well have tried to go to sleep in a vise there major do you hear the music these rascals are on the march again  the strains of music came very faintly to the ear for the bivouac was nearly a mile from the road  that is all right the major said now they have gone by we can be moving we must give them an hours start  now father we have not heard your adventures yet please tell us all about them  well we have not had so much variety as you but we have gone through a good deal you know we had talked over the best possible course to take in case of an attack come when it might we had arranged what each should do in case of a night attack or of a rising upon parade and we had even considered the probability of being set upon when gathered in the messroom we had all agreed that if taken by surprise resistance would mean certain death they would shoot us down through the doors and windows and we should be like rats in a cage we agreed therefore that in case of an attack a simultaneous attempt to break out must be made and we had even settled upon the window by which we should go the married men were of course to make for their bungalows except where as in my case i had made other arrangements and the rest to various bungalows agreed upon where traps were to be in readiness dunlop manners and myself had agreed to make for dunlops as it was the nearest and his trap was to be ready that evening  there were not many who believed in a mutiny that night the villains only in the morning having sworn to be faithful deceived most of us for it was very hard to believe they could be capable of such diabolical treachery swords and pistols were of course taken off but instead of being left in the anteroom were brought into the messroom some fellows put theirs in a corner others against the wall behind them i was sitting between dunlop and manners and we were as it happened at the corner nearest the window fixed upon for the bolt things went on all right till dinner was over there was an insolent look about some of the servants faces i did not like but nothing to take hold of i pointed it out to dunlop and we agreed that the plan arranged was the best possible and that as resistance would be of no use if at each of the eight large windows and the two doors a stream of musketry fire were being poured in we would make a rush straight for the window presently the colonel rose and gave the queen we all rose and as ifas i have no doubt it was the toast was the signal there was a sudden trampling in the veranda outside and at every window appeared a crowd of sepoys with their arms in their hands i shouted to the window for your lives and without stopping to get my sword i dashed at the sepoys who were there dunlop and manners were with me and before the scoundrels had time to get their guns to their shoulders we were upon them we are all big men and our weight and impetus and the surprise were too much for them we burst through them standing as they did four or five deep as if they had been reeds they gave a yell of rage and astonishment as they went down like ninepins but we scarcely saw it for as we went through them the musketry fire broke out round the messroom  illustration before the scoundrels had time to get their guns to their shoulders we were upon them  whether any of the others tried to follow us we dont know i think most of them forgot their arrangement and rushed to their arms certainly some of them did so for we heard the crack of revolvers between the rifle shots we made straight across the parade for dunlops bungalow with musket balls flying in all directions as soon as the fellows we had gone through recovered from their first astonishment but they are not good shots at the best and a man running at his top speed is not an easy mark by moonlight we heard yells and musket shots all round and knew that while a part of the regiment was attacking us parties were told off to each bungalow by the time we had got over the few hundred yards to dunlops the whistling of the bullets round us had pretty well ceased for the fellows had all emptied their muskets besides we were nearly out of range none of them were near us for they had stopped in their run to fire they were too much interested in the massacre going on inside and we seemed pretty safe when just as i entered the gate of the compound a stray bullet hit me on the head and down i went like a log  happily the syce had proved faithful he had been with dunlop ever since he joined the regiment and dunlop once risked his life to save him from a tiger there was the syce with the trap he had not dared bring it out till the first shot was fired lest his fellowservants who were all traitors should stop it but the instant it began he came round they ran the horse up to where i was lying lifted me in and jumped in and drove out of the gate as a score of fellows from the messhouse came making toward the bungalow we had fifty yards start but they fired away at us a ball passing through the syces leg as he scrambled up behind the horse went along at a gallop but we were not safe for parties were carrying on their hellish work in every bungalow dunlop and manners were maddened by the screams they heard and if it had not been for having me under their charge and by the thoughts of the girls i believe they would have jumped out and died fighting a few of the black devils hearing wheels ran out and fired but we kept on at a full gallop till we were well out of the place a mile further dunlop found the horse begin to slacken his speed and to go very leisurely he jumped out to see what was the matter and found as he expected that the horse had been hit he had one bullet in the neck another in the side it was evident that it could not go much further they lifted me out and carried me to a patch of bushes thirty yards from the road the syce was told to drive on quietly till the horse dropped dunlop gave him money and told him to meet us at meerut  why did you not keep him with you he would have been very useful dick asked  you see i wanted to get the trap as far away as possible before the horse fell captain dunlop said we did not know how severely wounded the major was indeed we both feared he was killed but the mutineers when they found the dead horse in the morning were certain to make a search in its neighbourhood and would have found your father had he been close by laid up with a wound  happily i now began to come to the major went on continuing his story the ball was nearly spent and had given me a nasty scalp wound and had stunned me but i now began to come round the instant i was able to understand where i was or what had happened dunlop and manners who were halfwild with excitement and grief made me promise to lie quiet while they went back to see what had become of you all of course i consented they were away about three hours for they had to make a circle of the cantonments as our bungalow was quite at the other end they brought cheering news they had first been to the house and found it utterly destroyed as they expected that told them nothing for if you had been killed your bodies would probably have been burned with the house then they went out to the tope of trees where it was agreed that you should if possible first fly here they found a pockethandkerchief of roses and going round to the other side found by the marks upon the soil that four of you had started together with hearts immensely lightened by the discovery that you had at any rate all escaped from the first massacre they hurried back to gladden me with the news i was past understanding it when they arrived for the intense pain in my head and my terrible anxiety about you had made me delirious it would have been certain death to stay so near the road so they dipped their handkerchiefs in water and tied them round my head and then supporting me one on each side they half dragged halfcarried me to a deserted and halfruinous cottage about a mile away  next day i was still feverish but fortunately no one came near us dunlop and manners went out at night and got a few bananas next morning our regiment marched away and dunlop then appealed to an old cottager for shelter and food for us all he at once promised to aid us and i was removed to his cottage where everything in his power was done for me i was now convalescent and a day later we were talking of making a move forward that night however the cottage was surroundedwhether the peasant himself or some one else betrayed us we shall never knowbut the men that we saw there belonged to a regiment of mutineers that had marched in that afternoon from dollah we saw at once that resistance was useless and we were moreover without arms had we had them i have no doubt we should have fought and been killed as it was we were bound and marched into the camp at sandynugghur it was resolved to take us in triumph into delhi and we were marched along with the regiment till you saw us we had talked over every conceivable plan of escape and had determined that we would try tonight which will be the last halt before they get to delhi it is very unlikely that we should have succeeded but it was better to be shot down than to be taken to delhi and given over to the mob to torture before they killed us i am convinced we had no chance of really getting off and that you have saved our lives just as dunlop and manners saved mine at the risk of their own on that first night of our flight and now let us be on the march  they had not gone far before the three officers found that it was impossible to walk in their sepoy jackets they accordingly took them off and slung them from their muskets ned and dick were fairly fitted they halted for the night near the river about ten miles above delhi in the morning they were off early by nine oclock they stood on the bank of the river five miles higher up  the river is wide or rather the bed of the river is wide half a mile at least this in the rainy season is full to the brim but at other times the stream is not more than half that width after crossing the river they would have fifteen miles still to traverse to arrive at meerut and it was probable that the whole intervening country was in the hands of the sepoys  had we not better keep this side of the river for a bit father ned asked  no my boy we will cross here after dark and make straight for meerut if we cant find a boat we will each cut a large bundle of rushes to act as a lifebuoy and carry your guns and ammunition and so swim across after it is dark  well major as the sun is getting awfully hot i vote we get into the shade of those stunted trees and have a nap till the afternoon it wont do to begin even to make the raft till the sun is down  captain dunlops proposition was carried into effect but it is questionable whether any of the party slept much for they were excited by the thought that in a few hours they would be with friends once more soldiers instead of fugitives with power to fight in defense of their sovereigns dominions and of the helpless women and children exposed to the fury of the atrocious mutineers with these thoughts mingled the anxiety which was wearing them all although each refrained from talking about it as to the safety of the girls whose lives wore dependent upon the fidelity of a native and his servants  over and over again since they met the boys had they regretted that they had not gone back to watch over them but the fact that rose might be weeks before she was able to stand and that as their protector had said the presence of europeans near them might be detected and would be a source of constant danger convinced them that they had taken the proper course they knew too that in acting as they had done they were performing their duty and that at a moment when the fate of british india trembled in the balance the place of every soldier was by the side of the british troops who still maintained the old flag flying in the face of increasing numbers of the enemy still although they knew that they were doing their duty and were moreover taking the wisest course the thoughts of the girls alone in the midst of danger with one of them down with fever tried them terribly and they longed with a fierce desire for the excitement of work and of danger to keep them from thinking of it  here boys is a ear of indian corn apiece eat that and then get to work  the frugal meal was soon over and they then set to work cutting down breaking off and tearing up large reeds with which to make floats the boys had knives but the others had been stripped of everything they had at the time of their capture in about an hour however five bundles were made each some six feet long and nearly three feet thick the muskets and ammunition pouches were fastened on these and soon after it was quite dark they entered the water  there are no crocodiles i hope dick whispered to ned  nothing to fear in these large rivers the chances of meeting one are very small  all right dick said of course weve got to risk it but theyre as bad as sharks and sharks as the yankee said is pison well here goes  when the bundles were placed in the water they were lashed side by side with long trailing creepers which grew abundantly among the rushes and they were thus secured from the risk of turning over from the weights on the top upon the raft thus formed their clothes were placed and then side by side pushing it before them the party shoved off from shore in twenty minutes they touched ground on the other side they dressed examined their muskets to see if they were in good order and then started in the direction in which they knew meerut to be several times they paused and listened for they could occasionally hear the noise of galloping men and it was evident that there were troops of some kind or other moving about  they walked for some hours until they thought that they could not be far from their destination and had begun to congratulate themselves upon being near their friends when the sound of a strong body of men was heard sweeping along the level plain across which they were now passing  there is a small building ahead the major said run for that they are coming across here  they were seen for a shout of who goes there in hindostanee was heard  give me your musket dick captain dunlop exclaimed for the lad with the weight of his musket and ammunition could hardly keep up with the others  just in time they reached the building in front of them rushed in and closed the door as the cavalry swept up it was a small temple a building of massive construction with one little window about six inches square and on the same side a strong door  pile everything against the door the major cried dunlop fire at once at them our only chance is to hold out with the hope that we may be heard and that some of our fellows may come to the rescue  captain dunlop fired just as the troopers dashed up to the door  now manners steady pick off your man the major said as aided by the boys he jammed a beam of wood between the door and the wall at such an angle that except by breaking it to pieces the door could not be forced  now he said its my turn and he fired into the enraged enemy now ned steady are you loaded again dunlop  yes major just ready  dick you follow take good aim  the cavalry answered their fire every shot of which was taking effect by a confused discharge of their pistols at the door and window  draw off their leader shouted rearrank men hold the horses front rank men dismount and break in the door  the order was obeyed and the troopers rushed forward on foot and were met by a steady fire to which the straggling return of their pistols was but an inefficient answer vainly the mutineers hacked at the door with their sabers and struck it with their pommels  throw yourselves against it all at once cried their leader and a dozen men sent themselves against the door it creaked and strained but the beam kept it in its place  you keep up the fire through the window said the major the boys and i will fire through the door  yells and shrieks followed each shot through the door and after three or four minutes the troopers drew off  any one hurt the major asked  i have got a bullet in my shoulder said captain dunlop  but that was the only reply there was a shout outside and manners exclaimed confound the fellows they have got a big log of wood that will soon splinter the door  we must stop them as long as we can said the major as he fired among the men who were advancing with the log  several sepoys fell before they got up to the house but they pressed on and at the first blow given by the batteringram driven by the men the door split from top to bottom  fix bayonets the major said now manners you and i will hold them back not more than two can come at once and their swords are of no use against bayonets in a narrow space dunlop will you stand in reserve you have still got your right hand use your bayonet as a dagger if a rush comes boys you go on loading and firing put in four balls each time if they get in of course use your bayonets there goes the door  a shout burst from the natives as the last portion of the door dropped from its hinges and the doorway was open there was however no inclination betrayed to make a rush  forward death to the infidel dogs shouted their officer  suppose you lead us said one of the troopers the officers always show the way  come then cried an old officer on whose breast hung several medals follow me  drawing his sword he rushed forward followed by twenty of his men but as he passed over the threshold he and the trooper next to him fell beneath the bayonet thrusts of major warrener and his companion the next two pushed forward by their comrades shared the same fate while as they fell the muskets of ned and dick sent their contents into the mass the rest recoiled from the fatal doorway while the defenders set up a cheer of triumph it was drowned in a crash of musketry mingled with a cry of surprise and despair from the natives as a body of british soldiers leaped from the wood and followed their volley by an impetuous charge the cavalry on the plain turned and fled at a gallop and in five minutes but for a few dark figures prostrate on the plain not an enemy was in sight  well gentlemen you have made a stout defense the officer in command said as he returned to the shrine outside which the little party had gathered it seems as if you could have done without my help who are you may i ask and where have you sprung from  why sibbold is it you you havent forgotten warrener and here are dunlop and manners  hurrah shouted the officer thank god old fellows you are saved we fancied that you had all gone down i am glad and he shook hands enthusiastically with his friends while two of the officers coming up joined in the hearty greeting  do those two men belong to your regiment captain sibbold asked if so they are wonders for i dont know a case as yet where any of the men proved true when the rest mutinied  they are my sons major warrener answered  what exclaimed the other laughingbelieving that the major was joking  its a fact as you will see when they have got rid of the stains on their faces he replied while captain dunlop added and two as fine young fellows as ever stepped do you know that we three were prisoners and that these lads rescued us from the middle of a pandy regiment if they hadnt we should have been dead men before now and now have you got anything to eat at meerut for we are famishing in the next place i have got a bullet in my shoulder and shall enjoy my food all the more after it has been taken out our stories are long and will keep how go things here  not very brightly dunlop however that will keep too now let us be off have we any casualties sergeant he asked a noncommissioned officer who came up for orders  none sir  what is the enemys loss  there are fifteen which can be fairly counted to us sir and nineteen here  thats a respectable total fall in lads he said to the men who had gathered round and let us get back you will be glad to hear that these officers have escaped from the massacre at sandynugghur  there was a hearty cheer of satisfaction from the men for englishmen were knit very closely together in those terrible days then falling in the two companies of the sixtieth rifles marched back again to their cantonments at meerut     chapter vi  a dashing expedition   on arriving at the cantonments the party were soon surrounded by the troops who had been called under arms at the sound of distant firing but had been dismissed again on the arrival of a message to the effect that the enemy had fled the news had spread rapidly that some fugitives had escaped from sandynugghur where it was supposed that the massacre had been general and officers pressed forward to shake their hands and the men uttered words of kindly congratulation and welcome the greeting swelled into a cheer as the detachment fell out and scattering among their comrades told of the desperate defense and of the slaughter inflicted upon the enemy by this handful of men the fugitives were of course taken first to the messroom captain dunlop being however carried off by the surgeon to his quarters to have his wound examined and attended to  it seemed almost like a dream to the worn and weary party as they sat down again to a table laid with all the brightness and comfort of civilization and felt that they were indeed safe among friends many were the questions asked them by officers who had friends and acquaintances among the military and civilians at sandynugghur and the fugitives learned that they were so far as was known the only survivors from the massacre the story of their escape and the safety of the girls was told briefly and listened to with eager interest and very deep and hearty were the congratulations which the boys received for their share in the history in return major warrener learned what had taken place in the last ten days  the story was not reassuring tidings of evil were coming from all parts as yet the number of stations where risings had taken place was comparatively small but the position was everywhere critical in agra allahabad and benares the attitude of the native troops and population was more than doubtful at lucknow and cawnpore every precaution was being taken but a rising was regarded as inevitable in fact everywhere save in the punjab trouble had either come or was coming general anson was collecting in all haste a force at umballah which was intended to advance upon delhiwhere the exking had been proclaimed emperor of indiabut his force would necessarily be an extremely small one and no help could possibly arrive up country for many weeks there was therefore only the punjab to look to for aid happily the troops of the madras and bombay presidencies had so far remained faithful  i suppose you have a good many men from delhi civilians and military as well as from other places  oh yes we are crowded every bungalow has been given up to the ladies and we all sleep under canvas  i intend to ask leave to get up a troop of volunteers major warrener said in the first place to go out and bring in my daughter and niece and afterward to do any scouting or other duty that may be required  there has already been a talk of forming the unattached officers and civilians into a sort of irregular cavalry so i should think that you will get leave but it will be a hazardous business to make your way eighty miles through the country especially as the mutineers are marching in all directions toward delhi  the next morning major warrener obtained permission without difficulty to carry out his scheme and the news no sooner was known through the cantonments that a body of irregular horse was to be formed for scouting and general purposes and that unattached officers might until they received further orders join it than the tent which had been assigned to major warrener was besieged by men anxious to join a corps which seemed likely to afford them a chance of striking an early blow at the mutineers  hitherto the officers who had escaped from delhi and other stations those who had come in from police duties in isolated districts and civilians both merchants and government officials had been fretting that they could not be doing something to aid the great work of holding india and punishing those who had murdered their friends and relations major warreners light horse as it was to be called afforded the opportunity desired and by the next morning eightyfive volunteers had enrolled themselves some thirtyfive of these were officers the rest civilians many of them had ridden in others had driven so that most of them were already provided with horses an appeal was made to the officers of the meerut garrison and to the civilians resident there to give up any horses they might be able to spare for the public service while others were bought from friendly zemindars in a week the troop were all mounted and during this time they had worked hard to acquire a sufficient amount of cavalry drill to enable them to perform such simple evolutions as might be necessary major warrener divided the squadron into two troops each with a captain and subaltern all these officers being cavalrymen as were the officers who did duty as sergeants thus major warrener had the general command each troop being maneuvered by its own officers in the ranks as simple privates were two majors and a dozen captainsamong these latter captain manners captain dunlop was for the present in the surgeons hands but he was resolved that when the time came for a start for the rescue of the girls he would take his place in the ranks the boys of course formed part of the troop the uniform was simple consisting simply of a sort of norfolk jacket made of karkee a kind of coarse brown holland of native make each man carried a revolver and sword belt of brown leather their headgear was a cap of any kind wrapped round and round with the thick folds of a brown puggaree beyond the norfolk jacket and puggaree there was no actual uniform most of the men had hunting breeches many had high boots others had gaiters but these were minor points as were the horses equipments  nothing had been said as to the intended expedition to bring in the fugitives as native spies might have carried the news to the rebels and so caused a renewed search to be made for their hidingplace there was therefore a deep feeling of satisfaction as well as of surprise when on the tenth day after the formation of the corps the men were told on being dismissed from morning parade that the squadron would parade for duty at evening gunfire that each man was to be provided with a blanket and a haversack with cooked food sufficient for four days and a bag with twenty pounds of forage for his horse each horse to be well fed before coming on parade  had the route been free from enemies the distance might have been done in two long night marches but it would be necessary to make a detour on starting so as to avoid striking the main road as on the way out it was allimportant to avoid detection as the enemy might muster in such strength that their return would be difficult and dangerous in the extreme the girls once in their hands the return journey would be easy as they could avoid any infantry and had no fear of being able to cut their way through any body of cavalry whom they might accidentally come across especially as they would have all the advantage of a surprise half an hour after sunset the squadron rode out from the lines at meerut amid a hearty cheer from the many troops at the station who hearing that warreners light horse were off on an expedition against the mutineers had assembled to see the start major warrener rode at the head of the squadron with captain kent who commanded the first troop by his side and behind them came two native guides well acquainted with the country these had been dressed in the uniform of a native cavalry regiment in order that if they passed any village and were challenged they could ride forward and represent the troop as a body of native cavalry sent out from delhi on a mission to a friendly rajah the precaution was unnecessary during two long night marches with occasional halts to rest the horses they rode without interruption they passed through several villages but although the tramp of the horses and the rattle of sabers must have been heard by the inhabitants none stirred for the mutineers took what they wanted without paying and were already behaving as masters of the country and even thus early the country people were beginning to doubt whether the fall of the english raj and the substitution of the old native rule with its war its bloodshed and its exactions was by any means a benefit so far as the tillers of the soil were concerned just before morning on the third day the troop halted in a thick grove having watered their horses at a tank a halfhour before they had ridden some seventy miles and were they calculated about fifteen miles from the place where they had left the girls it might have been possible to push on at once but the day was breaking and it would have been inexpedient to tire out the horses when they might want all their speed and strength on the return journey very slowly passed the day most of the men after seeing to their horses and eating some food threw themselves down and slept soundly but major warrener his sons and captains dunlop and manners were far too anxious to follow their example for some time it was more than a fortnight since the boys had left the ladies and so many things of which they hardly dare think might have happened since  dont let us talk about it any more major warrener said at last we only add to each others anxiety now dunlop you must positively lie down you know johnson said it was mad in you to get on horseback till your bone had set firmly and that it was ten to one in favor of inflammation coming on again you have much to go through yet  illustration after five minutes riding they drew up their horses with a cry of dismay  gradually sleepiness overcame excitement and with the exception of ten men told off as sentries and to look after the horses the whole party slept quietly for some hours it had been determined to start in time to arrive at the farmhouse before it was dark as the boys required daylight to enable them to recognize the locality besides which it was advisable to get as far back upon the return journey as possible before daybreak the boys were now riding in front with their father  that is the wood ned said presently i know by those three palm trees growing together in a clump at a short distance in advance i noticed them particularly  where is the house major warrener asked  we ought to see the house dick said and he looked at his brother apprehensively  yes ned said we certainly ought to see it  you are sure you are not mistaken in the locality their father asked  quite sure the boys answered together but the house  let us gallop on major warrener said catching the fear which was expressed in each of his sons faces  five minutes riding and they drew up their horses with a cry of dismay a large patch of wood ashes marked the spot where the house had stood no words were needed the truth was apparent the fugitives had been discovered and the abode of their protectors destroyed their two friends joined the little group and the rest of the troop dismounted at a short distance respecting the deep pain which the discovery had caused to their leader  what is to be done major warrener asked breaking the deep silence  for a moment no one answered and then dick said  perhaps we may find some of the farmers people in the hut where we slept and we may get news from them  a capital thought dick said major warrener we must not give up hope there are no bodies lying about so the farm people are probably alive as to the girls if they are carried off we must rescue them where is the hut  a few minutes walking brought them to it even before they reached it it was evident that it was inhabited for two or three peons were squatted near the door these rose on seeing the group of englishmen but made no attempt at flight they entered the hut without ceremony and ned and dick hurried to the side of an old man lying on a heap of straw while some females standing near hastily veiled themselves at the entrance of the strangers  where are the girls what has happened are you hurt were the three questions poured out rapidly by ned as the boy seized the old mans hands  is it you sahibs i am glad indeed i did not break my promise to come and tell you but as you see and he pointed to the bandage which enveloped his head i was wounded and am still ill  but the girls asked ned  they have been carried off by the troops of the rajah of nahdoor  how long since  thursday sahib  how far off is nahdoor  ten miles sahib  major warrener now took up the interrogation  how is the one who was ill  she was better and was getting stronger again when they carried her off  do you think they are still at nahdoor or that they have been sent into delhi  they are still there the hindoo said i have sent a man each day to watch so that directly i got better i might be able to tell you the truth of the matter my servant has just returned they had not left at three oclock and they would be sure not to start after that hour the rajah will go with his troops in a few days to pay his respects to the emperor he will probably take the mem sahibs with him  thank god for that major warrener said if they have not yet been taken to that horrible den of murder we will save them i am the father of one and the other is my niece he said to the zemindar and i owe their lives so far to you the debt of gratitude i can never pay to youor to your wife and daughter he added turning to the women who their first impulse of alarm over had now in the presence of friends uncovered their faces for it is only the higher class of hindoo women who closely veilfor your care in nursing my niece and for giving them shelter when to do so was to risk your lives this debt i can never pay but the losses you have sustained in the destruction of your house and the loss of animals i can happily more than replace and now tell me how it happened  it was late in the afternoon the hindoo said when a body of horse galloped across the field to my door their captain rode up to me are there any feringhees hid here old man he asked i have seen no man of the white race since the troubles began i said and you know i spoke not falsely i must search the house he said there are a party of fugitives hiding somewhere in this district and the orders from delhi are strict that every feringhee is to be hunted down and sent there you will find no one here i said but my women one of whom is sick i must see them he said and he knocked loudly at the door of the womens room and ordered them to come out my wife and daughter came to the door where is the one who is said to be sick he said i must see her too then seeing that he was determined to enter the young mem sahib came to the door the captain gave a shout of pleasure calling in his men he entered the room and in spite of the entreaties of her sister brought the one who was sick out also she was able to walk but as we had agreed between us should be done if discovery was made she pretended that she was almost at the point of death some poles were got a hammock was made and borne by four bearers she was carried away her sister being placed on a horse closely guarded as he turned to ride off the captains eye fell upon me ah old traitor he said i had forgotten you and he drew a pistol and fired at me i know no more his men put fire to the barn and granaries and drove off our cattle and horses when he had ridden off my servantswho thought i was deadby order of my sorrowing wife carried me here happily however by the will of brahma the bullet instead of going through my skull glanced off and i was only stunned i had lost much blood but i determined to set out as soon as i could walk to bring you the news and in the meantime have had a watch kept upon nahdoor  major warrener and his sons thanked the old peasant and his family in the warmest terms for what they had done and the former pressed upon the farmer a sum of money which would cover all the losses he had sustained  your conduct he said will be reported to the government and you will find when these troubles are over that england knows how to reward those who proved faithful when so many were faithless now we will say adieu when the war is over the ladies you have so kindly treated will themselves return to thank you  in a few minutes the troop was in the saddle again and directed its march toward nahdoor  on the way major warrener questioned his guide as to the strength and position of the fortress which lay away from the main road and had not been visited by any of the troopas the major had ascertained before starting the account was not reassuring the guide reported that it stood on a rock which rose perpendicularly some eighty or a hundred feet from the plain the only access being by a zigzag road cut in the face of the cliff with a gateway defended by a gun and loopholed walls at each turn and with a very strong wall all round the edge of the rock the garrison they had learned from the persons at the farm was some three hundred strong the ordinary number of retainers being at present increased by many fighting men who had within the last few days joined the rajah on hearing that he was going to march to delhi to fight under the emperor against the feringhees  the troop halted in a wood three miles from nahdoor as the guide said that there was no place nearer where they could be concealed without a certainty of discovery  before morning major warrener and his second in command put on native clothes which the former bad brought with him in case it should be necessary to open communication with the girls and left the wood with one of the native guides the disguises were not meant to deceive close investigation and no attempt was made to change the color of the skin but they were sufficient to enable the wearers to pass without exciting suspicion by any one who only saw them at a distance  when morning broke they stood within half a mile of the fortress which answered exactly to the description they had received of it gradually keeping always at a distance and availing themselves as far as possible of coverthey made a circuit of the place and then returned to the troop who were anxiously awaiting their report  it is a very hard nut to crack major warrener said to his sons there is no possibility of climbing the rock anywhere or of attacking in any way except by the regular ascent there are eight gateways to be forced before arriving at the main entrance through the walls we should require petards to blow in gates and ought to have field guns to drive them out of the gatehouses i do not say it would be absolutely impossible because before now british troops have done what seemed impossible in india but the difficulties would be so enormous the risk of failure so great and the loss certainly so crushing that i should not be justified in undertaking such a desperate adventure on my own responsibility and for my own private ends we have no right boys to cause the loss of some thirty or forty of these fine young fellows even to rescue the girls an attack by surprise is the only possibility at present we dont see the way but something may turn up to help us failing that our only plan is to wait till the rajah starts with his following and the girls for delhi and then to attack them on their way the drawback to this is that he may not leave for days and that at any moment we may be discovered besides there is the difficulty of feeding the horses and ourselves now boys you know as much as i do think it over while i have a talk with dunlop and manners  manners is at the other end of the wood father half a mile away we found after you had gone that the main delhi road ran through the further skirts of the wood so manners suggested to lieutenant simmons that he should go with ten men and hide there so that they could see who went along the road and perhaps intercept some messenger between delhi and nahdoor  a capital idea major warrener said  two hours later captain manners returned with his party bringing in two prisoners  who have you there manners major warrener asked  two of the rascally third cavalry who mutinied at meerut this fellow as you see is a native officer there were two of them and two sowars but they showed fight when we surrounded them and tried to ride through us so we had to shoot two of them they are bearers of a letter from the delhi prince to the rajah here it is  major warrener looked sternly at the prisoners who were still wearing their british uniform and then ordered them to be taken away and hung at once  what did you do with the others manners  we hid their bodies under some bushes at a distance from the road  you must go back the major said with another take larkin with you you must strip off the uniforms and bring them here  half an hour later major warrener summoned the captains of his two troops and took them into council  nothing could be more fortunate than this capture he said it seems to clear the way for us altogether what i propose to do is this that two of the best linguists of the troop with the two native guides should dress in the uniforms of these scoundrels they can then go boldly in with the letter from the prince they will of course be well received and will stay for the night the two who go as officers will be entertained by the rajah and will learn the plan of the state apartments the other two will be made welcome by the retainers when all is quiet at night they must steal out and wait on the wall that projecting watchtower that overhangs the cliff on the other side would be the best we will be below then a rope must be lowered we have two long picketing ropes either of which would be long enough but they would be too bulky to carry in without suspicion our native guides however will soon tear up some cloth and twist a rope not much thicker than string but strong enough to hold the rope then the string can be twisted round the body without fear of detection and when the time comes lowered with a stone at the end we shall be below with a strong rope ladder made with the picketropes and bamboo staves and once fixed we shall be up in no time i leave it to you to decide who are the best linguists they must of course be asked if they are willing to undertake it i will speak to the guides what do you think of the general plan  excellent the officers said it might be as well one suggested that each of the party should have a light rope wound round him so that if one two or even three could not slip away the fourth could still carry out the plan  some other details were arranged and then the officers went to pick out the two men who could best pass as natives there was no difficulty upon this score for two of the troop who had for years commanded large police districts spoke the language as perfectly as natives and these upon being asked readily accepted the duty the work of making the rope ladders and the light ropes for hauling them up was entered upon and by sunset all were ready for the expedition  it was fortunate that they had no longer to stay in the wood for during the day five or six natives who came in to gather wood had to be seized and bound and it was certain that a search would be set on foot there next morning fortunately a large field of indian corn bordered one side of the wood and from this both man and horse had satisfied their hunger  every detail of the plan was carefully considered and discussed so that no mistake could occur and each of the principal actors in the piece had his part assigned to him the two native guides who had themselves served as soldiers in native regiments consented willingly to perform their parts and just at sunset the two officers and men rode off to nahdoor bearing the letter from the prince of delhi to the rajah  there was high feasting in nahdoor that night the rajah had received with all honor the officers from delhi the letter from the prince had promised him a high command in the army which was to exterminate the last infidel from the land it had thanked him for the capture of the white women and had begged him to bring them on with him to delhi and to come at once with his own force from the officers the rajah had heard how the mutiny was everywhere a success and that at lucknow and cawnpore the troops would rise in a day or two and massacre all the whites the evening ended early for the officers from delhi were fatigued with their long ride and being shown into a little square marblelined room off the great hall where they had supped were soon apparently asleep on the cushions and shawls spread for them the rajah retired to his apartments and his officers to their quarters and although for another hour talking and laughing went on round the little fires in the courtyard presently these too were hushed and a profound stillness fell upon nahdoor then barefooted the officers from delhi stole out of their apartment and made for the outer wall as they had anticipated they found no one about beyond a sentry at the lower gate there would be no watch kept and they reached the watchtower on the wall without the slightest interruption here two other figures had already arrived and after throwing down some small stones as a signal which was answered by a faint whistle the ropes were lowered without delay one of them was soon seized from below and the others being also found and fastened to the rope ladder the weight of which was considerable those above began to draw up everything succeeded admirably one by one fifty men appeared at the top of the wall quietly they made their way down to the courtyard and broke up into parties taking their places at the entrance to the various buildings then all further need for concealment being at an end a bugle call sounded loud in the air it was answered by another down upon the plain near the gate the rajah himself was one of the first to rash out he was seized and disarmed before he was aware of what had happened  tell your men to throw down their arms and surrender major warrener said to him or we will put you and every soul here to the sword the place is surrounded and there is no escape do you not hear our bugles on the plain  it needed not the rajahs order the garrison taken utterly by surprise and finding the castle captured by an enemy of unknown strength threw down their arms as they came out of their quarters orders were sent by the rajah to the men at the various gates on the hill to come up and lay down their arms and the sentry at the lowest of all was to open it to the troops there a bugler and ten men were left below and the rest joined the party in the castle  long ere they had arrived the joyful meeting of the captives and their friends had taken place rose and kate had awoke at the sound of the bugle but had heeded it little believing that it was only a sepoy call even the stir and commotion outside had not disturbed them and they had lain quiet until they heard a loud knocking at the door of the womens apartments followed by screams from the women and thenthey could scarcely believe their earstheir names shouted in major warreners voice with a cry of delight both sprang up and seizing shawls rushed to the door and in another moment kate was in the arms of her father  we are all here dear he said after the first wild greetingthe boys and dunlop and manners hurry on your clothes darlings they are longing to see you  the garrison of the castle were all collected in one of the smaller courts where twenty troopers revolver in hand kept guard over them the whole of the arms found in the castle were broken to pieces and thrown over the walls and the cannon planted there were first spiked and then pitched over the guns on the gates were similarly rendered useless and the stores of gunpowder all wetted the rajah and his two sons boys of six and eight were then told to prepare to accompany the troops and warning was given that they would be shot in case an attack was made upon the force as it returned to meerut  tell your followers this major warrener said and order them to give no alarm or to spread the news for if we are caught your life and that of your sons will pay forfeit as it is you may hope for clemency you have as yet taken no part in the insurrection and although there is no doubt of your intention your good conduct in the future may perhaps wipe out the memory of your faults  it needs not to say anything of the rapturous greeting of the girls and their brothers and lovers or the happy halfhour which was spent together in the great hall while the preparations for the departure were being made outside captain kent saw to all that there was to be done leaving the major free to join the happy party within  are you strong enough to ride rose  oh i think so uncle i have been shamming ill and they thought i could not walk but i am pretty strong and if i cant ride by myself i must be tied on to some one else  i dare say my horse will carry double captain manners said laughing  have the women here been kind major warrener asked  the girls shook their heads  not very papa they have been talking of delhi and kate shuddered  the major frowned he could guess what they must have suffered he went to the door  kent order the women out of the zenana into one of the other rooms tell them that they will all be searched as they come out and that if one brings out an ornament or a jewel with her she will be put to death of course you will not search them but the threat will do let no insult be offered them then let rivers take four men and go in and take all the loot you can find the jewels we will divide among the men when at meerut tell off another party to loot the rest of the rooms but only take what is really valuable and portable we cannot cumber ourselves with baggage it would serve the rajah right if i were to burn his castle down he may think himself lucky to get off with his life  the girls pleaded for the women we bear them no illfeeling they said they are very ignorant they only acted as they were taught  well well said the major we will take the jewels alone they are a fair loot  another hour and the troops were already well on their way on the delhi road the good luck which had attended them so far followed them to the end anxious to avoid an encounter with the enemy they took an even more circuitous route than that by which they had come and on the fourth afternoon after leaving rode into meerut where their arrival after the long and successful expedition created quite an excitement a comfortable house was found for the girls with some old friends of the major who resided permanently at meerut as for the major and his troops they prepared to accompany the column which was on the point of marching against delhi     chapter vii  delhi   never did a government or a people meet a terrible disaster with a more undaunted front than that displayed by the government and british population of india when the full extent of the peril caused by the rising of the sepoys was first clearly understood by the rising of delhi and of the whole country down to allahabad the northern part of india was entirely cut off from calcutta and was left wholly to its own resources any help that could be spared from the capital was needed for the menaced garrisons of allahabad benares and agra while it was certain that the important stations of cawnpore and lucknow in the newlyannexed province of oude would at best be scarcely able to defend themselves and would in all probability urgently require assistance thus the rebel city of delhi the center and focus of the insurrection was safe from any possibility of a british advance from the south nor did it look as if the position of the english was much better in the north at sealkote lahore and many other stations the sepoys mutinied and the sikh regiments were disturbed and semimutinous it was at this allimportant moment that the fidelity of two or three of the great sikh chieftains saved british india foremost of them was the rajah of puttiala who when the whole sikh nation was wavering as to the course it should take rode into the nearest british station with only one retainer and offered his whole force and his whole treasury to the british government a halfdozen other prominent princes instantly followed the example and from that moment northern india was not only safe but was able to furnish troops for the siege of delhi the sikh regiments at once returned to their habitual state of cheerful obedience and served with unflinching loyalty and bravery through the campaign  not a moment was lost as it was allimportant to make an appearance before delhi and so by striking at the heart of the insurrection to show the waverers all over india that we had no idea of giving up the game the main force was collected at umballah under general anson transport was hastily got together and in the last week of may this force moved forward while a brigade from meerut advanced to effect a junction with it with this latter force were warreners irregular horse which had returned only the evening before the advance from its successful expedition to nahdoor on the 30th of may the meerut force under brigadiergeneral wilson came in contact with the enemy at ghazeeuddeen nugghur a village fifteen miles from delhi where there was a suspension bridge across the hindur this fight although unimportant in itself is memorable as being the first occasion upon which the mutineers and the british troops met hitherto the sepoys had had it entirely their own way mutiny havoc murder had gone on unchecked but now the tide was to turn never to ebb again until the sepoy mutiny was drowned in a sea of blood upon this their first meeting with the white troops the sepoys were confident of success they were greatly superior in force they had been carefully drilled in the english system they were led by their native regimental officers and they had been for so many years pampered and indulged by government that they regarded themselves as being man for man fully equal to the british thus then they began to fight with a confidence of victory which however great their superiority in numbers was never again felt by the mutineers throughout the war upon many subsequent occasions they fought with extreme bravery but it was the bravery of despair whereas the british soldiers were animated with a burning desire for vengeance and an absolute confidence of victory thus the fight at ghazeeuddeennugghur is a memorable one in the annals of british india  the mutineers seeing the smallness of the british force at first advanced to the attack but they were met with such fury by four companies of the sixtieth rifles supported by eight guns of the artillery by the carbineers and warreners horse that astounded and dismayed they broke before the impetuous onslaught abandoned their intrenchments threw a way their arms and fled leaving five guns in the hands of the victors and in many cases not stopping in their flight until they reached the gates of delhi the next day considerable bodies of fresh troops came out to renew the attack but the reports of the fugitives of the day before of the fury and desperation with which the british troops were possessed had already effected such an impression that they did not venture upon close fighting but after engaging in an artillery duel at long distances fell back again to delhi  on the 7th of june the meerut force joined that from umballah at alipore a short march from delhi and the next morning the little army now under the command of sir h barnardfor general anson overwhelmed by work and responsibility had died a few days before advanced upon the capital of india after four miles march they came at baduleekaserai upon the enemys first line of defense a strong intrenched position held by three thousand sepoys with twelve guns these pieces of artillery were much heavier than the british field guns and as they opened a heavy fire they inflicted considerable damage upon our advancing troops the british however were in no humor for distant fighting they panted to get at the murderers of women and childrenthese men who had shot down in cold blood the officers whose only fault had been their too great kindness to and confidence in them orders were given to the seventyfifth to advance at once and take the position and that regiment giving a tremendous cheer rushed forward with such impetuosity through the heavy fire that as at ghazeeuddeennugghur the sepoys were seized with a panic and fled in wild haste from their intrenchments leaving their cannon behind them  at the foot of the steep hill on which the signal tower stands another and stronger line of defense had been prepared but the mutineers stationed here were infected by the wild panic of the fugitives from the first position and so deserting their position joined in the flight into the city  the british troops had marched from their encampment at alipore at one in the morning and by nine am the last sepoy disappeared within the walls of the town and the british flag flew out on the signal tower on the ridge almost looking down upon the rebel city and the troops took up their quarters in the lines formerly occupied by the thirtyeighth fifty fourth and seventyfourth native regiments as the english flag blew out to the wind from the signal tower a thrill of anxiety must have been felt by every one in delhi from the emperor down to the lowest street ruffian so long as it waved there it was a proof that the british raj was not yet overthrownthat british supremacy although sorely shaken still asserted itselfand that the day of reckoning and retribution would slowly perhaps but none the less surely come for the bloodstained city not only in delhi itself but over the whole of india the eyes of the population were turned toward that british flag on the ridge native and british alike recognized the fact that english supremacy in india depended upon its maintenance that england would send out large reinforcements all knew but they also knew that many an anxious week must elapse before the first soldier from england could arrive within striking distance if the native leaders at delhi with the enormously superior forces at their command could not drive off their besiegers and pluck down the flag from the ridge the time must come when with the arrival of the reinforcements the tide would begin to flow against them so india argued and waited for the result the delhi leaders as well as the english felt the importance of the issue and the one never relaxed their desperate efforts to drive back the besiegersthe other with astonishing tenacity held on against all odds while scores of native chiefs hesitated on the verge waiting until they saw the end of the struggle at delhi it was called the siege of delhi but it should rather have been called the siege of the ridge for it was our force rather than that of the enemy which was besieged never before in the history of the world did three thousand men sit down before a great city inhabited by a quarter of a million bitterly hostile inhabitants and defended moreover by strong walls a very powerful artillery and a welldrilled and disciplined force at first amounting to some ten thousand men but swelled later on as the mutineers poured in from all quarters to three times that force never during the long months which the struggle lasted did we attempt to do more than to hold our own the city was open to the enemy at all sides save where we held our footing large forces marched in and out of the town provisions and stores poured into it and we can scarcely be said to have fired a shot at it until our batteries opened to effect a breach a few days before the final assault  the troops with which sir h barnard arrived before delhi consisted of the seventyfifth regiment six companies of the sixtieth rifles the first bengal fusiliers six companies of the second fusiliersboth composed of white troopsthe sirmoor battalion of goorkhas the sixth dragoon guards the carbineers two squadrons of the ninth lancers and a troop or two of newlyraised irregular horse the artillery consisted of some thirty pieces mostly light fieldguns  upon the day following the occupation of the ridge a welcome accession of strength was received by the arrival of the guides a picked corps consisting of three troops of cavalry and six companies of infantry this little force had marched five hundred and eighty miles in twentytwo days a rate of twentysix miles a day without a breaka feat probably altogether without example especially when it is considered that it took place in india and in the hottest time of the year  the ridge which occupies so important a place in the history of the siege of delhi is a sharp backed hill some half a mile long rising abruptly from the plain from the top a splendid view of delhi and of the country scattered with mosques and tombsthe remains of older delhican be obtained the cantonments lay at the back of this hill a few posts only such as hindoo raos house being held in advance until the work of building batteries and regularly commencing the siege should begin it would have been useless putting the troops unnecessarily under the fire of the heavy guns of the city bastions  when the troops had fairly taken possession of the old native lines on the 8th of june many of them as soon as dismissed from duty made their way up to the flagstaff tower on the highest point of the ridge to look down upon delhi among those who did so were major warrener and his two sons both uttered an exclamation of pleasure as the city came into view  what a superb city  delhi is indeed a glorious city as viewed from the ridge it is surrounded by a lofty crenelated wall strengthened with detached martello towers and with eleven bastions each mounting nine guns the work of our own engineers but in admirable architectural keeping with the towers conspicuous on a high table rock rising almost perpendicularly in the heart of the city is the jumma musjid the great mosque a superb pile of building with its domes and minarets to the left as viewed from the ridge is the great mass of the kings palacea fortress in itselfwith its lofty walls and towers and with its own mosques and minarets these rise thickly too in other parts while near the palace the closely packed houses cease and lofty trees rise alone there the ridge lies on the north of the city and opposite to it is the cashmere gate through which our storming parties would rush later on and away a little to the right is the lahore gate through which the enemys sorties were principally made on the left of the ridge the ground is flat to the river which sweeps along by the wall of the town and palace there are two bridges across it and over them the exulting mutineers were for weeks to pass into the citynot altogether unpunished for our guns carried that far and were sometimes able to inflict a heavy loss upon them as they passed with music playing and flags flying into the town  a glorious city ned warrener said as they looked down upon it what a ridiculous handful of men we seem by the side of it it is like tom thumb sitting down to besiege the giants castle why we should be lost if we got inside  yes indeed ned said his father there will be no possibility of our storming that city until our numbers are greatly increased for if we scaled the walls by assault which we could no doubt do we should have to fight our way through the narrow streets with barriers and barricades everywhere and such a force as ours would simply melt away before the fire from the housetops and windows there is nothing so terrible as street fighting and drill and discipline are there of comparatively little use the enemy will naturally fight with the desperation of rats in a hole and it would be rash in the extreme for us to make the attempt until we are sure of success a disastrous repulse here would entail the loss of all india the news is worse and worse every day from all the stations of the northwest and as the mutineers are sure to make for delhi the enemy will receive reinforcements vastly more rapidly than we shall and it will be all we shall be able to do to hold our own here we may be months before we take delhi  i hope they wont keep us here all that time dick said for cavalry cant do much in a siege besides the ground is all cut up into gardens and inclosures and we could not act even if we had orders to do so  we may be very useful in going out to bring convoys in major warrener replied and to cut off convoys of the enemy to scout generally and to bring in news still i agree with you dick that i hope we may be sent off for duty elsewhere hullo whats that  as he spoke a sudden fire broke out from the walls and bastions shot and shell whizzed over their heads many of them plunging down behind the ridge among the troops who were engaged in getting up their tents while a crackling fire of musketry broke out in the gardens around hindoo raos house our advanced post on the right front  a sortie exclaimed the major come along boys and those who had gathered around the flagstaff dashed down the hill to join their respective corps the sixtieth rifles however of whom two companies held hindoo raos repulsed the sortie and all calmed down again but the enemys artillery continued to play and it was evident that the foe had it in his power to cause great annoyance to all our pickets on the ridge  fortunately our position could only be assailed on one side our cavalry patrolled the plain as far as the river and our rear was covered by a canal possessing but few bridges and those easily guarded it was thus from our right and right front alone that serious attacks could be looked for  the next afternoon a heavy firing broke out near hindoo raos house and the troops got under arms the enemy were evidently in force  an aiddecamp rode up  major warrener you will move up your troop and fall in with the guide cavalry  at a trot warreners horse moved off toward the right the guns on the walls were now all at work and our artillery at hindoo raos were answering them and the shots from a light battery placed by the flagstaff went singing away toward the right  warreners horse were now at the station assigned to them the musketry fire in the gardens and broken ground near hindoo raos was very heavy and a large body of the enemys cavalry was seen extending into the plain with the intention of pushing forward on the right of the ridge  you will charge the enemy at once an aiddecamp said and with a cheer the guides and warreners horse dashed forward  it was the moment they had longed for and the fury with which they charged was too much for the enemy who although enormously superior in numbers halted before they reached them and fled toward the city with the british mixed with them in a confused mass of fighting struggling men the pursuit lasted almost to the walls of the city then the guns on the wall opened a heavy fire and the cavalry fell back as the balls plunged in among them  there were but two or three hurt but among them was lieutenant quentin battye a most gallant young officer a mere lad but a general favorite alike with other officers and the men struck by a round shot in the body his case was hopeless from the first he kept up his spirits to the last and said with a smile to an old schoolfriend who came in to bid him farewell  well old fellow dulce et decorum est pro patriá mori and you see its my case  such was the spirit which animated every officer and man of the little army before delhi and it is no wonder that day after day and week after week they were able to repulse the furious attacks of the everincreasing enemy  on the 9th 10th and 11th fresh sorties were made before daybreak on the 13th a large force of the mutineers came out quietly and worked their way round to the left and just as it began to be light made a furious assault on the company of the seventyfifth who were holding the flagstaff battery warreners horse were encamped on the old paradeground immediately behind and below the flagstaff and the men leaped from their beds on hearing this outburst of firing close to them  there was a confused shouting and then the majors voice was heard above the din  breeches and boots revolvers and swords nothing else quick lads fall in on foot we must save the battery at all hazards  in a few seconds the men came rushing out hastily buckling on their belts with their pouches of revolver ammunition and fell into rank and in less than two minutes from the sound of the first shot the whole were dashing up the steep ascent to the battery where the tremendous musketry fire told them how hardly the seventyfifth were pressed  keep line lads steady shouted the major as they neared the crest now get ready for a charge go right at them dont fire a shot till you are within five paces then give them three barrels of your revolvers then at them with the sword and keep your other shots in case you are pressed hurrah  with a thundering cheer the gallant little band fell on the mutineers many of whom had already made their way into the battery where the handful of white troops were defending themselves with desperation struck with terror and surprise at this sudden attack and by the shower of pistol bullets which swept among them the enemy wavered and broke at the fierce onslaught sword in hand of these new foes while the seventy fifth raising a shout of joy at the arrival of their friends took the offensive swept before them the mutineers who had made their way into the battery and joining the irregulars drove the mutineers astounded and panicstricken at the fierceness of the assault pellmell before them down the hill  the reinforcements had arrived but just in time for captain knox who commanded at this post and nearly half his force had fallen before major warreners band had come up to their aid the next day and the next and the next the sorties from the city were repeated with everincreasing force and fury each fresh body of mutineers who came into the city being required to testify their loyalty to the emperor by heading the attack on his foes desperately the little british force had to fight to maintain their position and their losses were so serious the number of their enemies so large so rapidly increasing that it was clear to all that the most prodigious efforts would be necessary to enable them to hold on until reinforcements arrived and that all idea of an early capture of the city must be abandoned  warreners horse however had no share in these struggles for on the day after the fight at the flagstaff a report spread among them that they were again to start upon an expedition a note had been brought in by a native to the effect that several english ladies and gentlemen were prisoners at the fortress of bithri in oude some hundred and fifty miles from delhi the instructions given to major warrener were that he was to obtain their release by fair means if possible if not to carry the place and release them if it appeared practicable to do so with his small force that he was then to press on to cawnpore communications had ceased with sir h wheeler the officer in command there but it was not known whether he was actually besieged or whether it was merely a severance of the telegraph wire if he could join sir h wheeler he was to do so if not he was to make his way on to form part of the force which general havelock was collecting at allahabad for an advance to cawnpore and lucknow it would be a long and perilous march but the troops were admirably mounted and as they would have the choice of routes open to them and would travel fast it was thought that they might hope to get through in safety and their aid would be valuable either to sir h wheeler or to general havelock  it was a lovely moonlight evening when they started during their stay at delhi they had profiting by their previous expedition got rid of every article of accouterment that could make a noise wooden scabbards had taken the place of steel and these were covered in flannel to prevent rattle should they strike against a stirrup the water bottles were similarly cased in flannel and the rings and chains of the bits in leather nothing save the sound of the horses hoofs was to be heard as they marched and even these were muffled by the deep dust that lay on the road each man moreover carried four leathern shoes for his horse with lacings for fastening them under the guidance of two natives the troop made their first six stages without the slightest adventure the country was flat and the villages sparsely scattered the barking of the dogs brought a few villagers to their doors but in those troubled times the advantages of noninterference were obvious and the peasant population in general asked nothing better than to be let alone  the troop always marched by night and rested by day at villages at a short distance from the main road upon a long march like that before them it would have been impossible to maintain secrecy by resting in woods food for men and horses was requisite and this could only be obtained in villages so far no difficulty had been met with the head men of the villages willingly provided provender for the horses while flour milk eggs and fowls were forthcoming in sufficient quantities for the men everything being strictly paid for  the last night march was as successful as the preceding and crossing the river by a bridge at banat they halted some five miles from the fortified house or castle which was the immediate object of their expedition they were now in oude and had since crossing the river avoided the villages as much as possible for in this province these are little fortresses each is strongly walled and guarded and petty wars and feuds are common occurrences the people are warlike and used to arms and without artillery even a small village could not be carried without considerable loss the troops therefore had made circuits round the villages and bivouacked at the end of their march in a wood having brought with them a supply of food and grain from the village where they had halted on the previous day they had not slept many hours when one of the vedettes came in to say that there was a sound of beating of drums in a large village not far away and that bodies of peasantry had arrived from other villages and that he believed an attack was about to take place  major warrener at once took his measures for defense the first troop were to defend the front of their position with their carbines against an attack the second troop were to move round to the extreme end of the tope were to mount there and when the enemy began to waver before the musketry fire were to sweep round and take them in flank major warrener himself took command of the dismounted troop and posted the men along behind a bank with a hedge a short distance in front of the trees then each man knowing his place they fell back out of the scorching sunshine to the shade of the trees and waited in half an hour a loud drumming was heard and a motley body two or three thousand strong of peasants in a confused mass with a tattered banner or two made their appearance  the avengers as warreners horse called themselves took their places behind the bank and quietly awaited the attack the enemy opened a heavy fire yet at a long distance answer with a shot or two occasionally major warrener had ordered as they will then aim at the bank instead of tiring into the wood we dont want the horses hurt  slowly and steadily the rifled carbines spoke out in answer to the heavy fire opened on the bank and as almost every man of warreners horse was a sportsman and a good shot very few shots were thrown away the enemy beat their drums more and more loudly and shouted vociferously as they advanced when they were within three hundred yards major warrener gave the word  fire fast but dont throw away a shot  astonished at the accuracy and deadliness of the fire which was poured into them by their still invisible foe the enemy wavered their leaders shouting loudly and exposing themselves bravely in front called them on as slowly and with heavy loss the main body arrived within a hundred yards of the hedge those in front were however falling so fast that no efforts of their leaders could get them to advance further and already a retrograde movement had begun when there was a yell of fear as the mounted troop hitherto unnoticed charged furiously down upon their flank  empty your rifles and then to horse shouted major warrener and the men dashed back through the tope to the spot in the rear where four of their number were mounting guard over the horses  in three minutes they were back again on the plain but the fight was over the enemy in scattered bodies were in full flight and the cavalry dashing through them were cutting them down or emptying their revolvers among them  make for the village major warrener said gallop  at full speed the troop dashed across the plain to the village whose gate they reached just as a large body of the fugitives were arriving these gave a yell as this fresh body of horsemen fell upon them a few tried to enter the gates of the village but the main body scattered again in flight the cavalry dashed in through the gates and sabered some men who were trying to close them a few shots were fired inside but resistance was soon over and the male inhabitants who remained dropped over the wall and sought refuge in flight a bugle call now summoned the other troop from pursuit and the women and children being at once without harm or indignity turned out of the village the conquerors took possession  this will be our headquarters for a day or two the major said as the troop gathered round him there is an abundance of food for horse and man and we could stand a siege if necessary  warreners horse was the happiest of military bodies on duty the discipline was severe and obedience prompt and ready off duty there was as among the members of a regimental mess no longer any marked distinction of rank all were officers and gentlemen good fellows and good comrades the best house in the village was set aside for major warrener and the rest of the squadron dispersed in the village quartering themselves in parties of threes and fours among the cleanest looking of the huts eight men were at once put on sentry on the walls two on each side their horses were first looked to fed and watered and soon the village assumed as quiet an aspect as if the sounds of war had never been heard in the land at dark all was life and animation a dozen great fires blazed in the little square in the center of the village and here the men fried their chickens or scraping out a quantity of redhot embers baked their chupatties with much laughter and noise  then there was comparative quiet the sentries on the walls were trebled and outposts placed at a couple of hundred yards beyond the gates men lighted their pipes and chatted round the fires while major warrener and a dozen of the oldest and most experienced of his comrades sat together and discussed the best course to be pursued     chapter viii  a desperate defense   well major what do you think of the situation one of the senior captains asked after the pipes had begun to draw  it looks rather bad crawshay theres no disguising the fact we shall have the country up in force they will swarm out like wasps from every village and by tomorrow night we shall have at the very least ten thousand of them round us against a moderate force we could defend the village but it is a goodsized place and we have only twentyfive men for each wall and a couple of hundred would be none too little  but surely major we might prevent their scaling the walls it is not likely that they would attack on all sides at once and without artillery they could do little  they will have artillery said captain wilkins an officer who had served for some time in oude these talookdars have all got artillery they were ordered to give it up and a good many old guns were sent in but there is not one of these fellows who cannot bring a battery at the very least into the field by tomorrow night or at the latest next day we may have some thirty or forty pieces of artillery round this place  it will not do to be caught like rats in a trap here major warrener said for tonight it is a shelter after that it would be a trap but about bithri i dont like to give up the idea of rescuing our country people there still although the matter has been left to my discretion i cannot risk losing the whole squadron  what is the castle like warrener have you heard captain crawshay asked  a square building with high walls and a deep moat beyond the moat is another wall with a strong outwork and gate there are believed to be a couple of guns on the outwork and eight on the inner wall  do you think they will attack us tomorrow wilkins you know these oude fellows  they will muster strong no doubt and be prepared to attack us if we sally out but i should think if we remain quiet they would wait till next day so as to gather as many men and guns as possible  then you think we ought to be out of this early major warrener asked  i dont say we ought to be major i only say we ought to be if we intend to get off without having to fight our way through them i suppose the bithri man is sure to come out to attack us  oh no doubt major warrener answered he has openly declared against us  the thing would be to pop into his place just as he is thinking of popping in here captain dunlop said laughing  thats a good idea dunlopa capital idea if it could be carried out the question is is it possible  then gradually the plan was elaborated until it finally was definitely arranged as afterward carried into execution  the night passed quietly but fires could be seen blazing in many directions over the plain and occasionally a distant sound of drums or a wild shout came faintly on the still air next morning major warrener started early with half a troop to reconnoiter the country toward bithri the party got to a spot within two miles of the castle and had a look at it and its surroundings and were able to discern that a great deal of bustle was going on around it and that considerable numbers of horse and footmen were gathered near the gate then they rode rapidly back again having to run the gantlet of several bodies of natives who fired at them one party indeed had already placed themselves on the road about a mile from the village but captain kent seeing with his glass what was going on rode out with his troop to meet the little reconnoitering party and the enemy fearing cavalry on the open fell back after a scattering fire but not quickly enough to prevent the horse from cutting up their rear somewhat severely  at eight oclock large bodies of men could be seen approaching the village these when they arrived within gunshot discharged their long matchlocks at the walls with much shouting and gesticulation major warreners order was that not a shot should be returned as it was advisable to keep them in ignorance as to the long range of the enfield carbine  let all get their breakfasts he said and let the horses be well groomed and attended to we shall want all their speed tomorrow  at eleven some elephants surrounded by a large body of horse could be seen across the plain  here come some of the talookdars captain wilkins said i suspect those elephants are dragging guns behind them  yes the fun will soon begin now captain dunlop answered now dick he went on to young warrener you are going to see a little native artillery practice these fellows are not like the delhi pandies who are artillerymen trained by ourselves here you will see the real genuine native product and as the manufacture of shell is in its infancy and as the shot seldom fits the gun within half an inch or even an inch you will see something erratic they may knock holes in the wall but it will take them a long time to cut enough holes near each other to make a breach there do you see there are another lot of elephants and troops coming from the left we shall have the whole countryside here before long ah thats just as we expected they are going to take up their position on that rising ground which you measured this morning and found to be just five hundred yards off our carbines make very decent practice at that distance and you will see we shall astonish them presently  the two forces with elephants reached the rising ground at the same time and there was great waving of flags letting off of muskets and beating of drums while the multitude of footmen cheered and danced  by this time the greater portion of the little garrison were gathered behind the wall this was some two feet thick of rough sundried bricks and mud it was about fourteen feet high against it behind was thrown up a bank of earth five feet high and in the wall were loopholes four feet above the bank at the corners of the walls and at intervals along them were little towers each capable of holding about four men who could fire over the top of the walls in these towers and at the loopholes major warrener placed twenty of his best shots there was a great deal of moving about on the rising ground then the footmen cleared away in front and most of the elephants withdrew and then were seen ten guns ranged side by side close behind them were two elephants with gaudy trappings while others less brilliantly arrayed stood further back  major warrener was in one of the little towers with his second in command and his two sons to act as his orderlies  run boys and tell the men in the other towers to fire at the howdahs of the chief elephants let the rest of them fire at the artillery tell them to take good aim and fire a volley i will give the word make haste i want first shot that will hurry them and they will fire wild  the boys started at a run one each way and in a minute the instructions were given the major glanced down saw that every carbine was leveled and gave the word  fire  the sound of the volley was answered in a few seconds by a yell of dismay from the enemy one of the state elephants threw up its trunk and started at a wild gallop across the plain and a man was seen to fall from the howdah as it started there was also confusion visible in the howdahs of the other elephants several men dropped at the guns some surprised and startled fired wildly most of the balls going high over the village while others whose loading was not yet complete ran back from the guns only one ball hit the wall and made a ragged hole of a foot in diameter  thats sickened them for the present captain dunlop said i expect theyll do nothing now till it gets a bit cooler for even a nigger could hardly stand this ah we are going to give them another volley this time a stronger one  fifty carbines spoke out this time and the wildest confusion was caused among the elephants and footmen who were now trying to drag the guns back again a third volley and then the garrison were dismissed from their posts and told to lie down and keep cool till wanted again  half an hour later another large train of elephants ten of them with guns came from the direction of bithri and proceeded to a tope at about a mile from the village there the elephants of the first comers had gathered after the stampede and presently a great tent was raised in front of the tope  bithri is going to do it in style dick laughed to his brother i shouldnt mind some iced sherbet at present if he has got any to spare  look dick there is a movement they are getting the guns in position on that knoll a little to the right and a hundred yards or so in front of their tent  dick took the fieldglass which his brother handed him  yes we shall have a salute presently but they wont breach the wall this afternoon at that distance  twenty guns opened fire upon the village and the shot flew overhead or buried themselves in the ground in front or came with heavy thuds against the wall or in some instances crashed into the upper parts of the houses after an hours firing it slackened a little and finally died out for the heat was tremendous  at three oclock there was a move again ten of the guns were brought forward to a point about a thousand yards from the wall while ten others were taken round and placed on the road at about the same distance so as to command the gate again the fire opened and this time more effectually again the men were called to the loopholes the greater portion of them were armed not with the government carbines but with sporting rifles shortened so as to be carried as carbines and although none of the weapons were sighted for more than six hundred yards all with sufficient elevation could send balls far beyond that distance ten of the bestarmed men were told off against each battery of artillery and a slow steady fire was opened it was effective for with the field glasses men could be seen to fall frequently at the guns and the fire became more hurried but much wilder and even less accurate than it had hitherto been the rest of the men with the exception of ten told off for special duty were dispersed round the walls to check the advance of the footmen who crept daringly to within a short distance and kept up a rolling fire around the village  at five oclock half of the men were taken off the walls and several were set to build a wall four feet high in a semicircle just inside the gate which had been struck by several shots and showed signs of yielding two or three of the nearest huts were demolished rapidly there being plenty of native tools in the village and a rough wall was constructed of the materials a trench five feet deep and eight feet wide was simultaneously dug across the entrance at six oclock just as the wall was finished an unlucky shot struck one of the doorposts and the gate fell dragging the other post with it a distant yell of triumph came through the air  the gates fell partly across the trench now lads push them back a bit if you can if not knock the part over the ditch to pieces its half smashed already  it was easier to knock the gate already splintered with shot to pieces than to remove it  now dunlop fetch one of those powderbags we brought for blowing up the gates put it in the trench with a long train you attend to the train and when i give the word fire it bring up those two big pots of boiling water to the gatetowers captain kent thirty men of your troop will hold the other three walls but if you hear my dogwhistle every man is to leave his post and come on here at a run thirty men more will man this front wall and towers they are to direct their fire to check the crowd pushing forward behind those immediately assaulting the remaining forty will fire through the loopholes as long as possible and will then form round the breastwork and hold it to the last one man in each gatetower when the enemy reach the gate will lay down his carbine and attend to the boiling water let them each have a small pot as a ladle but let them throw the water on those pressing toward the gate not on those who have reached it those are our affair  in five minutes every man was at his post and a sharp fire from the seventy men along the front wall opened upon the masses of the enemy who came swarming toward the gate the effect on the crowd many thousand strong was very severe for each shot told but the mussulmen of oude are courageous and the rush toward the gate continued fast as those in front fell the gaps were imperceptible in the swarming crowd major warreners band of forty men were called away from the loopholes and were drawn up behind the ditch and as the head of the assaulting crowd neared the gate volley after volley rang out and swept away the leaders foremost among whom were a number of sepoys who when their regiments mutinied had returned to their homes and now headed the peasantry in their attack upon the british force when the dense mass arrived within thirty yards of the gate major warrener gave the word and a retreat was made behind the breastwork on with wild shouts came the assailants the first few saw the trench and leaped it those who followed fell in until the trench was full then the crowd swept in unchecked the defenders had laid by their carbines now and had drawn their revolvers they were divided into two lines who were alternately to take places in front and fire while those behind loaded their revolvers the din as the circle inclosed by the low wall filled with the assailants was prodigious the sharp incessant crack of the revolver the roll of musketry from the walls the yells of the enemy the shrieks which occasionally rose outside the gate as the men in the towers scattered the boiling water broadcast over them formed a chaos with the fury and despair of cornered wild beasts the enemy fought striving to get over the wall which so unexpectedly barred their way but their very numbers and the pressure from behind hampered their efforts  if a man in the front line of defenders had emptied his revolver before the one behind him had reloaded he held his place with the sword  the walls giving from the pressure dick exclaimed to his father and the latter put his whistle to his lips and the sound rang out shrill and high above the uproar  a minute later the front of the wall tottered and fell then major warrener held up his hand and captain dunlop who had stood all the time quietly watching him fired the train a thundering explosion a flight of bodies and fragments of bodies through the air a yell of terror from the enemy and then as those already rushing triumphantly through the breach stood paralyzed the british fell upon them sword in hand the men from the other walls came rushing up eager to take their part in the fray and the enemy inside the gate were either cut down or driven headlong through it  the crowd beyond already shaken by the murderous fire that the party on the walls kept up unceasingly upon them while they stood unable to move from the jam in front had recoiled through their whole mass at the explosion and the sight of the handful of their comrades flying through the gate completed the effect with yells of rage and discomfiture each man turned and fled while the defenders of the gateway passed out and joined their fire to that of their comrades above on the flying foe  thank god it is all over major warrener said but it has been hot while it lasted have we had many casualties  the roll was soon called and it was found that the besieged had escaped marvelously one young fellow a civil servant had been shot through the head by a stray ball entering the loophole through which he was firing thirteen of the defenders of the gateway were wounded with pistol shots or with sword cuts but none of the injuries were of a serious character  it was now rapidly becoming dark and major warrener mounted one of the towers to have a last look  the enemy had rallied at a distance from the walls and two fresh bodies of troops with elephants were to be seen approaching from the distance  that is all right he said they will wait and renew the attack to morrow  an hour afterward it was night the moon had not risen yet and major warrener had a huge bonfire lighted outside the gate with posts and solid beams from the fallen gates and from the houses  that will burn for hours he said quite long enough for our purpose  lights could be seen scattered all over the side of the plain on which the tents were erected some of them coming up comparatively close to the walls on the road in front but far enough to be well beyond the light of the fire voices could be heard and occasionally a shout that they would finish with the infidel dogs tomorrow rose on the air evidently by the low buzz of talk there were a large number here and probably the guns had been brought closer to check any attempt on the part of the little garrison to dash through their enemies the blazing fire however throwing as it did a bright light upon the empty gateway through which they must pass showed that at present at least the besieged had no idea of making their escape  at nine oclock the whole of the garrison stood to their horses not only had their feet been muffled with the leather shoes but cloths of which there were plenty in the village had been wound round them until their footfalls would even on the hardest road have been noiseless then major warrener led the way to the spot where ten men had been at work during the afternoon  at this point which was on the side furthest from that upon which was the main camp of the enemy a clump of trees and bushes grew close to the wall outside behind them a hole in the wall wide enough and high enough for a horse to pass through easily had been made and the ditch behind had been filled up with rubbish there was no word spoken every one had received his orders and knew what to do and as silently as phantoms the troop passed through each man leading his horse once outside the bushes they formed fours and went forward still leading their horsesas these were less likely to snort with their masters at their heads  ten minutes walking convinced them that they had little to fear and that no guards had been set on that side it was regarded by the enemy as so certain that the english would not abandon their horses and fly on foot only to be overtaken and destroyed the next day that they had only thought it necessary to watch the gateway through which as they supposed the british must if at all escape on horseback  the troop now mounted and trotted quietly away making a wide detour and then going straight toward bithri the moon had risen and when about a mile and a half in front they could see the castle major warrener who with captain kent and the native guides was riding ahead held up his hand the troop came to a halt  there are some bullockcarts just ahead take the mufflings off your horses feet and ride on by yourself he said to one of the native guides and see what is in the wagons and where they are going  the man did as ordered but he needed no questions the wagons were full of wounded men going to bithri he passed on with a word of greeting turned his horse when he reached a wood a little in front and allowed them to pass and then rode back to the troop  four bullockcarts full of wounded sahib  the very thing major warrener exclaimed nothing could be more lucky  orders were passed down the line that they were to ride along until the leaders were abreast of the first cart then to halt and dismount suddenly the drivers were to be seized gagged and bound the wounded were not to be injured  these men are not mutinous sepoys with their hands red with the blood of women major warrener said they are peasants who have fought bravely for their country and have done their duty according to their light     chapter ix  save by a tiger   the drivers of the bullockcarts were startled at the noiseless appearance by their side of a body of horsemen still more startled when suddenly that phantomlike troop halted and dismounted the rest was like a dream in an instant they were seized bound and gagged and laid down in the field at some distance from the road one of them however being ungagged and asked a few questions before being finally left the wounded all past offering the slightest resistance were still more astonished when their captors whom the moonlight now showed to be white instead of cutting their throats as they expected lifted them tenderly and carefully from the wagons and laid them down on a bank a short distance off  swear by the prophet not to call for aid or to speak should any one pass the road for one hour was the oath administered to each and all who were still conscious swore to observe it then with the empty wagons the troops proceeded on their way at the last clump of trees a quarter of a mile from the castle there was another halt the troop dismounted led their horses some little distance from the road and tied them to the trees twenty men remained as a guard four of the others wrapped themselves up so as to appear at a short distance like natives and took their places at the bullocks heads and the rest crowded into the wagons covering themselves with their cloaks to hide their light uniforms then the bullocks were again set in motion across the plain so careless were the garrison that they were not even challenged as they approached the gate of the outworks and without a question the gate swung back  more wounded the officer on guard said this is the third lot those children of sheitan must have been aided by their father ah treachery he cried as the first cart moving into the moonlight beyond the shadow of the gateway he saw the white faces of the supposed wounded  there was a leap from the nearest driver upon him and he was felled to the ground but the man at the open gate had heard the cry and drew a pistol and fired it before he could be reached then the british leaped from the carts and twenty of them scattered through the works cutting down those who offered resistance and disarming the rest these were huddled into the guardroom and five men with cocked revolvers placed at the door with orders to shoot them down at the first sign of movement  the garrison in the castle itself had been alarmed by the shots and shouts were heard and loud orders and the sentries over the gate discharged their muskets there was little time given them to rally however for captain kent with four of his men had on leaping from the cart made straight across the drawbridge over the moat for the gateway to which they attached the petards which they had brought with them then they ran back to the main body who stood awaiting the explosion in a few seconds it came and then with a cheer the troops dashed across the drawbridge and in through the splintered gate there was scarcely any resistance taken utterly by surprise and being numerically inferior to their assailantsfor nearly all the fighting men had gone out with their lordthe frightened retainers tried to hide themselves rather than to resist and were speedily disarmed and gathered in the courtyard  major warrener informed by the bullock drivers of the quarter in which the europeans were confined followed by a dozen men made his way straight to it and had the delight of being greeted by the voices of his countrymen and women these were as reported three officers and five ladies all of whom were absolutely bewildered by the surprise and suddenness of their rescue  there was no time for explanation the stables were ransacked and eight of the rajahs best horses taken then when all was ready for starting major warrener proceeded to the door of the womens apartments here in obedience to the order he had sent her the wife of the talookdar veiled from head to foot and surrounded by her attendants stood to await the orders of her captor  madam said captain wilkins who spoke the dialect in use in oude major warrener the british officer in command bids me tell you that this castle with you and all that it contains are in his power and that he might give it to the flames and carry you off as hostage but he will not do this the rajah of bithri is a brave man but he is wrong to fight against fate the english raj will prevail again and all who have rebelled will be punished we treat him as a brave but mistaken enemy and as we have spared his castle and his family so we hope that he in turn will behave kindly to any englishman or woman who may fall into his hands or may ask his aid lastly let no one leave this castle till daybreak for whoever does so we will slay without mercy  then turning round again warrener and his companions returned to the courtyard the moment the castle was entered and opposition quelled half the troops had run back for the horses and in twenty minutes from the arrival of the bullockcarts at the gateway of bithri the last of its captors filed out from its walls and trotted off into the darkness day broke before any of the inhabitants of bithri dared issue from its walls then a horseman took the news on to the camp the artillery increased now to thirtysix guns had already opened upon the village ere he reached the great tent on the plain the rajah could not credit the intelligence that the enemy had escaped that his castle had been attacked and carried and the white prisoners released but his surprise and fury were overpowered by the delight he felt at the news that his women and children were safe and his ancestral dwelling uninjured the english are a great people he said stroking his beard then issuing from his tent he told the news like wildfire it ran through the camp and as none of the thousands gathered there had his feelings of gratitude and relief to soften their anger and disappointment the fury of the multitude was unbounded  with a wild rush they made for the gatealmost blocked with their dead scoured the little village and soon discovered the hole through which the besieged had escaped then with wild yells three thousand horsemen set off in pursuit but it was six oclock now and the fugitives had got seven hours start the rajah of bithris contingent took no part in the pursuit on issuing from his tent he had after telling the news briefly given orders for his tents to be struck and for all his troops to return at once to the castle toward which he himself accompanied by his bodyguard set out on his elephant of state  major warrener and his troops had no fear of pursuit new foes might be met but with horses fresh and in good condition and six hours start for they were confident that no pursuit could commence before daybreak at the earliestthey felt safe from the enemy who had just attacked them especially as these could not know the direction which they were pursuing and would believe that their aim would be to return with their rescued friends to delhi instead of proceeding through the heart of oude the party whom they had found at bithri consisted of mr hartford a deputy commissioner with his wife and two daughters of a mrs pearson and her sister the former the wife of a district magistrate who had been absent on duty when the rising at the little station at which they lived took place and of captain harper and lieutenant jones who were the officers of the detachment there the men native cavalry had ridden off without injuring their officers but the fanatical people of the place had killed many of the residents and fired their bungalows some had escaped on horseback or in carriages and the present party keeping together had when near bithri been seized and brought in to the chief who intended to take them with him to lucknow whenan event of which he daily expected newsthe little body of english there were destroyed by the forces gathering round them the captives had heard what was doing both at lucknow and cawnpore at the latter place not only had the native troops mutinied but the rajah of bithoor nana sahib whom the english had regarded as a firm friend had joined them sir hugh wheeler with the officers of the revolted regiments the civilians of the station and forty or fifty white troops having some eight hundred women and children in their charge were defending a weak position against thousands of the enemy provided with artillery  when after riding thirty miles the party stopped at daybreak at a ruined temple standing in its grove at a distance from the main road major warrener called his officers into council to determine what was the best course to adopt under the circumstances should they dash through the lines of the besiegers of cawnpore or should they make for agra or endeavor to join the force which was being collected at allahabad to march to their relief  finally and very reluctantly the latter course was decided upon it was agreedand the truth of their conclusion was proved by the fact that throughout the mutiny there was no single instance of the rebels however numerous carrying a position held by any body of englishmenthat sir hugh wheeler and his force could probably hold the intrenchments against any assault that the enemy could make and that if forced to surrender it would probably be from want of supplies in that case the arrival of a hundred men would be a source of weakness rather than of strength the reinforcement would not be of sufficient strength to enable the garrison incumbered as it was with women and children to cut its way out while there would be a hundred more mouths to fill it was therefore resolved to change their course to avoid cawnpore and to make direct for allahabad with the news of the urgent strait in which sir hugh wheeler was placed and of the necessity for an instant advance to his relief  cawnpore was now but forty miles away and lucknow was about the same distance but in a different direction and as they stretched themselves on the ground and prepared for sleep they could distinctly hear the dull faint sounds that told of a heavy artillery fire at which of the stations or if at both the firing was going on they could not tell but in fact it was at cawnpore as this was the 25th of june and the siege of the lucknow residency did not begin in earnest until the 30th of that month  the course had now to be decided upon and maps were consulted and it was determined to cross the river at sirapore it was agreed too that they should at the first village they passed through that evening question the inhabitants as to the bodies of rebels moving about and find out whether any large number were stationed at any of the bridges  at nine oclock in the evening they were again in the saddle and an hour later halted at a village there several of the men were examined separately and their stories agreed that there were no large bodies of sepoys on the line by which they proposed to travel but that most of the talookdars were preparing to march to lucknow and cawnpore when the british were destroyed having thus learned that the bridge by which they intended to cross was open to them the troop again proceeded on their way leaving the village lost in astonishment as to where this body of british horse could have come from  upon this nights ride ned and dick warrener were on rearguardthat is to say they rode together some two hundred yards behind the rest of the squadron  an hour after leaving the village as they were passing through a thick grove of trees some figures rose as from the ground ned was knocked off his horse by a blow with the buttend of a gun and dick before he had time to shout or make a movement in his defense was dragged from his horse his head wrapped in a thick cloth and his arms bound then he could feel himself lifted up and rapidly carried off after a time he was put on his legs and the covering of his head removed he found ned beside him and a word of congratulation that both were alive was exchanged then a rope was placed round each of their necks and surrounded by their captors two of whom rode their horses they were started at a run with admonitions from those around them that any attempt to escape or to shout would be punished with instant death  for full two hours they were hurried along and then the party halted at the edge of a thick jungle lighted a fire and began to cook the prisoners were allowed to sit down with their captors these were matchlockmen on their way to join the forces besieging the residency at cawnpore toward which town they had been making their way as the boom of the guns sounded sharper and clearer every mile that they traveled ned gathered from the talk that their capture was the effect of pure accident the party had sat down in the wood to eat when they heard a troop of horsemen passing a word or two spoken in english as the leaders came along sufficed to show the nationality of the troop and the band lay quiet in the bushes until as they supposed all had passed they had risen to leave when the two last horsemen came in view and these they determined to capture and carry off if possible hoping to get a considerable reward from nan a sahib on their arrival at cawnpore  nana sahibs name had not as yet that terrible history attached to it which rendered it execrated wherever the english tongue is spoken but the boys had heard that after pretending to be the friend of the whites he was now leading the assault against them and that he was therefore a traitor and fighting as it were with a rope round his neck at the hands of such a man they had no mercy to expect  it is of no use trying to make a bolt ned  not the least in the world the two fellows next to us are appointed to watch us dont you see they are sitting with their guns across their knees we should be shot down in a moment  there was a debate among the band whether to push on to cawnpore at once but they had already made a long days journey and moreover thought that they could create a greater effect by arriving with their prisoners by daylight the fire was made up and the men wrapped themselves in their clothsthe native of india almost invariably sleeps with his head covered and looking more like a corpse than a living being anxiously the boys watched in hopes that their guards would follow the example they showed however no signs of doing so but sat talking over the approaching destruction of the english rule and of the restoration of the mohammedan power  two hours passed the fire burned low and the boys in spite of the danger of their position were just dropping off to sleep when there was a mighty roara rush of some great body passing over thema scream of one of the nativesa yell of terror from the rest a tiger stood with one of the guards in his mouth growling fiercely and giving him an occasional shake as a cat would shake a mouse while one of his paws held down the prostrate figure of the other  there was a wild stampedemen tumbled over and over each other in their efforts to escape from the terrible presence and then getting to their feet started off at full speed for a moment the boys had lain paralyzed with the sudden advent of the terrible maneater and then had like the rest darted away  to the jungle ned exclaimed and in an instant they had plunged into the undergrowth and were forcing their way at full speed through it man eating tigers are rarely found in pairs and there was little fear that another was lurking in the wood and even had such been the case they would have preferred death in that form to being murdered in cold blood by the enemy presently they struck on a track leading through the wood and followed it until in five minutes they emerged at the other side as they did so they heard the report of firearms in the direction of their last haltingplace and guessed that the peasants were firing at hazard in hopes of frightening the tiger into dropping his prey as to their own flight it was probable that so far they had been unthought of the first object of the fugitives was to get as far as possible from their late captors who would at daybreak be sure to organize a regular hunt for them and accordingly they ran straight ahead until in threequarters of an hour they came into a wide road then exhausted with their exertions they threw themselves down and panted for breath  dick was the first to speak what on earth are we to do now ned these uniforms will betray us to the first person we meet and we have no means of disguise  we must get as far away as we can before daylight dick and then hide up sooner or later we must throw ourselves on the hospitality of some one and take our chance this is evidently the main road to cawnpore and judging from the guns we cannot be more than ten or twelve miles away it will not do to go back along this road for the fellows we have got away from may strike it below us and follow it up let us go forward along it till we meet a side road and take that  ten minutes walking brought them to a point where a side road came in and taking this they walked steadily on they passed two or three villages which the moonlight enabled them to see before they reached them these they avoided by a detour as the dogs would be sure to arouse the inhabitants and it was only in a solitary abode that they had a chance of being sheltered toward morning they saw ahead a building of considerable size evidently the abode of a person of consequence it was not fortified but behind it was a large inclosure with high walls  i vote we climb over that wall ned there are several trees growing close up to it if they hunt the country round for us they will never look inside there and i expect that there is a garden and we are sure to find a hidingplace then if the owner comes out we can if he looks a decent chap throw ourselves on his hands  i think that a good idea dick the sooner we carry it out the better for in another halfhour day will be breaking  illustration a tiger stood with one of the guards in his mouth growling fiercely  they made a detour round to the back of the building and after some search found a tree growing close enough to the wall to assist them this they climbed got along a branch which extended over the top of the wall and thence dropped into the garden here there were pavilions and fountains and wellkept walks with great clumps of bushes and flowering shrubs well calculated for concealment into one of these they crept and were soon fast asleep  it was late in the afternoon when they awoke roused by the sound of laughter and of the chatter of many voices  good gracious ned exclaimed we have got into the womens garden  in another minute a group of women came in sight the principal figure was a young woman of some twentytwo or twentythree and with a red wafer like patch on her forehead very richly dressed  she is a hindoo ned whispered what luck  there are indeed very few hindoos in oude and the mohammedan being the dominant race a hindoo would naturally feel far more favorably inclined toward a british fugitive than a mohammedan would be likely to do as the triumph of the rebellion could to them simply mean a restoration of mohammedan supremacy in place of the far more tolerant british rule  next to the ranee walked an old woman who had probably been her nurse and was now her confidante and adviser the rest were young women clearly dependants  and so ahrab we must give up our garden and go into cawnpore and in such weather too  it must be so indeed the elder woman said these mohammedans doubt us and so insist on your highness showing your devotion to the cause by taking up your residence in cawnpore and sending in all your retainers to join in the attack on the english  the ranee looked sad  they say there are hundreds of women and little children there she said and that the english who are defending them are few  it is so ahrab said but they are brave the men of the nana and the old regiments are fifty to one against them and the cannon fire night and day and yet they do not give way a foot  they are men the english sahibs  while they were speaking the two chief personages of the party had taken their seats in a pavilion close to the spot where the young warreners were hidden  ned translated the purport of the talk to dick and both agreed that the way of safety had opened to them  seeing that their mistress was not in the humor for laughter and mirth and would rather talk quietly with her chief friend and adviser the attendants gradually left them and gathered in a distant part of the garden  then ned and dick crept out of their hidingplace and appeared suddenly at the entrance to the pavilion where they fell on one knee in an attitude of supplication and ned said  oh gracious lady have pity upon two fugitives  the ranee and her counselor rose to their feet with a little scream and hastily covered their heads  have pity lady ned went on earnestly we are alone and friendless oh do not give us up to our enemies  how did you get here asked the elder woman  we climbed the wall ned said we knew not that this garden was the ladies garden or we might not have invaded it now we bless providence that has brought us to the feet of so kind and lovely a lady  the ranee laughed lightly behind her veil  they are mere boys ahrab  yes your highness but it would be just as dangerous for you to shelter boys as men and what will you do as you have to go to cawnpore to morrow  oh you can manage somehow ahrabyou are so clever the ranee said coaxingly and i could not give them up to be killed i should never feel happy afterward  may heaven bless you lady ned said earnestly and your kind action may not go unrewarded even here soon very soon an english army will be at cawnpore to punish the rebels and then it will be well with those who have succored british fugitives  do you say an english army will come soon ahrab said doubtfully men say the english raj is gone forever  it is not true ned said england has not begun to put out her strength yet she can send tens of thousands of soldiers and the great chiefs of the punjab have all declared for her already delhi is besieged and an army is gathering at allahabad to march hither it may be quickly it may be slowly but in the end the english rule will be restored her enemies will be destroyed and her friends rewarded but i know he went on turning to the ranee that it needs not a thought of this to influence you and that in your kind heart compassion alone will suffice to secure us your protection  the ranee laughed again  you are only a boy she said but you have learned to flatter now tell us how you got here  your highness ahrab interrupted i had better send all the others in for they might surprise us let these young sahibs hide themselves again then we will go in and i will call in your attendants later when it is dusk you will plead heat and come out here with me again and then i can bring some robes to disguise the sahibs that is if your highness has resolved to aid them  i think i have resolved that ahrab the ranee said you have heard young sahibs retire now and hide when the sun has set we will be here again  with deep assurance of gratitude from ned the lads again took refuge in the shrubs delighted with the result of their interview  i do hope that the old one will bring us something to eat ned i am as hungry as a hunter that ranees a brick isnt she  two hours later a step was heard coming down the garden and a woman came and lit some lamps in the pavilion and again retired then in another ten minutes the ranee and her confidante made their appearance the former took her seat on the couch in the pavilion the latter remained outside the circle of light and clapped her hands softly in a minute the boys stood before her she held out a basket of provisions and a bundle of clothes  put these wraps on over your uniforms she said then if we should be surprised no one will be any the wiser  the boys retired hastily ate some food then wrapped themselves in the long folds of cotton which form the principal garment of native women of the lower class and went forward to the pavilion  the ranee laughed outright  how clumsy you are she said ahrab do arrange them a little more like women  ahrab adjusted their robes and brought one end over their heads so that it could if necessary be pulled over the face at a moments notice  the ranee then motioned to them to sit down upon two cushions near her and saying to ahrab it is very hot and they are only boys removed the veil from her face you make very pretty girls only you are too white she said  lady if we had some dye we could pass as natives i think ned said we have done so before this since the troubles began  tell me all about it the ranee said i want to know who you are and how you came here as if you had dropped from the skies  ned related their adventures since leaving delhi and then the ranee insisted upon an account of their previous masquerading as natives  how brave you english boys are she said no wonder your men have conquered india now ahrab tell these young sahibs what we propose  we dare not leave you here ahrab said you would have to be fed and we must trust many people we go to cawnpore tomorrow and you must go with us my son has a garden here we can trust him and he will bring a bullockcart with him tomorrow morning in this will be placed some boxes and he will start you

and i should have no opportunity of slipping away and letting you out  everything being now arranged the ranee rose ned reiterating the expression of the gratitude of his brother and himself the ranee coquettishly held out a little hand whose size and shape an englishwoman might have envied and the boys kissed itned respectfully dick with a heartiness which made her laugh and draw it away  you are a darling dick said in english with the native impudence of a midshipman and i wish i knew enough of your lingo to tell you  what does he say she asked of ned  he is a sailor ned said and sailors say things we on shore would not venture to say my brother says you are the flower of his heart  your brother is an impudent boy the ranee said laughing and i have a good mind to hand him over to the nana now goodby ahrab will let you out     chapter x  treachery   of all the names connected with the indian mutiny cawnpore stands out conspicuous for its dark record of treachery massacre and bloodshed and its name will so long as the english language continues be regarded as the darkest in the annals of our nation cawnpore is situated on the ganges one hundred and twentythree miles northwest of allahabad and was at the time of our story a large straggling town extending nearly five miles along the river it stands on a sandy plain intensely hot and dusty in summer and possesses no fort or other building such as proved the safety of the europeans in agra and allahabad the force stationed there at the first outbreak of the mutiny consisted of the first fiftythird and fiftysixth native regiments the second regiment of bengal cavalry and about fifty european invalid artillerymen when the news of the revolt at meerut reached cawnpore and it was but too probable that the mutiny would spread to all the native regiments throughout the country sir hugh wheeler who was in command at once set to work to prepare a fortified position in which to retire with the european residents in case of necessity to this end he connected with breastworks a large unfinished building intended as a military hospital with the church and some other buildings all standing near the center of the grand parade and surrounded the whole with an intrenchment within these lines he collected ammunition stores and provisions for a months consumption for a thousand persons and having thus as he hoped prepared for the worst he awaited the event  although there was much uneasiness and disquietude things went on tolerably well up to the middle of may then sir hugh wheeler sent to lucknow forty miles distant to ask for a company of white troops to enable him to disarm the sepoys and he also asked aid of nana sahib rajah of bithoor who was looked upon as a stanch friend of the english on the 22d of may fiftyfive europeans of the thirtysecond regiment and two hundred and forty native troopers of the oude irregular cavalry arrived from lucknow and two guns and three hundred men were sent in by the rajah of bithoor  nana sahib was at this time a man of thirtytwo years of age having been born in the year 1825 he was the son of poor parents and had at the age of two years and a half been adopted by the peishwa who had no children of his own in india adoption is very common and an adopted son has all the legal rights of a legitimate offspring the peishwa who was at one time a powerful prince was dethroned by us for having on several occasions joined other princes in waging war against us but was honorably treated and an annuity of eighty thousand pounds a year was assigned to him and his heirs in 1851 the peishwa died leaving nana dhoondu pant for that was the nanas full name his heir and successor the company refused to continue the grant to nana sahib and in so doing acted in a manner at once impolitic and unjust it was unjust because they had allowed the peishwa and nana sahib up to the death of the former to suppose that the indian law of adoption would be recognized here as in all other cases it was impolitic because as the greater portion of the indian princes had adopted heirs these were all alarmed at the refusal to recognize the nana and felt that a similar blow might be dealt to them  thus at this critical period of our history the minds of the great indian princes were all alienated from us by what was in their eyes at once a breach of a solemn engagement and a menace to every reigning house nana sahib however evinced no hostility to the english rule he had inherited the private fortune of the peishwa and lived in great state at bithoor he affected greatly the society of the british residents at cawnpore was profuse in his hospitality and was regarded as a jovial fellow and a stanch friend of the english when the mutiny broke out it proved that he was only biding his time nana sahib was described by an officer who knew him four years before the mutiny as then looking at least forty years old and very fat his face is round his eyes very wild brilliant and restless his complexion as is the case with most native gentlemen is scarcely darker than that of a dark spaniard and his expression is on the whole of a jovial and indeed somewhat rollicking character in reality this rollicking native gentleman was a human tiger  on the very night that the men of the thirtysecond came in from oude there was an alarm of a rising and the ladies and children of the station took refuge in the fortified post prepared for them and from that time the sufferings of the residents commenced although it was not for a fortnight afterward that the mutiny took place for the overcrowding and the intense heat at once began to affect the health of those huddled together in illventilated rooms and deprived of all the luxuries which alone make existence endurable to white people in indian cities on the plains during the heats of summer scarce a day passed without news of risings at other stations taking place and with the receipt of each item of intelligence the insolence displayed by the sepoys increased  a few english troops arrived from allahabad and at midnight upon the 4th of june when the natives broke into revolt there were in the intrenchments of cawnpore eightythree officers of various regiments sixty men of the eightyfourth regiment and seventy of the thirtysecond fifteen of the first madras fusiliers and a few invalid gunners the whole defensive force consisting of about two hundred and forty men and six guns there were under their charge a large number of ladies and children the wives and families of the officers and civilians at the station sixtyfour women and seventysix children belonging to the soldiers with a few native servants who remained faithful the total number of women children and noneffectives amounted to about eight hundred and seventy persons  during the night of the 4th of june the whole of the native troops rose set fire to all the european residences outside the intrenchments and marched to nawabgunge a place four miles away a message was sent by them to nana sahib to the effect that they were marching to delhi and inviting him to assume the command this he at once assented to and arrived at nawabgunge a few hours later with six hundred troops and four guns and his first act was to divide the contents of the english treasury there which had been guarded by his own troops among the mutineers  having destroyed the european buildings the force marched to kulleanpore on its way to delhi but on its reaching this place the same evening nana sahib called together the native officers and advised them to return to cawnpore and kill all the europeans there then they would be thought much of when they arrived at delhi the proposal was accepted with acclamation and during the night the rebel army marched back to cawnpore which they invested the next morning the last message from sir hugh wheeler came through on that day fighting having begun at halfpast ten in the morning  the first proceeding of the mutineers was to take possession of the native town of cawnpore where the houses of the peaceable and wealthy inhabitants were at once broken open and plundered and many respectable natives slaughtered  the bombardment of the british position began on the 6th and continued with daily increasing fury every attempt to carry the place by storm was repelled but the sufferings of the besieged were frightful there was but one well in the middle of the intrenchments and upon this by night and by day the enemy concentrated their fire so that it might be said that every bucket of water cost a mans life after four or five days of incessant bombardment the enemy took to firing redhot shot and on the 13th the barracks were set on fire and a strong wind blowing the fire spread so rapidly that upward of fifty sick and wounded were burned the other buildings were so riddled with shot and shell that they afforded scarcely any shelter many of the besieged made holes in the ground or under the banks of the intrenchments but the deaths from sunstroke and fever were even more numerous than those caused by the murderous and incessant fire  in the city a reign of terror prevailed all the native christians were massacred with their wives and families and every white prisoner brought inand they were manyman woman or child was taken before the nana and murdered by his orders  day by day the sufferings of the garrison in the intrenchments became greater and the mortality among the woman and children was terrible every day saw the army of the nana increasing by the arrival of mutineers from other quarters until it reached a total of over twelve thousand men while the fighting force of the garrison had greatly decreased yet the handful of englishmen repulsed every effort of the great host of assailants to carry the fragile line of intrenchments  when ned and dick warrener having carried out the instructions given by the ranee arrived next morning at her house at cawnpore ahrab at once led them to a small apartment  i have much news to tell you the fighting is over here the nana sent in a messenger to the english sahibs to say that if they would give up the place with the guns and treasure he would grant a free passage for all and the nana and his hindoo officers have sworn the sacred oath of our religion and the mohammedans have sworn on the koran that these conditions shall be observed boats are to be provided for them all they leave tomorrow at dawn her highness the ranee will shelter you here if you like to stay but if you wish it you can go at daybreak and join your countrymen  with many thanks for the ranees offer the boys at once decided to join their countrymen and accordingly next morning after a kind farewell from their protectress they started before daybreak under charge of their driver of the day before and still in their disguises of native women made their way to a point on the line of route outside the town there were but few people here and just as day broke the head of the sad procession came along the women and children the sick and woundedamong the latter sir h wheeler the gallant commander of the garrisonwere in wagons provided by the nana the remnant of the fighting men marched afterward hastily dropping their womens robes the boys slipped in among the troops unnoticed by any of the guards of nanas troops who were escorting the procession  a few words explained to their surprised compatriots that they were fugitives who had been in shelter in the town and many a word of welcome was muttered and furtive handshakes given in return the boys were able to give the news of the arrival of the british before delhi and the commencement of the siege all of which was new to the garrison who had been for twentytwo days without a word from the outer world at last the column reached the ghat or landingplace fixed upon for their embarkation  here seventeen or eighteen boats were collected the way down to the river was steep for the bank of the ganges is here rather high and covered with thick jungle at the top of the ghat is a small hindoo temple the wounded and sick were carried down the bank and placed in the boats the ladies and children took their places the officers and men then followed when all was ready the nanas officer suddenly called the native boatmen to come ashore to receive their wages for the passage down to benares  then as if by magic from out the thick jungle on both sides of the path to the ghat hundreds of sepoys rushed while at the same moment lines of bushes fell to the ground and showed a number of cannon all placed in position in a moment a tremendous fire was opened upon the unhappy fugitives numbers of them were at once killed in the boats some jumped into the water and pushing the boats afloat made for the opposite shore while others leaped into the river on the deeper side and tried to escape by swimming but upon the other shore were enemies as bloodthirsty as those they left behind for there the sepoys of the seventeenth native regiment who had mutinied at azimghur were posted and these cut off the retreat of the fugitives there then all the boats with the exception of two or three which had drifted down stream followed by bands of sepoys with cannon on either bank were brought back to the startingplace which is known and will be known through all time as the slaughter ghat there all the men still alive were taken on shore and shot while the women and children many of them bleeding from wounds were taken off to a house formerly belonging to the medical department of the european troops called the subada khotee  dick and ned warrener were in one of the boats which were still ashore when the treacherous sepoys burst from their hidingplace the scoundrels burst from ned indignantly while dick seeing at a glance the hopelessness of their position grasped his brothers arm  we must swim for it ned take a long dive and go under again the moment you have got breath  without an instants delay the brothers leaped into the water as dozens of others were doing and although each time their heads came up for an instant the bullets splashed around them they kept on untouched until they reached the center of the stream they were still within musket range but the distance was sufficient to render them pretty safe except against an accidental shot they looked back and saw the sepoys had many of them entered the river up to their shoulders to shoot the swimmers others on horseback had ridden far out and were cutting down those who unable to swim far made again toward shallow water while cannon and muskets still poured in their fire against the helpless crowds in the boats  look ned it is of no use making for the other shore dick said there is another body of the wretches there we must simply float down the stream in the middle if we keep on our backs and sink as low as we can so as to show only our noses and mouths above water they may fire for a week without hitting us there give me your hand so that we may float together i will look up from time to time to see that we are floating pretty fairly in the middle i will do it quickly so as not to be seen for if we lie still on our backs they wont watch us after a time but will take us for two drifting dead bodies now old boy so saying the lads turned on their backs and occasionally giving a quiet stroke with their legs or paddling with their hands drifted down stream showing so little of their faces above water that they could scarcely have been seen from the shore  both the lads were good swimmers but dick was perfectly at home in the water and ned knowing his own inferiority in this respect left himself entirely in his brothers hands soon dick in his quick glances to note their position perceived that three boats alone of all the number had got fairly away down streamthat their occupants had got out oars and were quickly coming up to the swimmers but he saw too that on both banks the sepoy guns kept abreast of them and that a fire of artillery and musketry was maintained for a moment he thought of being taken on board but their chance of escaping the fire centered upon them seemed hopeless and he judged it was better to keep on in the water he accordingly paddled himself out of the center of the stream so as to give the boats a wide berth trusting that the attention of the enemy would be so much directed at the boats that the floating bodies would be unnoticed as to keeping afloat for any time he had no fear whatever the water of indian rivers in the heat of summer is so warm that swimmers can remain in them for many hours without any feeling of chill or discomfort  an hour later dick lifted his head and looked forward the firing was two miles ahead now but one boat of the three still floated and dick congratulated himself that he had decided not to join his fate to that of those on board hour after hour passed and still the boys floated on until at last the sun went down dusk came and went and when all was dark they turned on their faces and swam quietly down the stream for many hours alternately swimming and floating they kept their course down the river until toward morning they gently paddled ashore crept into the thick jungle of the bank and fell asleep almost instantly  it was dusk again before they awoke they were desperately hungry but they agreed to spend one more night in the river before searching for food so as to put as much distance as possible between themselves and cawnpore they had been twenty hours in the water before and allowing two miles an hour for the current and something for their swimming they calculated that cawnpore must be fortysix or fortyseven miles behind eight hours more steady swimming added twenty to this and they landed again with a hope that nana sahibs ferocious bands must have been left behind and that they had now only the ordinary danger of travel in such times through a hostile country to face  it yet wanted an hour or so of daybreak and they struck off at right angles to the river and walked till it became light when they entered a small wood near to which was a hut watching this closely they saw only an old man come out and at once made to it and asked him for food and shelter recovered from his first surprise he received them kindly and gave them the best which his hut in which he lived alone with his wife afforded a meal of cakes and parched grain greatly revived them and after a long sleep they started again at nightfall with enough food for the next two days supply that they were not ahead of all their foes was certain from the fact that the peasant said that he had heard firing on the river bank on the previous day they knew by this also that the one boat ahead of them had at any rate escaped its perils of the first day  for two more nights they walked passing one day in a thick wood the other in a ruined temple their hopes rising for as they knew the further they got from cawnpore the loss likely the country people were to be hostile  the third morning they again entered a hut to ask for food  i will give you food the peasant said but you had better go to the rajahs his house is over there half an hours walk he has four englishmen there who came from the river and he is the friend of the feringhees  delighted at the news the boys went forward as they entered the courtyard of the house they were greeted with a hearty salutation in english and their hands were clasped a moment afterward by lieutenant delafosse an officer who had greatly distinguished himself in the defense of cawnpore and was one of the few survivors he took them in to the rajah who received them most kindly and after they had been fed lieutenant delafosse told them how he and his three comrades had escaped  the boat had although many on board had been hit by rifle balls escaped the first day she was crowded and very low in the water having on board most of those who had been in the two boats sunk by the enemy the next day they were again fired at without effect by artillery infantry accompanying the boat all day and keeping up an incessant fire on the third day the boat was no longer serviceable and grounded on a sandbank then the enemys infantry fired so heavily that those still able to carry arms fourteen in number made for the shore and attacked their foes these fell back and the handful of englishmen followed them great numbers of the enemy now came up and the english took refuge in a little temple here they defended themselves till the enemy piled bushes at the entrance and set them on fire then the english burst through the flames and made again for the river seven out of the twelve who got through the fire reached the river but of these two were shot before they had swum far three miles lower down one of the survivors an artilleryman swimming on his back went too near the bank and was killed six miles lower down the firing ceased and soon afterward the four survivors were hailed by natives who shouted to them to come ashore as their master the rajah was friendly to the english they did so and were most kindly received by him  an abundant meal and another good sleep did wonders for the young warreners and the next morning they determined to set out to join their countrymen at allahabad where they expected to find their father and his troops the rajah and their fellowcountrymen endeavored in vain to dissuade them but the former finding that they were determined gave them dresses as native women furnished them with a guide and sent them across the river in a boatfor they were on the oude sidewith a message to a zemindar there to help them forward     chapter xi  retribution begins   the zemindar to whom the warreners guide conducted them after crossing the ganges received them kindly and told them that the safest way would be for them to go on in a hackery or native cart and placed one at once at their disposal with a trusty man as a driver and another to accompany them in the hackery he told them that british troops were it was said arriving fast at allahabad and that it was even reported that an advance had already taken place nana sahib would it was said meet them at futtehpore a place fortyeight miles from cawnpore and seventyfive from allahabad as yet however none of his troops had reached futtehpore which was fortunate for the main road ran through that place which was but twenty miles from the point where they had crossed the ganges and although they would keep by a road near the river and so avoid the town the nanas troops would be sure to be scouring the country this news decided them not to accept the zemindars invitation to stay the night and start the next morning early it was still but little past noon and they might do many miles before darkness  before they halted the party had made fifteen miles and in passing through a village learned the welcome news that a small english force had advanced to synee some ten miles only beyond futtehpore this force had it was said met with little resistance as yet and the country people were full of stories of the manner in which the sepoys and others who had been engaged with them were as soon as captured hung up in numbers already in the minds of the peasantry the idea that the british would be the final conquerors in the strife was gaining ground and as the whole country had suffered from the exactions and insolence of the triumphant sepoys and life and property were no longer safe for a moment the secret sympathy of all those who had anything to lose was with the advancing british force  the next day the party followed the road near the river all day as they feared to fall either into the hands of sepoys retiring before the english or of those coming down from cawnpore they halted for the night at a village whence a road ran direct to synee which was about eight miles distant the villagers repeated that the sepoys had all fallen back and that there would be a great fight at futtehpore the english force was small but a large body were on their way up from allahabad  the boys started at daybreak and had proceeded about three miles when a body of cavalry were seen rapidly approaching  the driver of the hackery put his head inside the leather curtain of the vehicle  english he said the boys looked out and gave a shout of joy as they saw the wellknown uniforms and regardless of their womens robes they leaped out and ran to meet them the advanced guard of the cavalry stopped in surprise  halloo what is up who are you  why dunlop dont you know us the boys shouted  the warreners exclaimed captain dunlop leaping from his horse and seizing them by the hand my dear boys this is joy  the men set up a cheer which was caught up by the main body as they came up and in another minute the boys were in their fathers arms  the young warreners had been mourned as dead for no one doubted that they had been carried to cawnpore and had shared the fate of the garrison of that place and the joy of their father therefore was intense while the whole corps with whom the boys were general favorites were delighted  after the first rapturous greeting major warrener took off his cap reverently and said a few words of deep gratitude to god the men all baring their heads as he did so then captain kent said  shall i push on to the ganges major with my troop or perhaps your sons can tell us what we are ordered to find out  what is it ned asked  whether there are any bodies of troops pushing down by the river it would not do for them to get behind us and threaten our communications  the boys were able to affirm that there was no body of mutineers near the ganges below futtehpore as they had just come down that way  then we can ride back at once major warrener said major renaud was on the point of marching when we started and he will be glad to have us back again first though what have these natives done for you  ned in a few words explained that they came by the instruction of their master and had been with them for three days  the major made them a handsome present and sent a message to the zemindar to the effect that his kindness would be reported to government and dick scribbled a few words to lieutenant delafosse with the news of the british advance and a kind message to the rajah  now dick you jump up behind me his father said dunlop can take you ned and you can give us a short account of what has befallen you as we ride back we must get you a couple of horses of some kind or another at synee cant you cast off these womens clothes  we have got nothing to speak of underneath dick laughed we got rid of our uniforms in the ganges and want a rig out from top to toe  well we must see what we can do for you tonight and now he asked as they trotted along at the head of the column amid the smiles of the men at the appearance of their commanding officer carrying as it seemed a native woman en croupe how did you escape boys we did not miss you until we halted for half an hour at midnight then six of us rode back ten miles but could find no trace of you and we gave you up as lost so we rode on till we met major renauds force coming up when we sent our rescued friends on to allahabad and turned back with just a shadow of hope that we might yet find you alive somewhere or other  dick then told the story of the intervention of the tiger in their behalf and said that afterward an indian lady had succored them hinting that at the end of the war it was probable that ned would present his father with a daughterinlaw  thats all very well ned laughed if dick had understood the language i should have been nowhere you should have seen him kiss her hand  well anyhow dick said she was a brick father and no mistake  by this time synee was reached in spite of major warreners liberal offers no horses or even ponies were forthcoming so completely had the sepoys stripped the country most of the villages having been burned as well as plundered by them from the valises of the troop various articles of clothing were contributed which enabled the lads again to take their places in the ranks but riding as before en croupe in two hours after their arrival at synee they were moving forward again at a trot and in four hours came up with major renauds force encamped for the day  they were glad to get in for the rain since they left synee had been falling in sheets the force was fortunately moving now along the grand trunk road a splendid piece of roadmaking extending from calcutta to peshawur for already the country roads would have been almost impassable  do we halt here for the day ned asked his father as they drew rein in the camp  yes dick the enemy are in force at futtehpore which is only some fourteen miles away havelock is coming up by double marches he halted last night fifteen miles the other side of synee today he will reach synee will bivouac there for a few hours and will march on here in the night we are to be under arms by the time he will arrive and the whole of us will push forward to khaga five miles this side of futtehpore so havelocks men will have marched twentyfour miles straight off to say nothing of the fifteen today the troops could not do it were it not that every one is burning to get to cawnpore to avenge the murder of our comrades and to rescue the women and children if it be yet time  the boys were at once taken by their father to major renaud who welcomed them warmly this officer had under his command a force of four hundred british and four hundred and twenty native troops with two pieces of cannon  after being introduced to major renaud the boys went to the tents allotted to their corps which were already pitched and major warrener asked the officers and as many of the volunteers as his tent would hold to listen to the account of the massacre of cawnpore which was now for the first time authentically told for hitherto only native reports had come down from the city great was the indignation and fury with which the tale of black treachery and foul murder was heard and when the story was told it had to be repeated to the officers of the other corps in camp  the terrible tale soon spread through the camp and men gnashed their teeth in rage and swore bitter oathswhich were terribly keptto avenge the deeds that had been committed uppermost of all however was the anxiety about the women and children for the boys had heard when staying at the friendly rajahs that near one hundred and twenty of these unfortunatesthe survivors of the siege and of the river attackhad been shut up in a room in the cawnpore lines  at three oclock next morningthe 11th of julythe troops were under arms the tents struck and all in readiness for an advance presently a dull sound was heard it grew louder and the head of general havelocks column came up  there was a short halt while major renaud reported to the general the state of affairs in front as far as he knew them he mentioned too that two survivors of the cawnpore massacre had that day come in and that four others were in shelter with a native rajah on the oude side of the ganges the general at once requested that the warreners should be brought up to him and the lads were accordingly presented to the man whose name hitherto unknown outside military circles wasin consequence of the wonderful succession of battles and of victories of which that date the 12th of july was to mark the firstto become a household word in england  the column had better move forward major renaud your division will lead if you will ride by me gentlemen you can tell me of this dreadful business as we go  fortunately there were several horses in major renauds camp which had been taken from men of the enemys cavalry who had been surprised in the upward march and two of them had been assigned to the boys so that they were able to feel once more as soldiers  on arriving at khaga an insignificant village general havelock said to the lads  thank you very much for your information you have behaved with great coolness and courage and major warrener your father has every reason to be proud of you i am short of aidsdecamp and shall be glad if you will act as my gallopersan honor which it need hardly be said the boys joyfully accepted  the following was the total force under general havelocks command when he commenced the series of battles which were finally to lead him to lucknow seventysix men of the royal artillery three hundred and seventysix of the madras fusiliers four hundred and thirtyfive of the sixtyfourth regiment two hundred and eightyfour of the seventyeighth highlanders one hundred and ninety men of the eightyfourth regiment twentytwo men of the bengal artillery total of british regular troops thirteen hundred and eightythree with eight guns besides these he had warreners horse of natives he had the ferozepore regiment sikhs four hundred and forty eight strong ninetyfive men of the native irregular cavalry who were worse than useless and eighteen mounted native police  the order for a halt was welcome indeed to the troops havelocks column had marched twentyfour miles without resting or eating and fires were speedily lighted and preparation made for breakfast major tytler quartermastergeneral to the force had on arriving at the haltingplace taken twenty of warreners horse and had gone forward to reconnoiter the water was growing hot and the tired soldiers as they lay on the ground pipes in mouths were thinking that breakfast would soon be ready when there was an exclamation  here come the horse somethings up  the reconnoitering party were seen galloping back at full speed and a minute or two later a large body of the enemys cavalry in rapid pursuit emerged from a tope on the edge of the plain the bugles sounded to arms and the men grasped their firearms and fell in but not without many a muttered exclamation of disgust  confound them they might have given us time for breakfast  they need not be in such a hurry the days long enough  i thought i hated them fellows as bad as a chap could do but i owe them another now  a laugh was raised by a young officer saying cheerily to his men nevermind lads well return good for evil they wont let us have enough to eat and we are going to give them more than they can digest  in a very short time a considerable force of the enemys infantry appeared following the cavalry and with them were some guns which at once opened on the british force  hitherto general havelock had made no move he knew that his men urgently needed rest and food the sun had come out and was blazing fiercely and it was of great importance that the troops should eat before undertaking what could not but be a heavy mornings work but the enemy who believed that they had only major renauds weak force before them pressed forward so boldly that there was no refusing the challenge so offered the order was given to advance and the men with a hearty cheer moved forward against the enemy whose force consisted of fifteen hundred sepoys fifteen hundred oude tribesmen and five hundred rebel cavalry with twelve guns their position was a strong one for on each side of the road the plain was a swamp and in many places was two and even more feet under water in front on a rising ground were some villages with gardens and mangogroves and behind this futtehpore itself with gardens with high walls and many houses of solid masonry  it may however be said that the fight was decided as soon as begun the british artillery silenced that of the enemy the british rifles drove their infantry before them warreners horse and the irregular cavalry moved on the flank the infantry marched straight the swamps and while some of the guns kept on the solid road others had to be dragged and pushed with immense labor through the morass as the british advanced the enemy fell back abandoning gun after gun the general of the sepoy force was on an elephant on rising ground in the rear of his troops and captain maude who commanded the artillery by a wellaimed shot knocked the elephant over to the great delight of the gunners after that the rebels attempted no further resistance and fled to futtehpore there they prepared to make a stand in the houses and gardens but our men whose blood was now thoroughly up and who were disgusted at their failure to get at their foe went forward with a rush and the enemy fled without hesitation  the streets of futtehpore were absolutely choked with the baggage train of the defeated rebels and the discovery of many articles of attire of english ladies and children raised the fury of the troops to the highest point pursuit of the enemy was however impossible the troops were utterly exhausted and officers and men threw themselves down whereever a little shade could be found at three oclock the baggage came up and by the forethought of the commissariat officer in charge some camels laden with rum and biscuit came up with it so that the men were able to have a biscuit and a little spirits and water which revived them for whatever be the demerits of spirits upon ordinary occasions on an emergency of this kind it is a restorative of a very valuable kind  singularly enough in this battle in which thirtyfive hundred men were defeated and twelve guns captured not a single british soldier was killed the enemy never waiting until fairly within shot twelve soldiers however fell and died from sunstroke during the fight  on the 13th the troops halted to rest the guns taken from the enemy were brought in and the great baggage train captured in the town organized for our own service  on the 14th the force again advanced along a road literally strewn with arms cartridges chests of ammunition shot clothing and tents abandoned in their flight by the insurgents the most welcome find to the army were forty barrels of english porter part of the sepoys loot at one of the scenes of mutiny that night the force encamped at kulleanpore twentyseven miles from cawnpore  so far it has been easy work except for the legs major warrener said as he sat with his sons and his officers on the evening of the 13th but it will be very different work now these scoundrels are fighting with ropes round their necks they know that every cawnpore sepoy who falls into our hands will have but a short shrift and they cant help fighting altogether they have something like five times our force and as they have all been most carefully drilled and trained by ourselves the scoundrels ought to make a good fight of it  i dont mind the fighting ned said so much as the heat it is awful  it is hot ned captain dunlop said but at rate it is better for us who sit on horseback than for the men who have to march and carry a rifle and ammunition  do you think we shall have fighting tomorrow father dick asked  we are certain to do so the pandies have been intrenching themselves very strongly at dong which is five miles from here but this is not the worst part we know they have placed two heavy guns on the other side of the pandoo nuddee which is a large stream three miles beyond dong these guns will sweep not only the bridge but the straight road for a mile leading to it the bridge too has we know been mined and our only chance is to go on with the mutineers so as to give them no time to blow it up  the work of the 14th however was less severe than was expected the enemy fought stoutly at the village advancing beyond the inclosures to meet our troops our superior rifle and artillery fire however drove them back and then they clung stubbornly to the village and inclosures our advance being retarded by the threatening attitude of large bodies of the enemys cavalry who moved upon the flanks and menaced the baggage the force under havelock being so weak in cavalryfor the native irregulars had been disarmed and dismounted for their bad conductthere remained only warreners horse who were known in the force as the volunteers these covered the baggage and executed several brilliant charges on parties of the enemys cavalry who came too boldly forward but the artillery had to be brought from the front and to open upon the heavy masses of the enemys cavalry before they would fall back then the column pressed forward again captured dong with two guns placed there and drove the enemy out in headlong flight  then the force moved forward to the capture of the pandoo bridge as the artillery who were at the head of the column debouched from a wood into the straight bit of road leading to the bridge two puffs of smoke burst from a low ridge ahead followed by the boom of heavy guns and the twentyfour pound shot splendidly aimed crashed in among the guns bullocks and men again and again the enemys guns were fired with equal accuracy our light guns were at the distance no match for these twenty four pounders and captain maude ordered two guns to advance straight along the road until within easy practice distance and two others to go across the country to the right and left so as to take the bridge which stood at the extremity of a projecting bend of the river or as it is called in military parlance a salient angle in flank  the madras fusiliers in skirmishing line preceded the guns and their enfield fire as soon as they were within range astonished the enemy then the artillery opened with shrapnel and nearly at the first round silenced the enemys guns by killing the majority of the gunners and smashing the sponging rods then the infantry advanced at a charge and the enemy who were massed to defend the bridge at once lost heart and fled they tried to blow up the bridge but in their haste they blundered over it and while the parapets were injured the arches remained intact  after all this fighting the british loss was but six killed and twenty three woundedamong the latter being that brave officer major renaud whose leg was broken by a musket shot while leading the madras fusiliers  finding that the resistance was becoming more and more obstinate general havelock sent off a horseman to brigadier general neil at allahabad begging him to send up three hundred more british troops with all speed on receiving the message general neil sent off two hundred and twenty seven men of the eightyfourth regiment in bullock vans with orders to do twentyfive miles a day which would take them to cawnpore in less than five days he himself came on with the reinforcements allahabad being by this time quiet and safe  at daybreak next morning the troops marched fourteen miles halted and cooked their food after which at one oclock they prepared to attack the enemy who were our spies told us in a position extremely strong in the front but capable of being attacked by a flank movement in the burning heat of the sun with men falling out fainting at every step the troops under a heavy artillery fire of the enemy turned off the road and swept round to execute the flank movement as calmly and regularly as if on parade  when they reached the points assigned to them for the attack they advanced and then while the skirmishers and the artillery engaged the enemy who were strongly posted in the inclosures of a village the main body lay down the enemys guns were however too strongly posted to be silenced and the seventyeighth were ordered to take the position by assault the highlanders moved forward in a steady line until within a hundred yards of the village then at the word charge they went at it with a wild rush delighted that at last they were to get hand to hand with their foe not a shot was fired or a shout uttered as they threw themselves upon the mutineers the bayonet did its work silently and thoroughly  a breach once made in the enemys line position after position was carriedhighlanders sixtyfourth men and sikhs vieing with each other in the ardor with which they charged the foe the enemy everywhere fighting stubbornly though vainly  at last at six in the evening all opposition ceased and the troops marched into the old parade ground of cawnpore having performed a twenty two miles march and fought for five hours beneath a sun of tremendous power     chapter xii  dangerous service   on the morning of the 17th of july the troops rose with light hearts from the ground where they had thrown themselves utterly exhausted after the tremendous exertions of the previous day cawnpore was before them and as they did not anticipate any further resistancefor the whole of the enemys guns had fallen into their hands and the sepoys had fled in the wildest confusion at the end of the day after fighting with obstinacy and determination as long as a shadow of hope of victory remainedthey looked forward to the joy of releasing from captivity the hapless women and children who were known to have been confined in the house called the subada khotee since the massacre of their husbands and friends on the river  just after daybreak there was a dull deep report and a cloud of gray smoke rose over the city nana sahib had ordered the great magazine to be blown up and had fled for his life to bithoor well might he be hopeless he had himself commanded at the battle of the preceding day and had seen eleven thousand of his countrymen strongly posted defeated by a thousand englishmen what chance then could there be of final success as for himself his life was a thousandfold forfeit and even yet his enemies did not know the measure of his atrocities it was only when the head of the british column arrived at the subada khotee that the awful truth became known the troops halted surprised that no welcome greeted them they entered the courtyard all was hushed and quiet but fragments of dresses childrens shoes and other remembrances of british occupation lay scattered about awed and silent the leading officers entered the house and after a glance round recoiled with faces white with horror the floor was deep in blood the walls were sprinkled thickly with it fragments of clothes tresses of long hair childrens shoes with the feet still in thema thousand terrible and touching mementos of the butchery which had taken place there met the eye horrorstruck and sickened the officers returned into the courtyard to find that another discovery had been made namely that the great well near the house was choked to the brim with the bodies of women and children not one had escaped  on the afternoon of the 15th when the defeat at futtehpore was known the nana had given orders for a general massacre of his helpless prisoners there in this ghastly well were the remains not only of those who had so far survived the siege and first massacre of cawnpore but of some seventy or eighty women and children fugitives from futteyghur these had with their husbands fathers and friends a hundred and thirty in all reached cawnpore in boats on the 12th of july here the boats had been fired upon and forced to put to shore when the men were by the nairns orders all butchered and the women and children sent to share the fate of the prisoners of cawnpore  little wonder is it that the soldiers who had struggled against heat and fatigue and a host of foes to reach cawnpore broke clown and cried like children at that terrible sight that soldiers picked up the bloody relicsa handkerchief a lock of hair a childs sock sprinkled with bloodand kept them to steel their hearts to all thoughts of mercy and that after this they went into battle crying to each other  remember the ladies remember the babies think of cawnpore henceforth to the end of the war no quarter was ever shown to a sepoy  one of the first impulses of the warreners when the tents were pitched in the old cantonments and the troops were dismissed was to ride with their father to the house of the ranee it was found to be abandonedas indeed was the greater part of the townand an old servant who alone remained said that two days previously the ranee had left for her country abode major warrener at once drew out a paper saying that the owner of this house had shown hospitality and kindness to english fugitives and that it was therefore to be preserved from all harm or plunder and having obtained the signature of the quartermastergeneral in addition to his own he affixed the paper to the door of the dwelling the next day he rode out with his sons and twenty of his men to the house where the boys had first been sheltered the gates were opened at his summons by some trembling retainers who hastened to assure them that the ranee their mistress was friendly to the english  will you tell her that there is no cause for alarm but that we desire an interview with her the major said dismounting  in a minute the servant returned and begged the major to follow him which he did accompanied by his sons they were shown into a grand reception room where the ranee thickly veiled was sitting on a couch surrounded by her attendants ahrab standing beside her  the ranee gave a little cry of pleasure on recognizing the boys and ahrab instantly signed to the other attendants to retire then the ranee unveiled and the major who had remained near the entrance until the attendants had left came forward the boys kissing the hands that the ranee held out to them  i have mourned for you as dead she said when the news of that horrible treachery came and i thought that i had let you go to death my heart turned to water  this is our father dear lady ned said he has come to thank you himself for having saved and sheltered us  the interview lasted for half an hour refreshment being served ned recounted the particulars of their escape major warrener on leaving handed the ranee a protection order signed by the general to show to any british troops who might be passing and told her that her name would be sent in with the list of those who had acted kindly to british fugitives all of whom afterward received honors and rewards in the shape of the lands of those who had joined the mutineers then with many expressions of goodwill on both sides the major and his sons took their leave and joining the troops below rode back to cawnpore  for three days after his arrival at cawnpore general havelock rested his troops and occupied himself with restoring order in the town numbers of sepoys were found in hiding and these were as soon as identified all hung at once on the third day brigadiergeneral neil arrived with the two hundred and twenty men of the eightyfourth who had been hurried forwarda most welcome reinforcement for havelocks force was sadly weakened by loss in battle sunstroke and disease on the 20th the army marched against bithoor every heart beating at the thought of engaging nana sahib who with five thousand men and a large number of cannon had made every preparation for the defense of his castle at the approach of the avenging force however his courage and the courage of his troops alike gave way and they fled without firing a shot leaving behind them guns elephants baggage men and horses in great numbers the magazine was blown up and the palace burned and the force with their captured booty returned to cawnpore  during the advance to cawnpore the zeal and bravery of the young warreners had not escaped the notice of the general who had named them in his official report as gentlemen volunteers who had greatly distinguished themselves on the return from bithoor on the evening of the 20th he turned to them as he dismounted and said will you come to my tent in two hours time  young gentlemen he said when they presented themselves and had at his request seated themselves on two boxes which served as chairs in what i am going to say to you mind i express no wish even of the slightest i simply state that i require two officers for a service of extreme danger i want to send a message into lucknow none of the officers of the english regiments can speak the language with any fluency and those of the madras fusiliers speak the dialects of southern india therefore it is among the volunteers who all belong to the northwest that i must look i have no doubt that there are many of them who would undertake the service and whose knowledge of the language would be nearly perfect but there are reasons why i ask you whether you will volunteer for the work in the first place you have already three times passed while in disguise as natives and in the second your figures being slight and still a good deal under the height you will attain render your disguise far less easy to be detected than that of a fullgrown man would be if you undertake it you will have a native guide who last night arrived from lucknow with a message to me having passed through the enemys lines you understand young gentlemen the service is one of great honor and credit if accomplished but it is also one of the greatest risk i cannot so well intrust the mission to the native alone because i dare not put on paper the tidings i wish conveyed and it is possible however faithful he may be that he might if taken and threatened with death reveal the message with which he is charged i see by your faces what your answer is about to be but i will not hear it now go first to your father tell him exactly what i have told you and then send me the answer if he declines to part with youbring it me if he consents to your going remember that in yielding what i see is your own inclination to his natural anxiety you will not fall in the very least from the high position in which you stand in my regard in an hour i shall expect to hear from you goodnight if i do not see you again  of course father will let us go dick said when they got outside the tent ned did not reply  dick old boy he said presently as they walked along dont you think if i go alone it would be better it would be an awful blow to father to lose both of us  no ned dick said warmly i hope he will not decide that i know i cant talk the lingo as you can and that so i add to your danger still sometimes in danger two can help each other and we have gone through so much togetheroh ned dont propose that you should go alone  major warreneror colonel warrener as he should now be called for general havelock had given him a step in rank in recognition of the most valuable service of his troop during the battles on the road to cawnpore heard ned in silence while he repeated as nearly as possible word for word the words of the general for some time he was silent and sat with his face in his hands  i dont like you both going my boys he said huskily  no father dick said i feared that that was what you would say but although in some respects i should be a hindrance to ned from not speaking the language in others i might help him two are always better than one in a scrape and if he got ill or wounded or anything i could nurse him and two people together keep up each others spirits you know father we have got through some bad scrapes together all right and i dont see why we should not get through this we shall be well disguised and no end of sepoys and people from cawnpore must be making their way to lucknow so that very few questions are likely to be asked it does not seem to me anything like as dangerous a business as those we have gone through for the last thing they would look for is englishmen making their way to lucknow at present the guide who is going with us got out you know and they must be looking out ten times as sharp to prevent people getting out as to prevent any one getting in  i really do not think father ned said that the danger of detection is greatcertainly nothing like what it was before dick and i will of course go as sepoys and dick can bind up his face and mouth as if he had been wounded and was unable to speak there must be thousands of them making their way to lucknow and we shall excite no attention whatever the distance is not forty miles  very well boys so be it colonel warrener said there is much in what you say and reluctant as i am to part with you both yet somehow the thought that you are together and can help each other will be a comfort to me god bless you my boys go back to the general and say i consent freely to your doing the duty for which he has selected you i expect you will have to start at once but you will come back here to change  general havelock expressed his warm satisfaction when the boys returned with their fathers consent to their undertaking the adventure i understand from colonel warrener he said addressing ned that you are intended for the army i have deferred telling you that on the day of the first fight i sent your name home begging that you might be gazetted on that date to a commission in the sixtyfourth your name will by this time have appeared in order there are only two ensigns now in the regiment and ere i see you again there will i fear be more than that even of death vacancies so that you will have got your step i will do the same for you he said turning to dick if you like to give up your midshipmans berth and take to the army  no thank you sir dick said laughing by the time this is over i shall have had enough of land service to last my life  i have already sent down a report to the admiral of your conduct general havelock said and as a naval brigade is coming up under captain peel you will be able to sail under your true colors before long now for your instructions you are to inform colonel inglis who is in command since the death of sir h lawrence that although i am on the point of endeavoring to push forward to his rescue i have no hope whatever of success across the river large forces of oude irregulars with guns are collected and every step of the way will be contested i must leave a force to hold cawnpore and i have only eleven hundred bayonets in all with such a force as this it is impossible if the enemy resists as stubbornly as may be expected for me to fight my way to lucknow still more to force my way through the city held by some ten or fifteen thousand men to the residency i may say that i have no hope of doing this till i am largely reinforced still my making a commencement of a march and standing constantly on the offensive will force the enemy to keep a large force on the road to oppose me and will in so far relieve the residency from some of its foes you see the importance of your message did the enemy know my weakness they would be able to turn their whole force against the residency tell our countrymen there that they must hold out to the last but that i hope and believe that in a month from the present time the reinforcements will be up and that i shall be able to advance to their rescue colonel inglis says that their stores will last to the end of august and that he believes that he can repel all attacks the native who goes with you bears word only that i am on the point of advancing to the relief of the garrison so if the worst happens and you are all taken his message if he betrays it will only help to deceive the enemy you will start tonight if possible i leave it to you to arrange your disguises and have ordered the guide to be at your fathers tent at nine oclockthat is in an hour and a halfs timeso that if you can be ready by that time you will get well away before daybreak there is a small boat four miles up the river that the guide crossed in he hid it in some bushes so you will cross without difficulty and even if you are caught crossing your story that you are sepoys who have been hiding for the last few days will pass muster now goodby lads and may god watch over you and keep you  upon their return to colonel warreners tent they found their friends captains dunlop and manners and two or three of the officers most accustomed to native habits and ways and all appliances for disguise first the boys took a hearty meal then they stripped and were sponged with iodine from head to foot both were then dressed in bloodstained sepoy uniforms of which there were thousands lying about for the greater portion of the enemy had thrown off their uniforms before taking to flight neds left arm was bandaged up with bloody rags and put in a sling and dicks head and face were similarly tied up though he could not resist a motion of repugnance as the foul rags were applied to him both had a quantity of native plaster and bandages placed next to the skin in case suspicion should fall upon them and the outside bandages be removed to see if wounds really existed and dick was given a quantity of tow with which to fill his mouth and swell out his cheeks and lips to give the appearance which would naturally arise from a severe wound in the jaw caste marks were painted on their foreheads and their disguise was pronounced to be absolutely perfect to the eye both were barefooted as the sepoys never travel in the regimental boots if they can avoid it  at the appointed time the guide was summoned an intelligentlooking hindoo in country dress he examined his fellowtravelers and pronounced himself perfectly satisfied with their appearance  outside the tent six horses were in readiness colonel warrener and his friends dunlop and manners mounted on three the others were for the travelers and with a hearty goodby to their other friends in the secret the party started  half an hours riding took them to the place where the boat was concealed in the bushes and with a tender farewell from their father and a hearty goodby from his companions the three adventurers took their places in the boat and started  noiselessly they paddled across the ganges stepped out in the shallow water on the other side turned the boat adrift to float down with the stream and then struck across the country toward lucknow  they were now off the main road on which the oude mutineers collected to oppose the advance of general havelock were for the most part stationed thus they passed village after village unchallenged and unquestioned and morning when it dawned found them twenty miles on the road toward lucknow then they went into a wood and lay down to sleep for even if any one should enter accidentally and discover them they had no fear of any suspicion arising they were now near the main road and when they startedjust as it became duskthey met various parties of horse and foot proceeding toward cawnpore sometimes they passed without a question sometimes a word or two were said the guide answering and asking how things went at lucknow  the subject was evidently a sore one for curses on the obstinate feringhee dogs and threats as to their ultimate fate were their only reply  eighteen miles walk and a great black wall rose in front of them  that is the alumbagh the guide said the sahibs will have a big fight here it is a summer palace and garden of the king once past this we will leave the road it is but two miles to the canal and we must not enter the citynot that i fear discovery but there would be no possibility of entering the residency on this side our only chance is on the side i left it that is by crossing the river we must work round the town  how far are we from the residency now i can hear the cannon very clearly and indeed for the last two hours of their walk the booming of guns had been distinctly audible  it is about five miles in a straight line but it will be double by the route we must take  turning to the right after passing the dark mass of the alumbagh the little party kept away through a wooded country until another great building appeared in sight  that is the dilkouska the guide said now we will go half a mile further and then sleep we cannot get in tonight  in the afternoon they were awake again and took their seats on a bank at a short distance from any road and looked at the city  what an extraordinary view ned said what fantastic buildings what an immense variety of palaces and mosques what is that strange building nearest to us he asked the guide  that is the martinière it was built many years ago by a frenchman in the service of the king of oude now it is a training college all the pupils are in the residency and are fighting like men beyond between us and the residency are several palaces and mosques that is the residency do you not see an english house with a tower and a flag flying over it standing alone on that rising ground by the river  and that is the residency the boys exclaimed looking at the building in which and the surrounding houses a handful of englishmen were keeping at bay an army  that is the residency their guide said do you not see the circle of smoke which rises around it listen i can hear the rattle of musketry quite distinctly  and how are we to get there the boys asked impatient to be at work taking part in the defense  we will keep on here to the right the river is close by we will swim across after it gets dark make a wide sweep round and then come down to the river again opposite the residency swim across and then we are safe     chapter xiii  lucknow   lucknow although the capital of oude the center of a warlike people smarting under recent annexation had for a long time remained tranquil after insurrection and massacre were raging unchecked in the northwest sir henry lawrence a man of great decision and firmness united to pleasant and conciliating manners had when the sepoys began to hold nightly meetings and to exhibit signs of recklessness toward the end of april telegraphed to government for full power to act and having obtained the required authorization he awaited with calmness the first sign of insubordination this was exhibited by the men of the seventh oude irregular infantry who on the 3d of may endeavored to seduce the men of the fortyeighth native regiment from its allegiance and broke out into acts of open mutiny sir henry lawrence the same evening marched the thirtysecond foot and and a battery of european artillery with some native regiments to their lines three miles from the city surrounded and disarmed them and arrested their ringleaders after this act of decision and energy lucknow had peace for some time the native troops awed and subdued remained tranquil and on the 27th of may lucknow still remained quiet whereas every other station in oude except cawnpore was in the hands of the rebels  at the same time every preparation had been made for the struggle which all regarded as inevitable the houses which formed two sides of the large irregular square in the center of which stood the residency were connected by earthworks and a breastwork composed of sandbags and fascines surrounded the other sides stores of provisions were collected cattle driven in and every preparation made for a lengthened defense the cantonments were three miles distant from the residency and were occupied by the thirteenth fortyeighth and seventyfirst native infantry and seventh native cavalry her majestys twentysecond regiment a battery of european artillery and a small force of native horse  on the evening of the 30th of may the revolt broke out it began in the lines of the seventyfirst and spread at once to the other native regiments who took up arms fired the bungalows and killed all the officers upon whom they could lay hands happily all was in readiness and a company of european troops with two guns took up their post on the road leading to the city so as to bar the movement of the mutineers in that direction nothing could be done till morning when sir henry lawrence with a portion of the thirtysecond and the guns moved to attack the mutineers the british were joined by seven hundred men of the various regiments who remained true to their colors and the mutineers at once fled with such rapidity that although pursued for seven miles only thirty prisoners were taken  the troops then marched quickly back to the residency where their presence was much needed as there was great excitement in the town and a good deal of fighting between the police and the roughs of the city who endeavored to get up a general rising and an indiscriminate plunder of the town sir henry lawrence upon his return restored order erected a large gallows outside the fort and hung some of the rioters executed a dozen of the mutinous sepoys rewarded those who had remained faithful and for a time restored order all the european residents in lucknow were called into the lines of the residency the small european force being divided between that post and the mutchee bawn a strong fort threequarters of a mile distant and the remnant of the native infantry regiments who had so far remained true but who might at any moment turn traitors were offered three months leave to go home to their friends many accepted the offer and left but a portion remained behind and fought heroically through the siege by the side of the whites thus one source of anxiety for the garrison was removed and safe now from treachery within they had only to prepare to resist force from without  so determined was the front shown by the little body of british that lucknow with its unruly population of over a quarter of a million remained quiet all through the month of june it was not until the last day of the month that the storm was to burst on the 30th a body of insurgent sepoys some seven or eight thousand strong having approached to chinhut within a few miles of the town sir henry lawrence with two companies of the thirtysecond eleven guns some of them manned by natives and eighty native cavalry went out to give them battle  the affair was disastrous the native cavalry bolted the native gunners fled and after a loss of sixty men three officers and six guns the british troops with difficulty fought their way back to the residency the rebels entered the town in triumph and the city at once rose the respectable inhabitants were killed the bazaar looted and then assured of success the enemy prepared to overwhelm the little british garrison  immediately upon the return of the defeated column it became evident that the weakened force could not hold the two positions accordingly the mutchee bawn was evacuated its great magazine containing two hundred and forty barrels of powder and six hundred thousand rounds of ammunition was blown up and the british force was reunited in the residency  in order that the position of affairs in this perhaps the most remarkable siege that ever took place should be understood it is as well to give a full description of the defenses the residency and its surroundings formed an irregular lozengeshaped inclosure having its acute angles nearly north and south the southern extremity being contiguous to the cawnpore road and the northern point approaching near to the iron bridge over the river goomtee near the south point of the inclosure was the house of major anderson standing in the middle of a garden or open court and surrounded by a wall the house was defended by barricades and loopholed for musketry while the garden was strengthened by a trench and rows of palisades next to this house and communicating with it by a hole in the wall was a newly constructed defense work called the cawnpore battery mounted with guns and intended to command the houses and streets adjacent to the cawnpore road the house next to this occupied by a mr deprat had a mud wall six feet high and two and a half thick built along in front of its veranda and this was continued to the next house being raised to the height of nine feet between the houses and loopholed for musketry this next house was inhabited by the boys from the martinière school it was defended by a stockade and trench both of which were continued across a road which divided this house from the next which stood near the western angle and was the brigade messhouse this house had a lofty and wellprotected terrace commanding the houses outside the inclosure in its rear were a number of small buildings occupied by officers and their families  next to the brigade messhouse were two groups of low buildings called the sikh squares and on the flat roofs of these buildings sandbag parapets were raised next to this at the extreme western point stood the house of mr gubbins the commissioner a strong building defended with stockades and having at the angle a battery called gubbins battery along the northwestern side were a number of yards and buildings the racketcourt the sheeppens the slaughterhouse the cattleyard a storehouse for the food for the cattle and a guardhouse and behind them stood a strong building known as ommaneys house guarded by a deep ditch and cactus hedge and defended with two pieces of artillery a mortar battery was planted north of the slaughterhouse next along the line was the church converted now into a granary and in the churchyard was a mortar battery next came the house of lieutenant innis a weak and difficult post to hold commanded as it was by several houses outside the inclosure commanding the extreme north point which was in itself very weak was the redan battery a wellconstructed work from this point facing the river was a strong earthwork and outside the sloping garden served as a glacis and rendered attack on this side difficult near the eastern angle stood the hospital a very large stone building formerly the banquetinghall of the british residents at the court of oude near the hospital but on lower ground was the bailey guard dr fayrers house south of the hospital was strongly built and from its terraced roof an effective musketry fire could be kept up on an enemy approaching on this side next to it came the civil dispensary and then the post office a strong position defended by a battery between this and the south corner came the financial office sagos house the judicial office and the jail the residency a spacious and handsome building stood in the center of the northern portion of the inclosure surrounded by gardens it was on elevated ground and from its terraced roof a splendid view of the city and surrounding country could be obtained the begums khotee or ladies house stood near the center of the inclosure it was a large building and was used as a commissariat store and for the dwellings of many officers families thus it will be seen that the residency at lucknow as defended against the insurgents comprised a little town grouped round the dwelling of the resident  in this little circle of intrenchments were gathered on the 1st of july when the siege began over a thousand women and children defended by a few hundred british troops and civilians and about a hundred and fifty men remaining faithful from the sepoy regiments upon that day the enemy opened fire from several batteries a shell penetrated the small room in the residency in which sir henry lawrence was sitting and passed between him and his private secretary mr cowper his officers begged him to change his room but he declined to do so saying laughingly that the room was so small that there was no chance of another shell finding its way in he was however mistaken for the very next day a shell entered and burst in the room the fragments inflicting a mortal wound upon sir henry who died a few hours afterward the loss was a heavy one indeed both to the garrison to whom his energy calmness and authority were invaluable and to england who lost in him one of her noblest and most worthy sons on his death the command of the defense devolved upon colonel inglis of the thirtysecond regiment a most gallant and skillful officer after this day after day the fighting had continued the enemy ever gaining in numbers and in strength erecting fresh batteries and keeping up a ceaseless fire night and day upon the garrison  the warreners with their guide experienced the difficulties which this increased activity of the attack caused to emissaries trying to enter or leave the residency after it had become dark they swam the goomtee and made a wide circuit and then tried to approach the river again opposite the residency several batteries however had been erected on this side since the guide had left five days before and these were connected by a chain of sentries so closely placed that it would have been madness to endeavor to pass them unseen it was clear that the mutineers were determined to cut off all communication to or from the garrison the little party skirted the line of sentries a line indicated clearly enough by the bivouac fires on the near side of them round these large numbers of mutineers were moving about cooking smoking and conversing  it is hopeless to attempt to get through here said ned  we will go on to the road leading to the iron bridge the guide replied we can follow that to the river and then slip aside  here however they were foiled again as fires were lighted and there were sentries on the road to forbid all except those on business to pass presently a body of men came along bearing shell upon their heads for the service of the batteries on the other side of the river  whence are they fetching these ned asked the guide  from the kings magazine a quarter of a mile away to the right they are taking ammunition now for the bridge is within four hundred yards of the redan battery and they cannot cross at daylight under fire  here is a party coming back ned said let us fall in behind them go to the magazine and get shell and then follow back again till we are close to the bridge and trust to luck in getting clear  the guide assented and they followed the sepoys down to the magazine keeping a little behind the others and being the last to enter the yard where the loaded shell were standing  each took a shell and followed closely upon the heels of the party in the dark no one noticed the addition to their number and they passed the sentries on the road without question then they fell a little behind the natives paused just before they reached the bridge for the british knowing that ammunition was nightly being carried over fired an occasional shot in that direction the party halted under shelter of a house until a shot flew past and then hurried forward across the exposed spot as they did so the warreners and their guide placed the shells they were carrying on the ground turned off from the road climbed a garden wall and in a minute were close to the river  go silently the guide said there are some more sentries here  stealing quietly along for they were all shoeless they could see crouching figures between them and the water every twenty yards apart  we shall have to run the gantlet ned dick said our best chance will be to shove one of these fellows suddenly into the water jump in and dive for it you and i can dive across that river and we shall come up under the shadow of the opposite bank  ned spoke to the guide  the water is shallow for the first few yards sahib but we shall get across that into two feet which is deep enough for us before the sentries have recovered from their surprise they are sure to fire at random and we shall be out of the water on the other side before they have loaded again  the plan agreed to they stripped off their uniforms and crept quietly along until they were close to a sentry then with a bound they sprang upon him rolled him over the bank into the shallow water and dashed forward themselves at the top of their speed  so sudden was their rush that they were kneedeep before the nearest sentry fired his ball whizzing over their heads as they threw themselves face downward in the stream and struck out under water  even when full the goomtee is not more than ninety yards wide and from the point where they started to equally shallow water on the other side was now not more than forty the boys could both dive that distance but their guide although a good swimmer was a less expert diver and had to come twice to the surface for breath he escaped however without a shot for as they had expected the report of the musket was followed by a general volley in the direction of the splash by all the sentries for some distance on either side therefore when the party rose from the water and dashed up the other bank not a shot greeted them it was clear running now only a hundred yards up the slope of the garden to the british earthwork  we are friends the boys shouted as they ran and a cheer from the men on watch greeted them a few shots flew after them from the other side of the river but these were fired at random and in another minute the party had scrambled over the earthwork and were among friends  hearty were the handshakes and congratulations bestowed upon them all and as the news that messengers had arrived flew like wildfire round the line of trenches men came running down regardless of the bullets which now that the enemy were thoroughly roused up sang overhead in all directions  we wont ask your message was the cry till you have seen the colonel but do tell us is help at hand  english general coming the native guide said  yes ned said as delighted exclamations at the news arose but not yet do not excite false hopes among the ladies some time must pass before help arrives i must not say more till i have seen colonel inglis but i should be sorry if false hopes were raised  cloaks were lent to the boys and they were taken at once to the residency and along passages thronged with sleepers were conducted to colonel inglis room he had already heard that the native messenger had returned with two englishmen in disguise and he was up and ready to receive themfor men slept dressed and ready for action at a moments call  well done subadar he exclaimed as the native entered you have nobly earned your step in rank and the five thousand rupees promised to you well what is your message  the general sahib bids me say that he is coming on to lucknow with all speed cawnpore was taken four days before i left the nana has fled from bithoor and all goes well these officers have further news to give you  i am indeed glad to see you gentlemen colonel inglis said warmly shaking them by the hand whom have i the pleasure of seeing for at present your appearance is admirably correct as that of two sepoys  our name is warrener ned said we are brothers i have just been gazetted to the sixtyfourth my brother is a midshipman we have a message for your private ear sir and if i might suggest it would be better to keep our native friend close by for a few minutes lest his news spread you will see the reason when we have spoken to you  colonel inglis gave the sign and the other officers retired with the guide  our message sir is i regret to say far less favorable than that transmitted by the subadar and it was for that reason that general havelock sent us with him if taken he would have told his message for the general had ordered him to make no secret of his instructions if he fell into the enemys hands as it was desirable that they should believe that he was about to advance and thus relieve the pressure upon you by keeping a large force on the road up from cawnpore but in fact sir general havelock bids us tell you that he cannot advance he has but a thousand bayonets fit for service he must hold cawnpore and the force available for an advance would be hopelessly insufficient to fight his way through oude and force a road through the city the instant he receives reinforcements he will advance and will in the meantime continue to make feints so as to keep a large force of the enemy on the alert he fears that it may be a month before he will be able to advance to your aid with a chance of success  a month colonel inglis said that is indeed a long time and we had hoped that already help was at hand well we must do our best we are even now sorely pressed but i doubt not we can hold out for a month general havelock cannot accomplish impossibilities and it is wonderful that he should have recaptured cawnpore with so small a force  we thought it better to give you this news privately colonel in order that you might should you think fit keep from the garrison the knowledge that so long a time must elapse without succor  you were quite right sir colonel inglis said but the truth had better be made public it is far better that all should know that we are dependent upon our own exertions for another month than that they should be vainly looking for assistance to arrive and now gentlemen i will call my officers in and you shall get some clothes unhappily death is so busy that there will be no difficulty in providing you in that respect you must want food too and that such as it is is in plenty also  the other officers were now called in and the commandant told them the news that he had received from the warreners there was a look of disappointment for a moment and then cheering answers that they were all good for another months fighting were made  i know gentlemen colonel inglis said our thoughts are all the same we are ready to fight another month but we dread the delay for the sake of the women and children however gods will be done all that men can do this garrison will i know do and with gods help i believe that whether aid comes a little sooner or later we shall hold these battered ruins till it arrives captain fellows will you get these officers something to eat and some clothes then if they are not too tired they will perhaps not mind sitting up an hour or two and giving us the news from the outside world  daylight was breaking before ned and dickwho had at colonel inglis suggestion separated ned going to the colonels room while dick formed the center of a great gathering in a hall below in order that as many might hear the news as possiblebrought to a conclusion the account of havelocks advance of the awful massacre of cawnpore of the fresh risings that had taken place in various parts of india of the progress of the siege of delhi and the arrival of reinforcements from china and england with daybreak the cannon which had tired at intervals through the night began to roar incessantly and shot and shell crashed into the residency  is this sort of thing always going on dick asked in astonishment  always was the answer by day and four nights out of five we have not had so quiet a time as last night for a week now i will go and ask the chief to which garrison you and your brother are to be assigned     chapter xiv  the besieged residency   the warreners were taken to gubbins house or garrison as each of these fortified dwellings was now called and the distance short as it was was so crowded with dangers and disagreeables that they were astonished how human beings could have supported them for a month as the garrison of lucknow had done from all points of the surrounding circle shot and shell howled overhead or crashed into walls and roofs many of the enemys batteries were not above a hundred yards from the defenses and the whistling of musketballs was incessant  here and there as they ran along great swarms of flies millions in number rose from some spot where a bullock killed by an enemys shot had been hastily buried while horrible smells everywhere tainted the air  running across open spaces and stooping along beneath low walls the warreners and their conductor captain fellows reached gubbins house mr gubbins himselffinancial commissioner of oude a man of great courage and firmnessreceived them warmly  you will find we are close packed he said but you will i am sure make the best of it i am glad to have you for every man is of value here and after the bravery you have shown in coming through the enemys lines you will be just the right sort of men for me i think you will find most room here i lost two of my garrison from this room on the 20th when we had a tremendous attack all round  the room was small and dark as the window was closed by a bank of earth built against it on the outside it was some fourteen feet by eight and here including the newcomers eight men lived and slept here the warreners after a few words with those who were in future to be their comrades threw themselves down on the ground and in spite of the din which raged around them were soon fast asleep  it was nearly dark when they awoke and they at once reported themselves to mr johnsona police magistrate who was the senior officer of the party in the roomas ready to begin duty  you will not be on regular duty till tonight he replied altogether there are about forty men in the garrison eight are always on duty and are relieved every four hours so we go on every twenty hours only half our set go on duty together as that gives room for those who remain two came off duty at eight this morning four are just going on you will go on with the two who came off this morning at midnight besides their sentry work of course every one is in readiness to man the walls at any moment in case of alarm and a good deal of your time can be spent at loopholes picking off the enemy directly they show themselves one of the party in turn cooks each day besides the fighting duty there is any amount of fatigue work the repairing and strengthening of the defenses the fetching rations and drawing water for the house in which there are over fifty women and children the burying dead cattle and covering blood and filth with earth besides defending our own post we are of course ready to rush at any moment to assist any other garrison which may be pressed altogether you will think yourself lucky when you can get four hours sleep out of the twentyfour  are our losses heavy ned asked  terribly heavy the first week we lost twenty a day shot in the houses but now that we have as far as possible blocked every loophole at which a bullet can enter we are not losing so many as at first but the daily total is still heavy and on a day like the 20th we lost thirty the enemy attacked us all round and we mowed them down with grape we believe we killed over a thousand of them unfortunately every day our losses are getting heavier from disease foul air and overcrowding the women and children suffer awfully if you are disposed to make yourselves useful when not on duty you will find abundant opportunity for kindness among them i will take you round the house and introduce you to the ladies then you can go among them as you like  first the warreners went to what in happier times was the main room of the house a spacious apartment some thirtyfive feet square with windows opening to the ground at each end to allow a free passage of air these on the side nearest the enemy were completely closed by a bank of earth while those on the other side were also built up within a few inches of the top for shots and shell could equally enter them the warreners were introduced to such of the garrison as were in the greater part being at work outside the house repairing a bank which had been injured during the day then mr johnson went to one of the rooms leading off the main apartment a curtain hung across it instead of a door and this was now drawn aside to allow what air there was to circulate  may i come in he asked  certainly mr johnson a lady said coming to the entrance  mrs hargreaves let me introduce the messrs warreners the gentlemen who have so gallantly come through the enemys lines with the message they are to form part of our garrison  the lady held out her hand but with a slight air of surprise  i suppose our color strikes you as peculiar mrs hargreaves ned said but it will wear off in a few days it is iodine and we are already a good many shades lighter than when we started  how silly of me not to think of that mrs hargreaves said of course i heard that you were disguised but please come in it is not much of a room to receive in but we are past thinking of that now my daughter mrs righton her husband is with mine on guard at present these are my daughters edith and nelly these five children are my grandchildren my dears these are the messrs warreners who brought the news from general havelock their faces are stained but will be white again in time  the ladies all shook hands with the warreners who looked with surprise on the neatness which prevailed in this crowded little room on the ground by the walls were several rolls of bedding covered over with shawls and forming seats or lounges on the top of one of the piles two little children were fast asleep a girl of six sat in a corner on the ground reading there were two or three chairs and these the ladies seating themselves on the divan as they called the bedding asked their visitors to take  mrs hargreaves was perhaps fortyfive years old with a pleasant face marked by firmness and intelligence mrs righton was twentyfive or twentysix and her pale face showed more than that of her mother the effects of the anxiety and confinement of the siege edith and nelly were sixteen and fifteen respectively and although pale the siege had not sufficed to mar their bright faces or to crush their spirits  dear me nelly said why you look to me to be quite boys why you cant be much older than i am are you  my dear nelly her mother said reprovingly but dick laughed heartily  i am not much older than you are he said a year perhaps but not more i am a midshipman in the agamemnon my brother is a year older than i am and he is gazetted to the sixtyfourth so you see if the times were different we should be just the right age to be your devoted servants  oh you can be that now nelly said i am sure we want them more than ever dont we mamma  i think you have more than your share of servants now nelly replied her mother we are really most fortunate mr johnson in having our ayah still with us so many were deserted by their servants altogether and she is an admirable nurse i do not know what we should do without her for the heat and confinement make the poor children sadly fractious we were most lucky yesterday for we managed to secure a dobee for the day and you see the result and she smilingly indicated the pretty light muslins in which her daughters were dressed you see us quite at our best she said turning to the boys but we have indeed she went on seriously every reason to be thankful so far we have not lost any of our party and there are few indeed who can say this these are terrible times young gentlemen and we are all in gods hands we are exceptionally well off but we find our hands full my eldest daughter has to aid the ayah with the children then there is the cooking to be done by me and the room to be kept tidy by edith and nelly and there are so many sick and suffering to be attended to you will never find us all here before six in the evening we are busy all day but we shall always be glad to see you when you can spare time for a chat in the evening all the visitors we receive are not so welcome i can assure you and she pointed to three holes in the wall where the enemys shot had crashed through  that is a very noble woman mr johnson said as they went out she spends many hours every day down at the military hospital where the scenes are dreadful and where the enemys shot and shell frequently find entry killing alike the wounded and their attendants the married daughter looks after her children and the neatness of the rooms the young girls are busy all day about the house nursing sick children and yet as you see all are bright pleasant and the picture of neatness marvelous contrasts indeed to the disorder and wretchedness prevailing among many who might by making an effort be as bright and as comfortable as they are there are as you will find many brilliant examples of female heroism and selfdevotion exhibited here but in some instances women seem to try how helpless how foolish a silly woman can be ah he broke off as a terrific crash followed by a loud scream was heard i fear that shell has done mischief  mrs shelton is killed a woman said running out and lucy shelton has had her arm cut off where is dr topham  mrs hargreaves came out of her door with a basin of water and some linen torn into strips for bandages just as the doctor ran in from the sikh square where he had been attending to several casualties  that is right he nodded to mrs hargreaves this is a bad business i fear  all hands to repair defenses was now the order and the boys followed mr johnson outside  the scoundrels are busy this evening he observed  it sounds like a boilermakers shop dick said if only one in a hundred bullets were to hit there would not be many alive by tomorrow morning  no indeed mr johnson replied they are of course firing to some extent at random but they aim at the points where they think it likely that we may be at work and their fire adds greatly to our difficulty in setting right at night the damage they do in the daytime  for the next four hours the lads were hard at work with the rest of the garrison earth was brought in sacks or baskets and piled up stockades repaired and fascines and gabions mended the work would have been hard anywhere on an august night in india it was exhausting all the time that they were at work the bullets continued to fly thickly overhead striking the wall of the house with a sharp crack or burying themselves with a short thud in the earth round shot and shell at times crashed through the upper part of the house which was uninhabited while from the terraced roof and from the battery in the corner of the garden the crack of the defenders rifles answered the enemys fire  by the time that the work was done it was midnight and the warreners turn for guard they had received rifles and were posted with six others in the battery there were three guns here all of which were loaded to the muzzle with grape three artillerymen wrapped in their cloaks lay asleep beside them for the number of artillerymen was so small that the men were continually on duty snatching what sleep they could by their guns during the intervals of fighting the orders were to listen attentively for the sound of the movement of any body of men and to fire occasionally at the flashes of the enemys guns the four hours passed rapidly for the novelty of the work the thunder of cannon and crackling of musketry all round the residency were so exciting that the warreners were surprised when the relief arrived they retired to their room and were soon asleep but in an hour the alarm was sounded and the whole force at the post rushed to repel an attack heralded by a storm of fire from every gun which could be brought to bear upon the battery thousands of fanatics rushed from the shelter of the houses outside the intrenchments and swarmed down upon it the garrison lay quiet behind the parapet until the approach of the foe caused the enemys cannon to cease their fire then they leaped to their feet and poured a volley into the mass so great were their numbers however that the gaps were closed in a moment and with yells and shouts the enemy leaped into the ditch and tried to climb the earthwork of the battery fortunately at this moment the reserve of fifty men of the thirtysecond which were always kept ready to launch at any threatened point came up at a run and their volley over the parapet staggered the foe desperately their leaders called upon them to climb the earthworks but the few who succeeded in doing so were bayoneted and thrown back into the ditch while a continuous musketry fire was poured into the crowd over and over again the guns charged with grape swept lines through their ranks and at last dispirited and beaten they fell back again to the shelter from which they had emerged the thirtysecond men then returned to the brigade messroom and the garrison of the fort were about to turn in when mr gubbins said cheerfully  now lads we have done with those fellows for today i fancy i want some volunteers to bury those horses which were killed yesterday its an unpleasant job but its got to be done  the mens faces testified to the dislike they felt for the business but they knew it was necessary and all made their way to the yard where close by the cattle the horses were confined the boys understood at once the repugnance which was felt to approaching this part of the fort the ground was covered deep with flies who rose in a black cloud with a perfect roar of buzzing  lucknow was always celebrated for its plague of flies but during the siege the nuisance assumed surprising proportions the number of cattle and animals collected the blood spilled in the slaughteryard the impossibility of preserving the cleanliness so necessary in a hot climate all combined to generate swarms of flies which rivaled those of egypt the garrison waged war against them but in vain powder was plentiful and frequently many square yards of infected ground where the flies swarmed thickest would be lightly sprinkled with it and countless legions blown into the air but these wholesale executions however often repeated appeared to make no impression whatever on the teeming armies of persecutors  their task finished the fatigue party returned to their houses and then all who had not other duties threw themselves down to snatch a short sleep in spite of a night passed without rest sleep was not easily wooed the heat in the open air was terrific in the close little room it was stifling while the countless flies irritated them almost to madness there was indeed but the choice of two evils to cover closely their faces and hands and lie bathed in perspiration or to breathe freely and bear the flies as best they might the former alternative was generally chosen as heat however great may be endured in quiet and sleep may insensibly come on but sleep with a host of flies incessantly nestling on every exposed part of the face and body was clearly an impossibility  that day was a bad one for the defenders of gubbins garrison for no less than twelve shells penetrated the house and five of the occupants were killed or wounded the shells came from a newly erected battery a hundred and fifty yards to the north among the killed was one of mrs rightons children and the boys first learned the news when on rising from a fruitless attempt to sleep they went to get a little fresh air outside edith and nelly hargreaves came out from the door with jugs on their way to fetch water  the warreners at once offered to fetch it for them and as they spoke they saw that the girls faces were both swollen with crying  is anything the matter miss hargreaves ned asked  have you not heard edith said how poor little rupert has been killed by a shell the ayah was badly hurt and we all had close escapes the shells from that battery are terrible  expressing their sorrow at the news the boys took the jugs and crossing the yard to the well filled and brought them back  i wish we could do something to silence that battery said dick it will knock the house about our ears and we shall be having the women and children killed every day  lets go and have a look at it from the roof replied ned  the roof was like those of most of the houses in the residency flat and intended for the inmates to sit and enjoy the evening breeze the parapet was very low but this had been raised by a line of sandbags and behind them five or six of the defenders were lying firing through the openings between the bags in answer to the storm of musketry which the enemy were keeping up on the post  stooping low to avoid the bullets which were singing overhead the warreners moved across the terrace and lying down peered out through the holes which had been left for musketry gubbins house stood on one of the highest points of the ground inclosed in the defenses and from it they could obtain a view of nearly the whole circle of the enemys batteries they were indeed higher than the roofs of most of the houses held by the enemy but one of these distant only some fifty yards from the sikh square dominated the whole line of the british defenses on that side and an occasional crack of a rifle from its roof showed that the advantage was duly appreciated  what do they call that house ned asked one of the officers on the terrace  that is johannes house he answered it was a terrible mistake that we did not destroy it before the siege began it is an awful thorn in our side there is a black scoundrel a negro in the service of the king of oude who has his post there he is a magnificent shot and he has killed a great number of ours it is almost certain death to show a head within the line of his fire  i wonder we have not made a sortie and set fire to the place said ned  the scoundrels are so numerous that we could only hope to succeed with considerable loss and we are so weak already that we cant afford it so the chief sets his face against sorties but i expect that we shall be driven to it one of these days that new battery is terribly troublesome also there do you see it lies just over that brow so that the shot from our battery cannot touch it while it can pound away at our house and indeed at all the houses along this line  i should have thought dick said that a rush at night might carry it and spike the guns  no we should be certain to make some sort of noise however quiet we were there are six guns all loaded at nightfall to the muzzle with grape we know that for once they fancied they heard us coming and they fired such a storm of grape that we should have been all swept away besides which there are a large number of the fellows sleeping round and although sometimes the battery ceases firing for some hours the musketry goes on more or less during the night  the warreners lay wistfully watching the battery whose shots frequently struck the house and two or three times knocked down a portion of the sandbag parapetthe damage being at once repaired with bags lying in readiness but always under a storm of musketry which opened in the hopes of hitting the men engaged upon the work these were however accustomed to it and built up the sandbags without showing a limb to the enemys shot  there were two children killed by that last shot an officer said coming up from below and joining them it made its way through the earth and broke in through a blockedup window  we must silence that battery ned whatever comes of it dick said in his brothers ear  i agree with you dick but how is it to be done have you got an idea  well my idea is this the midshipman said i think you and i might choose a dark night as it will be tonight take the bearings of the battery exactly then when they stop firing and we think the gunners are asleep crawl out and make for the guns when we get there we can make our way among them keeping on the ground so that the sentry cannot see us against the sky and then with a sponge full of water we can give a squeeze on each of the touchholes so there would be no chance of their going off till the charges were drawn then we could make our way back and tell gubbins the guns are disabled and he can take out a party carry them with a rush and spike them permanently  capital dick im with you old boy  now let us take the exact bearings of the place there was a lane you see before the houses were pulled down running along from beyond that corner nearly to the guns when we get out we must steer for that because it is comparatively clear from rubbish and we aint so likely to knock a stone over and make a row we must choose some time when they are pounding away somewhere else and then we shant be heard even if we do make a little noise we will ask mrs hargreaves for a couple of pieces of sponge we need not tell her what we want them for  and you think tonight dick  well tonight is just as likely to succeed as any other night and the sooner the thing is done the better johnson commands the guard from twelve to four and he is an easygoing fellow and will let us slip out while some of the others wouldnt     chapter xv  spiking the guns   as soon as night fell a little procession with three little forms on trays covered with white cloths and two of larger size started from gubbins house to the churchyard mr and mrs hargreaves and mrs righton and her husband with two other women followed that morning all the five now to be laid in the earth were strong and well but death had been busy in such a climate as that and in so crowded a dwelling no delay could take place between death and burial and the victims of each day were buried at nightfall there was no time to make coffins no men to spare for the work and as each fell so were they committed to the earth  a little distance from gubbins house the procession joined a larger one with the days victims from the other parts of the garrisona total of twentyfour young and old at the head of the procession walked the rev mr polehampton one of the chaplains who was distinguished for the bravery and selfdevotion with which he labored among the sick and wounded the service on which they were now engaged was in itself dangerous for the churchyard was very exposed to the enemys fire and for they were throughout the siege remarkably wellinformed of what was taking place within the residencyevery evening they opened a heavy fire in the direction of the spot where they knew a portion of the garrison would be engaged in this sad avocation quietly and steadily the little procession moved along though bullets whistled and shells hissed around them each stretcher with an adult body was carried by four soldiers while some of the little ones bodies were carried by their mothers as if alive mrs hargreaves and her daughter carried between them the tray on which the body of little rupert righton lay arrived at the churchyard a long shallow trench six feet wide had been prepared and in this side by side the dead were tenderly placed then mr polehampton spoke a few words of prayer and comfort and the mourners turned away happily without one of them having been struck by the bullets which sang around while some of the soldiers speedily filled in the grave  while the sad procession had been absent the boys had gone to mrs hargreaves room the curtain was drawn and they could hear the girls sobbing inside  please miss hargreaves can i speak to you for a moment ned said i would not intrude but it is something particular  edith hargreaves came to the door  please ned went on will you give us two goodsized pieces of sponge we dont know any one else to ask andbut you must not say a word to any onemy brother and myself mean to go out tonight to silence that battery which is doing such damage  silence that battery edith exclaimed in surprise oh if you could do that but how is it possible  oh you dear boy nelly who had come to the door exclaimed impetuously if you could but do that every one would love you we shall all be killed if that terrible battery goes on but how are you going to do it  i dont say we are going to do it ned said smiling at the girls excitement but we are going to try tonight well tell you all about it in the morning when it is done that is he said seriously if we come back to tell it but you must not ask any questions now and please give us the pieces of sponge edith disappeared for a moment and came back with two large pieces of sponge  we will not ask as you say we must not she said quietly but i know you are going to run some frightful danger i may tell mamma and carrie when they come back that much may i not and we will all keep awake and pray for you tonightgod bless you both and with a warm clasp of the hands the girls went back into their room again  i tell you what ned the midshipman said emphatically when they went out into the air if i live through this war ill marry nelly hargreaves that is he added if shell have me and will wait a bit she is a brick and no mistake i never felt really in love before not regularly you know  at any other time ned would have laughed but with ediths farewell words in his ear he was little disposed for mirth and he merely put his hand on dicks shoulder and said  there will be time to talk about that in the future dick theres the battery opening in earnest there mr gubbins is calling for all hands on the roof with their rifles to try and silence it come along  for an hour the fire on both sides was incessant the six guns of the battery concentrated their fire upon gubbins house while from the walls and houses on either side of it the fire of the musketry flashed unceasingly sending a hail of shot to keep down the reply from the roof  on their side the garrison on the terrace disregarded the musketry fire but crowded behind the sandbags kept up a steady and concentrated fire at the flashes of the cannon while from the battery below the gunners unable to touch the enemys battery discharged grape at the houses tenanted by the enemys infantry the sepoys carefully instructed in our service had constructed shields of rope to each gun to protect the gunners but those at the best could cover but one or two men and the fire from the parapet inflicted such heavy losses upon the gunners that after a time their fire dropped and an hour from the commencement of the cannonade all was still again on both sides the sepoy guns were silenced  it was now ten oclock and the warreners went and lay down quietly for a couple of hours then they heard the guard changed and after waiting a quarter of an hour they went out to the battery having first filled their sponges with water there they joined mr johnson  cant sleep boys he asked those flies are enough to drive one mad you will get accustomed to them after a bit  it is not exactly that sir ned said but we wanted to speak to you dick and i have made up our minds to silence that battery we have got sponges full of water and we mean to go out and drown the priming then when we come back and tell mr gubbins i dare say he will take out a party make a rush and spike them  why you must be mad to think of such a thing mr johnson said in astonishment  i think it is easy enough sir ned replied at any rate we mean to try  i cant let you go without leave mr johnson said  no sir and so we are not going to tell you we are going ned laughed what we want to ask you is to tell your men not to fire if they hear a noise close by in the next few minutes and after that to listen for a whistle like this if they hear that they are not to fire at any one approaching from the outside goodby sir  and without waiting for mr johnson to make up his mind whether or not his duty compelled him to arrest them to prevent them from carrying out the mad scheme of which ned had spoken the warreners glided off into the darkness  they had obtained a couple of native daggers and took no other arms they did not take off their boots but wound round them numerous strips of blanket so that they would tread noiselessly and yet if obliged to run for it would avoid the risk of cutting their feet and disabling themselves in their flight then making sure that by this time mr johnson would have given orders to his men not to fire if they heard a noise close at hand they went noiselessly to the breastwork which ran from the battery to the house climbed over it and dropped into the trench beyond  standing on the battery close beside them they saw against the sky the figure of mr johnson  goodby sir ned said softly we will be back in half an hour if we have luck  then they picked their way carefully over the rough ground till they reached the lane and then walked boldly but noiselessly forward for they knew that for a little way there was no risk of meeting an enemy and that in the darkness they were perfectly invisible to any native posted near the guns after fifty yards walking they dropped on their hands and knees although the guns had been absolutely silent since their fire ceased at ten oclock a dropping musketry fire from the houses and walls on either side had as usual continued this indicated to the boys pretty accurately the position of the guns crawling forward foot by foot they reached the little ridge which sheltered the guns from the battery in gubbins garden  the guns themselves they could not see for behind them was a house and except against the sky line nothing was visible they themselves were as they knew in a line between gubbins house and any one who might be standing at the guns so that they would not show against the sky they could hear talking among the houses on either side of the guns and could see the light of fires showing that while some of their enemies were keeping up a dropping fire others were passing the night as is often the native custom round the fires smoking and cooking there was a faint talk going on ahead too beyond the guns but the enemy had had too severe a lesson of the accuracy of the english riflefire to dare to light a fire there  having taken in the scene the boys moved forward inch by inch presently ned put his hand on something which for a moment made him start back an instants thought however reassured him it was a man but the hardness of the touch told that it was not a living one crawling past it the lads found other bodies lying thickly and then they touched a wheel they had arrived at the guns and the bodies were those of the men shot down a few hours before in the act of loading  behind the guns a number of artillerymen were as the boys could hear sitting and talking but the guns themselves stood alone and unguarded a clasp of the hand and the boys parted one going as previously arranged each way ned rose very quietly by the side of the gun keeping his head however below its level and running his hand along it until it came to the breech the touchhole was covered by a wad of cloth to keep the powder dry from the heavy dew this he removed put up his hand again with the wet sponge gave a squeeze and then cautiously replaced the covering  dick did the same with the gun on the right and so each crept along from gun to gun until the six guns were disabled then they crawled back and joined each other  a clasp of the hands in congratulation and then they were starting to return when they heard a dull tramp and the head of a dark column came along just ahead of them the boys shrank back under the guns and lay flat among the bodies of the dead the column halted at the guns and a voice asked  is the colonel here  here am i said a voice from behind the guns and a native officer came forward  illustration the warreners drowning the priming of the sepoy guns  we are going to make an attack from the house of johannes we shall be strong and shall sweep the kaffirs before us it is the order of the general that you open with your guns here to distract their attention  will it please you to represent to the general that we have fought this evening and that half my gunners are killed the fire of the sons of sheitan is too strong for us your excellency will see the ground is covered with our dead bring fire he ordered and at the word one of the soldiers lighted a torch made of straw soaked in oil which threw a lurid flame over the ground see excellency how we have suffered  are they all dead asked the officer stepping nearer  the boys held their breath when there was a sharp cracking of musketry the man with the torch fell prostrate and several cries arose from the column the watchers on the roof of gubbins house had been quick to discern their enemy  move on march the officer exclaimed hastily double yes i see it is hot here but when we have attacked and their attention is distracted you may do something  so saying he went off at a run with his regiment  the boys lost no time in creeping out again and making the best of their way back once fairly over the crest they rose to their feet and ran down toward the intrenchment as they neared this ned whistled twice the whistle was answered and in a minute hands were stretched down to help them to scramble over the earthwork  all right ned said to mr johnson the guns are useless and weakly guarded there are lots of infantry on both sides but some of them will be drawn off for they are going to make an attack from johannes house where is mr gubbins  he has just made his rounds mr johnson said i will take you to him  mr gubbins was astonished when he heard from the boys that they had been out and rendered the guns temporarily useless you were wrong to act without orders he said but i cant scold you for such a gallant action we must act on it at once i would send for a reinforcement but we must not lose a moment if the attack from johannes house begins before our attack the artillerymen will prepare for action and may discover that the breeches of their guns are wet call up every man at once mr johnson and let them fall in on the battery and do you he turned to another run down to the sikh square and martinière garrison and warn them that a great attack is just going to be made tell them that we are making a sortie and ask them to bring every rifle to bear on the houses to the left of the guns so as to keep down the infantry fire there  in two minutes every man of the garrison was assembled in the battery even those from the roof being called down  bring a dark lantern mr gubbins said it may be useful now lads we are going to spike the guns they have been rendered useless so we have only got to make a dash for them the moment they are in our possession you mr johnson with ten men will clear the house immediately behind it and look for the magazine mr leathes you with fifteen men will move to the right a little and you mr percival with your command to the left do not go far but each carry a house or two set them on fire and fall back here when you hear the bugle i have got the hammer and spiking nails now as quietly as you can till you hear that we are discovered and then go with a rush at the guns  in fact they had gone very few paces before there was a shout in the enemys line the noise of so many men stumbling over the débris of leveled houses was heard in an instant in the night air  forward mr gubbins shouted dont fire give them the bayonet  at a charge the little party rushed along they were in the lane now and were able to run fast the shout had been followed by a shot then by a dozen others and then a rapid fire broke out from the houses and walls in front  they were still invisible however and the balls whistled overhead they heard the voice of the officer at the guns shout to his men  steady dont fire till they are on the crest then blow them into dust  they topped the crest and rushed at the guns  fire shouted the officer but a cry of dismay alone answered his words and in a moment the british rushed on to the guns and bayoneted the astonished and dismayed enemy  then they separated each to the work assigned to them while mr gubbins with a man with the lantern went from gun to gun and drove a nail down the touchhole of each then he followed into the house behind here a short but furious fight had taken place the sepoys lodged there fought desperately but unavailingly a few leaped from the windows but the rest were bayoneted the fight was stern and silent no words were spoken for the sepoys knew that it was useless to ask for quarter the clashing of sabers against muskets an occasional sharp cry and the sound of the falling of heavy bodies alone told of the desperate struggle  it ended just as mr gubbins entered  look about he said they must have a magazine somewhere here perhaps a large one  there was a rapid search  here it is ned said as he looked into a large outhouse behind the building there are some twenty barrels of powder and a large quantity of shot and shell  break open a barrel quick mr gubbins said mr johnson i will do this with the warreners do you line that low wall and keep back the pandies a minute or two they will be on us like a swarm of bees run into the house he said to dick as mr johnson led his men forward to the wall you will see a bucket of water in the first room bring it here quick now then he said empty this barrel among the others thats right smash in the heads of three or four others with this hammer thats right as dick returned with the water now fill your cap with powder  dick did so and mr gubbins poured some water into it stirred them together till the powder was damped through and with this made a train some five feet long to the dry powder  the party at the wall were now hotly engaged with a mass of advancing enemy  fall back mr johnson quickly sound the retreat bugler go along lads ill light the train  he waited until the last man had passed applied a lighted match to the train which began to fizz and sputter and then ran out and followed the rest shutting the door of the magazine as he went out in order that the burning fuse should not be seen  by this time the houses on either side were alight and the whole party were returning at a double toward the intrenchments  as they neared the lines the enemy swarmed out from their cover and the head of the reinforcements were pouring out through the house into the battery when the earth shook a mighty flash of fire lit the sky there was a roar like thunder and most of the retreating party were swept from their feet by the shock while a shower of stones and timber fell in a wide circle they were soon up again and scrambled over the earthworks  for a minute the explosion was succeeded by a deathlike stillness broken only by the sound of the falling fragments then from the whole circle of the british lines a great cheer of triumph rose up while a yell of fury answered them from the enemys intrenchments  any loss was mr gubbins first question  no one killed was the report of the officers of the three sections  any wounded  four of the men stepped forward two were slightly wounded only two were seriously hit but a glance showed that the wounds were not of a nature likely to be fatal  hurrah my lads mr gubbins said cheerily six guns spiked our garrison freed from that troublesome battery a lesson given to the enemy and i expect a few hundred of them blown up and all at the cost of four wounded  well done indeed a voice said and general inglis with two or three of his officers stepped forward gallantly done but how was it that the guns were silent you could hardly have caught them asleep  no sir mr gubbins said the gentlemen who brought in the message from general havelock two days ago went out on their own account and silenced the guns by wetting the priming  a suppressed cheer broke from the whole party for until now only mr johnson and those on guard with him knew what had happened and the silence of the guns had been a mystery to all  step forward young gentlemen will you general inglis said you have done a most gallant action he went on shaking them by the hand a most gallant action and the whole garrison are greatly indebted to you i shall have great pleasure in reporting your gallant conduct to the commanderinchief when the time comes for doing so i will not mar the pleasure which all feel at your deed by blaming you for acting on your own inspiration but i must do so tomorrow good fortune has attended your enterprise but the lives of brave men are too valuable to allow them to undertake such risks as this on their own account and now that i have said what i was obliged to say i ask you all to give three cheers for our gallant young friends  three hearty cheers were given and then the general hurried off to superintend the preparations for the defense of the quarter threatened by the attack from johannes house if indeed that attack should not be postponed owing to the discouragement which the blow just inflicted would naturally spread surrounded by their comrades the warreners reentered the house  what was that terrible explosion what has happened was asked by a score of female voices as they entered  good news mr gubbins said you can sleep in peace the guns of the battery which has annoyed us are all spiked and their magazine blown up and all this without the loss of a man thanks to the warreners who went out alone and disabled all the guns by wetting the primings all your thanks are due to them  there was a general cry of grateful joy for since the battery had begun to play upon the house no one had felt that his own life or the lives of those dearest to him were safe for a moment all were dressed for in these times of peril no one went regularly to bed and they now crowded round the boys shaking them by the hand patting them on the shoulders many crying for very joy and relief  mrs hargreaves was standing at the door and the boys went up to her she drew back the curtain for them to enter for sure that the boys intended to carry out some desperate enterprise none of her family had even lain down mr hargreaves and mr righton followed them in  we were all praying for you she said simply as if you had been my own sons for you were doing as much for me and mine as my own could have done and she kissed both their foreheads  i think mrs hargreaves said dick with the demure impudence of a midshipman that that ought to go round  i think you have fairly earned it you impudent boy mrs hargreaves said smiling  mrs righton kissed dick tearfully for she was thinking that had the battery been silenced only one day earlier her little one would have been saved edith glanced at her mother and allowed dick to kiss her while nelly threw her arms round his neck and kissed him heartily telling him he was a darling boy  ned who possessed none of the impudence of his brother and who was moreover at the age when many boys become bashful with women contented himself with shaking hands with mrs righton and edith and would have done the same with nelly but that young lady put up her cheek with a laugh  i choose to be kissed sir she said it is not much kissing that we get here goodness knows     chapter xvi  a sortie and its consequences   the night passed off without the expected attack from johannes house the rebels being too much disconcerted by the destruction of the battery and the loss of so many men to attempt any offensive operations the destruction of the house behind the guns and of all those in its vicinity deterred them from reestablishing a battery in the same place as there would be no shelter for the infantry supporting the guns and after the result of the sortie it was evident to them that a large force must be kept in readiness to repel the attacks of the british  for a few days life was more tolerable in gubbins garrison for although shot and shell frequently struck the house and batteries multiplied in the circle around none kept up so deadly and accurate a fire as that which they had destroyed  the warreners took their fair share in all the heavy fatigue work and in the picket duty in the battery or on the roof but they enjoyed their intervals of repose which were now always spent with mr hargreaves family  mr hargreaves was collector of a district near lucknow and was high in the civil service he was a fit husband for his kindly wife and as mr righton was of a cheerful and hopeful disposition the boys found themselves members of a charming family circle often and often they wished that their father sister and cousin could but join them or rather as ned said they could join the party without for no one could wish that any they loved should be at lucknow at that time  one evening late they were sitting together in a group outside the house the enemys fire being slack when mr johnson came up from the battery to mr gubbins who formed one of the party  i am afraid sir they are mining again lying on the ground we think we can hear the sound of blows  that is bad mr gubbins said i heard this afternoon that they believe that two mines are being driven from johannes house in the direction of the martinière and the brigade messhouse now we are to have our turn eh well we blew in the last they tried and must do it again but it is so much more hard work now gentlemen let us see who has the best ears excuse us mrs hargreaves we shall not be long away  on entering the battery they found the men on guard all lying down listening and were soon at full length with their ears to the ground all could hear the sound it was very faint as faint as the muffled tick of a watch sometimes beating at regular intervals of a second or so sometimes ceasing for a minute or two  there is no doubt they are mining mr gubbins said the question is from which way are they coming  none could give an opinion the sound was so faint and seemed to come so directly from below that the ear could not discriminate in the slightest  at any rate mr gubbins said we must begin at once to sink a shaft if when we get down a bit we cannot judge as to the direction we must drive two or three listening galleries in different directions but before we begin we must let major anderson of the royal engineers know and take his advice he is in command of all mining operations  in ten minutes major anderson was on the ground  the fellows are taking to mining in earnest he said this is the third we have discovered today and how many more there may be goodness only knows i think you had better begin here he said to mr gubbins you have got tools i think say about six feet square then two men can work at once i will be here the first thing in the morning and then we will look round and see which is the likeliest spot for the fellows to be working from will you ask your sentries on the roof to listen closely to night in order to detect if possible a stir of men coming or going from any given point  picks and shovels were brought out the garrison told off into working parties of four each to relieve each other every hour and the work began wellsinking is hard work in any climate but with a thermometer marking a hundred and five at night it is terrible and each set of workers as they came up bathed in perspiration threw themselves on the ground utterly exhausted mr hargreaves and a few of the elders of the garrison were excused this work and took extra duty on the terrace and battery  the next day it was decided that the enemy were probably working from a ruined house near their former battery and a gallery was begun from the bottom of the shaft this was pushed on night and day for three days the workers being now certain from the rapidly increasing sound of the workers that this was the line by which the enemy was approaching the gallery was driven nearly twenty yards and then three barrels of powder were stored there and the besieged awaited the approach of the rebels gallery  the sepoys had now erected batteries whose cross fire swept the ground outside the intrenchments so that a sortie could no longer be carried out with any hope of success had it been possible to have attempted it a party would have gone out and driving off any guard that might have been placed entered the enemys gallery and caught them at their work a sentry was placed continually in the gallery and each hour the sound of the pick and crowbar became louder  on the fifth day the engineers judged that there could not be more than a yard of earth between them the train was laid now and a cautious watch kept until just at the moment when it was thought that an opening would be made the train was fired the earth heaved and a great opening was made while a shower of stones flew high in the air the enemys gallery was blown in and the men working destroyed and a loud cheer broke from the garrison at the defeat of another attempt upon them  the month of august began badly in lucknow major banks the civil commissioner named by sir henry lawrence to succeed him was shot dead while reconnoitering from the top of an outhouse the reverend mr polehampton who had been wounded at the commencement of the siege was killed as were lieutenants lewin shepherd and archer  on the 8th large bodies of sepoys were observed to enter the city and on the 10th a furious attack was made all round the british line every man capable of bearing arms stood at his post and even the sick and wounded crawled out of hospital and took posts on housetops wherever they could fire on the foe the din was prodigiousthe yells of the enemy their tremendous fire of musketry the incessant roar of their cannon but they lacked heart for close fighting  frequently large bodies of men showed from behind their shelter and carrying ladders advanced as if with the determination of making an assault each time however the withering fire opened upon them from the line of earthworks from the roof of every house and the storm of grape from the batteries caused them to waver and fall back each fresh effort was led by brave men fanatics who advanced alone far in front of the rest shrieking death to the infidel  but they died and their spirit failed to animate their followers only once or twice did the assailing parties get near the line of intrenchments and then but to fall back rapidly after heavy loss  day after day the position of the besieged grew more unendurable the buildings were crumbling away under the heavy and continued fire and as one after another became absolutely untenable the ladies and children were more closely crowded in those which still offered some sort of shelter even death fearful as were its ravages did not suffice to counteract the closeness of the packing crowded in dark rooms living on the most meager foodfor all the comforts such as tea sugar wine spirits etc were exhausted and even the bread was made of flour ground each for himself between rough stoneswithout proper medicines attendance or even bedding tormented by a plague of flies sickened by disgusting smells condemned to inaction and confinement the women and children died off rapidly and the men although better off with regard to light and air sickened fast half the officers were laid up with disease and all were lowered in health and strength  on the 18th as the warreners had just returned from a heavy nights work strengthening the defenses and burying horses and cattle a great explosion was heard and one of those posted on the roof ran down shouting  to arms they have fired a mine under the sikh square  every man caught up his rifle and rushed to the spot the mine had carried away a portion of the exterior defense and the enemy with yells of triumph rushed forward toward the opening then ensued a furious mêlée each man fought for himself hand to hand in the breach mussulmen and englishmen struggled in deadly combat the crack of the revolver the thud of the clubbed guns the clash of sword against steel the british cheer and the native yell were mingled in wild confusion while some drove the enemy back others brought boxes and beams fascines and sandbags to repair the breach the enemy were forced back and the british poured out with shouts of triumph  our mens blood was up and they followed their advantage part of the engineers ever on the alert joined the throng with some barrels of powder and the enemy were pushed back sufficiently far to enable some of the houses from which we had been greatly annoyed by the enemys sharpshooters to be blown up  this success cheered the besieged and on the 20th when it was discovered that the enemy were driving two new mines a fresh sortie was determined upon  the garrison of gubbins house had now less cover than before for the building had been reduced almost to a shell by the enemys fire and all the women and children had the day before been removed to other quarters the residency itself was a tottering mass of ruins and this also had been emptied of its helpless ones who were crowded in a great underground room in the begum khotee it is difficult to form an idea of the storm of shot and shell which swept the space inclosed within the lines of defense but some notion may be obtained from the fact that an officer had the curiosity to count the number of cannon balls of various sizes that fell on the roof of the brigade messhouse in one day and found that they amounted to the almost incredible number of two hundred and eighty living such a life as this the warreners were rejoiced when they received orders with ten of the other defenders of the ruins of gubbins house to join in the sortie on the 20th of august about a hundred of the garrison formed up in the sikh square and at the word being given dashed over the stockade and intrenchment and made a charge for johannes house this had throughout the siege been the post from which the enemy had most annoyed them the king of oudes negro in particular having killed a great many of our officers and men it was from this point that the mines being driven and it was determined at all hazards to destroy it  the rush of the british took the enemy by surprise scarce a shot was fired until they had traversed half the distance and then a heavy fire of musketry opened from all the houses held by the enemy still the english pushed on at full speed without pausing to return a shot with a cheer they burst into the inclosure in which the house stood and while half the party entered it and engaged in a furious combat with those within the others in accordance with orders pressed forward into the houses beyond so as to keep the enemy from advancing to the assistance of their friends thus caught in a trap the warreners belonged to the party who advanced and were soon engaged in a handtohand fight with the enemy scattering through the houses they drove the sepoys before them the warreners were fighting side by side with mr johnson and with him after driving the enemy through the next house they entered an outhouse beyond it  mr johnson entered first followed by ned dick being last of the party dick heard a sudden shout and a heavy blow and rushed in mr johnson lay on the ground his skull beaten in with a blow from the ironbound staff of a dervish a wild figure with long hair and beard reaching down to his waist dick was in time to see the terrible staff descend again upon neds head ned guarded it with his rifle but the guard was beaten down and ned stretched senseless on the ground before the fakir had time to raise his stuff again dick drove his bayonet through his chest and the fakir fell prostrate his body rolling down some steps into a cellar which served as a woodstore  as he fell dick heard a fierce growl and a bear of a very large size who was standing by the fakir rose on his hind legs fortunately dicks rifle was still loaded and pointing it into the fierce beasts mouth he fired and the bear rolled down the wooden steps after his master throwing aside his rifle dick turned to raise his brother ned lay as if dead  dick leaped to his feet and ran out to call for succor he went into the house but it was empty he rushed to the door and saw the rest of the party in full retreat he shouted but his voice was lost in the crackle of musketry fire he ran back to ned and again tried to lift him and had got him on his shoulders when there was a tremendous explosion johannes house had been blown up  following close upon the sound came the yells of the enemy who were flocking up to pursue the english back to their trenches escape was now hopeless dick lowered ned to the ground hastily dragged the body of mr johnson outside the door and then lifting ned bore him down the steps into the cellar into which the fakir and the bear had fallen he carried him well into the cellar took away the wooden steps and then with great difficulty also dragged the bodies of the fakir and the bear further in so that any one looking down into the hole from the outside would observe nothing unusual  then as he lay down faint from his exertions he could hear above the tread of a great number of men followed by a tremendous musketry fire from the house once or twice he thought he heard some one come to the door of the outhouse but if so no one entered  beyond rubbing neds hands and putting cold stones to his forehead dick could do nothing but ned breathed and dick felt strong hopes that he was only stunned in a quarter of an hour he showed signs of reviving and in an hour was able to hear from dick an account of what had happened and where they were  we are in a horrible fix this time dick and no mistake my head aches so i can hardly think let us be quiet for a bit and we will both try to think what is best to be done there is no hurry to decide no one is likely to come down into this place but we may as well creep well behind this pile of wood and straw and then we shall be safe  dick assented and for an hour they lay quiet neds regular breathing soon telling his brother that he had dropped off to sleep then dick very quietly crept out again from their hidingplace  it is a grand idea he said to himself magnificent its nasty horribly nasty but after three weeks of what we have gone through in the residency one can see and do things which it would have made one almost sick to think of a month back and as our lives depend upon it we must not stand upon niceties i wish though i had been brought up a red indian it would have come natural then i suppose  so saying he took out his pocketknife opened it and went to the body of the dead fakir he took the long matted hair into his hand with an exclamation of disgust but saw at once that his idea was a feasible one the hair was matted together in an inextricable mass and could be trusted to hang together  he accordingly set to work to cut it off close to the head but although his knife was a sharp one it was a long and unpleasant task and nothing but the necessity of the case could have nerved him to get through with it  at last it was finished and he looked at his work with complacency  thats a magnificent wig he said i defy the best barber in the world to make such a natural one now for the bear  this was a long task but at last the bear was skinned and dick set to to clean as well as he could the inside of the hide then he dragged into a corner and covered up the carcass of the bear and the body of the fakir having first stripped the clothes off the latter scattered a little straw over the bears skin and then his task being finished he crept behind the logs again lay down and went off to sleep by the side of ned it was getting dark when he awoke ned was awake and was sitting up by his side outside the din of battle the ceaseless crack of the rifle and the roar of cannon was going on as usual without interruption  how do you feel now ned dick asked  all right dick i have got a biggish bump on the side of my head and feel a little muddled still but that is nothing i cant think of any plan for escaping from this place dick nor of getting hold of a disguise for even if we could get out of this place and neighborhood we must be detected and in this town it is of no use trying to beg for shelter or aid  it is all arranged dick said cheerfully i have got two of the best disguises in the world and we have only to dress up in them and walk out  ned looked at dick as if he thought that he had gone out of his mind  you dont believe me just you wait then two minutes till i have dressed up and then ill call you and without waiting for an answer dick went out  he speedily stripped to the waist rubbed some mud from the damp floor on his arms wound the fakirs rags round his body with a grimace of disgust put the wig on his headhis hair like that of all the garrison had been cut as close to the head as scissors would take itshook the long knotted hair over his face and shouldersbehind it hung to the waist took the staff in his hand and called quietly to ned to come out ned crept out and remained petrified with astonishment  the fakir he exclaimed at last good heavens dick is that you  its me sure enough dick said taking off his wig here is a wig in which the sharpest eyes in the world could not detect you  but where began ned still lost in surprise  my dear ned i have borrowed from the fakir it was not quite a nice job he went on in answer to neds astonished look but its over now and we need not say any more about it the hair and rags are disgustingly filthy there is no doubt about that their late owner never used a comb and was otherwise beastly in his habits still old man that cannot be helped and if you like when we once get out of the town we can put them in water for twentyfour hours or make a sort of oven and bake them to get rid of their inhabitants our lives are at stake ned and we must not mind trifles  right old boy ned said making a great effort to overcome his first sensation of disgust as you say it is a trifle you have hit upon a superb idea dick superb and i think you have saved our lives from what seemed a hopeless scrape but what is your other disguise  this dick said lifting the bears skin i can get into this and if we travel at night so that i can walk upright for i never could travel far on allfours i should pass well enough as i could lie curled up by your side in the daytime and no one will ask a holy fakir any troublesome questions i dont think you could get into the skin ned or i would certainly take the fakir for choice for it will be awfully hot in this skin  i dont mind doing the fakir a bit ned said fortunately the sun has done his work and the color of our skins can be hidden by a good coat of dirt which will look as natural as possible now let us set about it at once  it took an hours preparation for although neds toilet was quickly made needing in fact nothing but a coating of mud it took some time to sew dick up in the skin the opening being sewn up by means of the small blade of the knife and some string it was by this time quite dark and the operation had been completed so perfectly that once ned was dressed they had no fear whatever of interruption  now ned before we go i will set fire to the straw i dont suppose any one will go down and make any discoveries but they may be looking for wood so its as well to prevent accidents we will throw that big piece of matting over the opening in the floor so the light wont show till we get well away  he ran down the ladder struck a match lit the straw and then ran quickly up again the mat was dragged across the opening and then the boys went boldly out into the yard ned striding along and dick trotting on allfours beside him the night was dark and although there were many men in the yard sitting about on the ground round fires no one noticed the boys who turning out through a gateway took the road into the heart of lucknow     chapter xvii  out of lucknow   one hundred yards or so after starting the disguised fakir and his bear entered a locality teeming with troops quartered there in order to be close at hand to the batteries to assist to repel sorties or to join in attacks fortunately the night was very dark and the exceedingly awkward and unnatural walk of the bear passed unseen over and over again they were challenged and shouted to but the hoarse hoohac which is the cry of the fakirs and the ring of the ironbound staff with its clanking rings on the ground were a sufficient pass  ned guessed from the fact of their having been met with so close to the fort that the fakir and his bear would be well known to the mutineers and this proved to be the case  several of the men addressed him but he waved his arm shook his head angrily and strode on and as fakirs frequently pretend to be absorbed in thought and unwilling to converse the soldiers fell back beyond this the streets were deserted the most populous native quarter lay far away and few of the inhabitants save of the lowest classes cared to be about the streets after nightfall  the instant that they were in a quiet quarter dick rose on to his feet  my goodness he whispered to ned that allfours work is enough to break ones back ned  they now struck sharply to the left presently crossed the wide street leading from the cawnpore bridge and kept on through quiet lanes until they came to the canal this would be the guide they wanted and they followed it along taking nearly the route which general havelock afterward followed in his advance until they came to a bridge across the canal once over they were they knew fairly safe they kept on at a rapid walk until well in the country and then sat down by the roadside for a consultation as to their best course of proceeding the lads were both of opinion that the dangers which would lie in the way of their reaching cawnpore would be very great this road was now occupied by great numbers of troops determined to bar the way to lucknow against general havelock they had advanced without question because it was natural that sepoys should be making their way from cawnpore to lucknow but it would not be at all natural that a fakir should at this time be going in the opposite direction moreoverand this weighed very strongly with them they knew that general havelock would advance with a force wholly inadequate to the task before him and they thought that even should he succeed in getting into lucknow he would be wholly unable to get out again hampered as he would be with sick wounded women and children in that case he would have to continue to hold lucknow until a fresh relieving force arrived and the lads had already had more than enough of the confinement and horrors of a siege such as that of cawnpore  animated by these considerations they determined to push to delhi where they hoped that they might arrive in time to see the end of the siege at whose commencement they had been present  no suspicion would be likely to be excited by their passage through that line of country which indeed would be found altogether denuded of the enemys troops for all the regiments that had mutinied along this line had marched off either to delhi or lucknow and the country was in the hands of the zemindars who would neither suspect nor molest a wandering fakir it certainly was unusual for a fakir to be accompanied by a bear but as the fakir they had killed had a bear with him it was clearly by no means impossible dick protested that it was absolutely essential that they should walk at night for that he would be detected at once in the day  i vote that we walk all night ned and make our thirtyfive or forty miles then turn in hide up all day in the evening when it gets quite dusk we can go into the outskirts of a village then you will begin to shout and i will lie down as if tired by you they will bring you lots of grub under the idea that you will give them charms and so on next day when the village is asleep we will go on you can easily ask for clothi am sure your rags are wretched enoughand then i can dress at night after setting out from each village in native dress for it would be awful to walk far in this skin besides my feet are as uncomfortable as possible  this plan was agreed upon and they struck across country for the main delhi road dick slipping out of his bears skin and simply wearing it wrapped loosely round him  the warreners had been accustomed to such incessant labor at lucknow that they had no difficulty in keeping going all night as day was breaking they retired into a tope of trees and threw themselves down dick first taking the precaution to get into the bears skin and lace it up in case of surprise it was of course hot but at least it kept off flies and other insects and as it was quite loose for him it was not so hot as it would have been had it fitted more tightly the lads were both utterly fatigued and in a very few minutes were fast asleep  it was late in the afternoon before they awoke and although extremely hungry they were forced to wait until it became dusk before proceeding on their way  at the first village at which they arrived they sat down near the first house and ned began to strike his staff to the ground and to shout hoo hac with great vehemence although the population were for the most part mussulmen there were many hindoos everywhere scattered about and these at once came out and formed a ring round the holy man some bore torches and dick played his part by sitting up and rocking uneasily in the manner of a bear and then lying down and halfcovering his face with his paw went apparently to sleep  the servant of siva is hungry ned said and would eat he wants cloth and he pointed to the rags which scarce held together over his shoulder supplies of parched grain and of baked cakes were brought him and a woman carried up a sick child and a length of cloth ned passed his hand over the childs face and by that and the heat of her hand judged that she had fever first after the manner of a true fakir he mumbled some sentence which no one could understand then in silence he breathed a sincere prayer that the child might be restored to health after this he bade the mother give her cooling drinks made of rice water and acid fruit to keep her cool and to damp her hands and face from time to time and then he signified by a wave of his hand that he would be alone  the villagers all retired and the lads made a hearty meal then taking what remained of the food they started on their nights journey pausing in a short time for dick to get out of his skin and to wrap himself from head to foot in the dark blue cotton cloth that the woman had given  i felt like an impostor getting that cloth under false pretenses dick  oh nonsense dick said the woman gave it for what the fakir could do and i am sure your advice was better than the fakir would have given so she is no loser if ever we come on one of these sort of trips again we will bring some quinine and some strong pills and then we really may do some good  dick took no pains about coloring his face or hands for both were burned so brown with exposure to the sun that he had no fear that a casual glance at them at night even in torchlight would detect that he was not a native  now ned i promised to stop for twentyfour hours if you liked to soak that head of hair in a pond what do you say  no ned said it is terribly filthy but we will waste no time to morrow when we halt we will try and make an oven and bake it i will try tomorrow to get a fresh cloth for myself and throw these horrible rags away even a fakir must have a new cloth sometimes  they made a very long march that night and had the next evening a success equal to that of the night before another long nighttramp followed and on getting up at the end of the days sleep ned collected some dry sticks and lit a fire then he made a hole in the ground and filled it with glowing embers when the embers were just extinct he cleared them out took off his wig rolled it up and put it into the hot oven he had thus prepared and covered the top in with a sod then carefully looking to see that no natives were in sight he threw away his old rags and dick and he enjoyed a dip in a small irrigation tank close to the wood after this ned again smeared himself over with mud and sat down in the sun to dry then he dressed himself in the cloth that had been given him the night before opened his oven took out the wig gave it a good shake and put it on saying thank god i feel clean again i have had the horrors for the last three days dick  in the three nights journey the boys had traveled a hundred and eleven miles and were now close to ferruckabad a town of considerable size they pursued their usual tacticsentered it after dusk and sat down near the outskirts the signal calls were answered as before and a number of the faithful gathered round with their simple offerings of food  as they began stating their grievances ned as usual warned them off with a brief tomorrow when he saw outside the group of hindoos two or three mussulman troopers  these moved closely up and contemplated the wildlooking fakir with his tangled hair and his eyes peering out through the tangle one of them looked at the bear for some time attentively and then said  that is no bear it is a man in a bears skin  ned had feared that the discovery might be made and had from the first had his answer ready  fool he said in a loud harsh voice who with his eyes in his head supposed that it was a bear it is one who has sinned and is under a vow dogs like you know naught of these things but the followers of siva know  do you call me a dog said the mussulman angrily and strode forward as if to strike but ned leaped to his feet and twirling his staff round his head brought it down with such force on the soldiers wrist that it nearly broke the arm the hindoos began to shout sacrilege as the mussulman drew his pistol before he could fire however his comrades threw themselves upon him at this time it was the policy of hindoos and mussulmans alike to drop all religious differences and the troopers knew that any assault upon a holy fakir would excite to madness the hindoo population  the furious mohammedan was therefore dragged away by his fellows and ned calmly resumed his seat the hindoos brought a fresh supply of food for the holy man expiating his sin in so strange a way and then left the fakir to his meditation and his rest  half an hour later the warreners were on their way and before morning congratulated themselves upon having done more than half of the two hundred and eighty miles which separate lucknow from delhi the remaining distance took them however much longer than the first part had done for dick cut his foot badly against a stone the next night and was so lamed that the night journeys had to be greatly shortened instead therefore of arriving in eight days as they had hoped it was the 3d of september that is thirteen days from their startbefore they saw in the distance the british flag flying on the watch tower on the ridge they had made a long detour and came in at the rear of the british position on this side the country was perfectly open and the villagers brought in eggs and other produce to the camp  upon the 25th of august the enemy had sent a force of six thousand men to intercept the heavy siege train which was on its way to the british camp from the punjaub brigadiergeneral nicholson one of the most gallant and promising officers of the british army was sent out against them with a force of two thousand men of which only onefourth were british he met them at nujufghur and routed them capturing all their guns thirteen in number a curious instance here occurred of the manner in which the least courageous men will fight when driven to bay the army of six thousand men had made so poor a fight that the british loss in killed and wounded amounted to only thirtythree men after it was over it was found that a party of some twenty rebels had taken shelter in a house in a village in the british rear the punjaub infantry was sent to drive them out but its commanding officer and many of its men were killed by the desperate handful of mutineers the sixtyfirst queens was then ordered up but the enemy was not overpowered until another officer was dangerously wounded and many had fallen altogether the victory over this little band of men cost us sixteen killed and fortysix woundedthat is to say double the loss which had been incurred in defeating six thousand of them in the open the result of this engagement was that the road in the rear of the british camp was perfectly open and the warreners experienced no hindrance whatever in approaching the camp  dick had after crossing the oude frontier left his bears skin behind him and adopted the simple costume of a native peasant the blue cloth and a white turban ned having begged a piece of white cotton for the purpose traveling only at night when the natives wrap themselves up very much there was little fear of dicks color being detected and as he kept himself well in the background during the short time of an evening when ned appeared in public he had passed without attracting any attention whatever  the warreners hearts leaped within them on beholding on the afternoon of the 3d of september a party of british cavalry trotting along the road two miles from camp  it is the guides ned said we know the officer dick keep on your disguise a minute longer we shall have some fun  ned accordingly stood in the middle of the road and shouted his hoohac at the top of his voice  get out of the way you old fool the officer riding at its head said as he drew up his horse on seeing the wild figure covered with shaggy hair to the waist twirling his formidable staff  ned stopped a moment not a bit more of an old fool than you are yourself tomkins he said  the officer reined his horse back in his astonishment he had spoken in english unconsciously and being answered in the same language and from such a figure as this naturally petrified him  who on earth are you he asked  ned warrener and this is my brother dick and ned pulled off his wig  by jove the officer said leaping from his horse i am glad to see you where on earth have you come from some one who came up here from allahabad had seen some fellow there who had come down from cawnpore and he reported that you had gone on into lucknow in disguise and that news had come you had got safely in  so we did ned said and as you see we have got safely out again we left there on the night of the 20th  and what was the state of things then lieutenant tomkins asked how long could they hold out we know that it will be another three weeks before havelock can hope to get there  another three weeks ned said that is terrible they were hard pushed indeed when we left the enemy were driving mines in all directions the garrison were getting weaker and weaker every day and the men fit for duty were worked to death it seems next to impossible that they could hold out for another four or five weeks from the time we left them but if it can be done they will do it do you happen to have heard of our father  the man that brought the news about you said he was all right and hearty and the troop was doing good work in scouring the country round cawnpore now will you ride back and report yourself to general wilson so saying he ordered two of the troopers to dismount and walk back to camp  ned had thrown down the wig when he took it off but before mounting dick picked it up rolled it up into a little parcel and said  it is my first effort in wigmaking and as it has saved our lives ill keep it as long as i live as a memento besides who knows it may be useful again yet  quite an excitement was created in the camp behind the ridge by the arrival of the guide cavalry with two englishmen in native dress and the news that they were officers from lucknow quickly spread  the cavalry drew up at their own lines and then dismounting lieutenant tomkins at once sent an orderly to the general with the news while the boys were taken inside a tent and enjoyed the luxury of a bath and a message was sent round to the officers of the regiment which rapidly resulted in sufficient clothes being contributed to allow the boys to make their appearance in the garb of british officers  a curry and a cup of coffee were ready for them by the time they were dressed and these were enjoyed indeed after a fortnights feeding upon uncooked grain varied only by an occasional piece of native bread or cake the hasty meal concluded they accompanied lieutenant tomkins to the generals tent  they were most cordially received by general wilson and omitting all details they gave him an account of their having been cut off during a successful sortie from lucknow and having made their way to delhi in disguise then they proceeded to describe fully the state of affairs at lucknow a recital which was at once interesting and important inasmuch as though several native messengers had got through from lucknow to general havelock as none of them carried lettersfor these would have insured their death if searchedthey had brought simply messages from general inglis asking for speedy help and their stories as to the existent state of things in the garrison were necessarily vague and untrustworthy  the most satisfactory portion of the boys statement was that although the garrison were now on short rations and that all the comforts and many of what are regarded as almost the necessaries of life were exhausted yet that there was plenty of grain in the place to enable the besieged to exist for some weeks longer  the great fear is that some essential part of the defense may be destroyed by mines ned concluded against open attacks i think that the garrison is safe but the enemy are now devoting themselves so much to driving mines that however great the care and vigilance of the garrison they may not be always able to detect them or even if they do so to run countermines owing to the numerical weakness of our force  thanks for your description gentlemen it throws a great light upon the state of affairs and is very valuable i will at once telegraph a resumé of it to the central government and to general havelock the pressing need of aid will no doubt impress the calcutta authorities with the urgent necessity to place general havelock in a position to make an advance at the earliest possible moment he will of course communicate to colonel warrener the news of your safe arrival here you have gone through a great deal indeed since you left here while we have been doing little more than hold our own however the tide has turned now we have received large reinforcements and our siege train and i hope that in the course of a fortnight the british flag will once again wave over delhi in the meantime you will at any rate for a few days need rest i will leave you for a day with your friends of the guides and will then attach you to one of the divisional staffs i hope that you will both dine with me to day  that evening at dinner the warreners met at the generals table general nicholson whose chivalrous bravery placed him on a par with outram who was called the bayard of the british army he was short of staff officers and did not wish to weaken the fighting powers of the regiments of his division by drawing officers from them he therefore asked general wilson to attach the warreners to his personal staff this request was at once complied with their new chief assured them that for the present he had no occasion for their services and that they were at liberty to do as they pleased until the siege operations began in earnest the next few days were accordingly spent as dick said in eating and talking  every regiment in camp was anxious to hear the tale of the siege of lucknow and of the warreners personal experience in entering and leaving the besieged residency and accordingly they dined lunched or breakfasted by turns with every mess in camp they were indeed the heroes of the day and the officers were much pleased at the simplicity with which these gallant lads told their adventures and at the entire absence of any consciousness that they had done anything out of the way in fact they rather regarded the whole business as two schoolboys might regard some adventure in which they had been engaged dick in particular regarding all their adventures with the exception only of the sufferings of the garrison of lucknow in the light of an immense lark  in the meantime the troops were working day and night in the trenches and batteries under the directions of the engineer officers and every heart beat high with satisfaction that after standing for months on the defensive repelling continual attacks of enormously superior numbers at last their turn had arrived and that the day was at hand when the long deferred vengeance was to fall upon the bloodstained city     chapter xviii  the storming of delhi   on the morning of the 8th of september the battery eight hundred yards from the moree gate of delhi opened fire and sent the first battering shot against the town which had for three months been besieged hitherto indeed light shot shell and shrapnel had been fired at the gunners on the walls to keep down their fire and the city and palace had been shelled by the mortar batteries but not a shot had been fired with the object of injuring the walls or bringing the siege to an end  for three months the besiegers had stood on the offensive and the enemy not only held the city but had erected very strong works in the open ground in front of the lahore gate and had free ingress and egress from the town at all points save from the gates on the north side facing the british position on the ridge during these three long months however the respective position of the parties had changed a good deal for the first month the mutineers were elated with their success all over that part of india they were intoxicated with treason and murder and their enormous numbers in comparison with those of the british troops in the country made them not only confident of success but arrogant in the belief that success was already assured gradually however the failure of all their attempts even with enormously superior forces to drive the little british force from the grip which it so tenaciously held of the hill in front of delhi damped the ardor of their enthusiasm doubts as to whether after all their mutiny and their treachery would meet with eventual success and fear that punishment for their atrocities would finally overtake them began for the first time to enter their minds  quarrels and strife broke out between the various leaders of the movement and pitched battles were fought between the men of different corps then came pestilence and swept the crowded quarters a reign of terror prevailed throughout the city the respectable inhabitants were robbed and murdered shops were burst open and sacked and riot and violence reigned supreme  the puppet monarch terrified at the disorder that prevailed and finding his authority was purely nominalthe real power resting in the hands of his own sons who had taken a leading share in getting up the revolt and in those of the sepoy generalsbegan to long for rest and quiet the heavy shell which from time to time crashed into his palace disturbed his peace and through his wives he secretly endeavored to open negotiations with the british these overtures were however rejected the king had no power whatever and he and his household were all concerned in the massacres which had taken place in the palace itself  it was then by an army which however small was confident of victory against one which however large was beginning to doubt that final success would be theirs that the siege operations began on the morning of the 8th of september thenceforth the besiegers worked night and day every night saw fresh batteries rising at a distance of only three hundred yards from the walls fifteen hundred camels brought earth three thousand men filled sandbags placed fascines and erected traverses for the guns the batteries rose as if by magic the besieged viewed these preparations with a strange apathy they might at the commencement of the work have swept the ground with such a shower of grape and musketry fire that the erection of batteries so close to their walls would have been impossible but for the first three nights of the work they seemed to pay but little heed to what we were doing and when at last they awoke to the nature of our proceedings and began a furious cannonade against the british the works had reached a height that afforded shelter to those employed upon them each battery as fast as the heavy siege guns were placed in position opened upon the walls until forty heavy guns thundered incessantly  the enemy now fought desperately our fire overpowered that of the guns at the bastions opposed to them but from guns placed out in the open on our flank they played upon our batteries while from the walls a storm of musketry fire and rockets was poured upon us but our gunners worked away unceasingly piece by piece the massive walls crumbled under our fire until on the 13th yawning gaps were torn through the walls of the cashmere and water bastions that night four engineer officersmedley long greathead and homecrept forward and examined the breaches and returned reporting that it would be possible to climb the heaps of rubbish and enter at the gaps in the wall orders were at once issued for the assault to take place at daybreak next morning  the assaulting force was divided into four columns the first composed of three hundred men of the seventyfifth regiment two hundred and fifty men of the first bengal fusiliers and four hundred and fifty men of the second punjaub infantryin all one thousand men under brigadiergeneral nicholson were to storm the breach near the cashmere bastion the second column consisting of two hundred and fifty men of the eighth regiment two hundred and fifty men of the second bengal fusiliers and three hundred and fifty men of the fourth sikh infantry under colonel jones qb were to storm the breach in the water bastion the third column consisting of two hundred men of the fiftysecond regiment two hundred and fifty men of the ghoorka kumaan battalion and five hundred men of the first punjaub infantry under colonel campbell were to assault by the cashmere gate which was to be blown open by the engineers the fourth column eight hundred and sixty strong was made up of detachments of european regiments the sirmoor battalion of ghoorkas and the guides it was commanded by major reed and was to carry the suburb outside the walls held by the rebels called kissengunge and to enter the city by the lahore gate in addition to the four storming columns was the reserve fifteen hundred strong under brigadier longfield it consisted of two hundred and fifty men of the sixtyfirst regiment three hundred of the beloochee battalion four hundred and fifty of the fourth punjab infantry three hundred of the jhind auxiliary force and two hundred of the sixtieth rifles who were to cover with their fire the advance of the storming column and then to take their places with the reserves this body was to await the success of the storming column and then follow them into the city and assist them as required the cavalry and the rest of the force were to cover the flank and defend the ridge should the enemy attempt a counter attack  precisely at four oclock on the morning of the 14th the sixtieth rifles dashed forward in skirmishing order toward the walls and the heads of the assaulting columns moved out of the batteries which had until this moment kept up their fire without intermission  the warreners were on duty by the side of general nicholson and accustomed as they were to danger their hearts beat fast as they awaited the signal it was to be a tremendous enterprisean enterprise absolutely unrivaled in historyfor five thousand men to assault a city garrisoned by some thirty thousand trained troops and a fanatical and turbulent population of five hundred thousand all it may be said fighting with ropes round their necks  as the rifles dashed forward in front and the head of the column advanced a terrific fire of musketry broke out from wall and bastion which the british all necessity for concealment being over answered with a tremendous cheer as they swept forward arrived at the ditch there was a halt it took some time to place the ladders and officers and men fell fast under the hail of bullets then as they gathered in strength in the ditch there was one wild cheer and they dashed up the slope of rubbish and stones and passed through the breach  the entrance to delhi was won  scrambling breathlessly up keeping just behind their gallant general the warreners were among the first to win their way into the city  an equally rapid success had attended the assault upon the breach in the water bastion by the second column nor were the third far behind in the assault through the cashmere gate but here a deed had first to be done which should live in the memories of englishmen so long as we exist as a nation  as the head of the assaulting column moved forward a little party started at the double toward the cashmere gate the party consisted of lieutenants home and salkeld of the royal engineers and sergeants smith and carmichael and corporal burgess of the same corps bugler hawthorne of the fiftysecond regiment and twentyfour native sappers and miners under havildars mahor and tilluh sing each of the sappers carried a bag of powder and covered by such shelter as the fire of the sixtieth skirmishers could give them they advanced to the gate this gate stands close to an angle in the wall and from the parapets a storm of musketry fire was poured upon them when they reached the ditch they found the drawbridge destroyed but crossed in single file upon the beams on which it rested the gate was of course closed but a small posterndoor beside it was open and through this the mutineers added a heavy fire to that which streamed from above the sappers laid their bags against the gate and slipped down into the ditch to allow the firing party to do their work many had already fallen sergeant carmichael was shot dead as he laid down his powder bag havildar mahor was wounded as lieutenant salkeld tried to fire the fuse he fell shot through the arm and leg while havildar tilluh sing who stood by was killed and ramloll sepoy was wounded as he fell lieutenant salkeld handed the slow match to corporal burgess who lit the fuse but fell mortally wounded as he did so then those who survived jumped or were helped into the ditch and in another moment a great explosion took place and the cashmere gate blew into splinters killing some forty mutineers who were behind it then lieutenant home seeing that the way was clear ordered bugler hawthorne to sound the advance and the assaulting column came rushing forward with a cheer and burst through the gateway into the city  of the six englishmen who took part in that glorious deed only two lived to wear the victoria cross the reward of valor two had died on the spot and upon the other four general wilson at once bestowed the cross but lieutenant salkeld died of his wounds and lieutenant home was killed within a week of the capture of the city thus only sergeant smith and bugler hawthorne lived to wear the honor so nobly won  general nicholson who was in general command of the whole force concentrated the two columns which had entered in a wide open space inside the cashmere gate and then swept the enemy off the ramparts as far as the moree bastion the whole of the north wall being now in the possession of our troops then he proceeded to push on toward the lahore gate where he expected to meet major reed with the fourth column this column had however failed even to reach the lahore gate the enemys position in the suburb beyond the wall proving so strong and being held by so numerous a force that after suffering very heavily the commander had to call back his men his retreat being covered by the cavalry  thus as general nicholson advanced through the narrow lane between the wall and the houses the column was swept by a storm of fire from window loophole and housetopa fire to which no effective reply was possible then just as he was in the act of cheering on his men the gallant soldier fell back in the arms of those behind him mortally wounded he was carried off by his sorrowing soldiers and lingered until the 26th of the month when to the deep grief of the whole army he expired  it being evident that any attempt to force a path further in this direction would lead to useless slaughter and that the place must be won step by step by the aid of artillery the troops were called back to the bastion  a similar experience had befallen the third column which had guided by sir t metcalfe who knew the city intimately endeavored to make a circuit so as to reach and carry the jumma musjid the great mosque which dominated the city so desperate was the resistance experienced that this column had also to fall back to the ramparts the reserve column had followed the third in at the cashmere gate and had after some fighting possessed itself of some strong buildings in that neighborhood most important of which was a large and commanding house the residence of achmed ali khan and when the third column fell back skinners house the church the magazine and the mainguard were held and guns were planted to command the streets leading thereto one cause of the slight advance made that day was that the enemy knowing the weakness of the british soldier had stored immense quantities of champagne and other wines beer and spirits in the streets next to the ramparts and the troopsbritish sikhs beloochees and ghoorkas alikeparched with thirst and excited by the sight of these long untasted luxuries fell into the snare and drank so deeply that the lighting power of the force was for awhile very seriously impaired  on the 15th the stubborn fighting recommenced from house to house our troops fought their way frequently when the street was so swept by fire that it was impossible to progress there making their way by breaking down the party walls and so working from one house into another during this day guns and mortars were brought into the city from our batteries and placed so as to shell the palace and the great building called the selimgur  the next morning the sixtyfirst regiment and the fourth punjaub rifles made a rush at the great magazine and the rebels were so stricken by their rapidity and dash that they threw down their portfires and fled without even once discharging the cannon which crammed to the muzzle with grape commanded every approach here one hundred and twentyfive cannon and an enormous supply of ammunition fell into our hands and a great many of the guns were at once turned against their late owners  so day by day the fight went on at night the sky was red with the flames of burning houses by day a pall of smoke hung over the city from either side cannon and mortars played unceasingly while the rattle of musketry the crash of falling houses the shrieks of women the screams of children and the shouting of men mingled in a chaos of sounds to the credit of the british soldier be it said that infuriated as they were by the thirst for vengeance the thought of the murdered women and the heat of battle not a single case occurred so far as is known of a woman being illtreated insulted or fired uponalthough the women had been present in the massacres and had constantly accompanied and cheered on the sorties of the mutineers to the sepoys met with in delhi no mercy was shown every man taken was at once bayoneted and the same fate befell all townsmen found fighting against us the rest of the men as well as the women and children were after the fighting was over permitted to leave the city unmolested although large numbers of them had taken share in the sack of the white inhabitants houses and the murder of every christian british or native in the town it would however have been impossible to separate the innocent from the guilty consequently all were allowed to go free  from the time that the british troops burst through the breaches an exodus had begun from the gates of the town on the other side and across the bridge over the jumna our heavy guns could have destroyed this bridge and our cavalry might have swept round the city and cut off the retreat on the other side but the proverb that it is good to build a bridge for a flying foe was eminently applicable here had the enemy felt their retreat cut offhad they known that certain death awaited them unless they could drive us out of the city the defense would have been so desperate that it would have been absolutely impossible for the british forces to have accomplished it the defense of some of the spanish towns in the peninsular war by the inhabitants lighting from house to house against french armies showed what could be effected by desperate men lighting in narrow streets and the loss inflicted on our troops at nujufghur by twenty sepoys was another evidence of the inexpediency of driving the enemy to despair as it was the rebels after the first day fought feebly and were far from making the most of the narrow streets and stronglybuilt houses no one liked to be the first to retreat but all were resolved to make off at the earliest opportunity men grew distrustful of each other and day by day the desertions increased the resistance diminished and the districts held by the rebels grew smaller and smaller it is true that by thus allowing tens of thousands of rebels to escape we allowed them to continue the war in the open country but here as it afterward proved they were contemptible foes and their defeat did not cost a tithe of the loss which would have resulted in their extermination within the walls of delhi  up to the 20th the palace still held out this was a fortress in itself mounting many cannon on its walls and surrounded by an open parklike space on that morning the engineers began to run a trench to enable a battery to be erected to play upon the lahore gate of the palace before however they had been long at work a party of men of the sixtyfirst with some sikhs and ghoorkas ran boldly forward and taking shelter under a low wall close to the gate opened fire at the embrasures and loopholes the answering fire was so weak that colonel jones who was in command of the troops in this quarterconvinced that the report that the king with his wives and family and the greater part of the garrison of the palace had already left was truedetermined upon blowing in the gate at once lieutenant home was appointed to lead the party told off for the duty which was happily effected without loss the british rushed in and found three guns loaded to the muzzle placed in the gateway but fortunately the sepoys who should have fired them had fled  the news that the palace was taken spread rapidly and there was a rush to share in the spoil but few of the enemy were found inside these were at once bayoneted and then a general scramble ensued the order had been given that no private plundering should be allowed but that everything taken should be collected and sold for the general benefit of the troops orders like this are however never observed at any rate with portable articles and sikhs ghoorkas and british alike loaded themselves with spoil cashmere shawls worth a hundred pounds were sold for five shillings silk dresses might be had for nothing and jewelry went for less than the value of the setting  the same day the headquarters of the army were removed to the palace of delhi as the union jack of england ran up the flagstaff on the palace so lately occupied by the man crowned by the rebels emperor of india the seat and headquarters of the revolt which had deluged the land with blood and caused the rule of england to totter a royal salute was fired by the british guns and tremendous cheers arose from the troops in all parts of the city  the raising of that flag the booming of those guns were the signal of the deathblow of the indian mutiny over one hundred thousand rebels were still in arms against the british government but the heart of the insurrection was gone it was no longer a war it was a rebellion there was no longer a head a center or a common aim each body of mutineers fought for themselvesfor life rather than for victory the final issue of the struggle was now certain and all the native princes who had hitherto held aloof watching the issue of the fight at delhi and remaining neutral until it was decided whether the sepoys could pluck up the british flag from the ridge or the british tear down the emblem of rebellion from above the palace of delhi hesitated no longer but hastened to give in their allegiance to the victorious power  nothing has been said as to the part the warreners bore in that fierce six days fighting they did their duty as did every other man in the british army but they had no opportunity for specially distinguishing themselves as staff officers they had often to carry messages to troops engaged in stubborn fight and in doing so to dash across open spaces and run the gantlet of a score of musket balls both however escaped without a scratch they had not been present on the occasion of the taking of the palace for they had been at early morning on the point of going in to the headquarters for orders when captain hodgson came out they had dined with him on the day previous to the assault and he came up them now  now he said i am just going on an expedition after your own hearts lads we have news that the king and queen have stolen away and have gone to the palace at the kotub minar i am going with my troops to bring them in would you like to go  oh yes of all things the warreners exclaimed but we have no horses  oh i can mount you he said several of my fellows slipped into the town in hopes of getting some loot and three or four were shot so if the general will give you leave i will take you  the warreners at once went in to brigadiergeneral jones to whom they had been attached since the fall of general nicholson as they were supernumeraries on his staff the general at once gave them leave and in high delight they followed their frienda most gallant and fearless officer who had greatly distinguished himself by the dashing exploits which he had executed with his troop of irregular horseto his camp outside the walls half an hour later they were riding at a trot toward the spot where the exemperor had taken refuge their route lay across ground hitherto in possession of the enemy and they rode past thousands of armed budmashes or blackguards of delhi who had left the city and were making their way to join some of the rebel leaders in the field these scowled and muttered curses as the little troop rode by but the blow which had just been dealt was so crushing the dread inspired by british valor so complete that although apparently numerous enough to have destroyed the little band without difficulty not a man dared raise his voice or lift a weapon  what are all these wonderful ruins dick asked captain hodgson by whose side they were riding  this is where old delhi stood these great buildings are tombs of kings and other great men the smaller houses have gone to dust centuries ago but these massive buildings will remain for as many centuries more wait till you see kotub minar in my opinion there is nothing in india or in the world to equal it  another halfhours riding brought them into sight of a magnificent shaft of masonry rising far above the plain  that is the minar captain hodgson said it is the same word as minaret is it not magnificent  the kotub minar is an immense shaft tapering gradually toward the top it is built in stages with a gallery round each each stage is different in one it is fluted with round columns like a huge mass of basalt in another the columns are angular and in the next round and angular alternately the highest stage is plain the height is very great and the solidity of execution and the strength of the edifice are as striking as its height and beauty  they were not however to go so far as the kotub for questioning some peasants they learned that the king had halted at a building called durzahnizamoodeen the gates were shut and it was certain that the king would have a large body of retainers with him matchlock men showed at the windows and on the roof and things looked awkward for the little troop of cavalry captain hodgson rode forward however without hesitation and struck on the great gate a window by the side of the gate opened and he was asked what was wanted  i am come to take and to carry into delhi the exking and his family it is better to submit quietly for if i have to force my way in every soul in the place will be put to the sword  in two minutes the postern opened and a closely veiled figure made her appearance  i am the begum she said and captain hodgson bent in acknowledgment that the favorite wife of the man who was yesterday regarded as the emperor of india stood before him  the king will surrender she said if you will promise that his life shall be spared if not he will defend himself to the last and will die by his own hand  defense would be useless captain hodgson said the force i have would suffice amply to carry the place and if it did not in three hours any reinforcements i could ask for would be here i have no authority to give such a promise  if you give the promise it will be kept the begum said if you refuse the king will shoot himself when the first soldier passes the gate  captain hodgson hesitated it was true that he had no authority to make such a promise but he felt that government would far rather have the king a captive in their hands than that he should excite a feeling of regret and admiration among the people by dying by his own hand in preference to falling into those of the british  i agree he said after a pause i promise that the kings life shall be spared  in a minute the gate was thrown back and an aged man came out followed by several women the age of the king was nearly eightyfive and he was from first to last a mere puppet in the hands of others in no case would he have been executed by the government since the old man was clearly beyond any active participation in what had taken place  the litter in which the king and his wives had been conveyed from delhi was again brought into requisition and the party were soon en route for delhi the royal palace had been but a few hours in our hands before the exking was brought in a prisoner where he had so lately reigned he was lodged with his women in a small building in the palace under a strong guard until it should be decided what to do with him  i shall go out tomorrow to try and catch some of the sons of the old man they are the real culprits in the matter if you like to go out again and can get off duty well and good captain hodgson said  the boys who were very pleased at having been present at so historical an event as the capture of the king of delhi warmly thanked captain hodgson and having again obtained leave started with him on the following morning at daybreak some of the princes a spy had reported to captain hodgson as being at humayoons tomb a large building near the kotub minar they rode in the same direction that they had gone out on the preceding day but proceeded somewhat further  that is humayoons tomb captain hodgson said pointing to a large square building with a domed roof and four lofty minarets standing half a mile off the road  the troop rode up at a gallop and surrounding the building dismounted soldiers were placed at all the various doors of the building with orders to shoot down any one who might come out and captain hodgson sent a loyal moulvie named rujol ali who had accompanied him into the building to order the princes there to come out then arose within the building a great tumult of voices as the question whether they should or should not surrender was argued several times the moulvie returned to ask if any conditions would be given but hodgson said sternly that no conditions whatever would be made with them  at last after two hours delay two of the sons and a grandson of the king all of whom had been leaders in the mutiny and authors of massacres and atrocities came out and surrendered they were immediately placed in a carriage which had been brought for the purpose a guard was placed over them and ordered to proceed slowly toward the city  then hodgson accompanied by the warreners entered the inclosure which surrounded the tomb here from five to six thousand of the refuse of the city many of them armed were assembled a yell of hate arose as the little band entered guns were shaken defiantly sabers waved in the air the odds were tremendous and the warreners felt that nothing remained but to sell their lives dearly  lay down your arms captain hodgson shouted in a stentorian voice  eight or ten shots were fired from the crowd and the bullets whistled over the heads of the horsemen but fortunately none were hit  lay down your arms he shouted again men unsling your carbines level  as the carbines were leveled the bravery of the mob evaporated at once those nearest threw down their arms and as with leveled guns the horsemen rode through the crowd arms were everywhere thrown down and resistance was at an end over a thousand guns five hundred swords and quantities of daggers and knives were collected and a number of elephants camels and horses were captured  ordering the native lieutenant to remain with the troop in charge of these things until some carts could be sent out for the arms captain hodgson accompanied by the boys rode off after the carriage which had started two hours before  they rode rapidly until they neared delhi when they saw the carriage surrounded by a great mob captain hodgson set spurs to his horse and galloped forward at full speed followed by the boys they burst through the crowd who were a large body of ruffians who had just left the city where the fighting was even now not over and who were all armed a defiant cry broke from them as the three horsemen rode up to the carriage from which with the greatest difficulty the guard had so far kept the crowd  there was not a moment for hesitation captain hodgson raised a hand and a momentary silence reigned  these men in the carriage said he in loud tones have not only rebelled against the government but have ordered and witnessed the massacre and shameful treatment of women and children thus therefore the government punishes such traitors and murderers  then drawing his revolver before the crowd could move or lift a hand he shot the three prisoners through the head the crowd awed and astonished fell back and the carriage with the dead bodies passed into the city     chapter xix  a riot at cawnpore   while the guns of delhi were saluting the raising of the british flag over the royal palace general havelock and his force were fighting their way up to lucknow on the 19th of september he crossed the ganges brushed aside the enemys opposition and after three days march in a tremendous rain found them in force at the alumbagh after a short sharp fight they were defeated and the alumbagh fell into our hands all the stores and baggage were left here with a force strong enough to hold it against all attacks and after a day to rest his troops general havelock advanced on the 22d defeated the enemy outside lucknow and then as the direct route was known to be impassable he followed the canal as far as the kaiserbagh and there turning off fought his way through the streets to the residency where he arrived only just in time for the enemy had driven two mines right under the defenses and these would had the reinforcements arrived but one day later have been exploded and the fate of the garrison of cawnpore might have befallen the defenders of lucknow  the desperate street fighting had however terribly weakened the little force which had performed the feat out of fifteen hundred men who had entered the city a third were killed or wounded among the former being the gallant brigadiergeneral neil  with so weak a force it was evident that it would be hopeless to endeavor to carry off the sick the wounded the women and children through the army of rebels that surrounded them and it was therefore determined to continue to hold the residency until further aid arrived the siege therefore recommenced but under different conditions for the increased force enabled the british to hold a larger area and although the discomforts and privations were as great as beforefor the reinforcements had brought no food in with themthe danger of the place being carried by assault was now entirely at an end  one noble action connected with the relief of lucknow will never be forgotten before general havelock started up from cawnpore general sir james outram his senior officer arrived with authority to take the command upon his arrival however he issued a general order to say that to general havelock who had done such great deeds to relieve lucknow should be the honor of the crowning success and that he therefore waived his seniority and would fight under general havelock as a volunteer until lucknow was relieved a more generous act of selfnegation than this was never accomplished to the man who relieved lucknow would fall honor fame the gratitude of the english people and all this general outram of his own accord resigned he was worthy indeed of the name men gave him the bayard of india  the news that lucknow was relieved caused almost as much delight to the troops at delhi as their own successes had given them for the anxiety as to the safety of the garrison was intense to the warreners the news gave an intense pleasure for the thought of the friends they had left behind in that terrible strait had been ever present to their mind the faces of the suffering women the tender girls the delicate children had haunted them night and day and their joy at the thought that these were rescued from the awful fate impending over them knew no bounds  it was not at delhi however that the warreners heard the news for on the 23d only three days after the occupation of the city they left with the flying column of colonel greathead which was ordered to march down to agra clearing away the bands of mutineers which infested the intervening country and then to march to cawnpore to be in readiness to advance on lucknow the boys had no difficulty in obtaining leave to accompany this column as ned would naturally on the first opportunity rejoin his regiment which was at cawnpore while dick was longing to form one of the naval brigade which under captain peel was advancing up the country  the rebels were found in force at allyghur and were defeated without difficulty and after several minor skirmishes the force marched hastily down to agra which was threatened by a large body of the enemy without a halt they marched thirty miles to agra and encamped in the open space outside the fort  just as they were cooking their meals a battery of artillery opened upon them an infantry fire broke out from the surrounding houses and a large body of cavalry dashed in among them  for a moment all was confusion but the troops were all inured to war with wonderful rapidity they rallied and attacked the enemy who were over five thousand strong and finally defeated them with great slaughter and captured fourteen guns agra saved the column started two days later for cawnpore upon the way it defeated bodies of rebels and punished some zemindars who had taken part against us and arrived at cawnpore on the 26th of october  at majupoorie halfway up from agra the force had been joined by a brigade under colonel hope grant who as senior officer took the command of the column they marched into cawnpore three thousand five hundred strong all troops who had gone through the siege of delhi and ned at once joined his regiment where he was warmly received  on the following day the ninetythird highlanders and a part of the naval brigade two hundred strong arrived and dicks delight as the column marched in was unbounded he reported himself for duty at once and as among the officers were some of his own shipmates he was at once at home  there was little sleep in the tents of the junior officers of the brigade that night dicks name had been twice mentioned in dispatches and all sorts of rumors as to his doings had reached his comrades the moment therefore that dinner was over dick was taken to a tent placed on a very high box on a table supplied with grog and ordered to spin his yarn which although modestly told elicited warm applause from his hearers  on the 30th colonel grants column moved forward and arrived after three days march within six miles of the alumbagh they had with them a great convoy of siege material and provisions and these were next day escorted safely into the alumbagh where the little garrison had held their own though frequently attacked for six weeks the sixtyfourth regiment had already done so much fighting that it was not to form part of the advance the naval brigade was increased on the 1st of november by the arrival of captain peel himself with two hundred more sailors and four hundred troops they had had a heavy fight on the way up and had protected the convoy and siege guns of which they were in charge and had defeated the enemy four thousand strong and captured all his guns but with a loss to themselves of nearly one hundred men soon after the commencement of the engagement colonel powell who was in command of the column was killed and captain peel then took command of the force and won the victory  the astonishment of the people of cawnpore at the appearance of the brawny tars was unbounded the sailors went about the streets in knots of two or three staring at the contents of the shops and as full of fun and good humor as so many schoolboys greatly delighted were they when the natives gave them the least chance of falling foul of themfor they knew that the people of the town had joined the mutineersand were only too glad of an excuse to pitch into them they all carried cutlasses but these they disdained to use trusting and with reason to their fists which are to the natives of india a more terrible because a more mysterious weapon than the sword a sword they understand but a quick hit flush from the shoulder which knocks them off their feet as if struck by lightning is to them utterly incomprehensible and therefore very terrible  one day the warreners were strolling together through the town and turned off from the more frequented streets with a view of seeing what the lowerclass quarters were like they had gone some distance when ned said  i think we had better turn dick these scowling scoundrels would be only too glad to put a knife into us and we might be buried away under ground in one of these dens and no one be ever any the wiser for it i have no doubt when we have finished with the fellows and get a little time to look round there will be a clear sweep made of all these slums  the lads turned to go back when dick said listen  they paused and could hear a confused sound of shouting and a noise as of a tumult they listened attentively  ned dick exclaimed i am sure some of those shouts are english some of our fellows have got into a row come on  so saying he dashed off up the narrow street accompanied by his brother down two more lanes and then in an open space where five or six lanes met they saw a crowd in the midst of it they could see sabers flashing in the air while british shouts mingled with the yells of the natives  this is a serious business ned said as they ran we are in the worst part of cawnpore  three or four natives as they approached the end of the lane stepped forward to prevent their passage but the lads threw them aside with the impetus of their rush and then shoulder to shoulder charged the crowd  expecting no such assault the natives fell aside from the shock and in a few seconds the boys stood by their countrymen there were six in all sailors as the boys had expected the fight had evidently been a sharp one four or five natives lay upon the ground and two of the sailors were bleeding from swordcuts the tars gave a cheer at the sight of this reinforcement especially as one of the newcomers was a naval officerfor dick had bought the uniform of a naval officer killed in the fight of the 1st  the infuriated crowd drew back for a moment but seeing that the reinforcement consisted only of two lads again attacked fiercely the boys had drawn their swords and for a minute the little party fought back to back it was evident however that this could not last for every moment added to the number of their foes the budmashes flocking down from every quarter  now lads ned shouted get yourselves ready and when i say the word make a dash all together for that house at the left corner the door is open once in there we can hold it till help comes press them a bit first so as to scatter them a little and then for a rush are you all ready now  with a cheer the sailors hurled themselves upon the crowd in a body the surprise added to the weight and force of the charge was irresistible the natives were sent flying like ninepins and before the enemy quite understood what had happened the whole party were safe in the house and the door slammedto and bolted  see if there are any windows they can get in at  the men ran into the two rooms of which on the ground floor the house consisted but the windows in these as is often the case in indian towns were strongly barred there was a furious beating at the door  it will give in a minute dick said upstairs lads we can hold them against any number  its lucky they did not use their pistols ned said as they gathered in the upper room we should have been polished off in no time had they done so  i expect they made sure of doing for us with their swords and knives dick replied and did not like to risk calling attention by the sound of pistolshots now lads how did you get into this row  well your honor said one of the tars we were just cruising about as it might be when we got down these here lanes and lost our bearings altogether well we saw we had fallen among land pirates for the chaps kept closing in upon us as if they wanted to board and fingering those long knives of theirs then one of them he gives a push to bill jones and bill gives him a broadside between the eyes and floors him then they all begins to yell like a pack o they jackals we heard coming up country then they drew their knives and bill got a slash on his cheek so we seeing as how it were a regular case of an engagement all along the line drew our cutlasses and joins action there were too many of them though and we were nigh carried by the pirates when you bore up alongside  at this moment a crash was heard below the door had yielded and the crowd rushed into the lower part of the house when it was found to be empty there was a little delay no one cared to be the first to mount the stairs and encounter the determined band above dick stepped forward to glance at the state of things below when half a dozen pistolshots were fired one inflicted a nasty cut on his cheek and another struck him on the hand  are you hurt dick ned said as his brother leaped back  no nothing to speak of but it was a close shave perkins pick up my sword will you i didnt think of their firing  being indoors they are not afraid of the pistols being heard any distance ned said keep a sharp lookout lads in case they make a rush upstairs while i tie up my brothers hand and face  they are coming sir the sailors cried as the house shook with the rush of a body of men up the stairs  stand well back lads and cut them down as they enter the door  pushed from behind five or six of the enemy burst simultaneously into the room but ere they could fire a pistol or even put themselves into an attitude of defense they were cut down or run through the body then a tremendous crash and a wild cry was heard  hurrah dick shouted the staircase has given way  many groans and shrieks were heard below then there was a sound of persons being carried out and for awhile quiet below while outside the hubbub became greater  what is going on outside ned said and dick and he peered through the closed jalousies into the street  a number of budmashes were bringing bundles of bamboos from a basket makers shop opposite some of the crowd were opposing them  they are going to fire the house dick exclaimed the people opposing are the neighbors no doubt theyll do it though he added as the fiercer spirits drove the others back whats best to be done ned  ned looked round and then up  let us cut through the bamboo ceiling dick there must be a space between that and the roof the wall wont be thick between that and the next house and we can work our way from house to house and if the flames gainfor they are sure to spreadwe can but push off the tiles and take to the roofs and run the gantlet of their pistols and muskets their bloods up now and they will shoot to a certainty do you think that the best plan  thats it now lads two of you stand close together now perkins you jump on their shoulders and cut a hole through the bamboos with your cutlass quick lads theres no time to lose for they could hear the tramping of feet below and the sound as the bundles of bamboo were thrown down  now lads dick went onfor as a naval officer he was naturally in command of the mentake two or three of those rugs on that couch there and knot them together shut the door to keep the smoke out there theyve lit itas a shout of pleasure rose from below  the bamboos were tough and perkins could not use his strength to advantage smoke curled up through the crevices of the floor and all watched anxiously the progress made  thats big enough dick cried at last we have not a moment to lose the flames are making through the floor now perkins climb through the hole now lads follow in turn  four of the sailors were rapidly through the hole  now lads one of you two dont waste time now ned catch hold of this mans legs and give him a hoist thats right now drop that rope lad now ned im in command go on now lads catch this bundle of rugs thats right give me one end there we are now spread one of those rugs over the hole to keep the smoke out now lads how is the wall  quite soft your honor well be through in a minute  in accordance with orders those first up had begun at once with their cutlasses to pick a hole through the mud wall which formed the partition between the houses although thicker below the divisions between what may be called the lofts of the houses were made but of a single brick of unbaked clay or mud and as dick clambered up through the hole the sailors had already made an opening quite large enough to get through all crept through it and again dick hung a rug over the hole to keep out the smoke  now lads attack the next wall again but dont make more noise about it than you can help the people below will be removing what things they can and making a row still they might hear us and it is as well they should think us burned in the house where we were but you must look sharp lads for the fire spreads through these driedup houses as if they were built of straw  the sailors labored hard and they worked their way from house to house but the flames followed as fast and at last almost choked by smoke and dust dick said  quick my men knock off some tiles and get on the roof or we shall be burned like rats in a trap this side the furthest from the street  the tiles gave way readily and each man thrust his head out through the hole he had made for a breath of fresh air in a minute all were on the roof  crouch down lads keep on this side of the roof people are not likely to be looking out for us this side they will be too busy moving their furniture move on boys the fire is spreading now pretty nearly as fast as we can scramble along  it was already a great fire down both the lanes at whose junction the house first fired stood the flames had spread rapidly and leaping across the narrow streets had seized the opposite houses already fifty or sixty houses were in a blaze although it was not five minutes from the beginning of the fire  there is a cross lane about ten houses ahead dick ned said  we will stick on the last house as long as we can ned and then slide down by the rope on to that outhouse they are too busy now with their own affairs to think about us besides they suppose we are dead long ago and the fellows who are at the head of it will have made off to look after their own houses for the wind is blowing fresh and there is no saying how far the fire may spread besides we shall have our fellows up in a few minutes directly the fire is seen they are sure to be sent down to preserve order  they were soon gathered on the roof of the last house in the lane and three minutes later were driven from it by the flames one by one they scrambled down by the aid of the rope on to the outhouse and thence to the ground then they passed through the house into the lane beyond looking up the lane it was an arch of fire the flames were rushing from every window and towering up above every roof almost meeting over the lane upon the other hand all was wild confusion and terror men were throwing out of upper windows bedding and articles of furniture women laden with household goods and with children in their arms and others hanging to their clothes were making their way through the crowd bedridden people were being brought out and the screams shrieks and shouts mingled with the roaring of flames and the crashes of falling roofs as in great floods in india the tiger and the leopard the cobra and the deer may all be seen huddled together on patches of rising ground their mutual enmity forgotten in the common danger so no one paid the slightest attention to the body of englishmen who so suddenly joined the crowd  sheathe your cutlasses my lads dick said theres no more fighting to be done lend a hand to help these poor wretches there two of you take up that poor old creature they have carried her out and then left her take her on till you find some open space to set her down in now ned you take a couple of men and work one side of the lane i will take the opposite side with the others let us go into every room and see that no sick people or children are left behind there the flames have passed the cross lane already the corner house is on fire  for quarter of an hour the tars labored assiduously and many a bedridden old woman or a forgotten baby did they bring out fortunately at the end of the lane was an open space of some extent and here piles of household goods and helpless people were gathered  at the end of a quarter of an hour they heard a deep tramp and the naval brigade led by captain peel filed up through the lane the sailors burst into a cheer as they saw their friends arrive and these responded upon seeing some of their comrades at work carrying the sick and aged dick at once made his way to captain peel and reported briefly that the fire was in the first place lighted with the purpose of burning him and his party but that they had escaped and had since been at work helping the inhabitants  very well captain peel said you can give details afterward at present we have got to try and stop the flames it seems a large block of fire  it is sir it extends across several lanes there must be a couple of hundred houses in flames and i fear from what we have seen in the lane we have been working in a considerable loss of life  mr percival captain peel said to one of his officers take your company and knock down or blow up all the houses on this side of that lane there mr wilkinson you take number two company and do the same with the lane to the right the rest follow me march  in five minutes all the tars and the highlanderswho arrived on the ground immediately after the sailorswere at work pulling down houses so as to arrest the progress of the flames by isolating the burning block upon three sides they succeeded but upon the other the fire driven by the wind defied all their efforts and swept forward for half a mile until it burned itself out when it had reached the open country in its course it had swept away a great part of the worst and most crowded quarters of cawnpore  all through the evening and night the troops and sailors toiled and morning had broken before all danger of any further extension was over the men were then ordered home a fresh body of troops coming up to preserve order and prevent the robbery by the lawless part of the population of the goods which had been rescued from the flames then after a ration of grog had been first served out to each man and breakfast hastily cooked and eaten all sought their tents exhausted after their labors  it was not until evening that signs of life were visible in the camp then men began to move about and an orderly presently came across to request the warreners to go to captain peels quarters to report the circumstances through which the fire arose  the lads related the history of the affair from the time when they had come upon the scene and captain peel expressed himself in terms of warm laudation of their gallantry quickness and presence of mind then the sailors were called up and their story although longer and more diffuse than that told by the warreners was yet substantially the same and captain peel told the men that they ought not to have wandered in that way into the slums of cawnpore but that beyond that indiscretion they had acted as reported by mr warrener with great courage coolness and good discipline then the warreners went back to their tent and had to go through their yarn again with great minuteness and detail  i do think said rivers a midshipman of some two years older standing than dick that you are the luckiest youngster in the service it is not one fellow in a hundred thousand who has such chances  that is so rivers one of the lieutenants answered but it is not one in a hundred thousand who having gone through such adventures would have been alive to tell them at the end the getting into these scrapes may be luck but the getting out of them demands courage coolness and quickness of invention such as not one lad in a thousand possesses now rivers tell me honestly whether you think that had you been cut off as he was in that sortie at lucknow you would ever have thought of robbing that old fakir of his wig  no rivers said i am quite sure it would never have occurred to me yes as you say sir dick warrener has no end of luck but he certainly deserves and makes the best of it     chapter xx  the relief of lucknow   on the 6th of november captain peel with five hundred of his gallant bluejackets marched from cawnpore taking with them the heavy siege guns three days later they joined general grants column which was encamped at a short distance from the alumbagh and in communication with the force holding that position on the 9th sir colin campbell who had come out from england with all speed to assume the chief command in india arrived in camp and his coming was hailed with delight by the troops who felt that the hour was now at hand when the noble garrison of lucknow were to be rescued  the total force collected for the relief were her majestys eighth fiftythird seventyfifth and ninetythird regiments of infantry two regiments of punjaub infantry and a small party of native sappers and miners the cavalry consisted of the ninth lancers and detachments of sikh cavalry and hodgsons horse the artillery comprised peels naval brigade with eight heavy guns ten guns of the royal horse artillery six light field guns and a heavy battery of the royal artillery a total of about twentyseven hundred infantry and artillery and nine hundred cavalry  on the morning of the 10th mr kavanagh a civilian came into camp he had disguised as a native started the evening before from the residency with a native guide named kunoujee lal had swum the goomtee recrossed by the bridge into the city passed through the streets and finally made his way in safety he was perfectly acquainted with the city and brought plans from sir james outram for the guidance of the commanderinchief in his advance  after an examination of the plans sir colin campbell determined that instead of forcing his way through the narrow streets as general havelock had done he would move partly round the town and attack by the eastern side where there was much open ground sprinkled with palaces and mosques and other large buildings these could be attacked and taken one by one by a series of separate sieges and thus the residency could be approached with far less loss than must have taken place in an attempt to force a way through the crowded city  on the 15th the troops marched to the alumbagh defeating a small rebel force which attempted to stop their way  at the alumbagh dick warrenerfor ned was with his regiment which to his great disgust had remained at cawnporehad the joy of meeting his father again as warreners horse had not shared in havelocks advance to the residency but had remained as part of the garrison of the alumbagh it is needless to tell of the delight of that meeting after all that the lads had gone through since they parted from their father nearly four months before at cawnpore colonel warrener had heard of the safe arrival of his sons at delhi before he marched up from cawnpore but since then no word had reached him captains dunlop and manners were also delighted to meet him again and the whole of the troop vied with each other in the heartiness of the welcome accorded to him disease and death had sadly lessened the ranks and of the one hundred men who had volunteered at meerut to form a body of horse not more than fifty now remained in the ranks it was very late at nightor rather early in the morningbefore the party assembled in colonel warreners tent separated to seek a few hours sleep before the réveillé sounded for the troops to rise and prepare for the advance  soon after daybreak the column were under arms the seventyfifth regiment to its intense disappointment was ordered to stay and guard the alumbagh with its immense accumulation of stores and munitions and the rest of the troops turning off from the direct road and following the line the boys had traversed when they made their way into the residency marched for the dil koosha a huntingpalace of the late king of oude  the enemy who had anticipated an advance by the direct line taken by havelock and who had made immense preparations for defense in that quarter were taken aback by the movement to the right and no opposition was experienced until the column approached the beautiful park upon an elevated spot in which the dil koosha stood  then a brisk musketry fire was opened upon them the head of the column was extended in skirmishing order reinforcements were sent up and firing heavily as they advanced the british drove the enemy before them and two hours after the first shot was fired were in possession of the palace the enemy fled down the slope toward the city but the troops pressed forward and with but slight loss carried the strong position of the martinière college and drove the enemy across the canal by this time the enemys troops from the other side of the city were flocking up and prepared to recross the canal and give battle but some of the heavy guns were brought up to the side of the canal and the rebels made no further attempt to take the offensive  the result of the days fighting more than answered the commanderin chiefs expectations for not only had a commanding position from which the whole eastern suburb could be cannonaded been obtained but a large convoy of provisions and stores had been safely brought up and a new base of operations obtained  the next day the 15th of november is celebrated in the annals of british military history as that upon which some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting which ever took place in india occurred at a short distance beyond the canal stood the secunderbagh alexanders garden a building of strong masonry standing in a garden surrounded by a very high and strong wall this wall was loopholed for musketry the gate which led through a fortified gateway had been blocked with great piles of stones behind it and a very strong garrison held it in front a hundred yards distant was a fortified village also held in great force separated from the garden of the secunderbagh only by the road was the mosque of shah nujeeff this building was also situated in a garden with a strong loopholed wall and this was lined with the insurgent troops while the terraced roof of the mosque and the four minarets which rose at its corners were crowded with riflemen  the column of attack was commanded by brigadier hope and as it crossed the bridge of the canal and advanced a tremendous musketry fire was opened upon it from the village which formed the advanced post of the enemy the column broke up into skirmishing line and advanced steadily  the guns to the front said an aidedecamp galloping up to the naval brigade  with a cheer the sailors moved across the bridge following the horse artillery which dashed ahead unlimbered and opened fire with great rapidity it took somewhat longer to bring the ponderous sixtyeight pounders of the naval brigade into action but their deep roar when once at work astonished the enemy who had never before heard guns of such heavy metal  the rebels fought obstinately however but brigadiergeneral hope led his troops gallantly forward and after a brief stern fight the enemy gave way and fled to the secunderbagh  the guns were now brought forward and their fire directed at the strong wall the heavy cannon soon made a breach and the assault was ordered the fourth sikhs had been directed to lead the attack while the ninetythird highlanders and detachments from the fiftythird and other regiments were to cover their advance by their musketry fire at the loopholes and other points from which the enemy were firing  the white troops were however too impatient to be at the enemy to perform the patient role assigned to them and so joined the sikhs in their charge the rush was so fierce and rapid that a number of men pushed through the little breach before the enemy had mustered in force to repel them the entrance was however too small for the impatient troops and a number of them rushed to the grated windows which commanded the gates putting their caps on the ends of the muskets they raised them to the level of the windows and every sepoy at the post discharged his musket at once before they could load again the troops leaped up tore down the iron bars and burst a way here also into the garden  illustration the rush was so fierce that a number of men pushed through the little breach before the enemy could repel them  then ensued a frightful struggle two thousand sepoys held the garden and these caught like rats in a trap fought with the energy of despair nothing however could withstand the troops mad with the longbalked thirst for vengeance and attacked with the crywhich in very truth was the deathknell of the enemyremember cawnpore on their lips no quarter was asked or given it was a stubborn furious desperate strife man to mandesperate sepoy against furious englishman but in such a strife weight and power tell their tale and not one of the two thousand men who formed the garrison escaped two thousand dead bodies were next day counted within the four walls of the garden  the battle had now raged for three hours but there was more work yet to be done from the walls and minarets of the shah nujeeff a terrible fire had been poured upon the troops as they fought their way into the secunderbagh and the word was given to take this stronghold also the gate had been blocked up with masonry captain peel was ordered to take up the sixtyeightpounders and to breach the wall instead of halting at a short distance the gallant sailor brought up his guns to within ten yards of the wall and set to work as if he were fighting his ship broadside to broadside with an enemy it was an action probably unexampled in war had such an attack been made unsupported by infantry the naval brigade would have been annihilated by the storm of fire from the walls and dick warreners career would have come to a close the highlanders and their comrades however opened with such a tremendous fire upon the points from which the enemy commanded the battery and at every loophole in the wall that the mutineers could only keep up a wild and very ineffectual fire upon the gunners the massive walls crumbled slowly but surely and in four hours several gaps were made  then the guns ceased their fire and the infantry with a wild cheer burst into the garden of the shah nujeeff and filled the mosque and garden with the corpses of their defenders the loss of the naval brigade in this gallant affair was not heavy and dick warrener escaped untouched  evening was approaching now and the troops bivouacked for the night the ninetieth and that portion of the fiftythird not engaged in the assault of the secunderbagh and shah nujeeff were now to have their turn as leaders of the attack  the next point to be carried was the messhouse a very strong position situated on an eminence with flanking towers a loopholed mud wall and a ditch the naval guns began the fray and the heavy shot soon effected a breach in the wall the defenders of the post were annoyed too by a mortar battery in an advanced post of the british force in the residency for the space between the garrison and the relieving force was rapidly lessening the word was given and the ninetieth fiftythird and sikhs dashed forward surmounted all obstacles and carried the position with the bayonet and the observatory which stood behind it was soon afterward most gallantly carried by a sikh regiment  in the meantime the garrison of the residency was not idle on the day of the arrival of the british at dil koosha flagsignals from the towers of that palace had established communication with the residency and it was arranged that as soon as the relieving forces obtained possession of the secunderbagh the troops of the garrison should begin to fight their way to meet them  delighted at taking the offensive after their long siege havelocks troops on the 16th attacked the enemy with fury and carried two strong buildings known as hern khana and enginehouse and then dashed on through the chuttur munzil and carried all before them at the point of the bayonet  all the strongholds of the enemy along this line had now fallen and on the 17th of march sir colin campbell met generals outram and havelock amid the tremendous cheers of british troops which for awhile drowned the heavy fire which the enemy was still keeping up  the loss of the relieving column during the operations was far less than that which had befallen havelocks force in its advancefor it amounted only to one hundred and twentytwo officers and men killed and three hundred and fortyfive wounded the loss of the enemy considerably exceeded four thousand the relieving force did not advance into the residency but were stationed along the line which they had conquered between the dil koosha and the residency for the enemy were still in enormously superior force and threatened to cut the line by which the british had penetrated  the first operation was to pour in a supply of luxuries from the stores at the dil koosha white bread oranges bananas wine tea sugar and other articles were sent forward and these to those who had for nearly six months existed on the barest and coarsest food were luxuries indeed an even greater pleasure was afforded by sending in the mails which had accumulated and thus affording the garrison the intense delight of hearing of those loved ones at home from whom they had been so long cut off  the day that the junction was made dick obtained leave for a few hours to visit his friends in the residency it was singular to the lad to walk leisurely across the open space of the residency garden where before it would have been death to show ones self for a minute and to look about rather as an unconcerned spectator than as formerly with nerves on strain night and day to repel attack which if successful meant death to every soul in the place  in the battered walls the shattered roofs the destruction everywhere visible he saw how the terrors of the siege had increased after he had left and in view of the general havoc that met his view dick was astonished that any one should have survived the longcontinued bombardment in some respects the change had been favorable the accession of strength after the arrival of general havelocks force had enabled great and beneficial alteration to be made in the internal arrangements and the extension of the lines held had also aided in improving the sanitary condition but the change in the appearance of the place was trifling in comparison with that in the faces of the defenders these were it is true still pinched and thin for the supply of food had been reduced to a minimum and the rations had been lowered almost to starvation point but in place of the expression of deep anxiety or of stern determination then marked on every face all now looked joyous and glad for the end to the terrible trials had arrived  as he moved along men looked at the midshipman curiously and then as the lad advanced with outstretched hands greeted him with cries of astonishment and pleasure for it was naturally supposed in the garrison that the warreners had fallen in the sortie on johannes house very hearty were the greetings which dick received especially from those whom he met who had fought side by side with him at gubbins house this pleasure however was greatly dashed by the answers to his questions respecting friends dead dead killed were the replies that came to the greater part of the inquiries after those he had known and the family in whom he was chiefly interested had suffered heavily mr hargreaves was killed mr and mrs ritchie and all their children had succumbed to the confinement and privation but mrs hargreaves and the girls were well after briefly telling how they had escaped in disguise after having been cut off from falling back after the successful sortie dick warrener hurried off to the house where he heard that his friends were quartered  it was outside the bounds of the old residency for the ground held had since the arrival of havelocks force been considerably extended and the ladies had had two rooms assigned to them in a large building dick knocked at the door of the room and the ayah opened itlooked at him gave a scream and ran back into the room leaving the door open dick seeing that it was a sittingroom followed her in mrs hargreaves alarmed at the cry had just risen from her chair and nelly and edith ran in from the inner room as dick entered a general cry of astonishment broke from them  dick warrener mrs hargreaves exclaimed is it possible my clear boy thank god i see you again and your brother  he escaped too dick said  mrs hargreaves took him in her arms and kissed him as a dear relative would have done for during the month they had been together the boys had become very dear to her from their unvarying readiness to aid all who required it from their selfdevotion and their bravery nor were the girls less pleased and they warmly embraced the young sailor whom they had come to look upon as if he had been a member of the family and whom they had wept as dead  for a time all were too much moved to speak more than a few disjointed words for the sad changes which had occurred since they had last met were present in all their thoughts nelly the youngest was the first to recover and wiping away her tears she said halflaughing halfcrying  i hate you dick frightening us into believing that you were killed when you were alive and well all the time but i never quite believed it after all i said all along that you couldnt have been killed didnt i mamma and that monkeys always got out of scrapes somehow  mrs hargreaves smiled  i dont think you put it in that way exactly nelly but i will grant that between your fits of crying you used to assert over and over again that you did not believe that they were killed and now my dear boy tell us how this seeming miracle has come about  then they sat down quietly and dick told the whole story and mrs hargreaves warmly congratulated him on the manner in which they had escaped and upon the presence of mind they had shown then she in turn told him what they had gone through and suffered edith burst into tears and left the room and her mother presently went after her  well nelly i have seen a lot since i saw you have i not  yes you are a dear brave boy dick the girl said  even though i am a monkey eh dick answered and did you really cry when you thought i was dead  yes the girl said demurely i always cry when i lose my pets there was the dearest puppy i ever had  dick laughed quietly who is the monkey now he asked  i am she said frankly but you know i cant help teasing you dick  dont balk yourself nelly i like it i should like to be teased by you all my life he said in lower tones  the girl flushed up rosy red if you could always remain as you are now she said after a little pause just an impudent midshipman i should not mind it do you know dick they give terriers gin to prevent their growing dont you think you might stop yourself it is quite sad she went on pathetically to think that you may grow up into a great lumbering man  i am quite in earnest nelly dick said looking preternaturally stern  yes nelly said i have always understood midshipmen were quite in earnest when they talked nonsense  i am quite in earnest dick said solemnly and fixedly again  no really dick we are too old for that game nelly said with a great affectation of gravity i think we could enjoy hideandseek together or even blindmans buff but you know children never play at being little lovers after they are quite small i remember a dear little boy he used to wear pinafores  here mrs hargreaves again entered the room and dick jumping up suddenly said that it was quite time for him to be off i shall only just have time to be back by the time i promised  goodby dick i hope to see you again tomorrow  edith came in and there was a hearty shake of the hand all round except that dick only touched the tips of nellys fingers in a manner which he imagined betokened a dignified resentment although as he looked up and saw the girls eyes dancing with amusement he could scarcely flatter himself that it had produced any very serious effect dick returned in an indignant mood to the naval brigade which was quartered in the shah nujeeffs mosque and gardens  you are out of sorts tonight dick one of his brother midshipmen said as they leaned together upon the parapet of the mosque looking down on the city is anything the matter  were you ever in love harry  lots of times harry said confidently  and could you always persuade them that you were in earnest dick asked  harry meditated well i am not quite sure about that dick but then you see i was never quite sure myself that i was in earnest and thats rather a drawback you know  but what would you do harry supposing you were really quite in earnest and she laughed in your face and told you you were a boy dick asked  i expect the midshipman said laughing i should kiss her straight off and say that as i was a boy she couldnt object  oh nonsense dick said testily i want advice and you talk bosh  the midshipman winked confidentially at the moon there being no one else to wink at and then said gravely  i think dick the right thing to do would be to put your right hand on your heart and hold your left hand up with the forefinger pointing to the ceiling and to say madam i leave you now when years have rolled over our heads i will return and prove to you at once my affection and my constancy  dicks eyes opened to their widest and it was not until his friend went off in a shout of laughter that he was certain that he was being chaffed then with an exclamation of confound you harry he made a rush at his comrade who dodged his attack and darted off closely pursued by dick and as they dashed round the cupola and down the stairs their light hearted laughterfor dick soon joined in the laugh against himselfrose on the evening air and the tars smoking their pipes round the bivouac fires below smiled as the sound came faintly down to them and remarked them there midshipmites are larking just as if they were up in the maintop     chapter xxi  a sad parting   sir colin campbell had considered it possible that the enemy would upon finding that the residency was relieved and the prey of whose destruction they had felt so sure slipped from between their fingers leave the city and take to the open in which case he would after restoring order have left a strong body of troops in the city and have set off in pursuit of the rebels  it soon became apparent however that the enemy had no intention of deserting their stronghold lucknow abounded with palaces and mosques each of which had been turned into a fortress while every street was barricaded every wall loopholed as from forty thousand to fifty thousand men including many thousands of drilled soldiers stood ready to defend the town foot by foot it was clear that the fighting force at sir colin campbells command was utterly inadequate to attempt so serious an operation as the reduction of the whole city to leave a portion of the force would only have submitted them to another siege with the necessity for another advance to their relief the commanderinchief therefore determined to evacuate the residency and city altogether to carry off the entire garrison and to leave lucknow to itself until the reinforcements from england should arrive and he should be able to undertake the subjugation of the city with a force adequate for the purpose  his intention was kept a secret until the last moment lest the news might reach the enemy who from the batteries in their possession could have kept up a terrible fire upon the road along which the women and children would have to pass and who would have attacked with such fury along the whole line to be traversed that it would have been next to impossible to draw off the troops  in order to deceive the enemy guns were placed in position to play upon the town and a heavy fire was opened against the kaiserbagh or kings palace a fortress of great strength in the meantime preparations for retreat were quietly carried on bullock hackeries were prepared for the carriage of the ladies and children and on the morning of the 23d of november the occupants of the residency were informed that they must prepare to leave that afternoon and that no luggage beyond a few personal necessaries could be carried  the order awakened mingled emotionsthere was gladness at the thought of leaving a place where all had suffered so much and round which so many sad memories were centered there was regret in surrendering to the foe a post which had been so nobly defended for so many months among many too there was some dismay at the thought of giving up all their movable possessions to the enemy one small trunk was all that was allowed to each and as each tried to put together the most valuable of his or her belongings the whole of the buildings occupied were littered from end to end with handsome dresses silver plate mirrors clocks furniture and effects of all kinds a short time since every one would have gladly resigned all that they possessed for life and liberty but now that both were assured it was felt to be hard to give up everything  dick went in to mrs hargreaves to see if he could be of any service but there was comparatively little to do for that lady had lost all her portable property in the destruction of the bungalow on the estate owned by her husband and had come into lucknow shortly before the outbreak when the cloud began to lower heavily with but a small amount of baggage dick had not been able to see them since his first visit being incessantly on duty  i was so sorry i could not come up before he explained but each of the officers has been up to have a look at the residency and as we may be attacked at any moment captain peel expects them all to be on the spot with their men  shall we get away without being fired at nelly asked  i am afraid you will have to run the gantlet in one or two places dick said the enemy keep up an almost incessant fire and although we must hope they will not have an idea that any number of people are passing along the road and their fire will therefore be only a random one it may be a little unpleasant but you are all accustomed to that now i must be off again mrs hargreaves i really only came to explain why i did not come yesterday and only got leave for an hour so i have come at a trot all the way  and so dick made off again and as he shook hands with them he could feel that nelly had not yet forgiven the coldness of his last goodby  upon the previous day all the sick and wounded had been moved to the dil koosha that done the very large amount of money amounting to nearly a quarter of a million in the government treasury was removed together with such stores as were required then the guns were silently withdrawn from the batteries and at halfpast four in the afternoon the emigration of the women and children commenced all had to walk to the secunderbagh along a road strewn with débris and ankle deep in sand and in some places exposed to a heavy fire at one of these points a strong party of seamen were stationed among whom dick was on duty as each party of women arrived at the spot they were advised to stoop low and to run across at full speed as the road being a little sunk they thus escaped observation by the enemy whose battery was at some little distance but the grape whistled thickly overhead and several were wounded as they passed  dick had been on the lookout for the hargreaves party and came forward and had a talk with them before they started across the open spot he had quite recovered from nellys attack upon his dignity as a man and a naval officer and the pair as usual had a wordy spar dick was however rather serious at the prospect of the danger they were about to run  will you let me cross with you one at a time he asked  certainly not dick mrs hargreaves said you could do us no good and would run a silly risk yourself now girls are you ready  stoop low for heavens sake dick urged  mrs hargreaves started at a run accompanied by alice nelly was a little behind dick took her hand and ran across keeping between her and the enemy  down low he cried as when they were half across a heavy gun fired as he spoke he threw his arms round nelly and pulled her to the ground as he did so a storm of grape swept just above them striking the wall and sending a shower of earth over them another halfminute and they were across on the other side  goodby he said to them all you are over the worst now  goodby my dear boy mind how you cross again god bless you and mrs hargreaves and alice shook his hand and turned to go nelly held hers out to him he took it and clasped it warmly he was loosening his hold when the girl said you have saved my life dick  oh nonsense he said  you did sir andyes i am coming mammain answer to a word from her mother oh how stupid you are dick she cried with a little stamp of her foot dont you want to kiss me  of course i do dick said  then why on earth dont you do it sirthere that is enough god bless you dear dick and nelly darted off to join her mother  then he returned to his post and the ladies went on to the secunderbagh here a long halt was entailed until all were gathered there in order that they might be escorted by a strong guard on to the dil koosha then came an anxious journeysome in bullockcarts some in doolies some on foot the hargreaves walked for the anxiety was less when moving on foot than if shut up in a conveyance several times there were long halts in expectation of attack and a report that a great movement could be heard among the enemy at one time delayed them until reinforcements could be sent for and arrived but about midnight all reached the dil koosha where a number of tents had been erected and refreshments prepared for the many fugitives  later on the troops came tramping in having gradually and in regular order evacuated their posts leaving their fires burning and moving in absolute silence so that it was not until next morning that the enemy awoke to the knowledge that the residency was deserted and that their expected prey had safely escaped them  the next day was spent quietly all enjoying intensely the open air the relief from the long pressure and the good food wine and other comforts now at their disposal dick brought colonel warrener to make the acquaintance of his friends and a pleasant afternoon was spent together on the 25th a heavy gloom fell upon all for on that day the gallant general havelock worn out by his labors and anxieties was seized with dysentery and in a few hours breathed his last he was a good man as well as a gallant soldier and his death just at the moment when the safety of those for whom he had done so much was assured cast a gloom not only over his comrades and those who had fought under him but on the whole british nation all that day the great convoy had been on the move between the dil koosha and the alumbagh half the fighting force served as an escort the other half stood in battle order between them and lucknow in case the enemy should come out to the attack the whole road between the two stations was throughout the day covered by a continuous stream of bullock carts palanquins carts camels elephants guns ammunition carts and store wagons  mrs hargreaves and her daughters were on an elephant with their ayah and as the warreners had placed in the howdah a basket of refreshments the long weary march was borne not only without inconvenience but with some pleasure at the novelty of the scene and the delight of air and freedom  sir colin campbell had intended to allow a halt of seven days at the alumbagh but on the 27th of may a continuous firing was heard in the direction of cawnpore fearful for the safety of that allimportant post the commander determined to push forward his convoy at once on the morning of the 28th they started dick had come soon after daybreak to the tents where the hargreaves were with many others sleeping  there is bad news from cawnpore he said and you will have to push on i expect that it will be a terrible two days march with all this convoy pray take enough provisions with you for the two days in the howdah and some blankets and things to make a cover at night i am sure that the tents will not be got up and the confusion at the haltingplace will be fearful but if you have everything with you you will be able to manage  it was well that they were so prepared for the first march owing to the immense length of the convoy lasted until long past dark then there was a halt for a few hours and then a thirty miles journey to the bridge of boats on the ganges  the naval brigade accompanied the convoy but dick had seen nothing of his friends colonel warrener however who with his troop had moved along the line at intervals spoke to them and was able at the haltingplace to assist them to make a temporary shelter where they snatched a few hours sleep  the news that had caused this movement was bad indeed general wyndham in command at cawnpore had been defeated by the gwalior rebel contingent aided by the troops of nana sahib and those of koer sing a great oude chief and part of the town had been taken sir colin himself pushed forward at all speed with a small body of troops and some heavy guns so as to secure the safety of the bridge of boats for had this fallen into the hands of the enemy the situation of the great convoy would have been bad indeed however the rebels had neglected to take measures until it was too late and the approaches to the bridge on either side were guarded by our guns the passage of the convoy then began and for thirtynine hours a continuous stream passed across the river  the whole force which had accomplished the relief of lucknow had not returned as it was considered necessary to keep some troops to command the town and prevent the great body of mutineers gathered there from undertaking expeditions the alumbagh was accordingly held by the fifth seventyeighth eightyfourth and ninetieth foot the madras fusiliers the ferozepore sikhs and a strong artillery force the whole under the command of sir james outram  as the long day went on and the thunder of the guns at cawnpore grew louder and louder sir colin campbell took the naval brigade and the greater portion of the fighting troops and pushed forward the regiments as they arrived were hurried across the bridge to take part in the defense of the position guarding the bridge where general wyndhams troops were defending themselves desperately against immense forces of the enemy  what has happened was the question the officers of the naval brigade asked those of the garrison when they first met  oh we have been fearfully licked a series of blunders and mismanagement we have lost all the camp equipage all the storesin fact everything it is the most disgraceful thing which has happened since the trouble began we lost heavily yesterday frightfully today they say the sixtyfourth is cut to pieces  it had indeed been a wretched business and was the only occasion when british troops were in any force defeated throughout the mutiny the affair happened in this way the british force at cawnpore were stationed in an intrenched position so placed as to overawe the city and to command the river and bridge of boats which it was allimportant to keep open the general in command received news that the mutinous gwalior contingent with several other rebel bodies was on its way to cawnpore unfortunately they were approaching on the opposite side of the city to that upon which the british intrenchments were situated and the general therefore determined to leave a portion of his force to protect the intrenchments and bridge while with the rest he started to give battle to the enemy in the open at a distance on the other side of the city as it was very important to prevent cawnpore from again falling into their hands he advanced first to dhubarlee a strong position on the canal where a vigorous defense could have been made as a cross canal covered our flank unfortunately however the next day he again marched forward eight miles and met the advanced guard of the enemy at bhowree the british force consisted of twelve hundred infantry made up of portions of the thirtyfourth eightysecond eightyeighth and rifles with one hundred native cavalry and eight guns the troops advanced with a rush carried the village defeated the enemy and took two guns and then pressing forward found themselves in face of the main body of the enemys army then for the first time it appears to have occurred to the general that it was imprudent to fight so far from the city he therefore ordered a retreat and the british force fell back closely followed by the enemy had he halted again at dhubarlee he might still have retrieved his error but he continued his retreat and halted for the night on the plain of jewar a short distance from the northeast angle of the city  no preparations appear to have been made in case of an attack by the enemy and when in the morning they came on in immense force the british position was seriously threatened on all sides for five hours the troops held their ground nobly and prevented the enemy advancing by a direct attack a large body however moved round to the flank and entered the city thus getting between the british forces and their intrenchments the order was therefore given to retire and this was carried out in such haste that the whole of the camp equipage consisting of five hundred tents quantities of saddlery uniforms for eight regiments and a vast amount of valuable property of all kinds fell into the hands of the mutineers all these stores had been placed in a great camp on the plain outside the fortified intrenchments it was a disastrous affair and cawnpore blazed with great fires lighted by the triumphant mutineers  during the retreat a gun had been capsized and left in one of the lanes of the town and at dead of night one hundred men of the sixtyfourth accompanied by a detachment of sailors went silently out and succeeded in righting the gun and bringing it off from the very heart of the city  the next day the whole force moved out and took up their position to prevent the enemy from approaching the intrenchments the mutineers commanded by nana sahib in person advanced to the attack one british column remained in reserve the column under colonel walpole succeeded in repulsing the body opposed to it and captured two of its eighteenpounder guns the column under general carthew maintained its position throughout the day but fell back toward the eveninga proceeding for which the officer in command was severely censured by the commanderinchief who riding on ahead of his convoy with a small body of troops reached the scene of action just at nightfall  but it was the division under brigadiergeneral wilson colonel of the sixtyfourth that suffered most heavily seeing that general carthew was hardly pressed he led a part of his own regiment against four guns which were playing with great effect ned warreners heart beat high as the order to charge was given for it was the first time he had been in action with his gallant regiment with a cheer the little body who numbered fourteen officers and one hundred and sixty men advanced their way led along a ravine nearly half a mile long and as they moved forward a storm of shot shell and grape from the guns was poured upon them while a heavy musketry fire broke out from the heights on either side fast the men fell but there was no wavering on at the double they went until within fifty yards of the guns and then burst into a charge at full speed  ned accustomed as he was to fire had yet felt bewildered at the iron storm which had swept their ranks all round him men were falling a bullet knocked off his cap and a grapeshot smashed his sword off short in his hand the sepoy artillerymen stood to their guns and fought fiercely as the british rushed upon them ned caught up the musket of a man who fell dead by his side and bayoneted a gunner he saw another man at four paces off level a rifle at him felt a stunning blow and fell but was up in a minute again having been knocked down by a brick hurled by some sepoy from a dwelling close behind the gunsa blow which probably saved his life two of the guns where spiked while the handtohand conflict raged  major stirling fell dead captain murphy and captain macraw died fighting nobly beside him and the gallant colonel wilson received three bullets through his body from all sides masses of the enemy charged down and a regiment of sepoy cavalry swept upon them captain sanders was now in command and gave the word to fall back and even faster than they had approached the survivors of the sixtyfourth retreated literally cutting their way through the crowds of sepoys which surrounded them  ned was scarcely conscious of what he was doing and few could have given a detailed account of the events of that most gallant charge the men kept well together old veterans in fight they knew that only in close ranks could they hope to burst through the enemy and striking and stabbing and always running they at last regained the position they had quitted of the fourteen officers seven were killed and two wounded of the one hundred and sixty men eighteen killed and fifteen wounded a striking testimony to the valor with which the officers had led the way such slaughter as this among the officers is almost without parallel in the records of the british army and lads who went into the fray low down on the list of lieutenants came out captains among them was ned warrener who stood fifth on the list of lieutenants and who by the death vacancies now found himself a captain  it was not until they halted breathless and exhausted that he discovered that he had been twice wounded for in the wild excitement of the fight he had been unconscious of pain a bullet had passed through the fleshy part of his left arm while another had cut a clean gash just across his hip neither was in any way serious and having had them bound up with a handkerchief he remained with his regiment till nightfall put an end to the fighting when he made his way to the hospital this was crowded with badly wounded men and ned seeing the pressure upon the surgeons obtained a couple of bandages and went back to his regiment to have them put on there as he reached his camp dick sprang forward  my dear old boy i was just hunting for you we crossed tonight and directly we were dismissed i rushed off hearing that your regiment has suffered frightfully i hear you are hit but thank god only slightly  very slightly old boy nothing worth talking about it has been an awful business though and how are you and how is father  quite well ned not a scratch either of us  and the hargreaves  mrs hargreaves and the girls are all right ned and will be in to morrow all the rest are gone  gone dear dear i am sorry now dick come to the fire and bandage up my arm and you must congratulate me old boy for by the slaughter today i have my company  hurrah dick exclaimed joyfully that is good news what luck not eighteen yet and a captain  it was only on the 1st of december that the whole of the convoy from lucknow were gathered in tents on the paradeground at cawnpore and all hoped for a short period of rest  on the morning of the 3d however notice was issued that in two hours the women children and civilians of lucknow would proceed to allahabad under escort of five hundred men of the thirtyfourth regiment it would be a long march for the convoy would be incumbered by the enormous train of stores and munitions of war while a large number of vehicles were available for their transport  colonel warrener heard the news early and knowing how interested his sons were in the matter he rode round to their respective camps and told them leaving them to follow he then rode over to the hargreaves tent  they had just heard the news and short as the time was had so few preparations to make that they were ready for a start a dawkgarry or postcarriage was allotted to them which the ayah riding outside would hold them with some comfort these vehicles being specially constructed to allow the occupants when two in number only to lie down at full length it would be a close fit for the three ladies but they thought that they could manage and it was a comfort to know that even if no tents could be erected at night they could lie down in shelter  the young warreners soon arrived and while their father was discussing the arrangements with mrs hargreaves and seeing that a dozen of claret which his orderly had at his orders brought across with a basket of fruit was properly secured on the roof they sauntered off with the girls soon insensibly pairing off  it will be two years at least before i am home in england nelly dick said and i hope to be a lieutenant soon after for i am certain of my step directly i pass since i have been mentioned three times in dispatches i know i am a boy not much over sixteen but i have gone through a lot and am older than my age but even if you laugh at me nelly i must tell you i love you  but nelly was in no laughing mood  my dear dick she said i am not going to laugh i am too sad at parting but you know i am not much over fifteen yet though i too feel olderoh so much older than girls in england who are at school till long past that age you know i like you dick very very much it would be absurd to say more than that to each other now we part just on these terms dick we know we both like each other very much well yes i will say love if you like dick but we cannot tell the least in the world what we shall do five years hence so we wont make any promises or anything else we will be content with what we know and if either of us change there will be no blame and misery do you agree to that dick  dick did agree very joyfully and a few minutes later the pair very silent now strolled back to the tent ned and edith were already there for ned had no idea of speaking out now or of asking edith to enter into an engagement which she might repent when she came to enter society in england and yet although he said nothing or hardly anything the pair understood each others feelings as well as did dick and nelly  all was now ready for the start everything in its place and the ayah on the seat with the driver then came the partinga very sad one mrs hargreaves was much moved and the girls wept unrestrainedly while colonel warrener who had made his adieus and was standing a little back lifted his eyebrows with a comical look of astonishment as he saw the farewell embraces of his sons with edith and nelly  humph he muttered to himself a bad attack of calf love all round well as he looked at the manly figures of his sons and thought of the qualities they had shown i should not be surprised if the boys stick to it but whether those pretty little things will give the matter a thought when they have once come out at home remains to be seen it would not be a bad thing for hargreaves was i know a very wealthy man and there are only these two girls     chapter xxii  the last capture of lucknow   the women and children brought from lucknow once sent off from the british camp the commanderinchief was able to direct his attention to the work before himof clearing out of cawnpore the rebel army composed of the gwalior contingent and the troops of koer sing and nana sahib in all twentyfive thousand men against this large force he could only bring seventyfive hundred men but these well led were ample for the purpose  the position on the night of the 5th of december was as follows the british camp was separated from the city by a canal running east and west the enemy were entirely on the north of this canal their center occupying the town outside the city walls lay the right of the rebel army while his left occupied the space between the walls and the river in the rear of the enemys left was a position known as the subadars tank the british occupied as an advanced post a large bazaar on the city side of the river  the operations of the 6th of december were simple a demonstration was made against the city from the bazaar which occupied the attention of the large force holding the town the main body of the british were quietly massed on its left and crossing three bridges over the canal attacked the enemys right with impetuosity these cut off by the city wall from their comrades within were unable to stand the british onslaught and the thunder of peels guns and fled precipitately pursued by the british for fourteen miles along the calpee road every gun and ammunition wagon of the mutineers on this side fell into the hands of the victors  as the victorious british force swept along past the city sir colin campbell detached a force under general mansfield to attack and occupy the position of the subadars tankwhich was captured after some hard fighting thus the british were in a position in rear of the enemys left the mutineers seeing that their right was utterly defeated and the retreat of their left threatened lost all heart and as soon as darkness came on fled a disorganized rabble from the city they had entered as conquerors only six days before the cavalry started next day in pursuit cut up large numbers and captured the greater part of their guns  the threatening army of gwalior thus beaten and scattered and cawnpore in our hands sir colin campbell was able to devote his whole attention to clearing the country in his rear and in preparing for the great final campaign against lucknow which now that delhi had fallen was the headquarters of the mutiny  the next two months were passed in a series of expeditions by flying columns in some of these the warreners took part and both shared in the defeats of the sepoys and the capture of futtyghur and furruckabadplaces at which horrible massacres of the whites had taken place in the early days of the mutiny during these two months large reinforcements had arrived and jung bahadoor prince of nepaul had come down with an army of ten thousand ghoorkas to our aid  on the 15th of february the tremendous train of artillery ammunition and stores collected for the attack upon the city began to cross the river and upon the 26th of the month the order was given for the army to move upon the following day  the task before it was a difficult one from all the various points from which the british had driven themfrom delhi from rohilcund and the doab from cawnpore furruckabad futtyghur etawah allyghur goruckpore and other placesthey retreated to lucknow and there were now collected sixty thousand revolted sepoys and fifty thousand irregular troops besides the armed rabble of the city of three hundred thousand souls knowing the storm that was preparing to burst upon their heads they had neglected no means for strengthening their position great lines of fortifications had been thrown up enormous quantities of guns placed in position every house barricaded and loopholed and the kaiserbagh transformed into a veritable citadel in hopes of destroying the force under general sir james outram at the alumbaghwhich had been a thorn in their side for so longa series of desperate attacks had been made upon them but these had been uniformly defeated with heavy loss by the gallant british force on the 3d of march the advanced division occupied the dil koosha meeting with but slight resistance and the commanderinchief at once took up his headquarters here the next three days were spent in making the necessary disposition for a simultaneous attack upon all sides of the towngeneral outram on one side sir hope grant upon another jung bahadoor with his nepaulese on the third and the main attack under sir colin campbell himself on the fourth  great was the excitement in the camp on the eve of this tremendous struggle colonel warrener and his sons met on the night before the fighting was to begin  well boys he said after a long talk upon the prospects of the fighting did you do as you talked about and draw your pay and get it changed into gold  most of it ned said we could not get it all and had to pay a tremendous rate of exchange for it  here are the twenty pounds each in gold lads colonel warrener said that i told you i could get for you now what do you want it for you would not tell me at cawnpore  well father at delhi there was lots of loot taken quantities of valuable things and the soldiers were selling what they had got for next to nothing i had some lovely bracelets offered me for a few rupees but no one had any money in their pockets so dick and i determined that if we came into another storming business we would fill our pockets beforehand with money they say that the palaces the kaiserbagh especially are crowded with valuable things and as they will be lawful loot for the troops we shall be able to buy no end of things  colonel warrener laughed  there is nothing like forethought ned and i have no doubt that you will be able to pick up some good things the soldiers attach no value to them and would rather have gold which they can change for spirits than all the precious stones in the world i shall be out of it as of course the cavalry will not go into the city but will wait outside to cut off the enemys retreat  the fighting began with general outrams division which worked round the city and had on the 7th 8th and 9th to repulse heavy attacks of the enemy  on the 9th sir colin campbell advanced took the martinière with but slight opposition crossed the canal and occupied the secunderbaghthe scene of the tremendous fighting on the previous advance the begums palace in front of bank house was then attacked and after very heavy fighting carried here major hodgson the captor of the king of delhi was mortally wounded general outrams force had by this time taken up a position on the other side of the river and this enabled him to take the enemys defenses in flank and so greatly to assist the advancing party  day by day the troops fought their way forward and on the 14th the imaumbarra a splendid palace of the king of oude adjoining the kaiserbagh was breached and carried the panicstricken defenders fled through the court and garden into the kaiserbagh followed hotly by the sikhs ghoorkas and highlanders such was the terror which their appearance excited that a panic seized also the defenders of the kaiserbagh and these too fled deserting the fortifications raised with so much care and the british poured into the palace for a few minutes a sharp conflict took place in every room and then the sepoys being annihilated the victors fell upon the spoil from top to bottom the kaiserbagh was crowded with valuable articles collected from all parts of the world english furniture french clocks and lookingglasses chinese porcelain gorgeous draperies golden thrones studded with jewels costly weapons inlaid with gold enormous quantities of jewelryin fact wealth of all kinds to an almost fabulous value the wildest scene of confusion ensued according to the rule in these matters being taken by storm the place was lawful plunder for large things the soldiers did not care and set to to smash and destroy all that could not be carried away some put on the turbans studded with jewels others hung necklaces of enormous value round their necks or covered their arms with bracelets none knew the value of the costly gems they had become possessed of and few indeed of the officers could discriminate between the jewels of immense value and those which were mere worthless imitations  as soon as the news spread that the kaiserbagh was taken the guns fired a royal salute in honor of the triumph and all officers who could obtain an hours leave from their regiments hurried away to see the royal palace of oude  the warreners were both near the spot when the news came both were able to get away and met at the entrance to the palace already soldiers british and native were passing out laden with spoil  what will you give me for this necklace sir a soldier asked ned  i have no idea what its worth ned said  no more have i said the soldier it may be glass it may be something else you shall have it for a sovereign  very well ned said here is one  so onward they went buying everything in the way of jewels offered them utterly ignorant themselves whether the articles they purchased were real gems or imitation  penetrating into the palace they found all was wild confusion soldiers were smashing chandeliers and lookingglasses breaking up furniture tumbling the contents of chests and wardrobes and caskets over the floors eager to find equally eager to sell what they had found  bitter were the exclamations of disappointment and disgust which the warreners heard from many of the officers that they were unprovided with moneyfor the soldiers would not sell except for cash but for a few rupees they were ready to part with anything strings of pearls worth a thousand pounds were bought for a couple of rupeesfour shillings diamond aigrettes worth twice as much went for a sovereign and the warreners soon laid out the seventy pounds which they had between them when they entered the palace and their pockets and the breasts of their coats were stuffed with their purchases and each had a bundle in his handkerchief  i wonder dick said as they made their way back whether we have been fools or wise men i have not a shadow of an idea whether these things are only the sham jewels which dancing girls wear or whether they are real  it was worth running the risk anyhow for if only half of them are real they are a big fortune anyhow dick lets hold our tongues about it its no use making fellows jealous of our good luck if they turn out to be real or of getting chaffed out of our lives if they prove false let us just stow them away till its all over and then ask father about them  it was calculated that twenty thousand soldiers and campfollowers obtained loot of more or less value from the case of jewelry valued at one hundred thousand pounds that fell into the hands of an officer to clocks candelabra and articles of furniture carried off by the least fortunate the value of the treasure there was estimated at ten millions of money at the lowest computation  the fall of the kaiserbagh utterly demoralized the enemy and from that moment they began to leave the town by night in thousands numbers were cut off and slaughtered by our cavalry and artillery but large bodies succeeded in escaping to give us fresh trouble in the field  day by day the troops fought their way from palace to palace and from street to street day and night the cannon and mortar batteries thundered against the districts of the city still uncaptured and great fires blazed in a dozen quarters until gradually the resistance ceased and lucknow was won  it was not until a week after the storming of the kaiserbaghby which time everything had settled down order was restored and the inhabitants were under the direction of the military authorities engaged in clearing away rubbish leveling barricades and razing to the ground a considerable portion of the citythat colonel warrener and his sons met the troops were now all comfortably under canvas in the cantonments and were enjoying a wellearned rest after their labors  well boys he said have you heard warreners horse is to be broken up the officers have all been appointed to regiments the civilians are anxious to return to look after their own affairs i am to go up to take the command of a newlyraised punjaub regiment dunlop goes with me as major manners has been badly hit and goes home the greater part of the naval brigade march down to calcutta at once the force will be broken up into flying columns for there is much to be done yet the greater portion of these scoundrels have got away and there are still considerably more than one hundred thousand of the enemy scattered in large bodies over the country i am going to delhi through agra with dunlop i accompany a detachment of fifty irregular punjaub horse who are ordered down to agra then i shall go up to meerut and have a week with the girls and do you know i have seen captain peel and your colonel ned and have got leave for you both for a month then you will go down to calcutta dick and join your ship ned will of course rejoin his regiment  the lads were delighted at the prospect of again seeing their sister and cousin and dick indulged in a wild dance expressive of joy  well boys and how about loot did you lay out your money  we laid it out father but we have not the least idea whether we have bought rubbish or not this black bag is full of it  so saying ned emptied a large handbag upon the top of a barrel which served as a table colonel warrener gave a cry of astonishment as a great stream of bracelets necklaces tiaras aigrettes and other ornaments poured out of the bag  good gracious boys do you mean to say all these are yours  ours and yours father there were forty pounds of your money and thirtyfive of ours do you think they are real  colonel warrener took one or two articles from the flashing heap of diamonds emeralds rubies opals and pearls  i should say so he said some of them are certainly but have you any idea what these are worth  not the least in the world ned said if they are real though i suppose they are worth some thousands of pounds  my boys i should say colonel warrener replied turning over the heap they must be worth a hundred thousand if they are worth a penny  the boys looked at each other in astonishment  really father  really my boys  hurrah dick said then you can give up the service when this war is over father and go home and live as a rich man that will be glorious  my dear boys the prize is yours  nonsense father exclaimed the boys together and then began an amicable contest which was not finally concluded for many a long day  but what had we better do with all these things father dick said at last  we will get a small chest and put them in boys i will give it to the paymasterhe is sending a lot of treasure down under a strong escortand will ask him to let it go down with the convoy i will direct it to a firm at calcutta and will ask them to forward it to my agent at home to whom i will give directions to send it to a firstclass jeweler in london to be by him opened and valued i will tell the calcutta firm to insure it on the voyage as treasure at twenty thousand pounds even if some of them turn out to be false you may congratulate each other that you are provided for for life  and when do we set out father ned asked after they had talked for some time longer about their treasure  in three days time we shall accompany a flying column for the first two days march and then strike across for agra  the next two days the warreners spent in investigating the town in wandering through the deserted palaces and admiring their vast extent and in saying goodby to their friends a great portion of the teeming population of lucknow had fled and the whole city outside the original town was to be cleared away and laid out in gardens so that henceforth lucknow would be little more than a fifth of its former size the ruined residency was to be cleared of its débris replanted with trees and to be left as a memorial of british valor the entire district through which havelocks men had fought their way was to be cleared of its streets and the palaces only were to be left standing to be utilized for public purposes the whole of the remaining male population of lucknow was set to work to carry out these alterations the scene was busy and amusing and the change from the fierce fight the din of cannon and the perpetual rattle of musketry to the order regularity and bustle of work was very striking here was a party of sappers and miners demolishing a row of houses there thousands of natives filling baskets with rubbish and carrying them on their heads to empty into bullock carts whence it was taken to fill up holes and level irregularities among the crowd soldiers of many uniformsbritish infantry rifles highlanders artillery and cavalry sinewy sikhs and quiet little nepaulesewandered at will or worked in fatigue parties  the three days past colonel warrener his sons and major dunlop took their places on horseback with the troop of irregular cavalry commanded by lieutenant latham and joined the flying column which was setting out to attack a large body of the enemy who were reported to be gathering again near furruckabad while simultaneously other columns were leaving in other directions for broken at lucknow the rebels were swarming throughout all oude the day was breaking but the sun was not yet up when the column startedfor in india it is the universal custom to start very early so as to get the greater part of the march over before the heat of the day fairly beginsand the young warreners were in the highest spirits at the thought that they were on their way to see their sister and cousin and that their nine months of marching and fighting were drawing to a close for it is possible to have too much even of adventure at ten oclock a halt was called at the edge of a large wood and after preparing breakfast there was a rest in the shade until four in the afternoon after which a two hours march took them to their haltingplace for the night tents were pitched fires lighted and then dinner over they made merry groups who sat smoking and chatting until nine oclock when the noise ceased the fires burned down and all was quiet until the réveillé sounded at four oclock after which there was an hour of busy work getting down rolling up and packing the tents and baggage in the wagons  another days march and halt and then colonel warrener and his friends said goodby to their acquaintances in the column and started with the troop of cavalry for agra unincumbered by baggage and no longer obliged to conform their pace to that of the infantry they trotted gayly along and accomplished forty miles ere they halted for the night near a village the country through which they had passed had an almost deserted appearance here and there a laborer was at work in the fields but the confusion and alarm created by the bodies of mutineers who had swept over the country and who always helped themselves to whatever pleased them had created such a scare that the villagers for the most part had forsaken their abodes and driven their animals with all their belongings to the edge of jungles or other unfrequented places there to await the termination of the struggle  at the end of the days journey they halted in front of a great mosque like building with a dome the tomb of some long dead prince the doors stood open and colonel warrener proposed that they should take up their quarters for the night in the lofty interior instead of sleeping in the night air for although the temperature was still high the night dews were the reverse of pleasant it was evident by the appearance of the interior that it had been used as the headquarters and storehouse of some body of the enemy for a considerable quantity of stores military saddles harness coils of rope and barrels of flour were piled against the wall a space was soon swept and a fire lighted on the floor outside the troopers dismounted some proceeded to a wood at a short distance off to fetch fuel others took the horses to a tank or pond to drink it was already getting dusk and inside the great domed chamber it was nearly dark  the fire looks cheerful colonel warrener said as after seeing that the men had properly picketed their horses and had made all their arrangements the little group of officers returned to it a trooper had already prepared their meal which consisted of kabobs or pieces of muttonfrom a couple of sheep which they had purchased at a village where they halted in the morninga large bowl of boiled rice and some chupatties or griddle cakes a pannikin of tea was placed by each and spreading their cloaks on the ground they set to with the appetite of travelers dinner over a bottle of brandy was produced from one of major dunlops holsters the pannikin was washed out and a supply of fresh water brought in pipes and cheroots were lighted and they prepared for a cheerful evening  i am very sorry manners is not here dick said it would have been so jolly to be all together again however it is a satisfaction to know that his wound is doing well and that he is likely to be all right in a few months  yes colonel warrener said but i believe that he will have to leave the service his right leg will always be shorter than the left  i dont suppose he will mind that ned said i should think he must have had enough of india to last for his life  mr latham dick said presently to the officer in command of the cavalry will you tell us your adventures we know all about each others doings  so they sat and talked until ten oclock when mr latham went round to see that the sentries were properly placed and alert when he returned the door was shut to keep out the damp air and the whole party rolling themselves in their cloaks and using their saddles for pillows laid up for the night dick was some time before he slept his imagination was active and when he at last dozed off he was thinking what they had best do were they attacked by the enemy  it was still dark when with a sudden start the sleeping party in the tomb awoke and leaped to their feet for a moment they stood bewildered for outside was heard on all sides the crack of volleys of musketry wild yells and shouts and the trampling of a large body of cavalry  surprised exclaimed the colonel the sentries must have been asleep  there was a rush to the door and the sight that met their eyes showed them the extent of the disaster the moon was shining brightly and by her light they could see that a large body of rebel cavalry had fallen upon the sleeping troopers while the heavy musketry fire showed that a strong body of infantry were at work on the other side of the mosque lieutenant latham rushed down the steps with his sword drawn but fell back dead shot through the heart  back back shouted colonel warrener let us sell our lives here     chapter xxiii  a desperate defense   in an instant the door was closed and bolted and the four set to work to pile barrels and boxes against it not a word was spoken while this was going on by the time they had finished the uproar without had changed its character the firing had ceased and the triumphant shouts of the mutineers showed that their victory was complete then came a loud thundering noise at the door  we have only delayed it a few minutes colonel warrener said we have fought our fight boys and our time has come would to god that i had to die alone  look father dick said there is a small door there i noticed it last night no doubt there is a staircase leading to the terrace above at any rate we may make a good fight there  yes major dunlop said we may fight it out to the last on the stairs run dick and see  dick found as he supposed that from the door a narrow winding staircase led to the terrace above from which the dome rose far into the air the stairs were lit by an occasional narrow window he was thinking as he ran upstairs of the ideas that had crossed his brain the night before  it is all right he said as he came down again look father if we take up barrels and boxes we can make barricades on the stairs and defend them for any time almost  excellent the colonel said to work they will be a quarter of an hour breaking in the door make the top barricade first a few feet below the terrace  each seized a box or barrel and hurried up the stairs they had a longer time for preparation than they expected for the mutineers feeling sure of their prey were in no hurry and finding how strong was the door decided to sit down and wait until their guns would be up to blow it in thus the defenders of the tomb had an hours grace and in that time had constructed three solid barricades each was placed a short distance above an opening for light so that while they themselves were in darkness their assailants would be in the light they left a sufficient space at the top of each barricade for them to scramble over leaving some spare barrels on the stairs above it to fill up the space after taking their position  now for the remains of our supper father dick said and that big water jug i will carry them up ned do you bring up that long coil of thin rope  what for dick  it may be useful ned ropes are always useful ah their guns are up  as he spoke a round shot crashed through the door and sent splinters of casks and a cloud of flour flying  now ned come along dick said and followed by colonel warrener and major dunlop they entered the little doorway and ran up the narrow stairs  at the first barricade which was some thirty steps up the officers stopped and proceeded to fill up the passage hitherto left open while the boys continued their way to the terrace  let us have a look round ned those fellows will be some minutes before they are in yet and that barricade will puzzle them  day was breaking now and the lads peered over the parapet which ran round the terrace  there are a tremendous lot of those fellows dick four or five thousand of them at least and they have got six guns  hurrah ned dick said looking round at the great dome this is just what i hoped  he pointed to a flight of narrow steps only some twelve inches across fixed to the side of the dome which rose for some distance almost perpendicularly by the side of the steps was a low handrail they were evidently placed there permanently to enable workmen to ascend to the top of the dome to regild the long spike which surmounted by a crescent rose from its summit or to do any repairs that were needful  there ned i noticed these steps on some of the domes at lucknow when the worst comes to the worst and we are beaten from the stairs we can climb up that ladderfor its more like a ladder than stairsand once on the top could laugh at the whole army of them now ned let us go down to them by that cheering below the artillery has broken the door open  the mutineers burst through the broken door into the great hall with triumphant yells heralding their entrance by a storm of musketry fire for they knew how desperately even a few englishmen will sell their lives there was a shout of disappointment at finding the interior untenanted but a moments glance round discovered the door and there was a rush toward it each longing to be the first to the slaughter the light in the interior was but faint and the stairs were pitch dark and were only wide enough for one man to go up with comfort although two could just stand side by side without an obstacle the leaders of the party stumbled and groped their way up the stairs until the first came into the light of a long narrow loophole in the wall then from the darkness above came the sharp crack of a revolver and the man fell on his face shot through the heart another crack and the next shared his fate then there was a pause for the spiral was so sharp that not more than two at a time were within sight of the defenders of the barricade  the next man hesitated at seeing his immediate leaders fall but pressed from behind he advanced with his musket at his shoulder in readiness to fire when he saw his foes but the instant his head appeared round the corner a ball struck him and he too fell still the press from behind pushed the leaders forward and it was not until six had fallen and the narrow stairs were impassable from the dead bodies that an officer of rank who came the next on the line succeeded by shouting in checking the advance then orders were passed down for those crowding the doorway to fall back and the officer with the men on the stairs descended and the former reported to the leader that six men had fallen and that the stairs were choked with their bodies after much consultation orders were given the men to go up and keeping below the spot at which one after another their comrades had fallen to stretch out their arms and pull down the bodies this was done and then an angry consultation again took place it was clear that moving fast only one could mount the stairs at a time and it seemed equally certain that this one would on reaching a certain spot be shot by his invisible foes large rewards and great honor were promised by the chief to those who would undertake to lead the assault and at last volunteers were found and another rush attempted  it failed as had the first each man as he passed the loophole fell and again the dead choked the stairs one or two had not fallen at the first shot and had got a few steps higher but only to fall back dead upon their comrades again the assault ceased and for two or three hours there was a pause the officers of the mutineers deliberated and quarreled the men setto to prepare their meal that over one of the troopers went in to the officers and proposed a plan which was at once approved of and a handsome reward immediately paid him before enlisting he had been a carpenter and as there were many others of the same trade no time was lost in carrying out the suggestion several of the thick planks composing the door remained uninjured these were cut and nailed together so as to make a shield of exactly the same width as the staircase and six feet high on one side several straps and loops were nailed to give a good hold to those carrying it and then with a cheer the sepoys again prepared for an attack the shield was heavy but steadily and with much labor it was carried up the stairs step by step by two men others pressing on behind  when they reached the loophole the pistol shots from above again rang out but the door was of heavy seasoned wood three inches thick and the bullets failed to penetrate then the shield ascended step by step until it reached the barrier there it stopped for the strength that could be brought to bear upon it was altogether insufficient to move in the slightest the solid pile and after some time spent in vain efforts the shield was taken back again as gradually and carefully as it had been advanced until out of the range of the pistols of the defenders  what will be the next move i wonder colonel warrener said as the little party sat down on the stairs and waited for a renewal of the attack  i dont like that shield major dunlop remarked it shows that there is some more than usually intelligent scoundrel among them and he will be up to some new trick  an hour passed and then there was a noise on the stairs and the shield was again seen approaching as before it advanced to the barrier and stopped there was then a sort of grating noise against it and the door shook as this continued  what on earth are they up to now major dunlop exclaimed  piling fagots against it dick said or i am mistaken i have been afraid of fire all along if they had only lit a pile of damp wood at the bottom of the stairs they could have smoked us out at the top and then as the smoke cleared below they could have gone up and removed the barricade before the upper stairs were free enough from smoke for us to come down there i thought so make haste and dick dashed up the stairs followed by his friends as a curl of smoke ascended and a loud cheer burst from the sepoys below  quickly as they ran upstairs the smoke ascended still more rapidly and they emerged upon the terrace halfsuffocated and blinded  so ends barricade number one major dunlop said when they had recovered from their fit of coughing i suppose it will be pretty nearly an hour before the fire is burned out  the door would not burn through in that time said major warrener but they will be able to stand pretty close and the moment the fagots are burned out they will drag the screen out of the way and with long poles with hooks or something of that sort haul down the barricade directly the smoke clears off enough for us to breathe we will go down to our middle barricade they may take that the same way they took the first but they cannot take the last so  why not father ned asked  because its only ten steps from the top ned so that however great a smoke they make we can be there again the instant they begin to pull it down  it was now past midday and the party partook sparingly of their small store of food and water the smoke continued for some time to pour out of the door of the stairs in dense volumes then became lighter several times the lads tried to descend a few steps but found that breathing was impossible for the smoke from the green wood was insupportable at last it became clear enough to breathe and then the party ran rapidly down to their second barricade that at least was intact but below they could hear the fall of heavy bodies and knew that the lower barricade was destroyed  i dont suppose that screen of theirs was burned through father so very likely they will try the same dodge again of course they dont know whether we have another barricade or where we are so they will come on cautiously it seems to me than if you and dunlop were to take your place a bit lower than this stooping down on the stairs and then when they come were boldly to throw yourselves with all your weight suddenly against the shield you would send it and its bearers headlong downstairs and could then follow them and cut them up tremendously  capital dick that would be just the thing dont you think so dunlop if they havent got the shield we can shoot them down so either way we may as well make a sortie  i think so major dunlop said here goes then  halfway down they heard the trampling of steps again the sepoys had extinguished the fires with buckets of water had put straps to the door again and were pursuing their former tactics the two officers sat down and awaited the coming of their foes slowly the latter ascended until the door was within two steps of the englishmen then the latter simultaneously flung all their weight against it  wholly unprepared for the assault the bearers were hurled backward with the heavy shield upon them knocking down those behind them who in turn fell on those below sword in hand colonel warrener sprang upon the hindmost of the falling mass while pressing just behind him and firing over his shoulder major dunlop followed  shrieks of dismay rose from the sepoys who crowded the stairs as the bodies of those above were hurled upon them flight or defense was equally impossible turning to descend they leaped upon their comrades below a frightful scene ensuedsuch a scene as has sometimes been seen on the stairs of a theater on fire what was the danger above none thought a wild panic seized all over each other they rolled choking the stairs and obstructing all movement until the last twenty feet of the stairs were packed closely with a solid mass of human beings lying thickly on each other and stifling each other to death on reaching this mass colonel warrener and his friend paused there was nothing more to be done over fifty human beings lay crushed together those on the top of the heap were shot and then the officers retraced their steps many lay on the stairs but major dunlop had passed his sword through their bodies as he passed them four muskets were picked up and all the ammunition from the pouches and then with the boys who had followed closely behind them they again ascended to the terrace and sat down  we are safe now for some time colonel warrener said it will take them a long time to clear away that heap of dead and they wont try the shield dodge again  it was indeed late in the afternoon before the sepoys made any fresh move against the defenders of the stairs the time however had not passed idly with the latter one of them keeping watch at the barrier the others had maintained a steady musketry fire through the open work of the parapet upon the enemy below the sepoys had answered with a scattering fire but as the defenders were invisible behind the parapet and could move from one point to another unobserved there was but little fear of their being hit while their steady fire did so much execution among the throng of sepoys that these had to move their camping ground a couple of hundred yards back from the tomb  it was nearly dark when several men bearing large bundles of straw and bamboos ran across the open ground and entered the mosque and the besieged guessed that another attempt was to be made to smoke them out there had been much consultation on the part of the enraged mutineers and this time two men with their muskets leveled at their shoulders led the advance very slowly they made their way up until a pistol shot rang out and one of the leaders discharging his musket before him fell then there was a halt another sepoy with fixed bayonet took the place in front and over the shoulders of him and his comrade those behind threw bundles of straw mixed with wet leaves a light was applied to this and with a sheet of flame between themselves and the besieged they had no fear now they pressed forward threw on fresh straw and then knowing that the besieged would have fled higher reached through the flames with a pole with a hook attached to it and hauled down the barricade the moment the fire burned a little low two men lighted fresh bundles and stamping out the fire advanced up the stairs carrying before them the blazing bundles like torches the volumes of smoke from these of course preceding them  the party on the terrace had noticed the smoke dying down and had prepared to descend again when a fresh addition to the smoke convinced them that the enemy were still piling on bundles and that there was nothing to fear so they sat quietly chatting until ned who was sitting next to the door exclaimed  listen they are pulling down our top barricade  sword in hand he rushed down the others closely following him just as he turned the spiral which would bring him in sight of the upper barricade a musket was fired and ned would have fallen forward had not major dunlop seized him by the collar and pulled him backward  hold the stairs colonel he said they are at the barricade but are not through yet i will carry ned up hes hit in the shoulder  major dunlop carried ned to the platform and laying him down for he had lost consciousness rushed back to assist to hold the stairs for the crack of colonel warreners and dicks revolvers could be heard the advantage however was so great with them standing above the others and so placed as to be able to fire the instant that their foes came round the corner that the sepoys after losing several of their number ceased their attack  the defenders hurried up to ned confident that the enemy would not renew the assault again for the moment as they could not tell whether there was yet another barrier to be stormed dick stood sentry at the door and the colonel and major dunlop examined neds wound it was a serious one the ball had entered the chest below the collarbone had it been fired from a level it would have been fatal but the sepoy having stood so much below it had gone out near the neck smashing the collarbone on its way ned had become unconscious from the shock to the system  we must take to the dome at once colonel warrener said the next assault those fellows will gain the terrace i will carry ned up  no colonel i will take him major dunlop said i can carry him over my shoulders as easily as possible  well dunlop you are the younger man so i will hand him over to you i will put this coil of rope round my neck and will take the water and food it is so dark now that they will not see us from below if those fellows had but waited half an hour we could have gained the top without this sad business will you go first dunlop  major dunlop who was a very powerful and active man lifted ned on his shoulders and began to ascend the narrow steps to the dome it was hard work at first but as he got on the ascent became less steep and the last part was comparatively easy colonel warrener mounted next also heavily laden dick remained on guard at the door until he saw his father pass the shoulder of the dome out of sight from those on the terrace he then slung two muskets and cartridge pouches on his shoulders briskly climbed the steps and was soon by his father  in three minutes the party were gathered round the central spike of the dome suddenly a loud cheer was heard from below  they are out on the terrace dick said i will go down a bit to guard the steps you will be more use with ned than i should  the shouts on the terrace were answered by a great cheer of exultation from the sepoy host around who had been chafed almost to madness at the immense loss which was being caused by three or four men for they knew not the exact strength of the party the shouts of exultation however were silenced when rushing round the terrace the sepoys found that their foes had again evaded them there was no other door no hidingplace nowhere in fact that the besieged could have concealed themselves but the ladderlike steps soon met the eye of the searchers a yell of anger and disappointment arose not even the bravest among them thought for a moment of climbing the stairs for it would indeed have been clearly impossible for men forced to climb in single file to win their way against wellarmed defenders who would simply shoot them down from above as fast as a head appeared over the shoulder of the dome  the position was indeed practically impregnable against assault although exposed to artillery fire and to distant musketry it was for this reason that the defenders of the stairs had not taken to it at once they felt confident in their ability to defend the stair all day and to inflict heavy loss upon the enemy whereas by climbing up the dome in daylight they would have been a target to all those below while climbing and would have been exposed all day to a distant fire that they would have to support it for two or three days was nearly certain but clearly the less time the better  the enemy consoling themselves with the thought that on the morrow their cannon would finish the contest which had thus far cost them so dearly placed a guard of fifty men on the terrace at the foot of the steps lighted a large fire there in order that they could see any one attempting to descend long before he reached the level and then retired below  by this time ned had recovered consciousness and having taken a drink of water was able to understand what had happened his father had cut his uniform off his shoulder and arm and having also cut off one of his own shirt sleeves had soaked it in water and applied it as a bandage on the wound  i am very glad we had agreed that only dick should go ned said otherwise i should have blamed myself for keeping you here  no we could not have gone in any case colonel warrener said as there would have been no one to have lowered the rope here besides which it is only a sailor or a practiced gymnast who can let himself down a rope some eighty feet  when will dick try  as soon as the camp gets quiet the moon will be up by twelve oclock and he must be off before that are you in much pain old boy  not much father i feel numbed and stupid  now dunlop colonel warrener said will you relieve dick on guard at the steps you may as well say goodby to him it is about eight oclock now and in a couple of hours he will be off after he has gone i will relieve you then a four hours watch each will take us to daylight there wont be much sleeping after that  by ten oclock the noise in the rebel camp had nearly ceased groups still sat and talked round the campfires but the circle was pretty large round the tomb for the sepoys had fallen back when the musketry fire was opened upon them from the parapet and had not troubled to move again afterward  now dick said it is time for me to be off i have got a good seventy miles to ride to lucknow it is no use my thinking of going after the column for they would be some fifty miles away from the place where we left them by to morrow night if i can get a good horse i may be at lucknow by midday tomorrow the horses have all had a rest today sir colin will i am sure send off at once and the troops will march well to effect a rescue they will make thirtyfive miles before they halt for the night and will be here by the following night  we must not be too sanguine dick it is just possible dear boy that if all goes well you may be back as you say in fortyeight hours but we will make up our minds to twice that time if you get here sooner all the better but i dont expect that they will hit us and after tiring a bit the chances are they will not care to waste ammunition and will try to starve us out     chapter xxiv  best after labor   with a tender farewell of his father and brother the midshipman prepared for his expedition one end of the rope had been fastened round the large mast which rose from the dome holding the coil over his shoulder dick made his way down the dome on the side opposite that at which they had ascended until it became too steep to walk then he lay down on his back and paying the rope out gradually let himself slip down the lower part of the descent was almost perpendicular and dick soon stood safely on the terrace it was as he expected confidently that it would be quite deserted on this side then he let go of the rope and major warrener who was watching it saw that the strain was off it pulled it up a foot to make sure and then untied the knot dick pulled it gently at first coiling it up as it came down until at last it slid rapidly down he caught it as well as he could but he had little fear of so slight a noise being heard on the other side of the great dome then he tied the rope to the parapet lowered it carefully down and then when it was all out swung himself out over the parapet and slid down the rope the height was over eighty feet but the descent was a mere nothing for dick accustomed to lark about in the rigging of a manowar  he stood perfectly quiet for a minute or two after his feet touched the ground but outside everything was still through the opencarved stonework of a window he could hear voices inside the tomb and had no doubt that the leaders of the enemys force were there  from the parapet in the afternoon he had gained an accurate idea of the position of the cavalry and toward this he at once made his way he took off his boots and walked lightly until he approached the enemys bivouac then he went cautiously the ground was covered with sleeping figures all wrapped like mummies in their clothes and although the night was dusk it was easy in the starlight to see the white figures even had one been awake dick had little fear as except near a fire his figure would have been indistinguishable there was no difficulty when he neared the spot in finding the horses as the sound of their pawing the ground eating and the occasional short neigh of two quarreling was clearly distinguishable  their position once clear dick moved round them he had noticed that four officers horses were picketed further away beyond the general mass of the mens and these could therefore be more easily removed and would moreover be more likely to be fast and sound they had too the advantage of being placed close to the road by which the english force had marched on the day before  dick was some time in finding the horses he was on the lookout for but at last he heard a snorting at a short distance off and on reaching the spot found the horses he was in search of they were all saddled but none had bridles it would be dick knew useless to look for them and he felt sure that the halter would be sufficient for welltrained horses  before proceeding to work he reconnoitered the ground around he found the way to the road which was but twenty yards distant and discovered also that the syces or grooms were asleep close by the horses a little further off were a party of sleeping troopers dick now cut off the heel ropes by which two of the horses were picketed and then leading them by the halters moved quietly toward the road to get upon this however there was a ditch first to be passed and in crossing it one of the horses stumbled  what is that exclaimed one of the syces sitting up halloo he continued leaping up two of the horses have got loose  the others leaped to their feet and ran in the direction whence came the noise which had awakened them thinking that the horses had drawn their picket pegs  by this time dick was in the saddle and giving a kick with his heels to the horse he was on and striking the other with the halter which he held in his hand dashed off into a gallop  a shout burst from the syces and several of the troopers springing to their feet and seizing their arms ran up to know what was the matter  some thief has stolen the colonels horse exclaimed one of the syces  the troopers did not like to fire as it would have alarmed the camp besides which a random fire in the darkness would be of no avail so grumbling that the syces would have to answer for it in the morning they went off to sleep again while the men in charge of the two horses which had been taken after some consultation decided that it would be unsafe to remain to meet the anger of the officers in the morning and so stole off in the darkness and made for their native villages  dick hearing that he was not pursued pulled up in a half a mile and gave a loud shrill cooey the australian call he knew that this would be heard by his father sitting listening at the top of the dome and that he would learn that so far he had succeeded then he set the horses off again in a hand gallop and rode steadily down the road every hour or so he changed from horse to horse thus giving them a comparative rest by turns occasionally he allowed them to walk for a bit to get their wind and then again rode on at a gallop it was about eleven oclock when he started on his ride by four in the morning he was at the spot where the party had separated from the column having thus made forty miles after that he went more slowly but it was a little past nine when with his two exhausted horses he rode into the camp at lucknow where his appearance created quite an excitement  dicks story was briefly told and the two horses which were both splendid animals were taken off to be fed and rubbed down while dick accompanied by the colonel of the cavalry regiment where he had halted went at once to the camp of the commanderinchief  sir colin listened to dicks story in silence  this will be the band he said that colonel lawsons column went to attack they must have altered their course something must be done at once there shall be no delay my lad a force shall be ready to start in an hour i suppose you will want to go with them i advise you to go back to colonel harpers tent get into a bath and get a couple of natives to shampoo you that will take away all your stiffness by the time thats over and you have had some breakfast the troops will be in readiness  dick left sir colin but delighted at the readiness and promptness of the fine old soldier while sir colin called his military secretary and at once arranged for the dispatch of a body of troops  there must be no delay the commanderinchief said if possibleand it is possiblethese scoundrels must be attacked at daylight tomorrow morning they will see the rope the lad escaped by but they will not dream of an attack so early and may be caught napping besides it is all important to rescue those officers whom they will have been making a target of all day especially as one is badly wounded and will be in the full blaze of the sun see that a wagon and an ambulance accompany the column send a regiment of punjaub horse three field guns and three hundred infantry in light marching order let gharries be got together at once to take the infantry forty miles then they will start fresh for a thirtymile march the cavalry and guns can go on at once let them march halfway then unsaddle and rest if they are off by halfpast ten they can get to their haltingplace by five then if they have five hours rest they will catch the infantry up before daybreak and attack just as it gets light those light punjaub horse can do it now which regiments shall we send  a quarter of an hour later bugles were blowing and by ten oclock three hundred british infantry were packed in light carts and the cavalry and guns were drawn up in readiness dick took his place in the ambulance carriage as although greatly refreshed he had had plenty of riding for a time and in the ambulance he could lie down and get through the journey without fatigue sir colin himself rode up just as they were starting and shook hands with dick and expressed his warm hope that he would find his friends safe at the end of the journey and then the cavalry started  dick has always asserted that never in his life did he make such a short journey as that worn out by the excitement and fatigue of the preceding thirty hours he fell fast asleep in the ambulance before he had gone a mile and did not awake until the surgeon shook him by the shoulder  halloo he cried leaping up where are we  we are as far as we can tell about half a mile from the tomb i would not wake you when we halted warrener i thought you wanted sleep more than food we have been halting half an hour here and the cavalry have just come up it is about an hour before daybreak the colonel wants you to act as guide  all right dick said leaping out just to think that i have been asleep for eighteen hours  a hasty council was held and it was determined that as the country was somewhat wooded beyond the tomb but perfectly open on that side the cavalry and artillery should remain where they were that the infantry should make a détour and attack at daybreak from the other side and that as the enemy fell back the artillery and cavalry should deal with them  not a moment was lost the infantry who were sitting down after their long tramp got cheerily on to their feet again for they knew that they were going to attack the enemy and dick led them off the road by a considerable détour to come upon the enemy from the other side by the moonlight the tomb was visible and served as a center round which to march but they were too far off to enable dick to see whether any damage had been done to the dome  day was just breaking when the infantry gained the desired position then throwing out two hundred men in skirmishing order while the other one hundred were kept in hand as a reserve the advance began it was not until they were within three hundred yards of the enemy that they were perceived by the sentries the challenge was answered by a musket shot and as the rebels sprang to their feet a heavy fire was poured in upon them in an instant all was wild confusion taken completely by surprise and entirely ignorant of the strength of the enemy the natives after a wild fire in the direction of the advancing foe fled precipitately their officers tried to rally them and as the smallness of the force attacking them became visible the sepoys with their old habit of discipline began to draw together but at this moment the guns loaded with grape poured into their rear and with a cheer the punjaub cavalry burst into their midst  thenceforth there was no longer any idea of fighting it was simply a rout any a pursuit the rebels own guns fell at once into the hands of the infantry and were quickly turned upon the masses of fugitives who mown down by the fire of the nine guns and cut up by the cavalry who charged hither and thither among them while volleys of musketry swept through them threw away their arms and fled wildly over a thousand of them were left dead on the plain and had not the horses of the cavalry been too exhausted to continue the pursuit a far greater number would have fallen  dick took no part in their fighting a company fifty strong with an officer had been told off to attack and carry the tomb under his guidance disregarding all else this party with leveled bayonets had burst through the throng and made straight for the door of the tomb many of the enemys troops had run in there and for a minute or two there was a fierce fight in the great hall then when the last foe had fallen dick led the men to the stairs up which many of the enemy had fled  quick he shouted follow them close up  some of them were but a few steps ahead and dick closely followed by his men burst on to the terrace at their very heels it was well that he did so for the guard upon the terrace seeing that all was lost below were preparing to sell their lives dearly and to make a long resistance at the top of the stairs dick and his men however rushed so closely upon the heels of their own comrades from below that they were taken completely by surprise some turned at once to fly others made an effort to oppose their enemy but it was useless two or three of the sepoy leaders calling to their men to follow them made a rush at the british and dick found himself engaged in a handtohand contest with aboo raab the rebel leader he was a powerful and desperate man and with a swinging blow he beat down dicks guard and inflicted a severe wound on his head but dick leaped forward and ran him through the body just as the bayonet of one of the british soldiers pierced him in the side  for a minute or two the fight was fierce but every moment added to the avenging force and with a cheer the soldiers rushed at them with the bayonet in five minutes all was over many of the sepoys leaped over the parapet and were dashed to pieces preferring that death to the bayonet while on the terrace no single sepoy at the end of that time remained alive  when all was over dick gave a shout which was answered from above  are you all right dunlop  yes thank god but ned is delirious send some water up at once  dick was too much shaken by the severe cut he had received in the head to attempt to climb the ladder but the officer in command of the company at once offered to ascend several of the men had a little water left in their waterbottles and from them one was filled and slung over the officers neck  i have some brandy in my flask he said and started up the steps  in a few minutes he descended again  your brother is wildly delirious he said they have bound his injured arm to his side with a sash but they cannot leave him how is he to be got down  there is plenty of rope and sacking down below dick said after a moments thought i think that they had better wrap him up in sacking so that he cannot move his arms tie a rope round him and lower him down close by the side of the steps my father coming down side by side with him so as to speak to him and tranquillize him  a soldier was sent below for the articles required and with them the officer accompanied by a sergeant to assist him in lowering ned from above again mounted in a few minutes dicks plan was carried out and ned was lowered safely to the terrace then four soldiers carried him below and he was soon laid on a bed of sacks in the great hall under the care of the surgeon with coldwater bandages round his head  then dick had time to ask his father how the preceding day had passed  first tell me dick by what miracle you got back so soon tomorrow morning was the very earliest time i thought that relief was possible  dick told his story briefly and then colonel warrener related what had happened to them on the dome during the day  as soon as day broke dick they opened a heavy musketry fire at us but they were obliged to go so far off to get a fair view of us that the smoothbore would hardly carry up and even had we been hit i question if the balls would have penetrated though they might have given a sharp knock half an hour later the artillery fire began we agreed that dunlop and i should by turns lie so as to command the stairs while the other kept with ned on the other side of the dome the enemy divided their guns and put them on each side also lying down we presented the smallest possible mark for them but for some hours it was very hot nine out of ten of their shot just went over the dome altogether the spike was hit twenty or thirty times and lower down a good many holes were knocked in the dome but the shots that struck near us all glanced and flew over they fired a couple of hundred shot altogether and at midday they stoppedfor dinner i supposeand did not begin again i suspect they were running short of ammunition once when the firing was hottest thinking i suppose to catch us napping an attempt was made to climb the ladder but dunlop who was on watch put a bullet through the first fellows head and by the yell that followed i suspect that in his fall he swept all the others off the ladder anyhow there was no repetition of the trial the heat was fearful and dunlop and i suffered a good deal from thirst for there was not much water left in the bottle and we wanted that to pour down neds throat from time to time and to sop his bandages with ned got delirious about eleven oclock and we had great trouble in holding him down the last drop of water was finished in the night and we should have had a terrible day of it if you had not arrived and now let us hear what the surgeon says about poor ned  the doctors report was not consoling the wound was a very severe one the collarbone had been smashed in fragments but the high state of fever was even a more serious matter than the wound  what will you do father  i must carry out my orders dick dunlop and i must go on to agra and then on to join our regiment ned will of course be taken back to lucknow and you must give up your trip and stay and nurse him of course if he gets over it poor boy he will be invalided home and you can travel with him down to calcutta i shall send the girls home by the first opportunity india will be no place for ladies for some time we shall have months of marching and fighting before we finally stamp out the mutiny there will be sure to be convoys of sick and wounded going down and a number of ladies at meerut who will be leaving at the first opportunity it is very sad old boy leaving you and ned at such a time but i must do my duty whatever happens the british force encamped for that day and the next around the tomb which had been the scene of so much fierce fighting for the animals were so much exhausted by their tremendous march that it was thought better to give them rest ned continued delirious but he was more quiet now as his strength diminished fortunately the ambulance was well supplied and cooling drinks were given to him and all was done that care and attention could suggest there were three other wounded in addition to dick all men who had taken part in the fight on the terrace none had been killed elsewhere no casualty had happened in the force  early on the third morning the column was again in motion the forty miles to the crossroads were done in two days and here colonel warrener and major dunlop parted from dick going on with a small escort of cavalry to agra  it was a sad parting and it is doing no injustice to dicks manhood to say that he shed many tears but his father promised that if the lucknow jewels turned out to be real he would leave the service and come back to england at the end of the war  the gharries were all in waiting at the crossroad and another day brought them to lucknow where the news of the defeat and dispersion of the rebel force had already been sent on by a mounted orderly  for a week ned lay between life and death then the fever left him and the most critical point of his illness was reached it was for days a question whether he had strength left to rally from his exhaustion but youth and a good constitution triumphed at last and six weeks from the day on which he was brought in he started in a litter for calcutta  dick had telegraphed to captain peel and had obtained leave to remain with his brother and he now started for the coast with ned he himself had had a sharp attack of feverthe result of his wound on the head and the exertion he had undergone but he was now well and strong again and happy in neds convalescence  the journey was easy and pleasant at benares they went on board a steamer and were taken down to calcutta by the time they reached the capital ned was sufficiently recovered to walk about with his arm in dicks the use of his left arm was gone and it was a question whether he could ever recover it  at calcutta the warreners had the delight of meeting their sister and cousin who had arrived there the week previous the next four days were happy ones indeed and then there was another parting for the girls and ned sailed in a peninsular and oriental steamer for england dick remained a fortnight at calcutta until a sloopofwar sailed to join the china fleet to which his ship was now attached  it was two years later when the whole party who had been together in the bungalow at sandynuggher when the mutiny broke out met in london on the return of dicks ship from the east the lucknow jewels had turned out to be of immense value and messrs garrard to whom they had been sent had offered one hundred and thirty thousand pounds for them the offer had been at once accepted and the question of the division had after an endless exchange of letters been finally left by colonel warrener to the boys they had insisted that colonel warrener should take fifty thousand pounds and the remainder they had divided in four equal shares between themselves their sister and cousin whom they regarded as one of themselves this had enabled the latter to marry without delay captain manners whose wound had compelled him to leave the service while miss warrener had a few months later married major dunlop  ned too was no longer a soldier he had when he arrived in england found that his name had been included in the brevet rank bestowed upon all the captains of his regiment for distinguished service he had a years leave given him but at the end of that time a medical board decided that although greatly recovered it would be years before he thoroughly regained his strength and he therefore sold his commission and left the service  dick had passed as a lieutenant and had immediately been appointed to that rank with a fair prospect of getting his commanders step at the earliest possible date as a reward for the distinguished services for which he had been several times mentioned in dispatches at the time of the mutiny  general sir henry warrenerfor he received a step in rank and knighthood on retiring from the servicehad renewed his acquaintance with mrs hargreaves immediately on his return to england and dick to his intense astonishment and delight on arriving homefor he had received no letters for many monthsfound his old friend installed at the head of his fathers establishment as lady warrener  the daughters were of course inmates of the house and dick was not long in getting nelly to acknowledge that so far she had not changed her mind as expressed at cawnpore more than that he could not get her to say but when three years later he returned with commanders rank nelly after much entreaty and many assertions that it was perfectly ridiculous for a boy of twentyone to think about marrying consented and as ned and edith had equally come to an understanding a double marriage took place  general warrener and his wife are still alive major warrener has a seat in parliament and captain warrener who never went to sea after his marriage lives in a pretty house down at ryde where his yacht is known as one of the best and fastest cruisers on the coast  at christmas the whole partythe dunlops manners and warrenersmeet and an almost innumerable troop of children of all ages assemble at the spacious mansion of general warrener in berkeley square and never fail to have a long talk of the adventures that they went through in the times of peril  the end
