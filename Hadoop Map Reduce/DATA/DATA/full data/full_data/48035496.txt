of the firm   it will be observed by the literary and commercial world that in this transaction the name of the really responsible party does not show on the titlepage igeorge robinsonam that party when our mr jones objected to the publication of these memoirs unless they appeared as coming from the firm itself i at once gave way i had no wish to offend the firm and perhaps encounter a lawsuit for the empty honour of seeing my name advertised as that of an author we had talked the matter over with our mr brown who however was at that time in affliction and not able to offer much that was available one thing he did say as we are partners said mr brown lets be partners to the end well said i if you say so mr brown so it shall be i never supposed that mr brown would set the thames on fire and soon learnt that he was not the man to amass a fortune by british commerce he was not made for the guild of merchant princes but he was the senior member of our firm and i always respected the oldfashioned doctrine of capital in the person of our mr brown  when mr brown said lets be partners to the end it wont be for long mr robinson i never said another word no said i mr brown youre not what you wasand youre down a peg im not the man to take advantage and go against your last wishes whether for long or whether for short well pull through in the same boat to the end it shall be put on the titlepageby one of the firm god bless you mr robinson said he god bless you  and then mr jones started another objection the reader will soon realize that anything i do is sure to be wrong with mr jones it wouldnt be him else he next declares that i cant write english and that the book must be corrected and put out by an editor now when i inform the discerning british public that every advertisement that has been posted by brown jones and robinson during the last three years has come from my own unaided pen i think few will doubt my capacity to write the memoirs of brown jones and robinson without any editor whatsoever  on this head i was determined to be firm what after preparing and correcting and publishing such thousands of advertisements in prose and verse and in every form of which the language is susceptible to be told that i couldnt write english it was jones all over if there is a party envious of the genius of another party in this sublunary world that party is our mr jones  but i was again softened by a touching appeal from our senior partner mr brown though prosaic enough in his general ideas was still sometimes given to the muses and now with a melancholy and tender cadence he quoted the following lines      let dogs delight to bark and bite     for tis their nature to     but tis a shameful sight to see when partners of one firm        like we     fall out and chide and fight   so i gave in again  it was then arranged that one of smith and elders young men should look through the manuscript and make any few alterations which the taste of the public might require it might be that the sonorous and if i may so express myself magniloquent phraseology in which i was accustomed to invite the attention of the nobility and gentry to our last importations was not suited for the purposes of light literature such as this in fiction mr robinson your own unaided talents would doubtless make you great said to me the editor of this magazine but if i may be allowed an opinion i do think that in the delicate task of composing memoirs a little assistance may perhaps be not inexpedient  this was prettily worded so what with this and what with our mr browns poetry i gave way but i reserved to myself the right of an epistolary preface in my own name so here it is   ladies and gentlemeni am not a bit ashamed of my part in the following transaction i have done what little in me lay to further british commerce british commerce is not now what it was it is becoming open and free like everything else that is britishopen to the poor man as well as to the rich that bugbear capital is a crumbling old tower and is pretty nigh brought to its last ruin credit is the polished shaft of the temple on which the new world of trade will be content to lean that i take it is the one great doctrine of modern commerce creditcreditcredit get credit and capital will follow doesnt the word speak for itself must not credit be respectable and is not the word respectable the highest term of praise which can be applied to the british tradesman  credit is the polished shaft of the temple but with what are you to polish it the stone does not come from the quarry with its gloss on mans labour is necessary to give it that beauteous exterior then wherewith shall we polish credit i answer the question at once with the pumicestone and sandpaper of advertisement  different great men have promulgated the different means by which they have sought to subjugate the world audacityaudacityaudacity was the lesson which one hero taught agitateagitateagitate was the counsel of a second registerregisterregister of a third but i sayadvertise advertise advertise and i say it again and againadvertise advertise advertise it is or should be the shibboleth of british commerce that it certainly will be so i george robinson hereby venture to prophesy feeling that on this subject something but little short of inspiration has touched my eager pen  there are thosemen of the old school who cannot rouse themselves to see and read the signs of the time men who would have been in the last ranks let them have lived when they wouldwho object to it that it is untruewho say that advertisements do not keep the promises which they make but what says the poethe whom we teach our children to read what says the stern moralist to his wicked mother in the play assume a virtue if you have it not and so say i assume a virtue if you have it not it would be a great trade virtue in a haberdasher to have forty thousand pairs of best hose lying ready for sale in his warehouse let him assume that virtue if he have it not is not this the way in which we all live and the only way in which it is possible to live comfortably a gentleman gives a dinner party his lady who has to work all day like a drayhorse and scold the servants besides to get things into order loses her temper we all pretty well know what that means well up to the moment when she has to show she is as bitter a piece of goods as may be but nevertheless she comes down all smiles although she knows that at that moment the drunken cook is spoiling the fish she assumes a virtue though she has it not and who will say she is not right  well i say again and again to all young tradesmenadvertise advertise advertiseand dont stop to think too much about capital it is a bugbear capital is a bugbear and it is talked about by those who have itand by some that have not so much of it neitherfor the sake of putting down competition and keeping the market to themselves  theres the same game going on all the world over and its the natural game for mankind to play at they whos up a bit is all for keeping down them who is down and they who is down is so very soft through being down that theyve not spirit to force themselves up now i saw that very early in life there is always going on a battle between aristocracy and democracy aristocracy likes to keep itself to itself and democracy is just of the same opinion only wishes to become aristocracy first  we of the people are not very fond of dukes but wed all like to be dukes well enough ourselves now there are dukes in trade as well as in society capitalists are our dukes and as they dont like to have their heels trod upon any more than the other ones why they are always preaching up capital it is their star and garter their coronet their ermine their robe of state their cap of maintenance their wand of office their noli me tangere but stars and garters caps and wands and all other noli me tangeres are gammon to those who can see through them and capital is gammon capital is a very nice thing if you can get it it is the desirable result of trade a tradesman looks to end with a capital but its gammon to say that he cant begin without it you might as well say a man cant marry unless he has first got a family why he marries that he may have a family its putting the cart before the horse  its my opinion that any man can be a duke if so be its born to him it requires neither wit nor industry nor any pushing nor goahead whatsoever a man may sit still in his armchair half asleep half his time and only half awake the other and be as good a duke as need be well its just the same in trade if a man is born to a dukedom there if he begins with a large capital why i for one would not thank him to be successful any fool could do as much as that he has only to keep on polishing his own star and garter and there are lots of people to swear that there is no one like him  but give me the man who can be a duke without being born to it give me the man who can go ahead in trade without capital who can begin the world with a quick pair of hands a quick brain to govern them and can end with a capital  well there you are a young tradesman beginning the world without capital capital though its a bugbear nevertheless its a virtue therefore as you havent got it you must assume it thats credit credit i take to be the belief of other people in a thing that doesnt really exist when you go into your friend smiths house and find mrs s all smiles you give her credit for the sweetest of tempers your friend s knows better but then you see shes had wit enough to obtain credit when i draw a bill at three months and get it done i do the same thing thats credit give me credit enough and i dont care a brass button for capital if i could have but one wish i would never ask a fairy for a second or a third let me have but unreserved credit and ill beat any duke of either aristocracy  to obtain credit the only certain method is to advertise advertise advertise advertise that is assume assume assume go on assuming your virtue the more you havent got it the more you must assume it the bitterer your own heart is about that drunken cook and that idle husband who will do nothing to assist you the sweeter you must smile smile sweet enough and all the world will believe you advertise long enough and credit will come  but there must be some nous in your advertisements there must be a system and there must be some wit in your system it wont suffice nowadays to stick up on a blank wall a simple placard to say that you have forty thousand best hose just new arrived any woodenheaded fellow can do as much as that that might have served in the olden times that we hear of twenty years since but the game to be successful in these days must be played in another sort of fashion there must be some finish about your advertisements something new in your style something that will startle in your manner if a man can make himself a real master of this art we may say that he has learnt his trade whatever that trade may be let him know how to advertise and the rest will follow  it may be that i shouldnt boast but yet i do boast that i have made some little progress in this business if i havent yet practised the art in all its perfections nevertheless i flatter myself i have learned how to practise it regarding myself as something of a master of this art and being actuated by purely philanthropic motives in my wish to make known my experience i now put these memoirs before the public  it will of course be urged against me that i have not been successful in what i have already attempted and that our house has failed this is true i have not been successful our house has failed but with whom has the fault been certainly not in my department  the fact is and in this my preface i will not keep the truth back from a discerning public that no firm on earthor indeed elsewherecould be successful in which our mr jones is one of the partners there is an overweening vanity about that man which is quite upsetting i confess i have been unable to stand it vanity is always allied to folly and the relationship is very close in the person of our mr jones of mr brown i will never bring myself to say one disrespectful word he is not now what he was once from the bottom of my heart i pity his misfortunes think what it must be to be papa to a goneril and a reganwithout the cordelia i have always looked on mrs jones as a regular goneril and as for the regan why it seems to me that miss brown is likely to be miss regan to the end of the chapter  no of mr brown i will say nothing disrespectful but he never was the man to be first partner in an advertising firm that was our mistake he had oldfashioned views about capital which were very burdensome my mistake was thisthat in joining myself with mr brown i compromised my principles and held out as it were a left hand to capital he had not much as will be seen but he thought a deal of what he had got and talked a deal of it too this impeded my wings this prevented me from soaring one cannot touch pitch and not be defiled i have been untrue to myself in having had any dealings on the basis of capital and hence has it arisen that hitherto i have failed  i make these confessions hoping that they may be serviceable to trade in general a man cannot learn a great secret and the full use of a great secret all at once my eyes are now open i shall not again make so fatal a mistake i am still young i have now learned my lesson more thoroughly and i yet anticipate success with some confidence  had mr brown at once taken my advice had his few thousand pounds been liberally expended in commencing a true system of advertising we should have beeni can hardly surmise where we should have been he was for sticking altogether to the old system mr jones was for mixing the old and the new for laying in stock and advertising as well with a capital of 4000l what my opinion is of mr jones i will not now say but of mr brown i will never utter one word of disparagement  i have now expressed what few words i wish to say on my own bottom as to what has been done in the following pages by the young man who has been employed to look over these memoirs and put them into shape it is not for me to speak it may be that i think they might have read more naturallike had no other cook had a finger in the pie the facts however are facts still these have not been cooked  ladies and gentlemen you who have so long distinguished our firm by a liberal patronage to you i now respectfully appeal and in showing to you a new article i beg to assure you with perfect confidence that there is nothing equal to it at the price at present in the market the supply on hand is immense but as a sale of unprecedented rapidity is anticipated may i respectfully solicit your early orders if not approved of the article shall be changed  ladies and gentlemen we have the honour to subscribe ourselves with every respect your most obedient humble servants brown jones and robinson per george robinson     chapter ii  the early history of our mr brown with some few words of mr jones   o commerce how wonderful are thy ways how vast thy power how invisible thy dominion who can restrain thee and forbid thy further progress kings are but as infants in thy hands and emperors despotic in all else are bound to obey thee thou civilizest hast civilized and wilt civilize civilization is thy mission and mans welfare thine appointed charge the nation that most warmly fosters thee shall ever be the greatest in the earth and without thee no nation shall endure for a day thou art our alpha and our omega our beginning and our end the marrow of our bones the salt of our life the sap of our branches the cornerstone of our temple the rock of our foundation we are built on thee and for thee and with thee to worship thee should be mans chiefest care to know thy hidden ways his chosen study  one maxim hast thou o commerce great and true and profitable above all othersone law which thy votaries should never transgress buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest may those divine words be ever found engraved on the hearts of brown jones and robinson  of mr brown the senior member of our firm it is expedient that some short memoir should be given at the time at which we signed our articles in 185 mr brown had just retired from the butter business it does not appear that in his early youth he ever had the advantage of an apprenticeship and he seems to have been employed in various branches of trade in the position if one may say so of an outdoor messenger in this capacity he entered the service of mr mccockerell a retail butter dealer in smithfield when mr mccockerell died our mr brown married his widow and thus found himself elevated at once to the fullblown dignity of a tradesman he and his wife lived together for thirty years and it is believed that in the temper of his lady he found some alloy to the prosperity which he had achieved the widow mccockerell in bestowing her person upon mr brown had not intended to endow him also with entire dominion over her shop and chattels she loved to be supreme over her butter tubs and she loved also to be supreme over her till browns views on the rights of women were more in accordance with the law of the land as laid down in the statutes he opined that a femme couverte could own no property not even a butter tuband hence quarrels arose  after thirty years of contests such as these mr brown found himself victorious made so not by the power of arguments nor by that of his own right arm but by the demise of mrs brown that amiable lady died leaving two daughters to lament their loss and a series of family quarrels by which she did whatever lay in her power to embarrass her husband but by which she could not prevent him from becoming absolute owner of the butter business and of the stock in trade  the two young ladies had not been brought up to the ways of the counter and as mr brown was not himself especially expert at that particular business in which his money was embarked he prudently thought it expedient to dispose of the shop and goodwill this he did to advantage and thus at the age of fiftyfive he found himself again on the world with 4000l in his pocket  at this period one of his daughters was no longer under his own charge sarah jane the eldest of the two was already mrs jones she had been captivated by the black hair and silk waistcoat of mr jones and had gone off with him in opposition to the wishes of both parents this she was aware was not matter of much moment for the opposition of one was sure to bring about a reconciliation with the other and such was soon the case mrs brown would not see her daughter or allow jones to put his foot inside the buttershop mr brown consequently took lodgings for them in the neighbourhood and hence a close alliance sprung up between the future partners  at this crisis maryanne devoted herself to her mother it was admitted by all who knew her that maryanne brown had charms at that time she was about twentyfour years of age and was certainly a fine young woman she was like her mother a little too much inclined to corpulence and there may be those who would not allow that her hair was auburn mr robinson however who was then devotedly attached to her was of that opinion and was ready to maintain his views against any man who would dare to say that it was red  there was a dash about maryanne brown at that period which endeared her greatly to mr robinson she was quite above anything mean and when her papa was left a widower in possession of four thousand pounds she was one of those who were most anxious to induce him to go to work with spirit in a new business she was all for advertising that must be confessed of her though her subsequent conduct was not all that it should have been maryanne brown when tried in the furnace did not come out pure gold but this at any rate shall be confessed in her behalf that she had a dash about her and understood more of the tricks of trade than any other of her family  mrs mccockerell died about six months after her eldest daughters marriage she was generally called mrs mccockerell in the neighbourhood of smithfield though so many years had passed since she had lost her right to that name indeed she generally preferred being so styled as mr brown was peculiarly averse to it the name was wormwood to him and this was quite sufficient to give it melody in her ears  the good lady died about six months after her daughters marriage she was struck with apoplexy and at that time had not been reconciled to her married daughter sarah jane nevertheless when she heard what had occurred came over to smithfield her husband was then in employment as shopman at the large haberdashery house on snow hill and lived with his wife in lodgings in cowcross street they were supported nearly entirely by mr brown and therefore owed to him at this crisis not only obedience but dutiful affection  when however sarah jane first heard of her mothers illness she seemed to think that she couldnt quarrel with her father fast enough jones had an idea that the old ladys money must go to her daughters that she had the power of putting it altogether out of the hands of her husband and that having the power she would certainly exercise it on this speculation he had married and as he and his wife fully concurred in their financial views it was considered expedient by them to lose no time in asserting their right this they did as soon as the breath was out of the old ladys body  jones had married sarah jane solely with this view and indeed it was highly improbable that he should have done so on any other consideration sarah jane was certainly not a handsome girl her neck was scraggy her arms lean and her lips thin and she resembled neither her father nor her mother her light brown sandy hair which always looked as though it were too thin and too short to adapt itself to any feminine usage was also not of her family but her disposition was a compound of the paternal and maternal qualities she had all her fathers painful hesitating timidity and with it all her mothers grasping spirit if there ever was an eye that looked sharp after the pence that could weigh the ounces of a servants meal at a glance and foresee and prevent the expenditure of a farthing it was the eye of sarah jane brown they say that it is as easy to save a fortune as to make one and in this way if in no other jones may be said to have got a fortune with his wife  as soon as the breath was out of mrs mccockerells body sarah jane was there taking inventory of the stock at that moment poor mr brown was very much to be pitied he was a man of feeling and even if his heart was not touched by his late loss he knew what was due to decency it behoved him now as a widower to forget the deceased ladys faults and to put her under the ground with solemnity this was done with the strictest propriety and although he must of course have been thinking a good deal at that time as to whether he was to be a beggar or a rich man nevertheless he conducted himself till after the funeral as though he hadnt a care on his mind except the loss of mrs b  maryanne was as much on the alert as her sister she had been for the last six months her mothers pet as sarah jane had been her fathers darling there was some excuse therefore for maryanne when she endeavoured to get what she could in the scramble sarah jane played the part of goneril to the life and would have denied her father the barest necessaries of existence had it not ultimately turned out that the property was his own  maryanne was not well pleased to see her sister returning to the house at such a moment she at least had been dutiful to her mother or if undutiful not openly so if mrs mccockerell had the power of leaving her property to whom she pleased it would be only natural that she should leave it to the daughter who had obeyed her and not to the daughter who had added to personal disobedience the worse fault of having been on friendly terms with her father  this one would have thought would have been clear at any rate to jones if not to sarah jane but they both seemed at this time to have imagined that the eldest child had some right to the inheritance as being the eldest it will be observed by this and by many other traits in his character that mr jones had never enjoyed the advantages of an education  mrs mccockerell never spoke after the fit first struck her she never moved an eye or stirred a limb or uttered a word it was a wretched household at that time the good lady died on a wednesday and was gathered to her fathers at kensal green cemetery on the tuesday following during the intervening days mr jones and sarah jane took on themselves as though they were owners of everything maryanne did try to prevent the inventory not wishing it to appear that mrs jones had any right to meddle but the task was too congenial to sarah janes spirit to allow of her giving it over she revelled in the work it was a delight to her to search out hidden stores of useless wealthto bring forth to the light forgotten hoards of cups and saucers and to catalogue every rag on the premises  the house at this time was not a pleasant one mr brown finding that jones in whom he had trusted had turned against him put himself very much into the hands of a young friend of his named george robinson who and what george robinson was will be told in the next chapter  there are three questions said robinson to be asked and answeredhad mrs b the power to make a will if so did she make a will and if so what was the will she made  mr brown couldnt remember whether or no there had been any signing of papers at his marriage a good deal of rum and water he said had been drunk and there might have been signing toobut he didnt remember it  then there was the search for the will this was supposed to be in the hands of one brisket a butcher for whom it was known mrs mccockerell had destined the hand of her younger daughter mr brisket had been a great favourite with the old lady and she had often been heard to declare that he should have the wife and money or the money without the wife this she said to coerce maryanne into the match  but brisket when questioned declared that he had no will in his possession at this time he kept aloof from the house and showed no disposition to meddle with the affairs of the family indeed all through these trying days he behaved honestly if not with high feeling in recounting the doings of brown jones and robinson it will sometimes be necessary to refer to mr brisket he shall always be spoken of as an honest man he did all that in him lay to mar the bright hopes of one who was perhaps not the most insignificant of that firm he destroyed the matrimonial hopes of mr robinson and left him to wither like a blighted trunk on a lone waste but he was nevertheless an honest man and so much shall be said of him let us never forget that an honest man is the noblest work of god  brisket when asked said that he had no will and that he knew of none in fact there was no will forthcoming and there is no doubt that the old woman was cut off before she had made one it may also be premised that had she made one it would have been invalid seeing that mr brown as husband was in fact the owner of the whole affair  sarah jane and maryanne when they found that no document was forthcoming immediately gave out that they intended to take on themselves the duties of joint heiresses and an alliance offensive and defensive was sworn between them at this time mr brown employed a lawyer and the heiresses together with jones employed another there could be no possible doubt as to mr brown being the owner of the property however infatuated on such a subject jones and his wife may have been no lawyer in london could have thought that the young women had a leg to stand upon nevertheless the case was undertaken and brown found himself in the middle of a lawsuit sarah jane and maryanne both remained in the house in smithfield to guard the property on their own behalf mr brown also remained to guard it on his behalf the business for a time was closed this was done in opposition both to mr brown and maryanne but mrs jones could not bring herself to permit the purchase of a firkin of butter unless the transaction could be made absolutely under her own eyes and even then she would insist on superintending the retail herself and selling every pound short weight it was the custom of the trade she said and to depart from it would ruin them  things were in this condition going from bad to worse when jones came over one evening and begged an interview with mr brown that interview was the commencement of the partnership from such small matters do great events arise  at that interview mr robinson was present mr brown indeed declared that he would have no conversation with jones on business affairs unless in the presence of a third party jones represented that if they went on as they were now doing the property would soon be swallowed up by the lawyers to this mr brown whose forte was not eloquence tacitly assented with a deep groan  then said jones let us divide it into three portions you shall have one sarah jane a second and i will manage the third on behalf of my sisterinlaw maryanne if we arrange it well the lawyers will never get a shilling  the idea of a compromise appeared to mr brown to be not uncommendable but a compromise on such terms as those could not of course be listened to robinson strongly counselled him to nail his colours to the mast and kick mr jones downstairs but mr brown had not spirit for this  ones children is ones children said he to robinson when they went apart into the shop to talk the matter over the fruit of ones loins and the prop of ones age  robinson could not help thinking that sarah jane was about as bad a prop as any that ever a man leant on but he was too generous to say so the matter was ended at last by a compromise go on with the business together said robinson mr brown keeping of course a preponderating share in his own hands  i dont like butter said jones nothing great can be done in butter  it is a very safe line said mr brown if the connection is good  the connection must have been a good deal damaged said robinson seeing that the shop has been closed for a fortnight besides its a womans businessand you have no woman to manage it added he fearing that mrs jones might be brought in to the detriment of all concerned  jones suggested haberdashery robinson guided by a strong idea that there is a more absolute opening for the advertising line in haberdashery than in any other business assented  then let it be haberdashery said mr brown with a sigh and so that was settled     chapter iii  the early history of mr robinson   and haberdashery it was but here it may be as well to say a few words as to mr robinson and to explain how he became a member of the firm he had been in his boyhooda billsticker and he defies the commercial world to show that he ever denied it in his earlier days he carried the paste and pole and earned a livelihood by putting up notices of theatrical announcements on the hoardings of the metropolis there was however that within him which nature did not intend to throw away on the sticking of bills as was found out quickly enough by those who employed him the lad while he was running the streets with his pole in his hand and his pot round his neck learned first to read and then to write what others might read from studying the bills which he carried he soon took to original composition and it may be said of him that in fluency of language and richness of imagery few surpassed him in person mr robinson was a genteel young man though it cannot be said of him that he possessed manly beauty he was slight and active intelligent in his physiognomy and polite in his demeanour perhaps it may be unnecessary to say anything further on this head  mr robinson had already established himself as an author in his own line and was supporting himself decently by his own unaided abilities when he first met maryanne brown in the regents park she was then walking with her sister and resolutely persisted in disregarding all those tokens of admiration which he found himself unable to restrain  there certainly was a dash about maryanne brown that at certain moments was invincible hooped petticoats on the back of her sister looked like hoops and awkward hoops they were angular lopsided and lumpy but maryanne wore her hoops as a duchess wears her crinoline her wellstarched muslin dress would swell off from her waist in a manner that was irresistible to george robinson such grouping as he said to his friend walker such a flow of drapery such tournure ah my dear fellow the artists eye sees these things at a glance and then walking at a safe distance he kept his eyes on them  im sure that fellows following us said sarah jane looking back at him with all her scorn  theres no law against that i suppose said maryanne tartly so much as that mr robinson did succeed in hearing  the girls entered their mothers house but as they did so maryanne lingered for a moment in the doorway was it accident or was it not did the fair girl choose to give her admirer one chance or was it that she was careful not to crush her starch by too rapid an entry  i shall be in regents park on sunday afternoon whispered robinson as he passed by the house with his hand to his mouth it need hardly be said that the lady vouchsafed him no reply  on the following sunday george robinson was again in the park and after wandering among its rural shades for half a day he was rewarded by seeing the goddess of his idolatry miss brown was there with a companion but not with sarah jane he had already as though by instinct conceived in his heart as powerful an aversion for one sister as affection for the other and his delight was therefore unbounded when he saw that she he loved was there while she he hated was away  twere long to tell at the commencement of this narrative how a courtship was commenced and carried on how robinson sighed at first in vain and then not in vain how goodnatured was miss twizzle the bosom friend of maryanne and how robinson for a time walked and slept and fed on roses  there was at that time a music class held at a certain elegant room near osnaburgh church in the new road at which maryanne and her friend miss twizzle were accustomed to attend those lessons were sometimes prosecuted in the evening and those evening studies sometimes resulted in a little dance we may say that after a while that was their habitual tendency and that the lady pupils were permitted to introduce their male friends on condition that the gentlemen paid a shilling each for the privilege it was in that room that george robinson passed the happiest hours of his chequered existence he was soon expert in all the figures of the mazy dance and was excelled by no one in the agility of his step or the endurance of his performances it was by degrees rumoured about that he was something higher than he seemed to be and those best accustomed to the place used to call him the poet it must be remembered that at this time mrs mccockerell was still alive and that as sarah jane had then become mrs jones maryanne was her mothers favourite and destined to receive all her mothers gifts of the name and person of william brisket george robinson was then in happy ignorance and the first introduction between them took place in the hall of harmony  twas about eleven oclock in the evening when the light feet of the happy dancers had already been active for some hour or so in the worship of their favourite muse that robinson was standing up with his arm round his fair ones waist immediately opposite to the door of entrance his right arm still embraced her slight girdle whilst with his left hand he wiped the perspiration from his brow she leaned against him palpitating for the motion of the music had been quick and there had been some amicable contest among the couples it is needless to say that george robinson and maryanne brown had suffered no defeat at that moment a refreshing breeze of the night air was wafted into the room from the opened door and robinson looking up saw before him a sturdy thickset man with mottled beefy face and by his side there stood a spectre its your sister whispered he to maryanne in a tone of horror  oh laws theres bill said she and then she fainted the gentleman with the mottled face was indeed no other than mr brisket the purveyor of meat for whose arms mrs mccockerell had destined the charms of her younger daughter conduct baser than that of mrs jones on this occasion is not perhaps recorded in history she was no friend of briskets she had it not at heart to forward her mothers views at this period of their lives she and her mother never met but she had learned her sisters secret and having it in her power to crush her sisters happiness had availed herself of the opportunity  there he is said she quite aloud so that the whole room should hear hes a billsticker and she pointed the finger of scorn at her sisters lover  im one who have always earned my own living said robinson and never had occasion to hang on to any one this he said knowing that joness lodgings were paid for by mr brown  hereupon mr brisket walked across the room and as he walked there was a cloud of anger on his brow perhaps young man he saidand as he spoke he touched robinson on the shoulderperhaps young man you wouldnt mind having a few words with me outside the door  sir said the other with some solemnity i am not aware that i have the honour of your acquaintance  im william brisket butcher said he and if you dont come out when i asks you by jingo ill carry you  the lady had fainted the crowd of dancers was standing round with inquiring faces that female spectre repeated the odious words still pointing at him with her finger hes a billsticker brisket was full fourteen stone whereas robinson might perhaps be ten what was robinson to do are you going to walk out or am i going to carry you said the hercules of the slaughterhouse  i will do anything said robinson to relieve a ladys embarrassment  they walked out on to the landingplace whither not a few of the gentlemen and some of the ladies followed them  i say young man said brisket do you know who that young woman is  i certainly have the honour of her acquaintance said robinson  but perhaps you havent the honour of knowing that shes my wifeas is to be now you know it and then the coarse monster eyed him from head to foot now you may go home to your mother said he but dont tell her anything of it because its a secret  he was fifteen stone at least and robinson was hardly ten oh how vile is the mastery which matter still has over mind in many of the concerns of life how can a man withstand the assault of a bull what was robinson to do he walked downstairs into the street leaving maryanne behind with the butcher  some days after this he contrived a meeting with his love and he then learned the history of that engagement she hated brisket she said he was odious to her he was always greasy and smelt of meatbut he had a respectable business  and is my maryanne mercenary asked robinson  now george said she its no use you scolding me and i wont be scolded ma says that i must be civil to him and im not going to quarrel with ma at any rate not yet  but surely maryanne  its no good you surelying me george for i wont be surelyed if you dont like me you can leave me  maryanne i adore you  thats all very well and i hope you do but why did you make a row with that man the other night  but dearest love he made the row with me  and when you did make it continued maryanne why didnt you see it out robinson did not find it easy to answer this accusation that matter has still dominion over mind though the days are coming when mind shall have dominion over matter was a lesson which in after days it would be sweet to teach her but at the present moment the time did not serve for such teaching a man must look after his own george or else hell go to the wall she said with a sneer and then he parted from her in anger  but his love did not on that account wax cool and so in his misery he had recourse to their mutual friend miss twizzle the truth is this said miss twizzle i believe shed take him because hes respectable and got a business  hes horribly vulgar said robinson  oh bother said miss twizzle i know nothing about that hes got a business and whoever marries brisket wont have to look for a bed to sleep on but theres a hitch about the money  then mr robinson learned the facts mrs mccockerell as she was still called had promised to give her daughter five hundred pounds as her marriage portion but mr brisket would not go to the altar till he got the money he wanted to extend himself he said and would not marry till he saw his way hence had arisen that delay which maryanne had solaced by her attendance at the musichall  but if youre in earnest said miss twizzle dont you be down on your luck go to old brown and make friends with him hell stand up for you because he knows his wife favours brisket  george robinson did go to mr brown and on the father the young mans eloquence was not thrown away she shall be yours mr robinson he said after the first fortnight but we must be very careful with mrs b  after the second fortnight mrs b was no more and in this way it came to pass that george robinson was present as mr browns adviser when that scheme respecting the haberdashery was first set on foot     chapter iv  nine times nine is eightyone showing how brown jones and robinson selected their house of business   and haberdashery it was but there was much yet to be done before any terms for a partnership could be settled mr jones at first insisted that he and his fatherinlaw should begin business on equal terms he considered that any questions as to the actual right in the property would be mean after their mutual agreement to start in the world as friends but to this mr brown not unnaturally objected  then i shall go back to my lawyer said jones whereupon he did leave the room taking his hat with him but he remained below in the old shop  if i am to go into partnership with that man alone said mr brown turning to his young friend almost in despair i may prepare for the gazette at onceand for my grave he added solemnly  ill join you said robinson i havent got any money you know that but then neither has he  i wish you had a little said mr brown capital is capital you know  but ive got that which is better than capital said robinson touching his forehead with his forefinger and if youll trust me mr brown i wont see you put upon the promise which mr robinson then gave he kept ever afterwards with a marked fidelity  i will trust you said mr brown it shall be brown jones and robinson  and brown jones and robinson shall carry their heads high among the greatest commercial firms of this wealthy metropolis said robinson with an enthusiasm which was surely pardonable at such a moment  mr jones soon returned with another compromise but it was of a low peddling nature it had reference to sevenths and eighths and went into the payments of the household bills i as one of the partners must object to any such arrangements said robinson  youyou one of the partners said jones  if you have no objectioncertainly said robinson and if you should have any objectionequally so  youa billsticker said jones  in the presence of william brisket george robinson had been forced to acknowledge that matter must still occasionally prevail over mind but he felt no such necessity in the presence of jones ill tell you what it is said robinson ive never denied my former calling among friends i often talk about it but mind you mr jones i wont bear it from you im not very big myself but i think i could stand up before you  but in this quarrel they were stopped by mr brown let dogs delight he said or sung to bark and bite and then he raised his two fat hands feebly as though deprecating any further wrath as usual on such occasions mr robinson yielded and then explained in very concise language the terms on which it was proposed that the partnership should be opened mr brown should put his capital into the business and be entitled to half the profits mr jones and mr robinson should give the firm the advantage of their youth energies and genius and should each be held as the possessor of a quarter that mr jones made long and fierce objections to this need hardly be stated it is believed that he did more than once go back to his lawyer but mr brown who for the time put himself into the hands of his youngest partner remained firm and at last the preliminaries were settled  the name of the house the nature of the business and the shares of the partners were now settled and the site of the future labours of the firm became the next question mr brown was in favour of a small tenement in little britain near to the entrance into smithfield  there would not be scope there said robinson  and no fashion said jones  its safe and respectable pleaded mr brown there have been shops in little britain these sixty years in the same families  but robinson was of opinion that the fortunes of the firm might not improbably be made in six if only they would commence with sufficient distinction he had ascertained that large and commanding premises might be had in st pauls churchyard in the frontage of which the square feet of plate glass could be counted by the hundred it was true that the shop was nearly all window but then as mr robinson said an extended front of glass was the one thing necessary and it was true also that the future tenants must pay down a thousand pounds before they enteredbut then as he explained how could they better expend the trifle of money which they possessed  trifle of money said mr brown thinking of the mountains of butter and years of economy which had been required to put together those four thousand poundsthinking also perhaps of the absolute impecuniosity of his young partner who thus spoke  jones was for the west end and regent street there was a shop only two doors off regent street which could be made to look as if it was almost in regent street the extension of a side piece of plate glass would show quite into regent street he even prepared a card describing the house as 2 doors from regent street printing the figure and the words regent street very large and the intermediate description very small it was ever by such stale inefficient artifices as these that he sought success  wholl care for your card said robinson when a mans card comes to be of use to him the things done hes living in his villa by that time and has his five thousand ayear out of the profits  i hope youll both have your willas before long said brown trying to keep his partners in good humour but a cottage horney will be enough for me id like to be able to give my children their bit of dinner on sunday hot and comfortable i want no more than that  that was a hard battle and it resulted in no victory the dingy shop in little britain was of course out of the question and mr brown assisted robinson in preventing that insane attempt at aping the unprofitable glories of regent street the matter ended in another compromise and a house was taken in bishopsgate street of which the frontage was extensive and commanding but as to which it must certainly be confessed that the back part of the premises was inconveniently confined  it isnt exactly all i could wish said robinson standing on the pavement as he surveyed it but it will do with a little originality and some dash well make it do we must give it a name  a name said mr brown its 81 bishopsgate street aint it they dont call houses names in london  thats just why well have a name for ours mr brown  the albert emporium suggested jones or victoria mart  mr jones as will be seen was given to tufthunting to the backbone his great ambition was to have a lion and unicorn and to call himself haberdasher to a royal prince he had never realized the fact that profit like power comes from the people and not from the court i wouldnt put up the queens arms if the queen came and asked me robinson once said in answer to him that game has been played out and it isnt worth the cost of the two wooden figures  the temple of fashion would do very well said jones  the temple of fiddlestick said robinson  of course you say so said jones  let dogs delight began mr brown standing as we were in the middle of the street  ill tell you what said robinson theres nothing like colour well call it magenta house and well paint it magenta from the roof to the window tops  this beautiful tint had only then been invented and it was necessary to explain the word to mr brown he merely remarked that the oil and paint would come to a deal of money and then gave way jones was struck dumb by the brilliancy of the idea and for once forgot to object  and ill tell you what said robinsonnine times nine is eightyone  certainly certainly said mr brown who delighted to agree with his younger partner when circumstances admitted it you are right there certainly jones was observed to go through the multiplication table mentally but he could detect no error  nine times nine is eightyone repeated robinson with confidence and well put that fact up over the firstfloor windows  and so they did the house was painted magenta colour from top to bottom and on the front in very large figures and letters was stated the undoubted fact that nine times nine is 81 if they will only call us the nine times nine the thing is done said robinson nevertheless the house was christened magenta house and now about glass said robinson when the three had retired to the little back room within  mr robinson however admitted afterwards that he was wrong about the colour and the number such methods of obtaining attention were he said too easy of imitation and devoid of any inherent attraction of their own people would not care for nine times nine in bishopsgate street if there were nine times nines in other streets as well no said he i was but beginning and made errors as beginners do outside there should be glass gas gold and glare inside there should be the same with plenty of brass and if possible a little wit if those wont do it nothing will all the same the magenta colour and the nine times nine did have their effect nine times nine is eightyone was printed on the top of all the flying advertisements issued by the firm and the printing was all done in magenta  mr brown groaned sorely over the expenditure that was necessary in preparation of the premises his wish was that this should be paid for in ready money and indeed it was necessary that this should be done to a certain extent but the great object should have been to retain every available shilling for advertisements in the way of absolute capitalmoney to be paid for stock4000l was nothing but 4000l scattered broadcast through the metropolis on walls omnibuses railway stations little books pavement chalkings illuminated notices porters backs gilded cars and men in armour would have driven nine times nine into the memory of half the inhabitants of london the men in armour were tried four suits were obtained in poland street and four strong men were hired who rode about town all day on four brewers horses they carried poles with large banners and on the banners were inscribed the words which formed the shibboleth of the firm      magenta house    9 times 9 is 81    bishopsgate street   and four times a day these four men in armour met each other in front of the windows of the house and stood there on horseback for fifteen minutes with their backs to the curbstone the forage however of the horses became so terribly large an item of expenditure that mr browns heart failed him his heart failed him and he himself went off late one evening to the livery stablekeeper who supplied the horses and in mr robinsons absence the armour was sent back to poland street  we should have had the police down upon us george said mr brown deprecating the anger of his younger partner  and what better advertisement could you have wished said robinson it would have been in all the papers and have cost nothing  but you dont know george what them beastesses was eating it was frightful to hear of fourandtwenty pounds of corn a day each of em because the armour was so uncommon heavy the men in armour were then given up but they certainly were beginning to be effective at 6 pm when the men were there it had become impossible to pass the shop without going into the middle of the street and on one or two occasions the policemen had spoken to mr brown then there was a slight accident with a child and the newspapers had interfered  but we are anticipating the story for the men in armour did not begin their operations till the shop had been opened  and now about glass said robinson as soon as the three partners had retired from the outside flags into the interior of the house  it must be plate of course said jones plate he might as well have said when wanting a house that it must have walls  i rather think so said robinson and a good deal of it  i dont mind a goodsized common window said brown  a deal better have them uncommon said robinson interrupting him and remember sir theres nothing like glass in these days it has superseded leather altogether in that respect  leather said mr brown who was hardly quick enough for his junior partner  of all our materials now in general use said robinson glass is the most brilliant and yet the cheapest the most graceful and yet the strongest though transparent it is impervious to wet the eye travels through it but not the hailstorm to the power of gas it affords no obstacle but is as efficient a barrier against the casualties of the street as an iron shutter to that which is ordinary it lends a grace and to that which is graceful it gives a double lustre like a good advertisement it multiplies your stock tenfold and like a good servant it is always eloquent in praise of its owner i look upon plate glass sir as the most glorious product of the age and i regard the tradesman who can surround himself with the greatest quantity of it as the most in advance of the tradesmen of his day oh sir whatever we do let us have glass  its beautiful to hear him talk said mr brown but its the bill im a thinking of  if you will only go enough ahead mr brown youll find that nobody will trouble you with such bills  but they must be paid some day george  of course they must but it will never do to think of that now in twelve months or so when we have set the house well going the payment of such bills as that will be a mere nothinga thing that will be passed as an item not worth notice faint heart never won fair lady you know mr brown and then a cloud came across george robinsons brow as he thought of the words he had spoken for his heart had once been faint and his fair lady was by no means won  thats quite true said jones it never does ha ha ha  then the cloud went away from george robinsons brow and a stern frown of settled resolution took its place at that moment he made up his mind that when he might again meet that giant butcher he would forget the difference in their size and accost him as though they two were equal what though some fell blow levelled as at an ox should lay him low for ever better that than endure from day to day the unanswered taunts of such a one as jones  mr brown though he was not quickwitted was not deficient when the feelings of man and man were concerned he understood it all and taking advantage of a moment when jones had stepped up the shop he pressed robinsons hand and saidyou shall have her george if a fathers word is worth anything you shall have her but in this caseas in so many othersa fathers word was not worth anything  but to business said robinson shaking off from him all thoughts of love  after that mr brown had not the heart to oppose him respecting the glass and in that matter he had everything nearly his own way the premises stood advantageously at the comer of a little alley so that the window was made to jut out sideways in that direction and a full foot and a half was gained on the other side the house did not stand flush with its neighbouras is not unfrequently the case in bishopsgate streetand here also a few inches were made available the next neighbour a quiet old man who sold sticks threatened a lawsuit but that had it been instituted would have got into the newspapers and been an advertisement there was considerable trouble about the entrance a wide commanding centre doorway was essential but this if made in the desirable proportions would have terribly crippled the side windows to obviate this difficulty the exterior space allotted for the entrance between the frontage of the two windows was broad and noble but the glass splayed inwards towards the shop so that the absolute door was decidedly narrow  when we come to have a crowd they wont get in and out said jones  if we could only crush a few to death in the doorway our fortune would be made said robinson  god forbid said mr brown god forbid let us have no bloodshed whatever we do  in about a month the house was completed and much to the regret of both the junior partners a considerable sum of ready money was paid to the tradesmen who performed the work mr jones was of opinion that by sufficient cunning such payments might be altogether evaded no such thought rested for a moment in the bosom of mr robinson all tradesmen should be paid and paid well but the great firm of brown jones and robinson would be much less likely to scrutinize the price at which plate glass was charged to them per square foot when they were taking their hundreds a day over the counter than they would be now when every shilling was of importance to them  for their own sake you shouldnt do it said he to mr brown you may be quite sure they dont like it  i always liked it myself said mr brown and thus he would make little dribbling payments by which an unfortunate idea was generated in the neighbourhood that money was not plentiful with the firm     chapter v  the division of labour   there were two other chief matters to which it was now necessary that the firm should attend the first and primary being the stock of advertisements which should be issued and the other or secondary being the stock of goods which should be obtained to answer the expectations raised by those advertisements  but george we must have something to sell said mr brown almost in despair he did not then understand and never since has learned the secrets of that commercial science which his younger partner was at so much pains to teach there are things which no elderly man can learn and there are lessons which are full of light for the new recruit but dark as death to the old veteran  it will be so doubtless with me also said robinson soliloquizing on the subject in his melancholy mood the day will come when i too must be pushed from my stool by the workings of younger genius and shall sink as poor mr brown is now sinking into the foggy depths of fogeydom but a man who is a man and then that melancholy mood left him can surely make his fortune before that day comes when a merchant is known to be worth half a million his fogeydom is respected  that necessity of having something to sell almost overcame mr brown in those days whats the good of putting down 5000 kolinski and minx boas in the bill if we dont possess one in the shop he asked we must have some if theyre asked for he could not understand that for a first start effect is everything if customers should want kolinski boas kolinski boas would of course be forthcomingto any number required either kolinski boas or quasi kolinski which in trade is admitted to be the same thing when a man advertises that he has 40000 new paletots he does not mean that he has got that number packed up in a box if required to do so he will supply them to that extentor to any further extent a long row of figures in trade is but an elegant use of the superlative if a tradesman can induce a lady to buy a diagonal osnabruck cashmere shawl by telling her that he has 1200 of them who is injured and if the shawl is not exactly a real diagonal osnabruck cashmere what harm is done as long as the lady gets the value for her money and if she dont get the value for her money whose fault is that isnt it a fair standup fight and when she tries to buy for 4l a shawl which she thinks is worth about 8l isnt she dealing on the same principles herself if she be lucky enough to possess credit the shawl is sent home without payment and three years afterwards fifty per cent is perhaps offered for settlement of the bill it is a fair fight and the ladies are very well able to take care of themselves  and jones also thought they must have something to sell money is money said he and goods is goods whats the use of windows if we havent anything to dress them and whats the use of capital unless we buy a stock  with mr jones george robinson never cared to argue the absolute impossibility of pouring the slightest ray of commercial light into the dim chaos of that murky mind had long since come home to him he merely shook his head and went on with the composition on which he was engaged it need hardly be explained here that he had no idea of encountering the public throng on their opening day without an adequate assortment of goods of course there must be shawls and cloaks of course there must be muffs and boas of course there must be hose and handkerchiefs that dressing of the windows was to be the special care of mr jones and robinson would take care that there should be the wherewithal the dressing of the windows and the parading of the shop was to be the work of jones his ambition had never soared above that and while serving in the house on snow hill his utmost envy had been excited by the youthful aspirant who there walked the boards and with an oily courtesy handed chairs to the ladies for one short week he had been allowed to enter this paradise and though i looked so sweet on them said he i always had my eye on them its a grand thing to be down on a welldressed woman as shes hiding a roll of ribbon under her cloak that was his idea of grandeur  a stock of goods was of course necessary but if the firm could only get their name sufficiently established that matter would be arranged simply by written orders to two or three wholesale houses competition that beautiful science of the present day by which every plodding carthorse is converted into a racer makes this easy enough when it should once become known that a firm was opening itself on a great scale in a good thoroughfare and advertising on real intelligible principles there would be no lack of goods  you can have any amount of hose you want out of cannon street said mr robinson in fortyfive minutes they can be brought in at the back while you are selling them over the counter  can they said mr brown perhaps they can but nevertheless george i think ill buy a few itll be an ease to my mind  he did so but it was a suicidal act on his part one thing was quite clear even to mr jones if the firm commenced business to the extent which they contemplated it was out of the question that they should do everything on the readymoney principle that such a principle is antiquated absurd and uncommercial that it is opposed to the whole system of trade as now adopted in this metropolis has been clearly shown in the preface to these memoirs but in this instance in the case of brown jones and robinson the doing so was as impracticable as it would have been foolish if practicable credit and credit only was required but of all modes of extinguishing credit of crushing as it were the young baby in its cradle there is none equal to that of spending a little ready money and then halting in trade as in love to doubtor rather to seem to doubtis to be lost when you order goods do so as though the bank were at your back look your victim full in the face and write down your long numbers without a falter in your pen and should there seem a hesitation on his part do not affect to understand it when the articles are secured you give your bill at six months date then your credit at your bankersyour discount systemcommences that is another affair when once your bank begins that with youand the banks must do so or they may put up their shutterswhen once your bank has commenced it must carry on the game you are floated then placed well in the centre of the full stream of commerce and it must be your own fault if you do not either retire with half a million or become bankrupt with an éclat which is worth more than any capital in refitting you for a further attempt in the meantime it need hardly be said that you yourself are living on the very fat of the land  but birds of a feather should flock together and mr brown and mr robinson were not exactly of the same plumage  it was finally arranged that mr robinson should have carte blanche at his own particular line of business to the extent of fifteen hundred pounds and that mr brown should go into the warehouse and lay out a similar sum in goods both jones and mrs jones accompanied the old man and a sore time he had of it it may here be remarked that mrs jones struggled very hard to get a footing in the shop but on this point it should be acknowledged that her husband did his duty for a while  it must be you or i sarah jane said he but not both  i have no objection in life said she you can stay at home if you please  by no means he replied if you come here and your father permits it i shall go to america of course the firm will allow me for my share she tried it on very often after that and gave the firm much trouble but i dont think she got her hand into the cash drawer above once or twice during the first twelve months  the division of labour was finally arranged as follows mr brown was to order the goods to hire the young men and women look after their morality and pay them their wages to listen to any special applications when a desire might be expressed to see the firm and to do the heavy respectable parental business there was a little back room with a skylight in which he was to sit and when he was properly got up his manner of shaking his head at the young people who misbehaved themselves was not ineffective there is always danger when young men and women are employed together in the same shop and if possible this should be avoided it is not in human nature that they should not fall in love or at any rate amuse themselves with ordinary flirtations now the rule is that not a word shall be spoken that does not refer to business miss obrien where is the salmoncoloured sarsenet or mr green ill trouble you for the ladies sevens nothing is ever spoken beyond that morals morals above everything mr brown was once heard to shout from his little room when a whisper had been going round the shop as to a concerted visit to the crystal palace why a visit to the crystal palace should be immoral when talked of over the counter mr brown did not explain on that occasion  a very nice set of young women the compiler of these memoirs once remarked to a commercial gentleman in a large way who was showing him over his business and for the most part very goodlooking  yes sir yes we attend to their morals especially they generally marry from us and become the happy mothers of families  ah said i really delighted in my innocence theyve excellent opportunities for that because there are so many decent young men about  he turned on me as though i had calumniated his establishment with a libel of the vilest description if a whisper of such a thing ever reaches us sir said he quite alive with virtuous indignation if such a suspicion is ever engendered we send them packing at once the morals of our young women sir and then he finished his sentence simply by a shake of his head i tried to bring him into an argument and endeavoured to make him understand that no young woman can become a happy wife unless she first be allowed to have a lover he merely shook his head and at last stamped his foot morals sir he repeated morals above everything in such an establishment as this if we are not moral we are nothing i supposed he was right but it seemed to me to be very hard on the young men and women i could only hope that they walked home together in the evening  in the new firm in bishopsgate street mr brown of course took upon himself that branch of business and some little trouble he had because his own soninlaw and partner would make eyes to the customers  mr jones he once said before them all youll bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave you will indeed and then he put up his fat hand and gently stroked the white expanse of his bald pate but that was a very memorable occasion  such was mr browns business to mr jones was allocated the duty of seeing that the shop was duly dressed of looking after the customers including that special duty of guarding against shoplifting and of attending generally to the retail business it cannot be denied that for this sort of work he had some specialties his eye was sharp and his ear was keen and his feelings were blunt in a certain way he was goodlooking and he knew how to hand a chair with a bow and smile which went far with the wives and daughters of the east end little tradesmenand he was active enough at his work he was usually to be seen standing in the front of the shop about six yards within the door rubbing his hands together or arranging his locks or twiddling with his brass watchchain nothing disconcerted him unless his wife walked into the place and then to the great delight of the young men and women he was unable to conceal his misery by them he was hatedas was perhaps necessary in his position he was a tyrant who liked to feel at every moment the relish of his power to the poor girls he was cruel treating them as though they were dirt beneath his feet for mr jones though he affected the reputation of an admirer of the fair sex never forgot himself by being even civil to a female who was his paid servant womans smile had a charm for him but no charm equal to the servility of dependence  but on the shoulders of mr robinson fell the great burden of the business there was a question as to the accounts these however he undertook to keep in his leisure moments thinking but little of the task but the work of his life was to be the advertising department he was to draw up the posters he was to write those little books which printed on magentacoloured paper were to be thrown with reckless prodigality into every vehicle in the town he was to arrange new methods of alluring the public into that emporium of fashion it was for him to make a credulous multitude believe that at that shop number nine times nine in bishopsgate street goods of all sorts were to be purchased at prices considerably less than the original cost of their manufacture this he undertook to do this for a time he did do this for years to come he would have done had he not experienced an interference in his own department by which the whole firm was ultimately ruined and sent adrift  the great thing is to get our bills into the hands of the public said robinson  you can get men for one and nine a day to stand still and hand em out to the passersby said mr brown  thats stale sir quite stale novelty in advertising is what we requiresomething new and startling  put a chimneypot on the mans head said mr brown and make it two and three  thats been tried said robinson  then put two chimneypots said mr brown beyond that his imagination did not carry him  chimneypots and lanterns on mens heads avail nothing to startle men and women to any purpose and drive them into bishopsgate street you must startle them a great deal it does not suffice to create a momentary wonder mr robinson therefore began with eight footmen in full livery with powdered hair and gold tags to their shoulders they had magentacoloured plush kneebreeches and magentacoloured silk stockings it was in may and the weather was fine and these eight excellently gotup london footmen were stationed at different points in the city each with a silken bag suspended round his shoulder by a silken cord from these bags they drew forth the advertising cards of the house and presented them to such of the passersby as appeared from their dress and physiognomy to be available for the purpose the fact has now been ascertained that men and women who have money to spend will not put out their hands to accept common bills from street advertisers in an ordinary way the money so spent is thrown away but from these men arrayed in gorgeous livery a duchess would have stayed her steps to accept a card and duchesses did stay their steps and cards from the young firm of brown jones and robinson were as the firm was credibly informed placed beneath the eyes of a very illustrious personage indeed  the nature of the card was this it was folded into three and when so folded was of the size of an ordinary playing card on the outside which bore a satin glaze with a magenta tint there was a blank space as though for an address and the compliments of the firm in the corner when opened there was a separate note inside in which the public were informed in very few words that messrs brown jones and robinson were prepared to open their house on the 15th of may intending to carry on their trade on principles of commerce perfectly new and hitherto untried the present rate of money in the city was five per cent and it would be the practice of the firm to charge five and a half per cent on every article sold by them the very quick return which this would give them would enable b j and r to realize princely fortunes and at the same time to place within the reach of the public goods of the very best description at prices much below any that had ever yet been quoted this also was printed on magentacoloured paper and nine times nine is eightyone was inserted both at the top and the bottom  on the inside of the card on the three folds were printed lists of the goods offered to the public the three headings were cloaks and shawls furs and velvets silks and satins and in a small note at the bottom it was stated that the stock of hosiery handkerchiefs ribbons and gloves was sufficient to meet any demand which the metropolis could make upon the firm  when that list was first read out in conclave to the partners mr brown begged almost with tears in his eyes that it might be modified george said he we shall be exposed  i hope we shall said robinson exposition is all that we desire  eight thousand african monkey muffs oh george you must leave out the monkey muffs  by no means mr brown  or bring them down to a few hundreds two hundred african monkey muffs would really be a great many  mr brown said robinson on that occasionand it may be doubted whether he ever again spoke to the senior partner of his firm in terms so imperious and decisive mr brown to you has been allotted your share in our work and when you insisted on throwing away our ready money on those cheap manchester prints i never said a word it lay in your department to do so the composition of this card lies in mine and i mean to exercise my own judgment and then he went on eight thousand real african monkey muffs six thousand ditto ditto ditto very superior with long fine hair mr brown merely groaned but he said nothing further  couldnt you say that they are such as are worn by the princess alice suggested jones  no i could not answered robinson you may tell them that in the shop if you please that will lie in your department  in this way was the first card of the firm drawn out and in the space of a fortnight nineteen thousand of them were disseminated through the metropolis when it is declared that each of those cards cost b j and r threepence three farthings some idea may be formed of the style in which they commenced their operations     chapter vi  it is our opening day   and now the day had arrived on which the firm was to try the result of their efforts it is believed that the 15th of may in that year will not easily be forgotten in the neighbourhood of bishopsgate street it was on this day that the experiment of the men in armour was first tried and the four cavaliers all mounted and polished as bright as brass were stationed in the front of the house by nine oclock there they remained till the doors and shop windows were opened which ceremony actually took place at twelve it had been stated to the town on the preceding day by a man dressed as fame with a long horn who had been driven about in a gilt car that this would be done at ten but peeping through the iron shutters at that hour the gentlemen of the firm saw that the crowd was as yet by no means great so a huge poster was put up outside each window      postponed till eleven    immense pressure of goods in the back premises   at eleven this was done again but at twelve the house was really opened at that time the car with fame and the long horn was stationed in front of the men in armour and there really was a considerable concourse of people  this wont do mr brown a policeman had said the people are half across the street  success success shouted mr robinson from the first landing on the stairs he was busy correcting the proofs of their second set of notices to the public  shall we open george whispered mr brown who was rather flurried  yes you may as well begin said he it must be done sooner or later and then he retired quietly to his work he had allowed himself to be elated for one moment at the interference of the police but after that he remained above absorbed in his work or if not so absorbed disdaining to mix with the crowd below for there in the centre of the shop leaning on the arm of mr william brisket stood maryanne brown  as regards grouping there was certainly some propriety in the arrangements made for receiving the public when the iron shutters were wound up the young men of the establishment stood in a row behind one of the counters and the young women behind the other they were very nicely got up for the occasion the girls were all decorated with magentacoloured ribbons and the young men with magenta neckties mr jones had been very anxious to charge them for these articles in their wages but mr browns good feeling had prevented this no jones no the master always finds the livery there had been something in the words master and livery which had tickled the ears of his soninlaw and so the matter had been allowed to pass by  in the centre of the shop stood mr brown very nicely dressed in a new suit of black that bald head of his and the way he had of rubbing his hands together were not illcalculated to create respect but on such occasions it was always necessary to induce him to hold his tongue mr brown never spoke effectively unless he had been first moved almost to tears it was now his special business to smile and he did smile on his right hand stood his partner and soninlaw jones mounted quite irrespectively of expense his waistcoat and cravat may be said to have been gorgeous and from his silky locks there came distilled a mixed odour of musk and patchouli about his neck also the colours of the house were displayed and in his hand he waved a magenta handkerchief his wife was leaning on his arm and on such an occasion as this even robinson had consented to her presence she was dressed from head to foot in magenta she wore a magenta bonnet and magenta stockings and it was said of her that she was very careful to allow the latter article to be seen the only beauty of which sarah jane could boast rested in her feet and ankles  but on the other side of mr brown stood a pair for whose presence there george robinson had not expressed his approbation and as to one of whom it may be said that better taste would have been shown on all sides had he not thus intruded himself mr brisket had none of the rights of proprietorship in that house nor would it be possible that he should have as long as the name of the firm contained within itself that of mr robinson had brown jones and brisket agreed to open shop together it would have been well for brisket to stand there with that magenta shawl round his neck and waving that magenta towel in his hand but as it was what business had he there  what business has he there ah tell me that what business has he there said robinson to himself as he sat moodily in the small back room upstairs ah tell me that what business has he here did not the old man promise that she should be mine is it for him that i have done all for him that i have collected the eager crowd of purchasers that throng the hall of commerce below which my taste has decorated or for her have i done this for herthe false one but what recks it she shall live to know that had she been constant to me she might have satalmost upon a throne and then he rushed again to his work and with eager pen struck off those wellknown lines about the house which some short time after ravished the ears of the metropolis  in a following chapter of these memoirs it will be necessary to go back for a while to the domestic life of some of the persons concerned and the fact of mr briskets presence at the opening of the house will then be explained in the meantime the gentle reader is entreated to take it for granted that mr william brisket was actually there standing on the left hand of mr brown waving high above his head a huge magenta cotton handkerchief and that on his other arm was hanging maryanne brown leaning quite as closely upon him as her sister did upon the support which was her own for one moment george robinson allowed himself to look down upon the scene and he plainly saw that clutch of the hand upon the sleeve big as he is said robinson to himself pistols would make us equal but the huge ox has no sense of chivalry  it was unfortunate for the future intrinsic comfort of the firm that that member of it who was certainly not the least enterprising should have found himself unable to join in the ceremony of opening the house but nevertheless it must be admitted that that ceremony was imposing maryanne brown was looking her best and dressed as she was in the correctest taste of the day wearing of course the colours of the house it was not unnatural that all eyes should be turned on her what a big man that robinson is some one in the crowd was heard to observe yes that huge lump of human clay that called itself william brisket the butcher of aldersgate street was actually taken on that occasion for the soul and life and salt of an advertising house of mr william brisket it may here be said that he had no other idea of trade than that of selling at so much per pound the beef which he had slaughtered with his own hands  but that ceremony was imposing ladies and gentlemen said those five there assembledspeaking as it were with one voicewe bid you welcome to magenta house nine times nine is eightyone never forget that robinson had planned the words but he was not there to assist at their utterance ladies and gentlemen again we bid you welcome to magenta house and then they retired backwards down the shop allowing the crowd to press forward and all packed themselves for awhile into mr browns little room at the back  it was smart said mr brisket  and went off uncommon well said jones shaking the scent from his head all the better too because that chap wasnt here  hes a clever fellow said brisket  and you shouldnt speak against him behind his back jones who did it all and who couldnt have done it if he hadnt been here when these words were afterwards told to george robinson he forgave mr brown a great deal  the architect acting under the direction of mr robinson had contrived to arch the roof supporting it on five semicircular iron girders which were left there visible to the eye and which were of course painted magenta on the foremost of these was displayed the name of the firmbrown jones and robinson on the second the name of the housemagenta house on the third the numbernine times nine is eighty one on the fourth an edict of trade against which retail houses in the haberdashery line should never sinterms ready cash and on the last the special principle of our tradefiveandahalf per cent profit the back of the shop was closed in with magenta curtains through which the bald head of mr brown would not unfrequently be seen to emerge and on each side of the curtains there stood a tall mirror reaching up to the very ceiling upon the whole the thing certainly was well done  but the contractorthe man who did the work was called the contractorthe contractor says that he will want the rest of his money in two months said mr brown whining  he would not have wanted any for the next twelve months answered robinson if you had not insisted on paying him those few hundreds  you can find fault with the bill you know said jones and delay it almost any time by threatening him with a lawyer  and then he will put a distress on us said mr brown  and after that will be very happy to take our bill at six months answered robinson and so that matter was ended for the time  those men in armour stood there the whole of that day and fame in his gilded car used his trumpet up and down bishopsgate street with such effect that the people living on each side of the street became very sick of him fame himself was well actedat 16s the dayand when the triumphal car remained still stood balanced on one leg with the other stretched out behind in a manner that riveted attention but no doubt his horn was badly chosen mr robinson insisted on a long singletubed instrument saying that it was classical but a cornet à piston would have given more pleasure  a good deal of money was taken on that day but certainly not so much as had been anticipated very many articles were asked for looked at and then not purchased but this though it occasioned grief to mr brown was really not of much moment that the thing should be talked ofif possible mentioned in the newspaperswas the object of the firm  i would give my bond for 2000l said robinson to get a leader in the jupiter  the first article demanded over the counter was a real african monkey muff very superior with long fine hair  the ships which are bringing them have not yet arrived from the coast answered jones who luckily stepped up at the moment they are expected in the docks tomorrow     chapter vii  miss brown pleads her own case and mr robinson walks on blackfriars bridge   at the time of mrs mccockerells death robinson and maryanne brown were not on comfortable terms with each other she had twitted him with being remiss in asserting his own rights in the presence of his rival and he had accused her of being fickle if not actually false  i shall be just as fickle as i please she said if it suits me ill have nine to follow me but there shant be one of the nine who wont hold up his head and look after his own  your conduct maryanne  george i wont be scolded and that you ought to know if you dont like me you are quite welcome to do the other thing and then they parted this took place after mr browns adherence to the robinson interest and while brisket was waiting passively to see if that five hundred pounds would be forthcoming  their next meeting was in the presence of mr brown and on that occasion all the three spoke out their intentions on the subject of their future family arrangements certainly with much plain language if not on every side with positive truth mr robinson was at the house in smithfield giving counsel to old mr brown as to the contest which was then being urged between him and his soninlaw at that period the two sisters conceived that their joint pecuniary interests required that they should act together and it must be acknowledged that they led poor mr brown a sad life of it he and robinson were sitting upstairs in the little back room looking out into spavinhorse yard when maryanne abruptly broke in upon them  father she said standing upright in the middle of the room before them i have come to know what it is that you mean to do  to do my dear said old mr brown  yes to do i suppose something is to be done some day we aint always to go on shillyshallying spending the money and ruining the business and living from hand to mouth as though there was no end to anything ive got myself to look to and i dont mean to go into the workhouse if i can help it  the workhouse maryanne  i said the workhouse father and i meant it if everybody had what was justly their own i shouldnt have to talk in that way but as far as i can see them sharks the lawyers will have it all now ill tell you what it is  hitherto robinson had not said a word but at this moment he thought it right to interfere maryanne he saidand in pronouncing the wellloved name he threw into it all the affection of which his voice was capablemaryanne  miss brown would be a deal properer and also much more pleasing if its all the same to you sir  how often had he whispered maryanne into her ears and the dear girl had smiled upon him to hear herself so called but he could not remind her of this at the present moment i have your fathers sanction said he  my father is nothing to menot with reference to what young man i let myself be called maryanne by and going on as he is going on i dont suppose that hell long be much to me in any way  oh maryanne sobbed the unhappy parent  thats all very well sir but it wont keep the kettle aboiling  as long as i have a bit to eat of maryanne and a cup to drink of you shall have the half  and what am i to do when you wont have neither a bit nor a cup thats what youre coming to father we can all see that whats the use of all them lawyers  thats joness doing said robinson  no it isnt joness doing and of course jones must look after himself im not partial to jones everybody knows that when sarah jane disgraced herself and went off with him i never said a word in her favour it wasnt i who brought a viper into the house and warmed it in my bosom it was at this moment that jones was behaving with the most barefaced effrontery as well as the utmost cruelty towards the old man and maryannes words cut her father to the very soul jones might have been anywhere for me she continued but there he is downstairs and sarah jane is with him of course they are looking for their own  and what is it you want maryanne  well ill tell you what i want my dear sainted mothers last wish was thati should become mrs brisket  and do you mean to say said robinsondo you mean to say that that is now your wish and he looked at her till the audacity even of her eyes sank beneath the earnestness of his own but though for the moment he quelled her eye nothing could quell her voice  i mean to say said she speaking loudly and with her arms akimbo that william brisket is a very respectable young man with a tradethat hes got a decent house for a young woman to live in and a decent table for her to sit at and hes always been brought up decent having been a regular prentice to his uncle and all that sort of thing hes never been wandering about like a vagrant getting his money nobody knows how william briskets as well known in aldersgate street as the post office and moreover she added after a pause speaking these last words in a somewhat milder breathand moreover it was my sainted mothers wish  then go to him said robinson rising suddenly and stretching out his arm against her go to him and perform yoursainted mothers wish go to thebutcher revel in his shambles and grow fat and sleek in his slaughterhouse from this moment george robinson will fight the world alone brisket indeed if it be accounted manliness to have killed hecatombs of oxen let him be called manly  he would have pretty nigh killed you young man on one occasion if you hadnt made yourself scarce  by heavens exclaimed robinson if hell come forth ill fight him tomorrowwith cleavers if he will  george george dont say that exclaimed mr brown let dogs delight to bark and bite  you neednt be afraid said maryanne he doesnt mean fighting and she pointed to robinson william would about eat him you know if they were to come together  heaven forbid said mr brown  but what i want to know is this continued the maiden how is it to be about that five hundred pounds which my mother left me  but my dear your mother had not five hundred pounds to leave  nor did she make any will if she had said robinson  now dont put in your oar for i wont have it said the lady and youd show a deal more correct feeling if you wasnt so much about the house just at present my darling mammaand then she put her handkerchief up to her eyesalways told william that when he and i became one there should be five hundred pounds downand of course he expects it now sir you often talk about your love for your children  i do love them so i do what else have i  nows the time to prove it let me have that sum of five hundred pounds and i will always take your part against the joneses five hundred pounds isnt so muchand surely i have a right to some share and you may be sure of this when were settled brisket is not the man to come back to you for more as some would do and then she gave another look at robinson  i havent got the money have i george said the father  that question i cannot answer replied robinson nor can i say how far it might be prudent in you to debar yourself from all further progress in commerce if you have got it but this i can say do not let any consideration for me prevent you from giving a dowry with your daughter to mr brisket if she loves him  oh its all bother about love said she men and women must eat and they must have something to give their children when they come  but if i havent got it my dear  thats nonsense father where has the money gone to whatever you do speak the truth if you choose to say you wont  well then i wont said he roused suddenly to anger i never made brisket any promise  but mother did she as is now gone and far away and it was her moneyso it was  it wasnt her moneyit was mine said mr brown  and thats all the answer im to get very well then i shall know where to look for my rights and as for that fellow there i didnt think it of him that hed be so mean i knew he was a coward always  i am neither mean nor a coward said robinson jumping up and speaking with a voice that was audible right across spavinhorse yard and into the tap of the man of mischief publichouse opposite as for meanness if i had the money i would pour it out into your lap though i knew that it was to be converted into beef and mutton for the benefit of a hated rival and as for cowardice i repel the charge and drive it back into the teeth of him who doubtless made it i am no coward  you ran away when he bid you  yes because he is big and strong and had i remained he would have knocked me about and made me ridiculous in the eyes of the spectators but i am no coward if you wish it i am ready to fight him  oh dear no it can be nothing to me  he will make me one mash of gore said robinson still holding out his hand but if you wish it i care nothing for that his brute strength will of course prevail but i am indifferent as to that if it would do you a pleasure  pleasure to me nothing of the kind i can assure you  maryanne if i might have my wish it should be this let us both sit down with our cigars lighteday and with tapers in our handson an open barrel of gunpowder then let him who will sit there longest receive this fair hand as his prize and as he finished he leaned over her and took up her hand in his  laws robinson she said but she did not on the moment withdraw her hand and if you were both blew up whatd i do then  i wont hear of such an arrangement said mr brown it would be very wicked if theres another word spoke about it ill go to the police at once  on that occasion mr brown was quite determined about the money and as we heard afterwards mr brisket expressed himself as equally resolute of course i expect to see my way said he i cant do anything of that sort without seeing my way when that overture about the gunpowder was repeated to him he is reported to have become very red either with gloves or without or with the sticks im ready for him said he but as for sitting on a barrel of gunpowder its a thing as nobody wouldnt do unless they was in bedlam  when that interview was over robinson walked forth by himself into the evening air along giltspur street down the old bailey and so on by bridge street to the middle of blackfriars bridge and as he walked he strove manfully to get the better of the passion which was devouring the strength of his blood and the marrow of his bones  if she be not fair for me he sang to himself what care i how fair she be but he did care he could not master that passion she had been vile to him unfeminine untrue coarsely abusive she had shown herself to be mercenary incapable of true love a scold fickle and cruel but yet he loved her there was a gallant feeling at his heart that no misfortune could conquer himbut one that misfortune had fallen upon himand he was conquered  why is it he said as he looked down into the turbid streamwhy is it that bloodshed physical strife and brute power are dear to them all any fool can have personal bravery tis but a sign of folly to know no fear grant that a man has no imagination and he cannot fear but when a man does fear and yet is brave then for awhile he stopped himself would that i had gone at his throat like a dog he continued still in his soliloquy would that i had could i have torn out his tongue and laid it as a trophy at her feet then she would have loved me after that he wandered slowly home and went to bed     chapter viii  mr brisket thinks he sees his way and mr robinson again walks on blackfriars bridge   for some halfhour on that night as robinson had slowly walked backwards and forwards across the bridge ideas of suicide had flitted across his mind should he not put an end to all thisto all this and so much else that harassed him and made life weary tis a consummation devoutly to be wished he said as he looked down into the dark river and then he repeated a good deal more expressing his desire to sleep but acknowledging that his dreams in that strange bed might be the rub and thus calamity must still live on he said as he went home to his lodgings  then came those arrangements as to the partnership and the house in bishopsgate street which have already been narrated during the weeks which produced these results he frequently saw maryanne in smithfield but never spoke to her except on the ordinary topics of the day in his demeanour he was courteous to her but he never once addressed her except as miss brown and always with a politeness which was as cold as it was studied on one or two occasions he thought that he observed in her manner something that showed a wish for reconciliation but still he said nothing to her she has treated me like a dog he said to himself and yet i love her if i tell her so she will treat me worse than a dog then he heard also that brisket had declared more than once that he could not see his way i could see mine he said as though a star guided me if she should but stretch forth her hand to me and ask me to forgive her  it was some week or two after the deed of partnership had been signed and when the house at no 81 had been just taken that miss twizzle came to robinson he was at the moment engaged in composition for an illustrious house in the minories that shall be nameless but he immediately gave his attention to miss twizzle though at the moment he was combating the difficulties of a rhyme which it had been his duty to repeat nineteen times in the same poem i think that will do said he as he wrote it down and yet its lamevery lame      but no lady ever loses    by going to the shop of   and then miss twizzle entered  i see you are engaged said she and perhaps i had better call another time  by no means miss twizzle pray be seated how is everything going on at the hall of harmony  i havent been there mr robinson since that night as mr brisket did behave so bad i got such a turn that night as i cant endure the sight of the room ever since if youll believe me i cant  it was not a pleasant occurrence said robinson i felt it very keenly a mans motives are so vilely misconstrued miss twizzle i have been accused ofofcowardice  not by me mr robinson i did say you should have stuck up a bit but i didnt mean anything like that  well its over now when are they to be married miss twizzle  now mr robinson dont you talk like that you wouldnt take it all calm that way if you thought she was going to have him  i mean to take it very calm for the future  but i suppose youre not going to give her up it wouldnt be like you that wouldnt  she has spurned me miss twizzle and after that  oh spurn thats all my eye of course she has theres a little of that always you knowjust for the fun of the thing the course of love shouldnt run too smooth i wouldnt give a straw for a young man if he wouldnt let me spurn him sometimes  but you wouldnt call him aa  a what a coward is it indeed but i would or anything else that came uppermost laws whats the good of keeping company if you aint to say just what comes uppermost at the moment twas but the other day i called my young man a raskil  it was in sport no doubt  i was that angry at the time i could have tore him limb from limb i was indeed but he says polly says he if im a heraskil youre a sheraskil so that neednt make any difference between us and no more it didnt he gets his salary rose in january and then we shall be married  i wish you all the happiness that married life can bestow said robinson  thats very prettily said and i wish the same to you only you mustnt be so down like theres maryanne she says you havent a word for her now  shell find as many words as she likes in aldersgate street no doubt  now robinson if youre going to go on like that you are not the man i always took you for you didnt suppose that a girl like maryanne isnt to have her bit of fun as long as it lasts them as is as steady as old horses before marriage usually has their colts fling after marriage maryannes principles is good and thats everythingaint it  i impute nothing to miss brown except that she is false and mercenary and cruel  exactly just a sheraskil as tom called me i was mercenary and all the rest of it but laws whats that between friends the long and short of it is this is barkis willing if barkis is willing then a certain gentleman as we know in the meat trade may suit himself elsewhere come answer that is barkis willing  for a minute or two robinson sat silent thinking of the indignities he had endured that he loved the girlloved her warmly with all his heartwas only too true yes he loved her too well had his affection been of a colder nature he would have been able to stand off for awhile and thus have taught the lady a lesson which might have been of service but in his present mood the temptation was too great for him and he could not resist it barkis is willing said he and thus at the first overture he forgave her all the injury she had done him a man never should forgive a woman unless he has her absolutely in his power when he does so and thus wipes out all old scores he merely enables her to begin again  but robinson had said the word and miss twizzle was not the woman to allow him to go back from it thats well said she and now ill tell you what tom and i are going to drink tea in smithfield with old brown you know youll come too and then when old brown goes to sleep you and maryanne will make it up of course she had her way and robinson though he repented himself of what he was doing before she was out of the room promised to be there  and he was there when he entered mr browns sittingroom he found maryanne and miss twizzle but miss twizzles future lord had not yet come he did not wait for mr brown to go to sleep but at once declared the purpose of his visit  shall i say maryanne said he putting out his hand or is it to be miss brown  well im sure said she theres a question if miss brown will do for you sir it will do uncommon well for me  call her maryanne and have done with it said miss twizzle i hate all such nonsense like poison  george said the old man take her and may a fathers blessing go along with her we are partners in the haberdashery business and now we shall be partners in everything then he rose up as though he were going to join their hands  oh father i know a trick worth two of that said maryanne thats not the way we manage these things nowadays is it polly  i dont know any better way said polly when barkis is willing  maryanne said robinson let bygones be bygones  with all my heart said she all of them if you like  no not quite all maryanne those moments in which i first declared what i felt for you can never be bygones for me i have never faltered in my love and now if you choose to accept my hand in the presence of your father there it is  god bless you my boy god bless you said mr brown  come maryanne said miss twizzle he has spoke out now quite manly and you should give him an answer  but he is so imperious polly if he only sees me speaking to another in the way of civilityas of course i musthes up with his grand ways and im put in such a trembling that i dont know how to open my mouth  of course every one will know how the affair ended on that evening the quarrels of lovers have ever been the renewal of love miss brown did accept mr robinsons vows mr brown did go to sleep tom whose salary was about to be raised to the matrimonial point did arrive and the evening was passed in bliss and harmony  then again for a week or two did george robinson walk upon roses it could not now be thrown in his teeth that some other suitor was an established tradesman for such also was his proud position he was one of that firm whose name was already being discussed in the commercial world and could feel that the path to glory was open beneath his feet it was during these days that those original ideas as to the name and colour of the house and as to its architectural ornamentation came from his brain and that he penned many of those advertisements which afterwards made his reputation so great it was then that he so plainly declared his resolve to have his own way in his own department and startled his partners by the firmness of his purpose it need hardly be said that gratified love was the source from whence he drew his inspiration  and now let us name the day said robinson as soon as that other daythe opening day for magenta househad been settled all nature would then be smiling it would be the merry month of may and robinson suggested that after the toil of the first fortnight of the opening a days holiday for matrimonial purposes might well be accorded to him well go to the bowers of richmond maryanne said he  god bless you my children said mr brown and as for the holiday jones shall see the shutters down and i will see them up again  what said maryanne this next first of june as ever is ill do no such thing  why not my own one  i never heard the like where am i to get my things and you will have no house taken or anything if you think im going into lodgings like sarah jane youre mistook i dont marry unless i have things comfortable about mefurniture and all that while you were in your tantrums george i once went to see william briskets house   william brisket said robinson perhaps he was wrong in using such a phrase but it must be confessed that he was sorely tried who but a harpy would have alluded to the comforts of a rivals domestic establishment at such a moment as that maryanne brown was a harpy and is a harpy to this day  there father said she look at that just listen to him you wouldnt believe me before whats a young woman to look for with a man as can go on like thatcursing and swearing before ones facequite awful  he was aggravated maryanne said the old man  yes and hell always be being aggravated if he thinks as i aint going to speak civil of them as has always spoke civil to me hes in the wrong of it william brisket never went about cursing at me in that way  i didnt curse at you maryanne  if william brisket had anything to say of a rival he said it out honest maryanne said he to me once if that young man comes after you any more ill polish his head off his shoulders now that was speaking manly and if you could behave like that youd get yourself respected but as for them rampagious billingsgate ways before a lady i for one havent been used to it and i wont put up with it and so she bounced out of the room  you shouldnt have swore at her george said mr brown  swear at her said robinson putting his hand up to his head as though he found it almost impossible to collect his scattered thoughts but it doesnt matter the world may swear at her for me now and the world will swear at her so saying he left the house went hastily down snow hill and again walked moodily on the bridge of blackfriars tis a consummation devoutly to be wished said he devoutlydevoutly and when they take me upup to her would it be loving or would it be loathinga nasty cold moist unpleasant body he went on ah me it would be loathing he hadnt a father he hadnt a mother he hadnt a sister he hadnt a brotherbut he had a dearer one still and a nearer one yet than all otherto be or not to be that is the questionhe must in ground unsanctified be lodged till the last trumpet ah theres the rub but for that who would these fardels bear then he made up his mind that the fardels must still be borne and again went home to his lodgings  this had occurred some little time before the opening of the house and on the next morning george robinson was at his work as harday harderthan ever he had pledged himself to the firm and was aware that it would ill become him to allow private sorrows to interfere with public duties on that morrow he was more enterprising than ever and it was then that he originated the idea of the four men in armour and of fame with her classical horn and gilded car  shell come round again george said mr brown and then take her at the hop  shell hop no more for me said george robinson sternly but on this matter he was weak as water and this woman was able to turn him round her little finger  on the fourteenth of may the day previous to the opening of the house robinson was seated upstairs alone still at work on some of his large posters there was no sound to be heard but the hammers of the workmen below and the smell of the magenta paint as it dried was strong in his nostrils it was then that one of the workmen came up to him saying that there was a gentleman below who wished to see him at this period robinson was anxious to be called on by commercial gentlemen and at once sent down civil word begging that the gentleman would walk up with heavy step the gentleman did walk up and william brisket was shown into the room  sir said george robinson as soon as he saw him i did not expect this honour from you and then he bethought himself of his desire to tear out the monsters tongue and began to consider whether he might do it now  i dont know much about honour said brisket but it seems to me an understandins wanted twixt you and i  there can be none such said robinson  oh but there must  it is not within the compass of things you sir cannot understand meyour intellectual vision is too limited and ii will not understand you  wont you by jingo then your vision shall be limited as far as two uncommon black eyes can limit it but come robinson if you dont want to quarrel i dont  as for quarrelling said robinson it is the work of children come brisket will you jump with me into yonder river the first that reaches the further side let him have her and he pointed up bishopsgate street towards the thames  perhaps you can swim said brisket  not a stroke said robinson  then what a jolly pair of fools we should be  ahhhh thats the way to try a mans metal  if you talk to me about metal young man ill drop into you youve been asending all manner of messages to me about a barrel of gunpowder and that sort of thing and its my mind that youre a little out of your own now i aint going to have anything to do with gunpowder nor yet with the river its a nasty place is the river and when i want a wash i shant go there  dreadfully staring through muddy impurity said robinson  impurity enough continued the other and i wont have anything to do with it now ill tell you what will you give me your word as a man never to have nothing more to say to maryanne brown  never again to speak to her  not except in the way of respect when shes mrs brisket  never again to clasp her hand in mine  not by no means and if you want me to remain quiet youd a deal better stow that kind of thing ill tell you what it isim beginning to see my way with old brown  et tu brute said robinson clasping his hands together  im beginning to see my way with old brown continued brisket and to tell you the truth at once i dont mean to be interfered with  hasmy partnerpromisedher hand to you  yes he has and five hundred pounds with it  and she  oh shes all right there isnt any doubt about she ive just come from she as you call her now that i see my way she and i is to be one  and wheres the money to come from mr brisket  the father ll stand the moneyin course  i dont know where hell get it then certainly not out of the capital of our business mr brisket and since you are so keen about seeing your way mr brisket i advise you to be quite sure that you do see it  thats my business young man ive never been bit yet and i dont know as im going to begin now i never moves till i see my way they as does is sure to tumble  well see your way said robinson see it as far as your natural lights will enable you to look its nothing to me  ah but i must hear you say that you renounce her  renounce her false harpy ay with all my heart  but i wont have her called out of her name  she is false  hold your tongue or ill drop into you theyre all more or less false no doubt but i wont have you say so of her and since youre so ready about the renouncing suppose you put it on paperi renounce my right to the hand and heart of maryanne brown youve got pen and ink therejust put it down  it shall not need said robinson  oh but it does need itll put an end to a world of trouble and make her see that the thing is all settled it cant be any sorrow to you because you say shes a false harpy  nevertheless i love her  so do i love her and as im beginning to see my way why of course i mean to have her we cant both marry her can we  no not both said robinson certainly not both  then you just write as i bid you said brisket  bid me sir  wellask you if that will make it easier  and what if i dont  why i shall drop into you thats all about it theres the pen ink and paper youd better do it  not at first did robinson write those fatal words by which he gave up all his right to her he loved but before that interview was ended the words were written what matters it he said at last just as brisket had actually risen from his seat to put his vile threat into execution has not she renounced me  yes said brisket she has done that certainly  had she been true to me continued robinson to do her a pleasure i would have stood up before you till you had beaten me into the likeness of one of your own carcases  thats what i should have done too  but nowwhy should i suffer now  no indeed why should you  i would thrash you if i could for the pure pleasure  no doubt no doubt  but it stands to reason that i cant god when he gave me power of mind gave you power of body  and a little common sense along with it my friend im generally able to see my way big as i look come whats the good of arguing youre quick at writing i know and theres the paper  then george robinson did write the words were as followsi renounce the hand and heart of maryanne brown i renounce them for evergeorge robinson  on the night of that day while the hammers were still ringing by gaslight in the unfinished shop while brown and jones were still busy with the goods and mrs jones was measuring out to the shopgirls yards of magenta ribbon short by an inch robinson again walked down to the bridge the bleak wind of march makes me tremble and shiver said he to himselfbut not the dark arch or the black flowing river  come young man move on said a policeman to him and he did move on  but for that man i should have done it then he whispered in his solitude as he went to bed     chapter ix  showing how mr robinson was employed on the opening day   et tu brute were the words with which mr brown was greeted at six oclock in the morning on that eventful day when at early dawn he met his young partner at magenta house he had never studied the history of cæsars death but he understood the reproach as well as any roman ever did  it was your own doing george he said when she was swore at in that way and when you went away and left her  it was she went away and left me  father said she when she came back i shall put myself under the protection of mr william brisket what was i to do then and when he came himself ten minutes afterwards what was i to say to him a father is a father george and ones children is ones children  and they are to be married  not quite at once george  no the mercenary slaughterer will reject that fair hand at last unless it comes to him weighted with a moneybag from whence are to come those five hundred pounds without which william brisket will not allow your daughter to warm herself at his hearthstone  as jones has got the partnership george maryannes husband should have something  ah yes it is i theni as one of the partners of this house who am to bestow a dowry upon her who has injured me and make happy the avarice of my rival since the mimic stage first represented the actions of humanity no such fate as that has ever been exhibited as the lot of man be it so bring hither the chequebook that hand that was base enough to renounce her shall with the same pen write the order for the money  no george no said mr brown i never meant to do that let him have itout of the profits  ha  i said in a monthif things went well of course i meantwell enough  but theyll lead you such a life as never man passed yet maryanne you know can be bitter very bitter  i must bear it george ive been abearing a long while and im partly used to it but george it isnt a pleasure to me it isnt a pleasure to a poor old father to be nagged at by his daughters from his very breakfast down to his very supper and they comes to me sometimes in bed nagging at me worse than ever  my heart has often bled for you mr brown  i know it has george and thats why ive loved you and trusted you and now you wont quarrel with me will you though i have a little thrown you over like  what was robinson to say of course he forgave him it was in his nature to forgive and he would even have forgiven maryanne at that moment had she come to him and asked him but she was asleep in her bed dreaming perchance of that big philistine whom she had chosen as her future lord a young david however might even yet arise who should smite that huge giant with a stone between the eyes  then did mr brown communicate to his partner those arrangements as to grouping which his younger daughter had suggested for the opening of the house when robinson first heard that maryanne intended to be there he declared his intention of standing by her side though he would not deign even to look her in the face she shall see that she has no power over me to make me quail he said and then he was told that brisket also would be there maryanne had begged the favour of him and he had unwillingly consented it is hard to bear said robinson very hard but it shall be borne i do not remember ever to have heard of the like  he wont come often george you may be sure  that i should have planned these glories for him well well be it so what is the pageantry to me it has been merely done to catch the butterflies and of these he is surely the largest i will sit alone above and work there with my brain for the service of the firm while you below are satisfying the eyes of the crowd  and so it had been as was told in that chapter which was devoted to the opening day of the house robinson had sat alone in the very room in which he had encountered brisket and had barely left his seat for one moment when the first rush of the public into the shop had made his heart leap within him there the braying of the horn in the street and the clatter of the armed horsemen on the pavement and the jokes of the young boys and the angry threatenings of the policemen reached his ears it is well said he the ball has been set arolling and the work that has been well begun is already half completed when once the steps of the unthinking crowd have habituated themselves to move hitherward they will continue to come with the constancy of the tide which ever rolls itself on the same strand and then he tasked himself to think how that tide should be made always to flownever to ebb they must be brought here said he ever by new allurements when once they come it is only in accordance with the laws of human nature that they should leave their money behind them upon that he prepared the words for another card in which he begged his friends the public of the city to come to magenta house as friends should come they were invited to see and not to buy the firm did not care that purchases should be made thus early in their career their great desire was that the arrangements of the establishment should be witnessed before any considerable portion of the immense stock had been moved for the purpose of retail sale and then the west end public were especially requested to inspect the furs which were being collected for the anticipated sale of the next winter it was as he wrote these words that he heard that demand for the african monkey muff and heard also mr joness discreet answer yes said he to himself before we have done ships shall come to us from all coasts real ships from tyre and sidon they shall come from ophir and tarshish from the east and from the west and from the balmy southern islands how sweet will it be to be named among the merchant princes of this great commercial nation but he felt that brown and jones would never be merchant princes and he already looked forward to the day when he would be able to emancipate himself from such thraldom  it has been already said that a considerable amount of business was done over the counter on the first day but that the sum of money taken was not as great as had been hoped that this was caused by mr browns injudicious mode of going to work there could be no doubt he had filled the shelves of the shop with cheap articles for which he had paid and had hesitated in giving orders for heavy amounts to the wholesale houses such orders had of course been given and in some cases had been given in vain but quite enough of them had been honoured to show what might have been done had there been no hesitation as a man of capital i must object he had said to mr robinson only a week before the house was opened i wish i could make you understand that you have no capital i would i could divest you of the idea and the money too said robinson but it was all of no use a domestic fowl that has passed all its days at a barndoor can never soar on the eagles wing now mr brown was the domestic fowl while the eagles pinion belonged to his youngest partner by whom in that firm the kite was personified shall not here be stated  brisket on that day soon left the shop but as maryanne brown remained there robinson did not descend among the throng there was no private door to the house and therefore he was forced to walk out between the counters when he went to his dinner on that occasion he passed close by miss brown and met that young ladys eye without quailing she looked full upon him and then turning her face round to her sister tittered with an air of scorn  i think hes been very badly used said sarah jane  and who has he got to blame but his own want of spirit said the other this was spoken in the open shop and many of the young men and women heard it robinson however merely walked on raising his hat and saluting the daughters of the senior partner but it must be acknowledged that such remarks as that greatly aggravated the misery of his position  it was on the evening of that day when he was about to leave the establishment for the night that he heard a gentle creeping step on the stairs and presently mrs jones presented herself in the room in which he was sitting now if there was any human fellowcreature on the face of this earth whom george robinson had brought himself to hate that human fellowcreature was sarah jane jones jones himself he despised but his feeling towards mrs jones was stronger than contempt to him it was odious that she should be present in the house at all and he had obtained from her father a direct promise that she should not be allowed to come behind the counters after this their opening day  george she said coming up to him i have come upstairs because i wish to have a few words with you private  will you take a chair said he placing one for her one is bound to be courteous to a lady even though that lady be a harpy  george she again beganshe had never called him george before and he felt himself sorely tempted to tell her that his name was mr robinson george ive brought myself to look upon you quite as a brotherinlaw you know  have you said he then you have done me an honour that does not belong to meand never will  now dont say that george if youll only bring yourself to show a little more spirit to maryanne all will be right yet  what was she that she should talk to him about spirit in these days there was no subject which was more painful to him than that of personal courage he was well aware that he was no coward he felt within himself an impulse that would have carried him through any danger of which the result would not have been ridiculous he could have led a forlorn hope or rescued female weakness from the fangs of devouring flames but he had declinedhe acknowledged to himself that he had declinedto be mauled by the hands of an angry butcher who was twice his size one has to keep ones own path in the world he had said to himself but nevertheless one avoids a chimneysweeper should i have gained anything had i allowed that huge monster to hammer at me so he had argued but though he had thus argued he had been angry with himself and now he could not bear to be told that he had lacked spirit  that is my affair he replied to her but those about me will find that i do not lack spirit when i find fitting occasion to use it  no im sure they wont and nows the time george youre not going to let that fellow brisket run off with maryanne from before your eyes  hes at liberty to run anywhere for me  now look here george i know youre fond of her  no i was once but ive torn her from my heart  thats nonsense george the fact is the more she gives herself airs and makes herself scarce and stiff to you the more precious you think her ignorant as the woman was of almost everything she did know something of human nature  i shall never trouble myself about her again said he  oh yes you will and make her mrs robinson before youve done now look here george that fellow brisket wont have her unless he gets the money  its nothing to me said robinson  and wheres the money to come from if not out of the house now you and jones has your rights as partners and i do hope you and he wont let the old man make off with the capital of the firm in that way if he gives brisket five hundred poundsand there isnt much more left  ill tell you what mrs joneshe may give brisket five thousand pounds as far as i am concerned whatever mr brown may do in that way i shant interfere to prevent him  you shant  its his own money and as far as george robinson is concerned  his own money and he in partnership with jones not a penny of it is his own and so ill make them understand as for you you are the softest  never mind me mrs jones  no i never will mind you again well to be sure and youd stand by and see the money given away in that way to enable the man you hate to take away the girl you love well i never they did say you was fainthearted but i never thought to see the like of that in a thing that called itself a man and so saying she took herself off                  it cannot be    but i am pigeonlivered and lack gall    to make oppression bitter   said robinson rising from his seat and slapping his forehead with his hand and then he stalked backwards and forwards through the small room driven almost to madness by the misery of his position i am not splenetic and rash he said yet have i something in me dangerous i loved ophelia forty thousand briskets could not with all their quantities of love make up my sum  at this time mr brown still lived at the house in smithfield it was intended that he should move to bishopsgate street as soon as the upper rooms could be made ready for him but the works had hitherto been confined to the shop on this the night of the opening day he intended to give a little supper to his partners and robinson having promised to join it felt himself bound to keep his word brisket will not be there he asked as he walked across finsbury square with the old man certainly not said mr brown i never thought of asking him and yet when they reached the house brisket was already seated by the fire superintending the toasting of the cheese as though he were one of the family its not my doing george indeed its not whispered mr brown as they entered the sittingroom of the family   illustration brisket makes himself useful   that supperparty was terrible to robinson but he bore it all without flinching jones and his wife were there and so also of course was maryanne her he had seen at the moment of his entry sitting by with wellpleased face while her huge lover put butter and ale into the fryingpan why sarah jane she said i declare hes quite a man cook how useful he would be about a house  oh uncommon said sarah jane and you mean to try before long dont you mr brisket  you must ask maryanne about that said he raising his great red face from the fire and putting on the airs and graces of a thriving lover  dont ask me anything said maryanne for i wont answer anything its nothing to me what he means to try  oh aint it though said brisket and then they all sat down to supper it may be imagined with what ease robinson listened to conversation such as this and with what appetite he took his seat at that table  mr robinson may i give you a little of this cheese said maryanne what a story such a question told of the heartlessness audacity and iron nerves of her who asked it what power and at the same time what cruelty there must have been within that laced bodice when she could bring herself to make such an offer  by all means said robinson with equal courage the morsel was then put upon his plate and he swallowed it i would he had poisoned it said he to himself with what delight would i then partake of the dish so that he and she partook of it with me  the misery of that supperparty will never be forgotten had brisket been adonis himself he could not have been treated with softer courtesies by those two harpies and yet not an hour ago sarah jane jones had been endeavouring to raise a conspiracy against his hopes what an ass will a man allow himself to become under such circumstances there sat the big butcher smirking and smiling ever and again dipping his unlovely lips into a steaming beaker of brandyandwater regarding himself as triumphant in the courts of venus but that false woman who sat at his side would have sold him piecemeal for money as he would have sold the carcase of a sheep  you do not drink george said mr brown  it does not need said robinson and then he took his hat and went his way  on that night he swore to himself that he would abandon her for ever and devote himself to commerce and the muses it was then that he composed the opening lines of a poem which may yet make his name famous wherever the english language is spoken      the goldeneyed son of the morning rushed down the wind       like a trumpet    his azure locks adorning with emeralds fresh from the ocean     chapter x  showing how the firm invented a new shirt   it has already been said that those four men in armour on the production of whom robinson had especially prided himself were dispensed with after the first fortnight this no doubt was brought about through the parsimony of mr brown but in doing so he was aided by a fortuitous circumstance one of the horses trampled on a child near the bank and then the police and press interfered at first the partners were very unhappy about the child for it was reported to them that the poor little fellow would die mr brown went to see it and ascertained that the mother knew how to make the most of the occurrenceand so after a day or two did the firm the jupiter daily newspaper took the matter up and lashed out vigorously at what it was pleased to call the wickedness as well as absurdity of such a system of advertising but as the little boy was not killed nor indeed seriously hurt the firm was able to make capital out of the jupiter by sending a daily bulletin from magenta house as to the state of the childs health for a week the newspapers inserted these and allowed the firm to explain that they supplied nourishing food and paid the doctors bill but at the end of the week the editor declined any further correspondence mr brown then discontinued his visits but the childs fortune had been made by gifts from a generous public and the whole thing had acted as an excellent unpaid advertisement now it is well understood by all trades that any unpaid advertisement is worth twenty that have cost money  in this way the men in armour were put down but they will be long remembered by the world of bishopsgate street that they cost money is certain whatever we do said mr brown dont lets have any more horses you see george theyre always aeating he could not understand that it was nothing though the horses had eaten gilded oats so long as there were golden returns  the men in armour however were put down as also was the car of fame one horse only was left in the service of the firm and this was an ancient creature that had for many years belonged to the butter establishment in smithfield by this animal a light but large wooden frame was dragged about painted magenta on its four sides and bearing on its various fronts different notices as to the business of the house a boy stood uncomfortably in the centre driving the slow brute by means of reins which were inserted through the apertures of two of the letters through another letter above there was a third hole for his eyes and shut up in this prison he was enjoined to keep moving throughout the day this he did at the slowest possible pace and thus he earned five shillings a week the arrangement was one made entirely by mr brown who himself struck the bargain with the boys father mr robinson was much ashamed of this affair declaring that it would be better to abstain altogether from advertising in that line than to do it in so ignoble a manner but mr brown would not give way and the magenta box was dragged about the streets till it was altogether shattered and in pieces  stockings was the article in which above all others mr brown was desirous of placing his confidence george said he all the world wears stockings but those who require african monkey muffs are in comparison few in number i know legg and loosefit of the poultry and ill purchase a stock he went to legg and loosefit and did purchase a stock absolutely laying out a hundred pounds of ready money for hosiery and getting as much more on credit stockings is an article on which considerable genius might be displayed by any house intending to do stockings and nothing else but taken up in this small way by such a firm as that of 81 bishopsgate street it was simply embarrassing now you can say something true in your advertisements said mr brown with an air of triumph when the invoice of the goods arrived  true said robinson he would not however sneer at his partner so he retreated to his own room and went to work stockings said he to himself there is no room for ambition in it but the word hose does not sound amiss and then he prepared that small book with silk magenta covers and silvery leaves which he called the new miracle      the whole world wants stockings he began not disdaining    to take his very words from mr brownand brown jones    and robinson are prepared to supply the whole world with    the stockings which they want the following is a list of    some of the goods which are at present being removed from    the river to the premises at magenta house in bishopsgate    street b j and r affix the usual trade price of the    article and the price at which they are able to offer them    to the public     one hundred and twenty baskets of ladies spanish    hoseusual price 1s 3d sold by b j and r at    9¾d   baskets said mr brown when he read the little book  its all right said robinson i have been at the trouble to learn the trade language      four hundred dozen white cotton hoseusual price 1s    0½d sold by b j and r at 7¼d     eight stack of china and pearl silk hoseusual price    3s sold by b j and r for 1s 9¾d     fifteen hundred dozen of balbrigganusual price 1s    6d sold by b j and r for 10½d   it may not perhaps be necessary to continue the whole list here but as it was read aloud to mr brown he sat aghast with astonishment george said he at last i dont like it it makes me quite afeard it does indeed  and why do you not like it said robinson quietly laying down the manuscript and putting his hand upon it does it want vigour  no it does not want vigour  does it fail to be attractive is it commonplace  it is not that i mean said mr brown but  is it not simple the articles are merely named with their prices  but george we havent got em we couldnt hold such a quantity and if we had them we should be ruined to sell them at such prices as that i did want to do a genuine trade in stockings  and so you shall sir but how will you begin unless you attract your customers  you have put your prices altogether too low said jones it stands to reason you cant sell them for the money you shouldnt have put the prices at allit hampers one dreadful you dont know what it is to stand down there among em all and tell em that the cheap things havent come  say that theyve all been sold said robinson  its just the same argued jones i declare last saturday night i didnt think my life was safe in the crowd  and who brought that crowd to the house demanded robinson who has filled the shop below with such a throng of anxious purchasers  but george said mr brown i should like to have one of these bills true if only that one might show it as a sample when the people talk to one  true said robinson again you wish that it should be true in the first place did you ever see an advertisement that contained the truth if it were as true as heaven would any one believe it was it ever supposed that any man believed an advertisement sit down and write the truth and see what it will be the statement will show itself of such a nature that you will not dare to publish it there is the paper and there the pen take them and see what you can make of it  i do think that somebody should be made to believe it said jones  you do and robinson as he spoke turned angrily at the other did you ever believe an advertisement jones in selfdefence protested that he never had and why should others be more simple than you no manno woman believes them they are not lies for it is not intended that they should obtain credit i should despise the man who attempted to base his advertisements on a system of facts as i would the builder who lays his foundation upon the sand the groundwork of advertising is romance it is poetry in its very essence is hamlet true  i really do not know said mr brown  there is no man to my thinking so false continued robinson as he who in trade professes to be true he deceives or endeavours to do so i do not no one will believe that we have fifteen hundred dozen of balbriggan  nobody will said mr brown  but yet that statement will have its effect it will produce custom and bring grist to our mill without any dishonesty on our part advertisements are profitable not because they are believed but because they are attractive once understand that and you will cease to ask for truth then he turned himself again to his work and finished his task without further interruption  you shall sell your stockings mr brown he said to the senior member of the firm about three days after that  indeed i hope so  look here sir and then he took mr brown to the window there stood eight stalwart porters divided into two parties of four each and on their shoulders they bore erect supported on painted frames an enormous pair of gilded embroidered brocaded begartered wooden stockings on the massive calves of these was set forth a statement of the usual kind declaring that brown jones and robinson of 81 bishopsgate street had just received 40000 pairs of best french silk ladies hose direct from lyons  and now look at the mens legs said robinson mr brown did look and perceived that they were dressed in magentacoloured kneebreeches with magentacoloured stockings they were gorgeous in their attire and at this moment they were starting from the door in different directions perhaps you will tell me that that is not true  i will say nothing about it for the future said mr brown  it is not true continued robinson but it is a work of fiction in which i take leave to think that elegance and originality are combined   we ought to do something special in shirts said jones a few days after this we could get a few dozen from hodges in king street and call them eureka  couldnt we have a shirt of our own said mr robinson couldnt you invent a shirt mr jones jones as robinson looked him full in the face ran his fingers through his scented hair and said that he would consult his wife before the day was over however the following notice was already in type      mankind in a state of bliss     brown jones and robinson have sincere pleasure in    presenting to the fashionable world their new katakairion    shirt in which they have thoroughly overcome the    difficulties hitherto found to be insurmountable of    adjusting the bodies of the nobility and gentry to    an article which shall be at the same time elegant    comfortable lasting and cheap     b j and rs katakairion shirt and their katakairion    shirt alone is acknowledged to unite these qualities     six shirts for 39s 9d     the katakairion shirt is specially recommended to officers    going to india and elsewhere while it is at the same time    eminently adapted for the home consumption   i think i would have considered it a little more before i committed myself said jones  ah yes you would have consulted your wife as i have not got one i must depend on my own wits  and are not likely to have one either said jones  young men young men said mr brown raising his hands impressively if as christians you cannot agree at any rate you are bound to do so as partners what is it that the psalmist says let dogs delight to bark and bite  the notice as to the katakairion shirt was printed on that day as originally drawn out by robinson and very widely circulated on the two or three following mornings a brisk demand ensued and it was found that hodges the wholesale manufacturer of king street was able to supply the firm with an article which when sold at 39s 6d left a comfortable profit  i told you that we ought to do something special in shirts said jones as though the whole merit of the transaction were his own  gloves was another article to which considerable attention was given      brown jones and robinson have made special arrangements    with the glove manufacturers of worcestershire and are    now enabled to offer to the public englishsewn worcester    gloves made of french kid at a price altogether out of    the reach of any other house in the trade     b j and r boldly defy competition   when that notice was put up in front of the house none of the firm expected that any one would believe in their arrangement with the worcestershire glovemakers they had no such hope and no such wish what gloves they sold they got from the wholesale houses in st pauls churchyard quite indifferent as to the county in which they were sewn or the kingdom from which they came nevertheless the plan answered and a trade in gloves was created  but perhaps the pretty little dialogues which were circulated about the town did more than anything else to make the house generally known to mothers and their families      mamma mamma i have seen such a beautiful sight   one of them began      my dearest daughter what was it     i was walking home through the city with my kind cousin    augustus and he took me to that wonderfully handsome and    extraordinarily large new shop just opened by those    enterprising men brown jones and robinson at no 81    bishopsgate street they call it nine times nine or    magenta house     my dearest daughter you may well call it wonderful it    is the wonder of the age brown jones and robinson sell    everything but not only thatthey sell everything good    and not only thatthey sell everything cheap whenever    your wants induce you to make purchases you may always be    sure of receiving full value for your money at the house of    brown jones and robinson   in this way by efforts such as these which were never allowed to flag for a single hourby a continued series of original composition which as regards variety and striking incidents was perhaps never surpasseda great and stirring trade was established within six months of the opening day by this time mr brown had learned to be silent on the subject of advertising and had been brought to confess more than once that the subject was beyond his comprehension  i am an old man george he said once and all this seems to be new  if it be not new it is nothing answered robinson  i dont understand it continued the old man i dont pretend to understand it i only hope that its right  the conduct which jones was disposed to pursue gave much more trouble he was willing enough to allow robinson to have his own way and to advertise in any shape or manner but he was desirous of himself doing the same thing it need hardly be pointed out here that this was a branch of trade for which he was peculiarly unsuited and that his productions would be stale inadequate and unattractive nevertheless he persevered and it was only by direct interference at the printers that the publication of documents was prevented which would have been fatal to the interests of the firm  do i meddle with you in the shop robinson would say to him  you havent the personal advantages which are required for meeting the public jones would answer  nor have you the mental advantages without which original composition is impossible  in spite of all these difficulties a considerable trade was established within six months and the shop was usually crowded as a drawback to this the bills at the printers and at the stationers had become very heavy and robinson was afraid to disclose their amount to his senior partner but nevertheless he persevered faint heart never won fair lady he repeated to himself over and over againthe fair lady for whom his heart sighed being at this time commercial success  vestigia nulla retrorsum that should be the motto of the house he failed however altogether in making it intelligible to mr brown     chapter xi  johnson of manchester   it was about eight months after the business had been opened that a circumstance took place which gave to the firm a reputation which for some few days was absolutely metropolitan the affair was at first fortuitous but advantage was very promptly taken of all that occurred no chance was allowed to pass by unimproved and there was perhaps as much genuine talent displayed in the matter as though the whole had been designed from the beginning the transaction was the more important as it once more brought mr robinson and maryanne brown together and very nearly effected a union between them it was not however written in the book that such a marriage should ever be celebrated and the renewal of love which for a time gave such pleasure to the young ladys father had no other effect than that of making them in their subsequent quarrels more bitter than ever to each other  it was about midwinter when the circumstances now about to be narrated took place mr brown had gone down to the neighbourhood of manchester for the purpose of making certain bonâ fide purchases of coloured prints and had there come to terms with a dealer at this time there was a strike among the factories and the goods became somewhat more scarce in the market and therefore a trifle dearer than was ordinarily the case from this arose the fact that the agreement made with mr brown was not kept by the lancashire house and that the firm in bishopsgate was really subjected to a certain amount of commercial illtreatment  it is a cruel shame said mr browna very cruel shame when a party in trade has undertaken a transaction with another party no consideration should hinder that party from being as good as his word a tradesmans word should be his bond this purchase down among the factories had been his own special work and he had been proud of it he was moreover a man who could ill tolerate any illusage from others cant we do anything to em george cant we make em bankrupts  if we could what good would that do us said robinson we must put up with it  id bring an action against them said jones  and spend thirty or forty pounds with the lawyers said robinson no we will not be such fools as that but we might advertise the injury  advertise the injury said mr brown with his eyes wide open by this time he had begun to understand that the depth of his partners finesse was not to be fathomed by his own unaided intelligence  and spend as much money in that as with the lawyers said jones  probably more said robinson very calmly we promised the public in our last weeks circular that we should have these goods  of course we did said mr brown and now the public will be deceived and he lifted up his hands in horror at the thought  well advertise it said robinson again and then for some short space he sat with his head resting on his hands yes well advertise it leave me for awhile that i may compose the notices  mr brown after gazing at him for a moment with a countenance on which wonder and admiration were strongly written touched his other partner on the arm and led him from the room  the following day was saturday which at magenta house was always the busiest day of the week at about four oclock in the afternoon the shop would become thronged and from that hour up to ten at night nearly as much money was taken as during all the week besides on that saturday at about noon the following words were to be read at each of the large sheets of glass in the front of the house they were printed of course on magenta paper and the corners and margins were tastefully decorated      brown jones and robinson having been greatly deceived by    johnson of manchester are not able to submit to the public    the 40000 new specimens of english prints as they had    engaged to do on this day but they beg to assure their    customers and the public in general that they will shortly    do so however tremendous may be the sacrifice   but it was staleybridge said mr brown and the mans name was pawkins  and you would have me put up pawkins of staleybridge and thus render the firm liable to an indictment for libel are not pawkins and johnson all the same to the public  but there is sure to be some johnson at manchester  there are probably ten and therefore no man can say that he is meant i ascertained that there were three before i ventured on the name  on that afternoon some trifling sensation was created in bishopsgate street and a few loungers were always on the pavement reading the notice robinson went out from time to time and heard men as they passed talking of johnson of manchester it will do said he you will see that it will do by seven oclock on next saturday evening i will have the shop so crowded that women who are in shall be unable to get out again  that notice remained up on saturday evening and till twelve on monday at which hour it was replaced by the following      johnson of manchester has proved himself utterly unable to    meet his engagement the public of the metropolis however    may feel quite confident that brown jones and robinson    will not allow any provincial manufacturer to practise such    dishonesty on the city with impunity   the concourse of persons outside then became much greater and an audible hum of voices not unfrequently reached the ears of those within during this trying week mr jones it must be acknowledged did not play his part badly it had come home to him in some manner that this peculiar period was of vital importance to the house and on each day he came down to business dressed in his very best it was pleasant to see him as he stood at the door shining with bears grease loaded with gilt chains glittering with rings with the lappets of his coat thrown back so as to show his frilled shirt and satin waistcoat there he stood rubbing his hands and looking out upon the people as though he scorned to notice them as regards intellect mind apprehension there was nothing to be found in the personal appearance of jones but he certainly possessed an amount of animal good looks which had its weight with weakminded females  the second notice was considered sufficient to attract notice on monday and tuesday on the latter day it became manifest that the conduct of johnson of manchester had grown to be matter of public interest and the firm was aware that persons from a distance were congregating in bishopsgate street in order that they might see with their own eyes the notices at magenta house  early on the wednesday the third of the series appeared it was very short and ran as follows      johnson of manchester is off     the police are on his track   this exciting piece of news was greedily welcomed by the walking public and a real crowd had congregated on the pavement by noon a little after that time while mr brown was still at dinner with his daughter upstairs a policeman called and begged to see some member of the firm jones whose timidity was overwhelming immediately sent for mr brown and he also embarrassed knocked at the door of mr robinsons little room and asked for counsel  the peelers are here george he said i knew thered be a row  i hope so said robinson i most sincerely hope so  as he stood up to answer his senior partner he saw that miss brown was standing behind her father and he resolved that as regarded this occasion he would not be taunted with want of spirit  but what shall i say to the man asked mr brown  give him a shilling and a glass of spirits beg him to keep the people quiet outside and promise him cold beef and beer at three oclock if he runs rusty send for me and then having thus instructed the head of the house he again seated himself before his writing materials at the table  mr robinson said a soft voice speaking to him through the doorway as soon as the ponderous step of the old man was heard descending the stairs  yes i am here said he  i dont know whether i may open the door said she for i would not for worlds intrude upon your studies  he knew that she was a harpy he knew that her soft words would only bring him to new grief but yet he could not help himself strong in so much else he was utterly weak in her hands she was a harpy who would claw out his heart and feed upon it without one tender feeling of her own he had learned to read her character and to know her for what she was but yet he could not help himself  there will be no intrusion he said in half an hour from this time i go with this copy to the printers till then i am at rest  at rest said she how sweet it must be to rest after labours such as yours though you and i are two mr robinson who was once one still i hear of you andsometimes think of you  i am surprised that you should turn your thoughts to anything so insignificant he replied  ah that is so like you you are so scornful and so proudand never so proud as when pretending to be humble i sometimes think that it is better that you and i are two because you are so proud what could a poor girl like me have done to satisfy you  false and cruel that she was tis thus that the basilisk charms the poor bird that falls a victim into its jaws  it is better that we should have parted said he though i still love you with my whole heart i know that it is better  oh mr robinson  and i would that your nuptials with that man in aldersgate street were already celebrated  oh you cruel heartless man  for then i should be able to rest if you were once anothers i should then know  you would know what mr robinson  that you could never be mine maryanne  sir  if you would not have me disgrace myself for ever by my folly leave me now  disgrace yourself im sure youll never do that whatever happens george robinson will always act the gentleman i have said of you times after times both to father and to william brisket so he will father has answered and then william brisket has said i dont know whether i ought to tell you what he said but what he said was thisif youre so fond of the fellow why dont you have him  all this was false and robinson knew that it was false no such conversation had ever passed nevertheless the pulses of his heart were stirred  tell me this said he are you his promised wife  laws mr robinson  answer me honestly if you can is that man to be your husband if it be so it will be well for him and well for you but above all it will be well for me that we should part and if it be so why have you come hither to torment me  to torment you george  yes to torment me and then he rose suddenly from his feet and advanced with rapid step and fierce gesture towards the astonished girl think you that love such as mine is no torment think you that i have no heart no feeling that this passion which tears me in pieces can exist without throwing a cloud upon my life with you as i know too well all is calm and tranquil your bosom boils with no ferment it has never boiled it will never boil it can never boil it is better for you so you will marry that man whose house is good and whose furniture has been paid for from his shop will come to you your daily mealsand you will be happy man wants but little here below nor wants that little long adieu  oh george are you going so  yes i am going why should i stay did i not with my own hand in this room renounce you  yes you did george you did renounce me and thats whats killing me so it iskilling me then she threw herself into a chair and buried her face in her handkerchief  would that we could all die he said and that everything should end but now i go to the printers adieu maryanne  but we shall see each other occasionallyas friends  to what purpose no certainly not as friends to me such a trial would be beyond my strength and then he seized the copy from the table and taking his hat from the peg he hurried out of the room  as william is so stiff about the money i dont know whether it wouldnt be best after all said she as she took herself back to her fathers apartments  mr brown when he met the policeman found that that excellent officer was open to reason and that when properly addressed he did not actually insist on the withdrawal of the notice from the window every mans house is his castle you know said mr brown to this the policeman demurred suggesting that the law quoted did not refer to crowded thoroughfares but when invited to a collation at three oclock he remarked that he might as well abstain from action till that hour and that he would in the meantime confine his beat to the close vicinity of magenta house a friendly arrangement grew out of this which for awhile was convenient to both parties and two policemen remained in the front of the house and occasionally entered the premises in search of refreshment  after breakfast on the thursday the fourth notice was put up      the public of london will be glad to learn that brown    jones and robinson have recovered the greatest part    of their paper which was in the hands of johnson of    manchester bills to the amount of fifteen thousand    pounds are however still missing   it was immediately after this that the second policeman was considered to be essentially necessary the whole house including the young men and women of the shop were animated with an enthusiasm which spread itself even to the light porter of the establishment the conduct of johnson and his probable fate were discussed aloud among those who believed in him while they who were incredulous communicated their want of faith to each other in whispers mr brown was smiling affable and happy and jones arrived on the friday morning with a new set of torquoise studs in his shirt why men and women should have come to the house for gloves stockings and ribbons because johnson of manchester was said to have run away it may be difficult to explain but such undoubtedly was the fact and the sales during that week were so great as to make it seem that actual commercial prosperity was at hand  if we could only keep up the ball said robinson  couldnt we change it to tomkins of leeds next week suggested jones  i rather fear that the joke might be thought stale replied robinson with a goodnatured smile there is nothing so fickle as the taste of the public the most popular author of the day can never count on favour for the next six months and he bethought himself that great as he was at the present moment he also might be eclipsed and perhaps forgotten before the posters which he was then preparing had been torn down or become soiled  on the friday no less than four letters appeared in the daily jupiter all dated from manchester all signed by men of the name of johnson and all denying that the writer of that special letter had had any dealings whatever with brown jones and robinson of bishopsgate street london there was johnson brothers johnson and co alfred johnson and son and johnson and johnson and in one of those letters a suggestion was made that b j and r of london should state plainly who was the special johnson that had gone off with the paper belonging to their house  i know we shall be detected said mr brown upon whose feelings these letters did not act favourably  there is nothing to detect said robinson but i will write a letter to the editor  this he did stating that for reasons which must be quite obvious to the commercial reading public it would be very unwise in the present state of affairs to give any detailed description of that mr johnson who had been named but that b j and r were very happy to be able to certify that that mr johnson who had failed in his engagements to them was connected neither with johnson brothers or johnson and co nor with alfred johnson and son or johnson and johnson this also acted as an advertisement and no doubt brought grist to the mill  on the evening of that same friday a small note in a scented envelope was found by robinson on his table when he returned upstairs from the shop well did he know the handwriting and often in earlier days had he opened such notes with mixed feelings of joy and triumph all those past letters had been kept by him and were now lying under lock and key in his desk tied together with green silk ready to be returned when the absolute fact of that other marriage should have become a certainty he half made up his mind to return the present missive unopened he knew that good could not arise from a renewed correspondence nevertheless he tore asunder the envelope and the words which met his eye were as follows      miss browns compliments to mr robinson and will mr    robinson tea with us in papas room on saturday at six    oclock there will be nobody else but mr and mrs    poppins that used to be miss twizzle papa perhaps will    have to go back to the shop when hes done tea miss brown    hopes mr robinson will remember old days and not make    himself scornful   scornful said he ha ha yes i scorn heri do scorn her but still i love her then he sat down and accepted the invitation      mr robinson presents his compliments to miss brown and    will do himself the honour of accepting her kind invitation    for tomorrow evening mr robinson begs to assure miss    brown that he would have great pleasure in meeting any of    miss browns friends whom she might choose to ask   psha said maryanne when she read it it would serve him right to ask bill and i would too only only it would hardly have answered her purpose she might have said had she spoken out her mind freely  in the meantime the interest as to johnson of manchester was reaching its climax at ten oclock on saturday morning each division of the window was nearly covered by an enormous bill on which in very large letters it was stated that      johnson of manchester has been taken   from that till twelve the shop was inundated by persons who were bent on learning what was the appearance and likeness of johnson photographers came to inquire in what gaol he was at present held and a man who casts heads in plaster of paris was very intent upon seeing him no information could of course be given by the men and women behind the counters among them there was at present raging a violent discussion as to the existence or nonexistence of johnson it was pleasant to hear jones repeating the circumstances to the senior partner mr brown theres miss glassbrook gone over to the antijohnsonites i think we ought to give her a months notice to those who inquired of mr brown himself he merely lifted up his hands and shook his head jones professed that he believed the man to be in the underground cells of newgate  the bill respecting johnsons capture remained up for two hours and then it was exchanged for another      johnson has escaped but no expense    shall be spared in his recapture   at four in the afternoon the public was informed as follows      johnson has got off and sailed for america   and then there was one other which closed the play late on saturday evening      brown jones and robinson beg to assure the public that    they shall be put out of all suspense early on monday    morning   and what shall we really say to them on monday asked mr jones  nothing at all replied mr robinson the thing will be dead by that time if they call say that hes in canada  and wont there be any more about it  nothing i should think we however have gained our object the house will be remembered and so will the name of brown jones and robinson  and it was so when the monday morning came the windows were without special notices and the world walked by in silence as though johnson of manchester had never existed some few eager inquirers called at the shop but they were answered easily and before the afternoon the name had almost died away behind the counters i knew i was right said miss glassbrook and mr jones heard her say so  in and about the shop johnson of manchester was heard of no more but in mr browns own family there was still a certain interest attached to the name how it came about that this was so shall be told in the next chapter     chapter xii  samson and delilah   in the commercial world of london there was one man who was really anxious to know what were the actual facts of the case with reference to johnson of manchester this was mr william brisket whose mind at this time was perplexed by grievous doubts he was called upon to act in a case of great emergency and was by no means sure that he saw his way it had been hinted to him by miss brown on the one side that it behoved her to look to herself and take her pigs to market without any more shillyshallyingby which expression the fair girl had intended to signify that it would suit her now to name her weddingday and he had been informed by mr brown on the other side that that sum of five hundred pounds should be now forthcomingor if not actually the money mr browns promissory note at six months should be handed to him dated from the day of his marriage with maryanne  under these circumstances he did not see his way that the house in bishopsgate street was doing a large business he did not doubt he visited the place often and usually found the shop crowded but he did doubt whether that business was very lucrative it might be that the whole thing was a bubble and that it would be burst before that bill should have been honoured in such case he would have saddled himself with an emptyhanded wife and would decidedly not have seen his way in this emergency he went to jones and asked his advice jones told him confidentially that though the bill of the firm for five thousand pounds would be as good as paper from the bank of england the bill of mr brown himself as an individual would be worth nothing  although mr brisket had gone to jones as a friend there had been some very sharp words between them before they separated brisket knew well enough that all the ready money at the command of the firm had belonged to mr brown and he now took upon himself to say that maryanne had a right to her share jones replied that there was no longer anything to share and that maryannes future husband must wait for her fortune till her father could pay it out of his income i couldnt see my way like that not at all said brisket and then there had been high words between them  it was at this time that the first act of johnson of manchesters little comedy was being played and people in mr briskets world were beginning to talk about the matter they must be doing a deal of trade said one believe me it is all flash and sham said another i happen to know that old brown did go down to manchester and see johnson there said the first there is no such person at all said the second so this went on till mr brisket resolved that his immediate matrimony should depend on the reality of johnsons existence if it should appear that johnson with all his paper was a false meteor that no one had deceived the metropolitan public that no one had been taken and had then escaped he would tell miss brown that he did not see his way the light of his intelligence told him that promissory notes from such a source even though signed by all the firm would be illusory if on the other hand johnson of manchester had been taken then he thought he might accept the billand wife  maryanne he said to the young lady early on that day on which she had afterwards had her interview with robinson whats all this about johnson of manchester  i know nothing about your johnsons nor yet about your manchester said miss brown standing with her back to her lover at this time she was waxing wroth with him and had learned to hate his voice when he would tell her that he had not yet seen his way  thats all very well maryanne but i must know something before i go on  who wants you to go on not i im sure nor anybody belonging to me if i do hate anything its them mercenary ways theres one who really loves me whod be above asking for a shilling if id only put out my hand to him  if you say that again maryanne ill punch his head  youre always talking of punching peoples heads but i dont see you do so much i shouldnt wonder if you dont want to punch my head some of these days  maryanne i never riz a hand to a woman yet  and youd better not as far as im concernednot as long as the pokers and tongs are about and then there was silence between them for awhile  maryanne he began again cant you find out about this johnson  no i cant said she  youd better  then i wont said she  ill tell you what it is then maryanne i dont see my way the least in life about this money  drat your way who cares about your way  thats all very fine maryanne but i care im a man as is as good as my word and always was i defy brown jones and robinson to say that im off carrying anybodys paper and as for paper its a thing as i knows nothing about and never wish when a man comes to paper it seems to me theres a very thin wall betwixt him and the gutter when i buys a score of sheep or so i pays for them down and when i sells a leg of mutton i expects no less myself i dont owe a shilling to no one and dont mean and the less that any one owes me the better i like it but maryanne when a man trades in that way a man must see his way if he goes about in the dark or with his eyes shut hes safe to get a fall now about this five hundred pound if i could only see my way  as to the good sense of mr briskets remarks there was no difference of opinion between him and his intended wife miss brown would at that time have been quite contented to enter into partnership for life on those terms and though these memoirs are written with the express view of advocating a theory of trade founded on quite a different basis nevertheless it may be admitted that mr briskets view of commerce has its charms presuming that a man has the wherewithal but such a view is apt to lose its charms in female eyes if it be insisted on too often or too violently maryanne had long since given in her adhesion to mr briskets theory but now weary with repetition of the lesson she was disposed to rebel  now william brisket she said just listen to me if you talk to me again about seeing your way you may go and see it by yourself im not so badly off that im going to have myself twitted at in that way if you dont like me you can do the other thing and this i will say when a gentleman has spoken his mind free to a lady and a lady has given her answer free back to him its a very mean thing for a gentleman to be saying so much about money after that of course a girl has got herself to look to and if i take up with you why of course i have to say stand off to any other young man as may wish to keep me company now theres one as shall be nameless that wouldnt demean himself to say a word about money  because he aint got none himself as i take it  hes a partner in a firstrate commercial firm and ill tell you what william brisket ill not hear a word said against him and ill not be put upon myself so now i wishes you good morning and so she left him  brisket when he was alone scratched his head and thought wistfully of his love i should like to see my way said he i always did like to see my way and as for that old mans bit of paper then he relapsed once again into silence  it was within an hour of all this that maryanne had followed her father to george robinsons room she had declared her utter indifference as to johnson of manchester but yet it might perhaps be as well that she should learn the truth from her father she had tried to get it but he had succeeded in keeping her in the dark to jones it would be impossible that she should apply but from robinson she might succeed in obtaining his secret she had heard no doubt of samson and delilah and thought she knew the way to the strong mans locks and might it not be well for her to forget that other samson and once more to trust herself to her fathers partners when she weighed the two young tradesmen one against the other balancing their claims with such judgment as she possessed she doubted much as to her choice she thought that she might be happy with eitherbut then it was necessary that the other dear charmer should be away as to robinson he would marry her she knew at once without any stipulations as to brisketif brisket should be her ultimate choiceit would be necessary that she should either worry her father out of the money or else cheat her lover into the belief that the money would be forthcoming having taken all these circumstances into consideration she invited mr robinson to tea  mr brown was there of course and so also were mr and mrs poppins when robinson entered they were already at the teatable and the great demerits of johnson of manchester were under discussion  now mr robinson will tell us everything said mrs poppins its about johnson you know where has he gone to mr robinson but robinson professed that he did not know  he knows well enough said maryanne only hes so close now do tell us  hell tell you anything you choose to ask him said mrs poppins  tell me anything not him indeed what does he care for me  im sure he would if he only knew what you were saying before he came into the room  now dont polly  oh but i shall because its better he should know  now polly if you dont hold your tongue ill be angry mr robinson is nothing to me and never will be im sure only if hed do me the favour as a friend to tell us about mr johnson id take it kind of him  in the meantime mr brown and his young married guest were discussing things commercial on their own side of the room and poppins also was not without a hope that he might learn the secret poppins had rather despised the firm at first as not a few others had done distrusting all their earlier assurances as to trade bargains and having been even unmoved by the men in armour but the great affair of johnson of manchester had overcome even his doubts and he began to feel that it was a privilege to be noticed by the senior partner in a house which could play such a game as that it was not that poppins believed in johnson or that he thought that 15000l of paper had at any time been missing but nevertheless the proceeding had affected his mind favourably with reference to brown jones and robinson and brought it about that he now respected themand perhaps feared them a little though he had not respected or feared them heretofore had he been the possessor of a wholesale house of business he would not now have dared to refuse them goods on credit though he would have done so before johnson of manchester had become known to the world it may therefore be surmised that george robinson had been right and that he had understood the ways of british trade when he composed the johnsonian drama  indeed id rather not mr poppins said mr brown secrets in trade should be secrets and though mr johnson has done us a deal of mischief we dont want to expose him  but youve been exposing him ever so long pleaded poppins  now poppins said that gentlemans wife dont you be troubling mr brown hes got other things to think of than answering your questions i should like to know myself i own because all the towns talking about it and it does seem odd to me that maryanne shouldnt know  i dont then said maryanne and i do think when a lady asks a gentleman the least thing a gentleman can do is to tell but i shant ask no morenot of mr robinson i was thinking but never mind polly perhaps its best as it is  would you have me betray my trust said robinson would you esteem me the more because i had deceived my partners if you think that i am to earn your love in that way you know but little of george robinson then he got up preparing to leave the room for his feelings were too many for him  stop george stop said mr brown  let him go said maryanne  if he goes away now i shall think him as hard as adam said mrs poppins  theres three to one again him said mr poppins to himself what chance can he have mr poppins may probably have gone through some such phase of life himself  let him go said maryanne again i wish he would and then let him never show himself here again  george robinson my son my son exclaimed the old man  it must be understood that robinson had heard all this though he had left the room indeed it may be surmised that had he been out of hearing the words would not have been spoken he heard them for he was still standing immediately beyond the door and was irresolute whether he would depart or whether he would return  george robinson my son my son exclaimed the old man again  he shall come back said mrs poppins following him out of the door he shall come back though i have to carry him myself  polly said maryanne if you so much as whisper a word to ask him ill never speak to you the longest day you have to live  but the threat was thrown away upon mrs poppins and under her auspices robinson was brought back into the room maryanne said he will you renounce william brisket  laws george said she  of course she will said mrs poppins and all the pomps and vanities besides  my son my son said old brown lifting up both his hands my daughter my daughter my children my children and then he joined their hands together and blessed them  he blessed them and then went down into the shop but before the evening was over delilah had shorn samson of his locks and so there wasnt any johnson after all said she  but robinson as he returned home walked again upon roses     chapter xiii  the wisdom of poppins   george robinson again walked upon roses and for a while felt that he had accomplished bliss what has the world to offer equal to the joy of gratified love what triumph is there so triumphant as that achieved by valour over beauty      take the goods the gods provide you    the lovely thais sits beside you   was not that the happiest moment in alexanders life was it not the climax of all his glories and the sweetest drop which fortune poured into his cup george robinson now felt himself to be a second alexander beside him the lovely thais was seated evening after evening and he with no measured stint took the goods the gods provided he would think of the night of that supper in smithfield when the big brisket sat next to his love half hidden by her spreading flounces and would remember how in his spleen he had likened his rival to an ox prepared for the sacrifice with garlands poor ignorant beast of the field he had said apostrophizing the unconscious brisket how little knowest thou how ill those flowers become thee or for what purpose thou art thus caressed they will take from thee thy hide thy fatness all that thou hast and divide thy carcase among them and yet thou thinkest thyself happy poor foolish beast of the field now that ox had escaped from the toils and a stag of the forest had been caught by his antlers and was bound for the altar he knew all this and yet he walked upon roses and was happy sufficient for the day is the evil thereof he said to himself the lovely thais sits beside me shall i not take the goods the gods provide me  the lovely thais sat beside him evening after evening for nearly two months up in mr browns parlour but as yet nothing had been decided as to the day of their marriage sometimes mr and mrs poppins would be there smiling happy and confidential and sometimes mr and mrs jones careworn greedy and suspicious on those latter evenings the hours would all be spent in discussing the profits of the shop and the fair division of the spoils on this subject mrs jones would be very bitter and even the lovely thais would have an opinion of her own which seemed to be anything but agreeable to her father  maryanne her lover said to her one evening when words had been rather high among them if you want your days to be long in the land you must honour your father and mother  i dont want my days to be long if were never to come to an understanding she answered and ive got no mother as you know well or you wouldnt treat me so  you must understand father said sarah jane that things shant go on like this jones shall have his rights though he dont seem half man enough to stand up for them whats the meaning of partnership if nobodys to know where the money goes to  ive worked like a horse said jones im never out of that place from morning to nightnot so much as to get a pint of beer and as far as i can see i was better off when i was at scrimble and grutts i did get my salary regular  mr brown was at this time in tears and as he wept he lifted up hands my children my children said he  thats all very well father said maryanne but whimpering wont keep anybodys pot aboiling im sick of this sort of thing and to tell the truth i think it quite time to see some sort of a house over my head  would that i could seat you in marble halls said george robinson  oh bother said maryanne that sort of a thing is very good in a play but business should be business it must always be acknowledged in favour of mr browns youngest daughter that her views were practical and not overstrained by romance  during these two or three months a considerable intimacy sprang up between mr poppins and george robinson it was not that there was any similarity in their characters for in most respects they were essentially unlike each other but perhaps this very difference led to their friendship how often may it be observed in the fields that a highbred quickpaced horse will choose some lowly donkey for his close companionship although other horses of equal birth and speed be in the same pasture poppins was a young man of an easy nature and soft temper who was content to let things pass by him unquestioned so long as they passed quietly live and let live were words that were often on his lipsby which he intended to signify that he would overlook the peccadilloes of other people as long as other people overlooked his own when the lady who became afterwards mrs poppins had once called him a rascal he had not with loud voice asserted the injustice of the appellation but had satisfied himself with explaining to her that even were it so he was still fit for her society he possessed a practical philosophy of his own by which he was able to steer his course in life he was not perhaps prepared to give much to others but neither did he expect that much should be given to him there was no ardent generosity in his temperament but then also there was no malice or grasping avarice if in one respect he differed much from our mr robinson so also in another respect did he differ equally from our mr jones he was at this time a countinghouse clerk in a large wharfingers establishment and had married on a salary of eighty pounds a year i tell you what it is robinson said he about this time i dont understand this business of yours  no said robinson perhaps not a business like ours is not easily understood  you dont seem to me to divide any profits  in an affair of such magnitude the profits cannot be adjusted every day nor yet every month  but a man wants his bread and cheese every day now theres old brown hes a deal sharper than i took him for  mr brown for a commercial man of the old school possesses considerable intelligence said robinson throughout all these memoirs it may be observed that mr robinson always speaks with respect of mr brown  very considerable indeed said poppins he seems to me to nobble everything perhaps that was the old school the young school aint so very different in that respectonly perhaps there isnt so much for them to nobble  a regular division of our profits has been arranged for in our deed of partnership said robinson  thats uncommon nice and very judicious said poppins  it was thought to be so by our law advisers said robinson  but yet you see old brown nobbles the money now if ever i goes into partnership i shall bargain to have the till for my share you never get near the till do you  i attend to quite another branch of the business said robinson  then youre wrong theres no branch of the business equal to the ready money branch old brown has lots of ready money always by him nowadays  it certainly was the case that the cash received day by day over the counter was taken by mr brown from the drawers and deposited by him in the safe the payments into the bank were made three times a week and the checks were all drawn by mr brown none of these had ever been drawn except on behalf of the business but then the payments into the bank had by no means tallied with the cash taken and latterlyfor the last month or sothe statements of the daily cash taken had been very promiscuous some payments had of course been made both to jones and robinson for their own expenses but the payments made by mr brown to himself had probably greatly exceeded these he had a vague idea that he was supreme in money matters because he had introduced capital into the firm george robinson had found it absolutely impossible to join himself in any league with jones so that hitherto mr brown had been able to carry out his own theory the motto divide et impera was probably unknown to mr brown in those words but he had undoubtedly been acting on the wisdom which is conveyed in that doctrine  jones and his wife were preparing themselves for war and it was plain to see that a storm of battle would soon be raging robinson also was fully alive to the perils of his position and anxious as he was to remain on good terms with mr brown was aware that it would be necessary for him to come to some understanding in his difficulty he had dropped some hints to his friend poppins not exactly explaining the source of his embarrassment but saying enough to make that gentleman understand the way in which the firm was going on  i suppose youre in earnest about that girl said poppins poppins had an offhand irreverent way of speaking especially on subjects which from their nature demanded delicacy that was frequently shocking to robinson  if you mean miss brown said robinson in a tone of voice that was intended to convey a rebuke i certainly am in earnest my intention is that she shall become mrs robinson  but when  as soon as prudence will permit and the lady will consent miss brown has never been used to hardship for myself i should little care what privations i might be called on to bear but i could hardly endure to see her in want  my advice to you is this if you mean to marry her do it at once if you and she together cant manage the old man you cant be worth your salt if you can do that then you can throw jones overboard  i am not in the least afraid of jones  perhaps not but still youd better mind your ps and qs it seems to me that you and he and the young women are at sixes and sevens and thats the reason why old brown is able to nobble the money  i certainly should be happier said robinson if i were married and things were settled  as to marriage said poppins my opinion is this if a man has to do it he might as well do it at once theyre always pecking at you and a fellow feels that if hes in for it whats the good of his fighting it out  i should never marry except for love said robinson  nor i neither said poppins that is i couldnt bring myself to put up with a hideous old hag because shed money i should always be wanting to throttle her but as long as theyre young and soft and fresh one can always love emat least i can  i never loved but one said robinson  there was a good many of them used to be pretty much the same to me they was all very well but as to breaking my heart about themwhy its a thing that i never understood  do you know poppins what i did twiceay thricein those dark days  what when brisket was after her  yes when she used to say that she loved another thrice did i go down to the river bank intending to terminate this wretched existence  did you now  i swear to you that i did but providence who foresaw the happiness that is in store for me withheld me from the leap  polly once took up with a sergeant and i cant say i liked it  and what did you do  i got uncommon drunk and then i knocked the daylight out of him weve been the best of friends ever since but about marryingif a man is to do it hed better do it it depends a good deal on the young woman of course and whether shes comfortable in her mind some women aint comfortable and then theres the devil to pay you dont get enough to eat and nothing to drink and if ever you leave your pipe out of your pocket she smashes it ive knowd em of that sort and a man had better have the rheumatism constant  i dont think maryanne is like that  well i cant say polly isnt shes not over good by no means and would a deal sooner sit in a armchair and have her victuals and beer brought to her than shed break her back by working too hard shed like to be always ajunketing and thats what shes best foras is the case with many of em  ive seen her as sportive as a young fawn at the hall of harmony  but she aint a young fawn any longer and as for harmony its my idea that the less of harmony a young woman has the better it makes em give themselves airs and think as how their ten fingers were made to put into yellow gloves and that a young man hasnt nothing to do but to stand treat and whirl em about till he aint able to stand a games all very well but bread and cheese is a deal better  i love to see beauty enjoying itself gracefully my idea of a woman is incompatible with the hard work of the world i would fain do that myself so that she should ever be lovely  but she wont be lovely a bit the more shell grow old all the same and take to drink very like when shes got a red nose and a pimply face and a sharp tongue youd be glad enough to see her at the washtub then i remember an old song as my father used to sing but my mother couldnt endure to hear it      woman takes delight in abundance of pleasure    but a mans life is to labour and toil   thats about the truth of it and thats what comes of your halls of harmony  you would like woman to be a household drudge  so i wouldonly drudge dont sound well call her a ministering angel instead and it comes to the same thing they both of em means much of a muchnessgetting up your linen decent and seeing that you have a bit of something hot when you come home late well goodnight old fellow i shall have my hair combed if i stay much longer take my advice and as you mean to do it do it at once and dont let the old un nobble all the money live and let live thats fair play all over and so mr poppins took his leave  had anybody suggested to george robinson that he should go to poppins for advice as to his course of life george robinson would have scorned the suggestion he knew very well the great difference between him and his humble friend both as regarded worldly position and intellectual attainments but nevertheless there was a strain of wisdom in poppins remarks which though it appertained wholly to matters of low import he did not disdain to use it was true that maryanne brown still frequented the hall of harmony and went there quite as often without her betrothed as with him it was true that mr brown had adopted a habit of using the money of the firm without rendering a fair account of the purpose to which he applied it the hall of harmony might not be the best preparation for domestic duties nor mr browns method of applying the funds the best specific for commercial success he would look to both these things and see that some reform were made indeed he would reform them both entirely by insisting on a division of the profits and by taking maryanne to his own bosom great ideas filled his mind if any undue opposition were made to his wishes when expressed he would leave the firm break up the business and carry his now wellknown genius for commercial enterprise to some other concern in which he might be treated with a juster appreciation of his merits  not that i will ever leave thee maryanne he said to himself as he resolved these things in his mind     chapter xiv  mistress morony   it was about ten days after the conversation recorded in the last chapter between mr robinson and mr poppins that an affair was brought about through the imprudence and dishonesty of mr jones which for some time prevented that settlement of matters on which mr robinson had resolved during those ten days he had been occupied in bringing his resolution to a fixed point and then when the day and hour had come in which he intended to act that event occurred which disgraceful as it is to the annals of the firm must now be told  there are certain small tricks of trade well known to the lower class of houses in that business to which brown jones and robinson had devoted themselves which for a time may no doubt be profitable but which are very apt to bring disgrace and ruin upon those who practise them to such tricks as these mr jones was wedded and by none of the arguments which he used in favour of a high moral tone of commerce could robinson prevail upon his partner to abandon them nothing could exceed the obstinacy and blindness of mr jones during these discussions when it was explained to him that the conduct he was pursuing was hardly removednay it was not removedfrom common swindling he would reply that it was quite as honest as mr robinsons advertisements he would quote especially those katakairion shirts which were obtained from hodges and of which the sale at 39s 6d the halfdozen had by dint of a wide circulation of notices become considerable if that isnt swindling i dont know what is said jones  do you know what katakairion means said robinson  no i dont said jones and i dont want to know  katakairion means fitting said robinson and the purchaser has only to take care that the shirt he buys does fit and then it is katakairion  but we didnt invent them  we invented the price and the name and thats as much as anybody does but that is not all its a wellunderstood maxim in trade that a man may advertise whatever he chooses we advertise to attract notice not to state facts but its a mean thing to pass off a false article over the counter if you will ticket your goods you should sell them according to the ticket  at first the other partners had not objected to this ticketing as the practice is now common and there is at first sight an apparent honesty about it which has its seduction a lady seeing 21s 7d marked on a mantle in the window is able to contemplate the desired piece of goods and to compare it in silent leisure with her finances she can use all her power of eye but as a compensation to the shopkeeper is debarred from the power of touch and then having satisfied herself as to the value of the thing inspected she can go in and buy without delay or trouble to the vendor but it has been found by practice that so true are the eyes of ladies that it is useless to expose in shopwindows articles which are not good of their kind and cheap at the price named to attract customers in this way real bargains must be exhibited and when this is done ladies take advantage of the unwary tradesman and unintended sacrifices are made george robinson soon perceived this and suggested that the ticketing should be abandoned jones however persevered observing that he knew how to remedy the evil inherent in the system hence difficulties arose and ultimately disgrace which was very injurious to the firm and went near to break the heart of mr brown  according to joness plan the articles ticketed in the window were not under any circumstances to be sold the shopmen indeed were forbidden to remove them from their positions under any entreaties or threats from the customers the customer was to be at first informed with all the blandishment at the shopmans command that the goods furnished within the shop were exact counterparts of those exposed then the shopman was to argue that the arrangements of the window could not be disturbed and should a persistent purchaser after that insist on a supposed legal right to buy the very thing ticketed mr jones was to be called in which case mr jones would inform the persistent purchaser that she was regarded as unreasonable violent and disagreeable and that under such circumstances her custom was not wanted by brown jones and robinson the disappointed female would generally leave the shop with some loud remarks as to swindling dishonesty and pettifogging to which mr jones could turn a deaf ear but sometimes worse than this would ensue ladies would insist on their rights scrambles would occur in order that possession of the article might be obtained the assistants in the shop would not always take part with mr jones and as has been before said serious difficulties would arise  there can be no doubt that jones was very wrong he usually was wrong his ideas of trade were mean limited and altogether inappropriate to business on a large scale but nevertheless we cannot pass on to the narration of a circumstance as it did occur without expressing our strong abhorrence of those ladies who are desirous of purchasing cheap goods to the manifest injury of the tradesmen from whom they buy them the ticketing of goods at prices below their value is not to our taste but the purchasing of such goods is less so the lady who will take advantage of a tradesman that she may fill her house with linen or cover her back with finery at his cost and in a manner which her own means would not fairly permit is in our estimationa robber it is often necessary that tradesmen should advertise tremendous sacrifices it is sometimes necessary that they should actually make such sacrifices brown jones and robinson have during their career been driven to such a necessity they have smiled upon their female customers using their sweetest blandishments while those female customers have abstracted their goods at prices almost nominal brown jones and robinson in forcing such sales have been coerced by the necessary laws of trade but while smiling with all their blandishments they have known that the ladies on whom they have smiled have beenrobbers  why is it that commercial honesty has so seldom charms for women a woman who would give away the last shawl from her back will insist on smuggling her gloves through the customhouse who can make a widow understand that she should not communicate with her boy in the colonies under the dishonest cover of a newspaper is not the passion for cheap purchases altogether a female mania and yet every cheap purchaseevery purchase made at a rate so cheap as to deny the vendor his fair profit is in truth a dishonestya dishonesty to which the purchaser is indirectly a party would that women could be taught to hate bargains how much less useless trash would there be in our houses and how much fewer tremendous sacrifices in our shops  brown jones and robinson when they had been established some six or eight months had managed to procure from a house in the silk trade a few black silk mantles of a very superior description the lot had been a remnant and had been obtained with sundry other goods at a low figure but nevertheless the proper price at which the house could afford to sell them would exceed the mark of general purchasers in bishopsgate street these came into mr jones hands and he immediately resolved to use them for the purposes of the window some halfdozen of them were very tastefully arranged upon racks and were marked at prices which were very tempting to ladies of discernment in the middle of one window there was a copious mantle of silk so thick that it stood almost alone very full in its dimensions and admirable in its fashion this mantle which would not have been dearly bought for 3l 10s or 4l was injudiciously ticketed at 38s 11½d it will bring dozens of women to the shop said jones and we have an article of the same shape and colour which we can do at that price uncommonly well whether or no the mantle had brought dozens of women into the shop cannot now be said but it certainly brought one there whom brown jones and robinson will long remember  mrs morony was an irishwoman who as she assured the magistrates in worship street had lived in the very highest circles in limerick and had come from a princely stock in the neighbouring county of glare she was a fullsized lady not without a certain amount of good looks though at the period of her intended purchase in bishopsgate street she must have been nearer fifty than forty her face was florid if not red her arms were thick and powerful her eyes were bright but as seen by brown jones and robinson not pleasant to the view and she always carried with her an air of undaunted resolution when she entered the shop she was accompanied by a thin acrid unmarried female friend whose feminine charms by no means equalled her own she might be of about the same age but she had more of the air and manner of advanced years her nose was long narrow and red her eyes were set very near together she was tall and skimpy in all her proportions and her name was miss biles of the name and station of mrs morony or of miss biles nothing was of course known when they entered the shop but with all these circumstances b j and r were afterwards made acquainted  i believe ill just look at that pelisse if you plaze said mrs morony addressing herself to a young man who stood near to the window in which the mantle was displayed  certainly maam said the man if youll step this way ill show you the article  i see the article there said mrs morony poking at it with her parasol standing where she did she was just able to touch it in this way thats the one i mane with the pricehow much was it miss biles  one eighteen eleven and a halfpenny said miss biles who had learned the figures by heart before she ventured to enter the shop  if youll do me the favour to step this way ill show you the same article said the man who was now aware that it was his first duty to get the ladies away from that neighbourhood  but mrs morony did not move its the one there that im asking ye for said she pointing again and pointing this time with the hooked end of her parasol ill throuble ye young man to show me the article with the ticket  the identical pelisse if you please sir said miss biles which you there advertise as for sale at one eighteen eleven and a halfpenny and then she pressed her lips together and looked at the shopman with such vehemence that her two eyes seemed to grow into one  the poor man knew that he was in a difficulty and cast his eyes across the shop for assistance jones who in his own branch was ever on the watchand let praise for that diligence be duly given to himhad seen from the first what was in the wind from the moment in which the stout lady had raised her parasol he felt that a battle was imminent but he had thought it prudent to abstain awhile from the combat himself he hovered near however as personal protection might be needed on behalf of the favourite ornament of his window  ill throuble you if you plaze sir to raich me that pelisse said mrs morony  we never disturb our window said the man but we keep the same article in the shop  dont you be took in by that mrs morony said miss biles  i dont mane said mrs morony i shall insist sir  now was the moment in which as jones felt the interference of the general himself was necessary mrs morony was in the act of turning herself well round towards the window so as to make herself sure of her prey when she should resolve on grasping it miss biles had already her purse in her hand ready to pay the legal claim it was clear to be seen that the enemy was of no mean skill and of great valour the intimidation of mrs morony might be regarded as a feat beyond the power of man her florid countenance had already become more than ordinarily rubicund and her nostrils were breathing anger  maam said mr jones stepping up and ineffectually attempting to interpose himself between her and the low barrier which protected the goods exposed to view the young man has already told you that we cannot disarrange the window it is not our habit to do so if you will do me the honour to walk to a chair he shall show you any articles which you may desire to inspect  dont you be done whispered miss biles  i dont mane if i know it said mrs morony standing her ground manfully i dont desire to inspect anythingonly that pelisse  i am sorry that we cannot gratify you said mr jones  but you must gratify me its for sale and the moneys on it  you shall have the same article at the same price and mr jones as he spoke endeavoured to press the lady out of her position but positively you cannot have that we never break through our rules  chaiting the public is the chief of your rules im thinking said mrs morony but youll not find it so aisy to chait me pay them the money down on the counter miss biles dear and so saying she thrust forth her parasol and succeeded in her attempt to dislodge the prey knowing well where to strike her blow and obtain a hold she dragged forth the mantle and almost got it into her left hand but jones could not stand by and see his firm thus robbed dreadful as was his foe in spirit size and strength his manliness was too great for this so he also dashed forward and was the first to grasp the silk  are you going to rob the shop said he  is it rob said mrs morony by the powers thin yere the biggest blagguard my eyes have seen since ive been in london and thats saying a long word is it rob to me ill tell you what it is young manav you dont let your fingers off this pelisse that ive purchased ill have you before the magisthrates for stailing it have you paid the money down dear  miss biles was busy counting out the cash but no one was at hand to take it from her it was clear that the two confederates had prepared themselves at all points for the contest having no doubt more than once inspected the article from the outsidefor miss biles had the exact sum ready done to the odd halfpenny there said she appealing to the young man who was nearest to her one eighteen eleven and a halfpenny but the young man was deaf to the charmer even though she charmed with ready money may i trouble you to see that the cash is right but the young man would not be troubled  youd a deal better leave it go maam said jones or i shall be obliged to send for the police  is it the police faith thin and i think youd better send give me my mantilla i say its bought and paid for at your own price  by this time there was a crowd in the shop and jones in his anxiety to defend the establishment had closed with mrs morony and was as it were wrestling with her his effort no doubt had been to disengage her hand from the unfortunate mantle but in doing so he was led into some slight personal violence towards the lady and now miss biles having deposited her money attacked him from behind declaring that her friend would be murdered  come hands off a womans a woman always said one of the crowd who had gathered round them  what does the man mean by hauling a female about that way said another  the poor crathurs nigh murthered wid him intirely said a countrywoman from the street  if shes bought the thingumbob at your own price why dont you give it her asked a fourth  ill be hanged if she shall have it said jones panting for breath he was by no means deficient in spirit on such an occasion as this  and its my belief you will be hanged said miss biles who was still working away at his back  the scene was one which was not creditable to the shop of english tradesmen in the nineteenth century the young men and girls had come round from behind the counter but they made no attempt to separate the combatants mr jones was not loved among them and the chance of war seemed to run very much in favour of the lady one discreet youth had gone out in quest of a policeman but he was not successful in his search till he had walked half a mile from the door mr jones was at last nearly smothered in the encounter for the great weight and ample drapery of mrs morony were beginning to tell upon him when she got his back against the counter it was as though a feather bed was upon him in the meantime the unfortunate mantle had fared badly between them and was now not worth the purchasemoney which but ten minutes since had been so eagerly tendered for it  things were in this state when mr brown slowly descended into the arena while george robinson standing at the distant doorway in the back looked on with blushing cheeks one of the girls had explained to mr brown what was the state of affairs and he immediately attempted to throw oil on the troubled waters  wherefore all this noise he said raising both his hands as he advanced slowly to the spot mr jones i implore you to desist but mr jones was wedged down upon the counter and could not desist  madam what can i do for you and he addressed himself to the back of mrs marony which was still convulsed violently by her efforts to pummel mr jones  i believe hes well nigh killed her i believe he has said miss biles  then at last the discreet youth returned with three policemen and the fight was at an end that the victory was with mrs morony nobody could doubt she held in her hand all but the smallest fragment of the mantlethe price of which however miss biles had been careful to repocketand showed no sign of exhaustion whereas jones was speechless but nevertheless she was in tears and appealed loudly to the police and to the crowd as to her wrongs  im fairly murthered with him thin so i amthe baist the villain the swindhler what am i to do at all and my things all desthroyed look at this thin and she held up the cause of war did mortial man iver see the like of that and im beaten black and blue wid himso i am and then she sobbed violently  so you are mrs morony said miss biles he to call himself a man indeed and to go to strike a woman  its thrue for you dear continued mrs morony policemen mind i give him in charge youre all witnesses i give that man in charge  mr jones also was very eager to secure the intervention of the policemuch more so than was mr brown who was only anxious that everybody should retire mr jones could never be made to understand that he had in any way been wrong a firm neednt sell an article unless it pleases he argued to the magistrate a firm is bound to make good its promises sir replied the gentleman in worship street and no respectable firm would for a moment hesitate to do so and then he made some remarks of a very severe nature  mr brown did all that he could to prevent the affair from becoming public he attempted to bribe mrs morony by presenting her with the torn mantle but she accepted the gift and then preferred her complaint he bribed the policemen also but nevertheless the matter got into the newspaper reports the daily jupiter of course took it upfor what does it not take up in its solicitude for poor british human natureand tore brown jones and robinson to pieces in a leading article no punishment could be inflicted on the firm for as the magistrate said no offence could be proved the lady also had certainly been wrong to help herself but the whole affair was damaging in the extreme to magenta house and gave a terrible check to that rapid trade which had already sprang up under the influence of an extended system of advertising     chapter xv  miss brown names the day   george robinson had been in the very act of coming to an understanding with mr brown as to the proceeds of the business when he was interrupted by that terrible affair of mrs morony for some days after that the whole establishment was engaged in thinking talking and giving evidence about the matter and it was all that the firm could do to keep the retail trade going across the counter some of the young men and women gave notice and went away and others became so indifferent that it was necessary to get rid of them for a week it was doubtful whether it would be possible to keep the house open and during that week mr brown was so paralyzed by his feelings that he was unable to give any assistance he sat upstairs moaning accompanied generally by his two daughters and he sent a medical certificate to worship street testifying his inability to appear before the magistrate from what transpired afterwards we may say that the magistrate would have treated him more leniently than did the young women they were aware that whatever money yet remained was in his keeping and now as at the time of their mothers death it seemed fitting to them that a division should be made of the spoils  george he said one evening to his junior partner id like to be laid decent in kensal green i know it will come to that soon  robinson hereupon reminded him that care had killed a cat and promised him all manner of commercial greatness if he could only rouse himself to his work the career of a merchant prince is still open to you said robinson enthusiastically  not along with maryanne and sarah jane george  sarah jane is a married woman and sits at another mans hearth why do you allow her to trouble you  she is my child george a man cant deny himself to his child at least i could not and i dont want to be a merchant prince if i could only have a little place of my own that was my own and where they wouldnt always be nagging after money when they come to see me  poor mr brown he was asking from the fairies that for which we are all askingfor which men have ever asked he merely desired the comforts of the world without its cares he wanted his small farm of a few acres as horace wanted it and cincinnatus and thousands of statesmen soldiers and merchants from their days down to ours his small farm on which however the sun must always shine and where no weeds should flourish poor mr brown such little farms for the comforts of old age can only be attained by long and unwearied cultivation during the years of youth and manhood  it was on one occasion such as this not very long after the affair of mrs morony that robinson pressed very eagerly upon mr brown the special necessity which demanded from the firm at the present moment more than ordinary efforts in the way of advertisement  jones has given us a great blow said robinson  i fear he has said mr brown  and now if we do not put our best foot forward it will be all up with us if we flag now people will see that we are down but if we go on with audacity all those reports will die away and we shall again trick our beams and flame once more in the morning sky  it may be presumed that mr brown did not exactly follow the quotation but the eloquence of robinson had its desired effect mr brown did at last produce a sum of five hundred pounds with which printers stationers and advertising agents were paid or partially paid and robinson again went to work  its the last said mr brown with a low moan and would have been maryannes  robinson when he heard this was much struck by the old mans enduring courage how had he been able to preserve this sum from the young womans hands pressed as he had been by her and by brisket of this robinson said nothing but he did venture to allude to the fact that the money must in fact belong to the firm  this is here mentioned chiefly as showing the reason why robinson did not for awhile renew the business on which he was engaged when mrs moronys presence in the shop was announced he felt that no private matter should be allowed for a time to interfere with his renewed exertions and he also felt that as mr brown had responded to his entreaties in that matter of the five hundred pounds it would not become him to attack the old man again immediately for three months he applied himself solely to business and then when affairs had partially been restored under his guidance he again resolved under the further instigation of poppins to put things at once on a proper footing  so you aint spliced yet said poppins  no not yet  nor wont benot to maryanne brown there was my wife at briskets in aldersgate street yesterday and we all know what that means  what does it mean demanded robinson scowling fearfully would you hint to me that she is false  false no shes not false that i know of shes ready enough to have you if you can put yourself right with the old man but if you cantwhy of course shes not to wait till her hairs grey she and polly are as thick as thieves and so polly has been to aldersgate street polly says that the joness are getting their money regularly out of the till  wait till her hair be grey said robinson when he was left to himself do i wish her to wait would i not stand with her at the altar tomorrow though my last halfcrown should go to the greedy priest who joined us and she has sent her friend to aldersgate streetto my rival there must at any rate be an end of this  late on that evening when his work was over he took a glass of hot brandyandwater at the four swans and then he waited upon mr brown he luckily found the senior partner alone mr brown said he ive come to have a little private conversation  private george well im all alone maryanne is with mrs poppins i think  with mrs poppins yes and where might she not be with mrs poppins robinson felt that he had it within him at that moment to start off for aldersgate street but first to business said he as he remembered the special object for which he had come  for the present it is well that she should be away he said mr brown the time has now come at which it is absolutely necessary that i should know where i am  where you are george  yes on what ground i stand who i am before the world and what interest i represent is it the fact that i am the junior partner in the house of brown jones and robinson  why george of course you are  and is it the fact that by the deed of partnership drawn up between us i am entitled to receive one quarter of the proceeds of the business  no george no not proceeds  what then  profits george one quarter of the profits  and what is my share for the year now over  you have lived george you must always remember that it is a great thing in itself even to live out of a trade in these days you have lived you must acknowledge that  mr brown i am not a greedy man nor a suspicious man nor an idle man nor a man of pleasure but i am a man in love  and she shall be yours george  ay sir that is easily said she shall be mine and in order that she may be mine i must request to know what is accurately the state of our account  george said mr brown in a piteous accent you and i have always been friends  but there are those who will do much for their enemies out of fear though they will do nothing for their friends out of love jones has a regular income out of the business  only forty shillings or so on every saturday night nothing more on my honour and then theyve babbies you know and they must live  by the terms of our partnership i am entitled to as much as he  but then george suppose that nobody is entitled to nothing suppose there is no profits we all must live you know but then its only hand to mouth is it  how terrible was this statement as to the affairs of the firm coming as it did from the senior partner who not more than twelve months since entered the business with a sum of four thousand pounds in hard cash robinson whose natural spirit in such matters was sanguine and buoyant felt that even he was depressed had four thousand pounds gone and was there no profit he knew well that the stock on hand would not even pay the debts that were due the shop had always been full and the men and women at the counter had always been busy the books had nominally been kept by himself but who can keep the books of a concern if he be left in ignorance as to the outgoings and incomings  that comes of attempting to do business on a basis of capital he said in a voice of anger  it comes of advertising george it comes of little silver books and big wooden stockings and men in armour and catscarrion shirts thats what its come from george  never said robinson rising from his chair with energetic action never you may as well tell me that the needle does not point to the pole that the planets have not their appointed courses that the swelling river does not run to the sea there are facts as to which the world has ceased to dispute and this is one of them advertise advertise advertise it may be that we have fallen short in our duty but the performance of a duty can never do an injury in reply to this old brown merely shook his head do you know what barlywig has spent on his physic barlywigs medean potion forty thousand ayear for the last ten years and now barlywig is worthi dont know what barlywig is worth but i know he is in parliament  we havent stuff to go on like that george in answer to this robinson knew not what to urge but he did know that his system was right  at this moment the door was opened and maryanne brown entered the room father she said as soon as her foot was over the threshold of the door but then seeing that mr brown was not alone she stopped herself there was an angry spot on her cheeks and it was manifest from the tone of her voice that she was about to address her father in anger oh george so you are there are you i suppose you came because you knew i was out  i came maryanne said he putting out his hand to her i cameto settle our wedding day  my children my children said mr brown  thats all very fine said maryanne but ive heard so much about wedding days that im sick of it and dont mean to have none  what you will never be a bride  no i wont whats the use  you shall be my bridetomorrow if you will  ill tell you what it is george robinson my belief of you is that you are that soft a man might steal away your toes without your feet missing em  you have stolen away my heart and my body is all the lighter  its light enough theres no doubt of that and so is your head your heels too were once but youve given up that  yes maryanne when a man commences the stern realities of life that must be abandoned but now i am anxious to commence a reality which is not sternthat reality which is for me to soften all the hardness of this hardworking world maryanne when shall be our wedding day  for a while the fair beauty was coy and would give no decisive answer but at length under the united pressure of her father and lover a day was named a day was named and mr browns consent to that day was obtained but this arrangement was not made till he had undertaken to give up the rooms in which he at present lived and to go into lodgings in the neighbourhood  george said she in a confidential whisper before the evening was over if you dont manage about the cash now and have it all your own way you must be soft under the influence of gratified love he promised her that he would manage it  bless you my children bless you said mr brown as they parted for the night bless you and may your loves be lasting and your children obedient     chapter xvi  showing how robinson walked upon roses   will it ever be said of me when my history is told that i spent forty thousand pounds ayear in advertising a single article would that it might be told that i had spent ten times forty thousand it was thus that robinson had once spoken to his friend poppins while some remnant of that five hundred pounds was still in his hands  but what good does it do it dont make anything  but it sells them poppins  everybody wears a shirt and no one wears more than one at a time i dont see that it does any good  it is a magnificent trade in itself would that i had a monopoly of all the walls in london the very arches of the bridges must be worth ten thousand ayear the omnibuses are invaluable the cabs are a mine of wealth and the railway stations throughout england would give a revenue for an emperor poppins my dear fellow i fancy that you have hardly looked into the depths of it  perhaps not said poppins some objects to them that theyre all lies it isnt that i mind as far as i can see everything is mostly lies the very worst article our people can get for sale they call middlings the real middlings are very superior and so on theyre all lies but they dont cost anything and all the world knows what they mean bad things must be bought and sold and if we said our things was bad nobody would buy them but i cant understand throwing away so much money and getting nothing  poppins possessed a glimmering of light but it was only a glimmering he could understand that a man should not call his own goods middling but he could not understand that a man is only carrying out the same principle in an advanced degree when he proclaims with a hundred thousand voices in a hundred thousand places that the article which he desires to sell is the best of its kind that the world has yet produced he merely asserts with his loudest voice that his middlings are not middlings a little man can see that he must not cry stinking fish against himself but it requires a great man to understand that in order to abstain effectually from so suicidal a proclamation he must declare with all the voice of his lungs that his fish are that moment hardly out of the ocean its the poetry of euphemism robinson once said to poppinsbut he might as well have talked greek to him  robinson often complained that no one understood him but he forgot that it is the fate of great men generally to work alone and to be not comprehended the higher a man raises his head the more necessary is it that he should learn to lean only on his own strength and to walk his path without even the assistance of sympathy the greedy jones had friends poppins with his easy epicurean laisser allerhe had friends the decent brown who would so fain be comfortable had friends but for robinson there was no one on whose shoulder he could rest his head and from whose heart and voice he could receive sympathy and encouragement  from one congenial soulfrom one soul that he had hoped to find congenialhe did look for solace but even here he was disappointed it has been told that maryanne brown did at last consent to name the day this occurred in may and the day named was in august robinson was very anxious to fix it at an earlier period and the goodnatured girl would have consented to arrange everything within a fortnight whats the use of shillyshallying said she to her father if it is to be done let it be done at once im so knocked about among you i hardly know where i am but mr brown would not consent mr brown was very feeble but yet he was very obstinate it would often seem that he was beaten away from his purpose and yet he would hang on it with more tenacity than that of a stronger man town is empty in august george and then you can be spared for a run to margate for two or three days  oh we dont want any nonsense said maryanne do we george  all i want is your own self said robinson  then you wont mind going into lodgings for a few months said brown  robinson would have put up with an attic had she he loved consented to spread her bridal couch so humbly but maryanne declared with resolution that she would not marry till she saw herself in possession of the rooms over the shop  therell be room for us all for awhile said old brown  i think we might manage said george  i know a trick worth two of that said the lady whos to make pa go when once we begin in that way as i mean to end so ill begin and as for you george theres no end to your softness youre that green that the very cows would eat you was it not well said by mr robinson in his preface to these memoirs that the poor old commercial lear whose name stood at the head of the firm was cursed with a goneriland with a regan  but nothing would induce mr brown to leave his home or to say that he would leave his home before the middle of august and thus the happy day was postponed till that time  theres many a slip twixt the cup and the lip said poppins when he was told do you take care that she and polly aint off to aldersgate street together  poppins i wouldnt be cursed with your ideas of human naturenot for a free use of all the stations on the north western go to aldersgate street now that she is my affianced bride  thats gammon said poppins when once shes married shell go straight enough i believe that of her for she knows which side her breads buttered but till the splice is made shes a right to please herself thats the way she looks at it  and will it not please her to become mine  its about the same with em all continued poppins my polly would have been at hong kong with the buffs by this time if i hadnt knocked the daylight out of that sergeant and poppins from the tone in which he spoke of his own deeds seemed to look back upon his feat of valour with less satisfaction than it had given him at the moment polly was his own certainly but the comfort of his small menage was somewhat disturbed by his increasing family  but to return robinson as we have said looked in vain to his future partner in life for a full appreciation of his own views as to commerce its all very well i daresay said she but one should feel ones way  when you launch your ship into the sea he replied you do not want to feel your way you know that the waves will bear her up and you send her forth boldly as wood will float upon water so will commerce float on the ocean streams of advertisement  but if you ran aground in the mud where are you then do you take care george or your boat ll be waterlogged  it was during some of these conversations that delilah cut another lock of hair from samsons head and induced him to confess that he had obtained that sum of five hundred pounds from her father and spent it among those who prepared for him his advertisements no said she jumping up from her seat then he had it after all  yes he certainly had it  well that passes and after all he said  a glimmering of the truth struck coldly upon robinsons heart she had endeavoured to get from her father this sum and had failed she had failed and the old man had sworn to her that he had it not but for what purpose had she so eagerly demanded it maryanne he said if you love another more fondly than you love me  dont bother about love george now and so you got it out of him and sent it all flying after the rest i didnt think you were that powerful  the money maryanne belonged to the firm  gracious knows who it belongs to now but lawswhen i think of all that he said its quite dreadful one cant believe a word that comes out of his mouth  robinson also thought that it was quite dreadful when he reflected on all that she must have said before she had given up the task as helpless then too an idea came upon him of what he might have to endure when he and she should be one bone and one flesh how charming was she to the eyes how luxuriously attractive when in her softer moments she would laugh and smile and joke at the winged hours as they passed but already was he almost afraid of her voice and already did he dread the fiercer glances of her eyes was he wise in this that he was doing had he not one bride in commerce a bride that would never scold and would it not be well for him to trust his happiness to her alone so he argued within his own breast but nevertheless love was still the lord of all  and the moneys all gone said maryanne  indeed it is would i had as many thousands to send after it  it was like your folly george not to keep a little of it by you knowing how comfortable it would have been for us at the beginning  but my darling it belonged to the firm  the firm arnt they all helping themselves hand over hand except you there was sarah jane in the shop behind the counter all yesterday afternoon now i tell you what it is if shes to come in i wont stand it shes not there for nothing and she with children at home no wonder she can keep a nursemaid if thats where she spends her time if you would go down more into the shop george and write less of them little books in verse it would be better for us all  and so the time passed on towards august and the fifteenth of that month still remained fixed as the happy day robinson spent some portion of this time in establishing a method of advertisement which he flattered himself was altogether new but it must be admitted in these pages that his means for carrying it out were not sufficient in accordance with this project it would have been necessary to secure the cooperation of all the tailors foremen in london and this could not be done without a douceur to the men his idea was that for a period of a month in the heart of the london season no new coat should be sent home to any gentleman without containing in the pocket one of those alluring little silver books put out by brown jones and robinson  the thing is to get them opened and looked at said robinson now i put it to you poppins whether you wouldnt open a book like that if you found that somebody had put it into your tail coat  well i should open it  you would be more or less than mortal did you not if its thrown into your cab you throw it out if a man hands it to you in the street you drop it if it comes by post you throw it into the wastepaper basket but ill defy the sternest or the idlest man not to open the leaves of such a work as that when he first takes it out of his new dresscoat surprise will make him do so why should his tailor send him the book of b j and r there must be something in it the name of b j and r becomes fixed in his memory and then the work is done if the tailors had been true to me i might have defied the world but the tailors were not true to him  during all this time nothing was heard of brisket it could not be doubted that brisket busy among his bullocks in aldersgate street knew well what was passing among the browns in bishopsgate street once or twice it occurred to robinson that the young women maryanne namely and mrs poppins expected some intervention from the butcher was it possible that mr brisket might be expected to entertain less mercenary ideas when he found that his prize was really to be carried off by another but whatever may have been the expectations of the ladies brisket made no sign he hadnt seen his way and therefore he had retired from the path of love  but brisket even though he did not see his way was open to female seduction why was it that at this eventful period of robinsons existence mrs poppins should have turned against him why his old friend polly twizzle should have gone over to his rival robinson never knew it may have been because in his humble way poppins himself stood firmly by his friend for such often is the nature of women be that as it may mrs poppins who is now again his fast friend was then his enemy  we shall have to go to this wedding of georges poppins said to his wife when the first week in august had already passed i suppose old pikes ill give me a morning old pikes was a partner in the house to which mr poppins was attached  i shant buy my bonnet yet awhile said mrs poppins  and why not polly  for reasons that i know of  but what reasons  you men are always half blind and tother half stupid dont you see that shes not going to have him  she must be pretty sharp changing her mind then heres tuesday already and next tuesday is to be the day  then it wont be next tuesday nor yet any tuesday this month briskets after her again  i dont believe it polly  then disbelieve it i was with him yesterday and ill tell you who was there before meonly dont you go to robinson and say i said so  if i cant make sport i shant spoil none said poppins  well jones was there jones was with brisket and jones told him that if hed come forward now he should have a hundred down and a promise from the firm for the rest of it  then jones is a scoundrel  i dont know about that said mrs poppins maryanne is his wifes sister and hes bound to do the best he can by her brisket is a deal steadier man than georgy robinson and wont have to look for his bread so soon im thinking  he hasnt half the brains said poppins  brains is like soft words they wont butter no parsnips  and youve been with brisket said the husband  yes why not brisket and i was always friends im not going to quarrel with brisket because georgy robinson is afraid of him i knew how it would be with robinson when he didnt stand up to brisket that night at the hall of harmony whats a man worth if he wont stand up for his young woman if you hadnt stood up for me i wouldnt have had you and so ended that conversation  a hundred pounds down said brisket to jones the next day  yes and our bill for the remainder  the cash on the nail  paid into your hand said jones  i think i should see my way said brisket at any rate ill come up on saturday  much better say tomorrow or friday  cant its little gogham fair on friday and i always kills on thursday  saturday will be very late  therell be time enough if youve got the money ready youve spoken to old brown i suppose ill be up as soon after six on saturday evening as i can come if maryanne wants to see me shell find me here it wont be the first time  thus was it that among his enemies the happiness of robinsons life was destroyed against brisket he breathes not a word the course was open to both of them and if brisket was the best horse why let him win  but in what words would it be right to depict the conduct of jones     chapter xvii  a teaparty in bishopsgate street   if it shall appear to those who read these memoirs that there was much in the conduct of mr brown which deserves censure let them also remember how much there was in his position which demands pity in this short narrative it has been our purpose to set forth the commercial doings of the house of brown jones and robinson rather than the domestic life of the partners and therefore it has been impossible to tell of all the trials through which mr brown passed with his children but those trials were very severe and if mr brown was on certain points untrue to the young partner who trusted him allowances for such untruth must be made he was untrue but there is one man who looking back upon his conduct knows how to forgive it  the scenes upstairs at magenta house during that first week in august had been very terrible mr brown in his anxiety to see his daughter settled had undoubtedly pledged himself to abandon the rooms in which he lived and to take lodgings elsewhere to this promised selfsacrifice maryanne was resolved to keep him bound and when some hesitation appeared on his part she swore to him that nothing should induce her to become mrs robinson till he had packed his things and was gone mr brown had a heart to feel and at this moment he could have told how much sharper than a serpents tooth is a childs ingratitude  but he would have gone he would have left the house although he had begun to comprehend that in leaving it he must probably lose much of his authority over the money taken in the shop he would however have done so had not mrs jones come down upon him with the whole force of her tongue and the full violence of her malice when robinson should have become one with maryanne brown and should also have become the resident partner then would the influence of mrs jones in that establishment have been brought to a speedy close  the reader shall not be troubled with those frightful quarrels in which each of the family was pitted against the others sarah jane declared to her father in terms which no child should have used to her parent that he must be an idiot and doting if he allowed his youngest daughter and her lover to oust him from his house and from all share in the management of the business brown then appealed piteously to maryanne and begged that he might be allowed to occupy a small closet as his bedroom but maryanne was inexorable he had undertaken to go and unless he did go she would never omit to din into his ears this breach of his direct promise to her maryanne became almost great in her anger as with voice raised so as to drown her sisters weaker tones she poured forth her own story of her own wrongs  it has been so from the beginning she said when i first knew brisket it was not for any love i had for the man but because mother took him up mother promised him money and then i said id marry himnot because i cared for him but because he was respectable and all right and then mother hadnt the money when the pinch came and of course brisket wasnt going to be put uponwhy should he so i took up with robinson and you knew it father  i did maryanne i did  of course you did i wasnt going to make a fool of myself for no man i have got myself to look to and if i dont do it myself they who is about me wont do it for me  your old father would do anything for you  father i hate words what i want is deeds well thenrobinson came here and was your partner and meanwhile i thought it was all right and who was it interfered why you did when brisket went to you you promised him the money and then he went and upset robinson and we had that supper in smithfield and robinson was off and i was to be mrs brisket out of hand but then again the money wasnt there  i couldnt make the money maryanne  father its a shame for you to tell such falsehoods before your own daughters  oh maryanne you wicked girl said sarah jane  if im wicked theres two of us so sarah jane you had the money and you gave it to robinson for them notices of his i know all about it now and then what could you expect of brisket of course he was off there was no fallal about love and all that with him he wanted a woman to look after his house but he wanted something with her and i wanted a roof over my headwhich im not likely to have the way youre going on  while i have a morsel you shall have half  and when you havent a morsel how will it be then of course when i saw all this i felt myself put upon there was jones getting his money out of the shop  well miss said sarah jane and isnt he a partner  you aint a partner and i dont know what business you have there but every one was helping themselves except me i was going to the wall i have always been going to the wall well when brisket was off i took up with robinson again i always liked him the best only i never thought of my own likings i wasnt that selfish i took up with robinson again but i wasnt going to be any mans wife if he couldnt put a roof over my head well father you know what was said then and now youre going back from it  i suppose youd better have mr brisket said the old man after a pause  will you give brisket those five hundred pounds and then those embassies to aldersgate street were made by mrs poppins and by mr jones during this time maryanne having spoken her mind freely remained silent and sullen that her father would not go out on the appointed day she knew that she would not marry robinson unless he did she knew also she did not like brisket but as she had said she was not so selfish as to let that stand in the way if it was to be brisket let it be brisket only let something be done  only let something be done it certainly was not a matter of surprise that she should demand so much it must be acknowledged that all connected with the firm and family began to feel that the house of brown jones and robinson had not succeeded in establishing itself on a sound basis mr brown was despondent and often unwell the joness were actuated by no ambition to raise themselves to the position of british merchants but by a greedy desire to get what little might be gotten in the scramble robinson still kept his shoulder to the collar but he did so with but little hope he had made a fatal mistake in leaguing himself with uncongenial partners and began to feel that this mistake must be expiated by the ruin of his present venture under such circumstances maryanne brown was not unreasonable in desiring that something should be done she had now given a tacit consent to that plan for bringing back brisket and consequently her brotherinlaw went at once to work  it must be acknowledged that the time was short when brisket with such easy indifference postponed his visit to bishopsgate street till the saturday giving to gogham market and the slaughtering of his beasts a preference to the renewal of his love he regarded the task before him as a light one but it must be supposed that it was no light task to miss brown on the tuesday following that saturday she would if she were true to her word join herself in wedlock to george robinson she now purposed to be untrue to her word but it must be presumed that she had some misgivings at the heart when she thought of the task before her  on the thursday and the friday she managed to avoid robinson on the saturday morning they met in her fathers room for a minute and when he attempted to exercise a privilege to which his near approaching nuptials certainly entitled him she repulsed him sullenly oh come none of that i shall require the more on tuesday he replied with his ordinary goodhumour she spoke nothing further to him then but left the room and went away to her friend mrs poppins  robinson belonged to a political debating club which met on every saturday evening at the goose and gridiron in one of the lanes behind the church in fleet street it was therefore considered that the new compact might be made in bishopsgate street on that evening without any danger of interruption from him but at the hour of dinner on that day a word was whispered into his ear by poppins i dont suppose you care about it said he but theres going to be some sort of doing at the old mans this evening  what doing  its all right i suppose but brisket is going to be there its just a farewell call i suppose  brisket with my love said robinson then will i be there also  dont forget that youve got to chaw up old crowdy on the paper question what will the geese do if youre not there the club in question was ordinarily called the goose club and the members were in common parlance called the geese  i will be there also said robinson but if i should be late you will tell the geese why it is so  they all know you are going to be married said poppins and then they parted  the hour at which the parliament of the geese assembled was as a rule a quarter before eight in the evening so that the debate might absolutely begin at eight seven was the hour for tea in bishopsgate street but on the present occasion brisket was asked for halfpast seven so that robinsons absence might be counted on as a certainty at halfpast seven to the moment brisket was there and the greeting between him and maryanne was not of a passionate nature  well old girl here i am again he said as he swung his burly body into the room  i see you she said as she half reluctantly gave him her hand but remember it wasnt me who sent for you id just as lief you stayed away and then they went to business  both jones and his wife were there and it may perhaps be said that if maryanne brown had any sincerity of feeling at her heart it was one of hatred for her brotherinlaw but now this new change in her fortunes was being brought about by his interference and he was as it were acting as her guardian this was very bitter to her and she sat on one side in sullen silence and to all appearance paid no heed to what was being said  the minds of them all were so intent on the business part of the transaction that the banquet was allowed to remain untouched till all the preliminaries were settled there was the tea left to draw till it should be as bitter as maryannes temper and the sally luns were becoming as cold as sarah janes heart mr brown did in some halfbashful manner make an attempt at performing the duties of a host my dears wont mr brisket have his dish of tea now its here but my dears were deaf to the hint maryanne still sat sullen in the corner and sarah jane stood bolt upright with ears erect ready to listen ready to speak ready to interfere with violence should the moment come when anything was to be gained on her side by doing so  they went to the work in hand with very little of the preamble of courtesy yes brisket would marry her on the terms proposed by jones he could see his way if he had a hundred pounds down and the bill of the firm at three months for the remaining sum  not three months brisket six months suggested brown but in this matter brisket was quite firm and mr brown gave way  but as all of them knew the heat of the battle would concern the names which were to be written on the bill brisket demanded that the bill should be from the firm jones held that as a majority of the firm were willing that this should be so mr brown was legally entitled to make the bill payable at the bank out of the funds of the house in this absurd opinion he was supported violently by his wife brisket of course gave no opinion on the subject it was not for him to interfere among the partners all he said was that the bill of the firm had been promised to him and that he shouldnt see his way with anything else mr brown hesitatedpondering painfully over the deed he was called upon to do he knew that he was being asked to rob the man he lovedbut he knew also that if he did not do so he must go forth from his home and then when he might be in want of comfort the child for whose sake he should do so would turn from him without love or pity  jones and me would do it together said mr brown  jones wont do nothing of the kind said joness careful wife  it would be no good if he did said brisket and ill tell you what it is im not going to be made a fool of i must know how its to be at once or im off and he put out his hand as though to take up his hat  what fools you are said maryanne speaking from her chair in the corner theres not one of you knows george robinson ask him to give his name to the bill and hell do it instantly  who is it wants the name of george robinson said the voice of that injured man as at the moment he entered the room george robinson is here and then he looked round upon the assembled councillors and his eyes rested at last with mingled scorn and sorrow upon the face of maryanne brownwith mingled scorn and sorrow but not with anger george robinson is here who wants his nameand why  will you take a cup of tea george said mr brown as soon as he was able to overcome his first dismay  maryanne said robinson why is that man here and he pointed to brisket  ask them said maryanne and she turned her face away from him in towards the wall  mr brown why is he here why is your daughters former lover here on the eve of her marriage with me  i will answer that question if you please said jones stepping up  you and robinson looking at him from head to foot silenced him with his look you answer me from you i will take no answer in this matter with you i will hold no parley on this subject i have spoken to two whom i loved and they have given me no reply there is one here whom i do not love and he shall answer me mr brisket though i have not loved you i have believed you to be an honest man why are you here  to see if we can agree about my marrying that young woman said brisket nodding at her with his head while he still kept his hands in his trousers pockets  ah is it so there she is mr brisket and now for the third time i shall go out from your presence renouncing her charms in your favour when first i did so at the dancingroom i was afraid of your brute strength because the crowd was looking on and i knew you could carry out your unmanly threat and when i wrote that paper the second time you had again threatened me and i was again afraid my heart was high on other matters and why should i have sacrificed myself now i renounce her again but i am not afraidfor my heart is high on nothing  george george said maryanne jumping from her seat leave him leave him and ill promise and then she seized hold of his arm for the moment some touch of a womans feeling had reached her heart at that instant she perhaps recognizedif only for the instant that true love is worth more than comfort worth more than well assured rations of bread and meat and a secure roof for that once she felt rather than understood that an honest heart is better than a strong arm but it was too late   illustration robinson defies his rival   no said he ill have no promise from youyour words are false ive humbled myself as the dust beneath your feet because i loved youand therefore you have treated me as the dust the man who will crawl to a woman will ever be so treated  you are about right there old fellow said brisket  leave me i say for still she held his arm she still held his arm for she saw by his eye what he intended though no one else had seen  you have twitted me with my cowardice he said but you shall see that i am no coward he is the coward and he pointed with his finger to brisket he is the coward for he will undergo no risk and then without further notice george robinson flew at the butchers throat  it was very clear that brisket himself had suspected no such attack for till the moment at which he felt robinsons fingers about his cravat he had still stood with his hands in the pockets of his trousers he was very strong and when his thoughts were well made up to the idea of a fight could in his own way be quick enough with his fists but otherwise he was slow in action nor was he in any way passionate  halloo he said striving to extricate himself and hardly able to articulate as the handkerchief tightened itself about his neck ughhh and getting his arm round robinsons ribs he tried to squeeze his assailant till he should drop his hold  i will have his tongue from his mouth shouted robinson and as he spoke he gave another twist to the handkerchief  oh laws said mrs jones the poor man will be choked and she laid hold of the tail of robinsons coat pulling at it with all her strength  dont dont said mr brown george george you shall have her indeed you shallonly leave him  maryanne the while looked on as ladies of yore did look on when knights slaughtered each other for their smiles and perhaps of yore the hearts of those who did look on were as cold and callous as was hers for one moment of enthusiasm she had thought she loved but now again she was indifferent it might be settled as well this way as any other  at length brisket succeeded in actually forcing his weak assailant from him mrs jones the while lending him considerable assistance and then he raised his heavy fist robinson was there opposite to him helpless and exhausted just within his reach and he raised his heavy fist to strike him down  he raised his fist and then he let it fall no said he im blowed if ill hit you youre better stuff than i thought you was and now look here young man there she is if shell say that shell have you ill walk out and i wont come across you or she any more  maryanne when she heard this raised her face and looked steadily at robinson if however she had any hope that hope was fruitless  i have renounced her twice said he and now i renounce her again it is not now from fear mr brown you have my authority for accepting that bill in the name of the firm then he left the room and went forth into the street     chapter xviii  an evening at the goose and gridiron   those political debaters who met together weekly at the goose and gridiron were certainly open to the insinuation that they copied the practices of another debating society which held its sittings farther west in some respects they did so and were perhaps even servile in their imitation they divided themselves into parties of which each had an ostensible leader but then there was always some ambitious but hardly trustworthy member who endeavoured to gather round him a third party which might become dominant by trimming between the other two and he again would find the ground cut from beneath his feet by new aspirants the members never called each other by their own names but addressed each always as the worthy goose speaking at such moments with the utmost courtesy this would still be done though the speaker were using all his energy to show that that other goose was in every sense unworthy they had a perpetual chairman for whom they affected the most unbounded respect he was generally called the grand his full title being the most worthy grand goose and members on their legs when they wished to address the meeting with special eloquence and were about to speak words which they thought peculiarly fit for public attention would generally begin by thus invoking him most worthy grand they would say but this when done by others than well accustomed speakers was considered as a work either of arrogance or of ignorance this great officer was much loved among them and familiarly he was called my grand though there was an immensity of talk at these meetings men speaking sometimes by the half hour whose silence the club would have been willing to purchase almost at any price there were not above four established orators there were four orators of each of whom it was said that he copied the manner and tone of some great speaker in that other society there was our friend robinson who in the elegance of his words and the brilliancy of his ideas far surpassed any other goose his words were irresistible and his power in that assembly unequalled but yet as many said it was power working only for evil the liberal party to which he had joined himself did not dare to stand without him but yet if the whispers that got abroad were true they would only too gladly have dispensed with him he was terrible as a friend but then he could be more terrible as a foe  then there was crowdycrowdy whose highflown ideas hardly tallied with the stern realities of his life crowdy was the leader of those who had once held firmly by protection crowdy had been staunchly true to his party since he had a party though it had been said of him that the adventures of crowdy in search of a party had been very long and very various there had been no goose with a bitterer tongue than crowdy but now in these days a spirit of quiescence had fallen on him and though he spoke as often as ever he did not wield so deadly a tomahawk  then there was the burly buggins than whom no goose had a more fluent use of his vernacular he was not polished as robinson nor had he ever possessed the exquisite keenness of crowdy but in speaking he always hit the nail on the head and carried his hearers with him by the energy and perspicuity of his argument but by degrees the world of the goose and gridiron had learned that buggins talked of things which he did not understand and which he had not studied his facts would not bear the light words fell from his mouth sweeter than honey but sweet as they were they were of no avail it was pleasant to hear buggins talk but men knew that it was useless  but perhaps the most remarkable goose in that assembly as decidedly he was the most popular was old pan he traced his birth to the mighty blood of the great pancabinets whose noble name he still proudly bore every one liked old pancabinet and though he did not now possess and never had possessed those grand oratorical powers which distinguished so highly the worthy geese above mentioned no goose ever rose upon his legs more sure of respectful attention the sway which he bore in that assembly was very wonderful for he was an old man and there were there divers geese of unruly spirit lately he had associated himself much with our friend robinson for which many blamed him but old pancabinet generally knew what he was about and having recognized the tremendous power of the young merchant from bishopsgate street was full sure that he could get on better with him than he could against him  it was pleasant to see my grand as he sat in his big armchair with his beer before him and his long pipe in his mouth a benign smile was ever on his face and yet he showed himself plainly conscious that authority lived in his slightest word and that he had but to nod to be obeyed that pipe was constant in his hand and was the weapon with which he signified his approbation of the speakers when any great orator would arise and address him as most worthy grand he would lay his pipe for an instant on the table and crossing his hands on his ample waistcoat would bow serenely to the goose on his legs then not allowing the spark to be extinguished on his tobacco he would resume the clay and spread out over his head and shoulders a long soft cloud of odorous smoke but when any upstart so addressed himany goose not entitled by character to use the sonorous phrasehe would still retain his pipe and simply wink his eye it was said that this distinction quite equalled the difference between big type and little perhaps the qualification which was most valued among the geese and most specially valued by the worthy grand was a knowledge of the forms of the room as it was called these rules or formulas which had probably been gradually invented for the complication of things which had once been too simple were so numerous that no goose could remember them all who was not very constant in his attention and endowed with an accurate memory and in this respect they were no doubt usefulthat when young and unskilled geese tried to monopolize the attention of the room they would be constantly checked and snubbed and at last subdued and silenced by some reference to a forgotten form no goose could hope to get through a lengthy speech without such interruption till he had made the forms of the room a long and painful study  on the evening in questionthat same evening on which robinson had endeavoured to tear out the tongue of brisketthe geese were assembled before eight oclock a motion that had been made elsewhere for the repeal of the paper duties was to be discussed it was known that the minds of many geese were violently set against a measure which they presumed to be most deleterious to the country but old pan under the rigorous instigation of robinson had given in his adhesion and was prepared to vote for the measureand to talk for it also should there be absolute necessity buggins also was on the same sidefor buggins was by trade a radical but it was felt by all that the debate would be nothing unless robinson should be there to chaw up crowdy as had been intimated to our friend by that worthy goose the young poppins  but at eight oclock and at a quarter past eight robinson was not there crowdy not wishing to lacerate his foe till that foe should be there to feel the wounds sat silent in his usual seat pancabinet who understood well the beauty of silence would not begin the fray buggins was ever ready to talk but he was cunning enough to know that a future opportunity might be more valuable than the present one then up jumped poppins now poppins was no orator but he felt that as the friend of robinson he was bound to address the meeting on the present occasion there were circumstances which should be explained most worthy grand he began starting suddenly to his legs whereupon the worthy grand slightly drew back his head still holding his pipe between his lips and winked at the unhappy poppins as the friend of the absent robinson he went on but he was at once interrupted by loud cries of order from every side of the room and worse than that the grand frowned at him there was no rule more established than that which forbade the name of any goose to be mentioned i beg the grands pardon continued poppins i mean the absent worthy goose as his friend i rise to say a few words i know he feels the greatest interest about this measure which has been brought forward in the house of c but again he was interrupted order order order was shouted at him by vociferous geese on every side and the grand frowned at him twice when the grand had frowned at a member three times that member was silenced for the night in this matter the assembly at the goose and gridiron had not copied their rule from any other body but it is worthy of consideration whether some other body might not do well to copy theirs i beg the grands pardon again said the unhappy poppins but i meant in another place hereupon a worthy goose got up and suggested that their numbers should be counted now there was a rule that no debate could be continued unless a dozen geese were present and a debate once closed was closed for that night when such a hint was given to the grand it became the grands duty to count his geese and in order to effect this in accordance with the constitution of the assembly it was necessary that the servants should withdraw strangers also were sometimes present and at such moments they were politely asked to retire when the suggestion was made the suggestor no doubt knew that the requisite number was not there but it usually happened on such occasions that some hangerson were at hand to replenish the room a goose or two might be eating bread and cheese in the little parlourfor food could not be introduced into the debatingroom and a few of the younger geese might often be found amusing themselves with the young lady at the bar word would be passed to them that the grand was about to count and indeed they would hear the tap of his tobaccostopper on the table then there would be a rush among these hungry and amorous geese and so the number would be made up that they called making a flock  when the suggestion was given on the present occasion the grand put down his tankard from his hand and proceeded to the performance of his duty turning the mouthpiece of his long pipeclay out from him he pointed it slowly to one after another counting them as he so pointed first he counted up old pancabinet and a slight twinkle might be seen in the eyes of the two old men as he did so then turning his pipe round the room he pointed at them all and it was found that there were fifteen present there is a flock and the discreet and worthy goose is in possession of the room he said bowing to poppins and poppins again began his speech  it was but a blundering affair as was too often the case with the speeches made there and then when poppins sat down the great crowdy rose slowly to his legs we will not attempt to give the speech of this eloquent goose at length for the great crowdy often made long speeches it may suffice to say that having a good cause he made the best of it and that he pitched into our poor robinson most unmercifully always declaring as he did so that as his friend the enterprising and worthy goose was absent his own mouth was effectually closed it may be noted here that whenever a goose was in commerce the epithet enterprising was always used when he was mentioned and if he held or ever had held a service of trust as poppins did he was called the discreet goose and then just as crowdy finished his speech the swinging door of the room was opened and robinson himself started up to his accustomed place  it was easy to see that both the inner man had been disturbed and the outer his hair and clothes had been ruffled in the embrace with brisket and his heart had been ruffled in its encounter with maryanne he had come straight from bishopsgate street to the goose and gridiron and now when he walked up to his seat all the geese remained silent waiting for him to declare himself  most worthy grand he began and immediately the long pipe was laid upon the table and the hands of the grand were crossed upon his bosom a circumstance has occurred tonight which unfits me for these debates no no no was shouted on one side and hear hear hear on the other during which the grand again bowed and then resumed his pipe  if the chamber will allow me to wander away from paper for a moment and to open the sores of a bleeding heart  question question was then called by a jealous voice  the enterprising and worthy goose is perfectly in order said the burly buggins many a good heart will bleed before long if this debate is to be choked and smothered by the cackle of the incapable  i submit that the question before the chamber is the repeal of the paper duties said the jealous voice and not the bleeding heart of the enterprising and worthy goose  the question before the cabinet is said my grand that the chamber considers that two millions ayear will be lost for ever by the repeal of the paper duties but if the enterprising and worthy goose have any personal remarks to make bearing on that subject he will be in order  it is a matter of privilege suggested poppins  a personal explanation is always allowed said robinson indignantly nor did i think that any member of this chamber would have had the baseness to stop my voice when  orderorderorder  i may have been wrong to say baseness in this chamber however base the worthy goose may be and therefore with permission of our worthy grand i will substitute hardihood whereupon the worthy grand again bowed but still there were cries of question from the side of the room opposite to that on which robinson sat  then old pancabinet rose from his seat and all voices were hushed  if i may be allowed to make a suggestion said he i would say that the enterprising and worthy goose should be heard on a matter personal to himself it may very probably be that the privileges of this chamber are concerned and i think i may say that any worthy goose speaking on matters affecting privilege in this chamber is always heard with that attention which the interest of the subject demands after that there was no further interruption and robinson was allowed to open his bleeding heart  most worthy grand he again began and again the pipe was laid down for robinson was much honoured i come here hot from a scene of domestic woe which has robbed me of all political discretion and made the paper duty to me an inscrutable mystery the worthy geese here assembled see before them a man who has been terribly injured one in whose mangled breast fate has fixed her sharpest dagger and poisoned the blade before she fixed it nonono hearhearhear yes my grand she poisoned the blade before she fixed it on tuesday next i had hoped and here his voice became inexpressibly soft and tender on tuesday next i had hoped to become one bone and one flesh with a fair girl whom i have loved for monthsfair indeed to the outer eye as flesh and form can make her but ah how hideously foul within and i had hoped on this day sennight to have received the congratulations of this chamber i need not say that it would have been the proudest moment of my life but my grand that has all passed away her conduct has been the conduct of a harpy she is a regan she is false heartless and cruel and this night i have renounced her  hereupon a small goose very venomous but vehemently attached to the privileges of his chamber gave notice of a motion that that false woman should be brought before the most worthy grand and heard at the bar of the goose and gridiron but another worthy goose showed that the enterprising and worthy goose had by his own showing renounced the lady himself and that therefore there could have been no breach of the privilege of the chamber the notice of motion was then withdrawn  o woman continued robinson how terrible is thy witchcraft and how powerful are thy charms thou spakest and adam fell thou sangest and samsons strength was gone the head of the last of the prophets was the reward of thy meretricious feet twas thy damnable eloquence that murdered the noble duncan twas thy lascivious beauty that urged the slaughter of the noble dane as were adam and samson so am i as were macbeth and the foul king in the play so is my rival brisket most worthy grand this chamber must hold me excused if i decline tonight to enter upon the subject of the paper duties then robinson left the chamber and the discussion was immediately adjourned to that day sennight     chapter xix  george robinsons marriage   thus ended george robinsons dream of love never again will he attempt that phase of life beauty to him in future shall be a thing on which the eye may rest with satisfaction as it may on the sculptors chiselled marble or on the varied landscape it shall be a thing to look atpossibly to possess but for the future george robinsons heart shall be his own george robinson is now wedded and he will admit of no second wife on that same tuesday which was to have seen him made the legal master of maryannes charms he vowed to himself that commerce should be his bride and as in the dead of night he stood on the top of the hill of ludgate he himself as highpriest performed the ceremony yes said he on that occasion o goddess here i devote myself to thy embraces to thine and thine only to live for thee shall satisfy both my heart and my ambition if thou wilt be kind no softer loveliness shall be desired by me george robinson has never been untrue to his vows nor shalt thou o my chosen one find him so now for thee will i labour straining every nerve to satisfy thy wishes woman shall henceforward be to me a doll for the adornment of whose back it will be my business to sell costly ornaments in no other light will i regard the loveliness of her form o sweet commerce teach me thy lessons let me ever buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest let me know thy hidden ways and if it be that i am destined for future greatness and may choose the path by which it shall be reached it is not great wealth at which i chiefly aim let it rather be said of me that i taught the modern world of trade the science of advertisement  thus did he address his new celestial bride and as he spoke a passing cloud rolled itself away from before the moons face and the great luminary of the night shone down upon his upturned face i accept the omen said robinson with lightened heart and from that moment his great hopes never again altogether failed him though he was doomed to pass through scorching fires of commercial disappointment  but it must not be supposed that he was able to throw off his passion for maryanne brown without a great inward struggle up to that moment in which he found brisket in mr browns room and as he stood for a moment on the landingplace heard that inquiry made as to the use of his name he had believed that maryanne would at last be true to him poppins indeed had hinted his suspicions but in the way of prophecy poppins was a cassandra poppins saw a good deal with those twinkling eyes of his but robinson did not trust to the wisdom of poppins up to that hour he had believed in maryanne and then in the short flash of an instant the truth had come upon him she had again promised herself to brisket if brisket would only take her let brisket have her if he would a minutes thought was sufficient to bring him to this resolve but hours of scorching torment must be endured ere he could again enjoy the calm working of a sound mind in a sound body  it has been told how in the ecstasy of his misery he poured out the sorrows of his bleeding heart before his brethren at the debating club they with that ready sympathy which they always evince for the success or failure of any celebrated brother at once adjourned themselves and robinson walked out followed at a distance by the faithful poppins  george old fellow said the latter touching his friend on the shoulder at the corner of bridge street  leave me exclaimed robinson do not pry into sorrows which you cannot understand i would be alone with myself this night  youd be better if youd come to the mitre and smoke a pipe said poppins  pipe me no pipes said robinson  oh come youd better quit that and take it easy after all isnt it better so than you should find her out when it was too late theres many would be glad to have your chance  man shouted robinson and as he did so he turned round upon his friend and seized him by the collar of his coat i loved that woman forty thousand poppinses could not with all their quantity of love make up my sum  very likely not said poppins  wouldst thou drink up esil wouldst thou eat a crocodile  heaven forbid said poppins  ill do it and if thou prate of mountains  but i didnt  no poppins no thats true though i should be hamlet yet art not thou laërtes but poppins thou art horatio  im thomas poppins old fellow and i mean to stick to you till i see you safe in bed  thou art horatio for ive found thee honest there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamed of in our philosophy  come old fellow  poppins give me that man that is not passions slave and i will wear him in my hearts core ay in my heart of heartsas i do thee and then falling on poppins neck george robinson embraced him  youll be better after that said poppins come lets have a little chat over a drop of something hot and then well go to bed ill stand sammy  something hot said robinson i tell you poppins that everything is hot to me here here im hot and then he struck his breast and yet im very cold tis cold to be alone cold to have lost ones all poppins ive loved a harpy  i believe youre about right there said poppins  a harpy her nails will grow to talons and on her feet are hoofs within she is horn all over theres not a drop of blood about her heart oh poppins  youre very well out of it george but yet im sorry for you i am indeed  and now goodnight this way is mine yours there  what to the bridge no im blessed if you do at any rate not alone  poppins tell me this was hamlet mad or did he feign so  faith very likely the latter many do that now there are better rations in bedlam than in any of the gaolslet alone the workhouses  ay go mad for rations theres no feigning there poppins the world is doing that but poppins hamlet feigned and so do i let the wind blow as it may i know a hawk from a handsaw therefore you need not fear me  i dont but i wont let you go on to that bridge alone youll be singing that song of a suicide till youre as low as low come and drink a drop of something and wish brisket joy with his wife  i will said robinson and so the two went to the mitre and there comforted by the truth and honesty of his friend robinson resolved that he would be weak no longer but returning at once to his work would still struggle on to rescue the house of brown jones and robinson from that bourne of bankruptcy to which it was being hurried by the incompetency of his partners  the following day was sunday and he rose at twelve with a racking headache he had promised to take a chop with his friend at two and at that hour he presented himself with difficulty at mrs poppinss room she was busy laying the cloth as he entered but his friend was seated halfdressed unshorn pale and drooping in an old armchair near the window  its a shame for you george robinson said the lady as he entered so it is look at that for a father of a familycoming home at three oclock in the morning and not able to make his way upstairs till i went down and fetched him  i told her that we were obliged to sit out the debate said poppins winking eagerly at his friend  debate indeed a parcel of geese as you call yourself only geese go to bed betimes and never get beastly drunk as you was poppins  i took a bit of stewed cheese which always disagrees with me  stewed cheese never disagrees with you when im with you ill tell you what it is poppins if you aint at home and in bed by eleven oclock next saturday ill go down to the goose and gridiron and ill have that old grandy out of his chair thats what i will i suppose youre so bad you cant eat a bit of nothing in answer to which robinson said that he did not feel himself to be very hungry  its a blessing to maryanne to have lost you thats what it is  stop woman said robinson  dont you woman me any womans i know what stuff youre made off its a blessing for her not to have to do with a man who comes home roaring drunk like a dead log at three oclock in the morning  now polly began poor poppins  oh ah polly yes pollys very well but it was a bad day for polly when she first sat eyes on you there was sergeant macnash never took a drop too much in his life and youre worse than robinson ten times hes got no children at home and no wife if he kills hisself with tobacco and gin nobody will be much the worse i know one whos got well out of it anyway and now if either of you are able to eat you can come robinson did not much enjoy his afternoon but the scenes as they passed served to reconcile him to that lonely life which must henceforward be his fate what was there to enjoy in the fate of poppins and what in the proposed happiness of brisket could not a man be sufficient for himself alone was there aught of pleasantness in that grinding tongue of his friends wife should not ones own fleshthe bone of ones bonebind up ones bruises pouring in balm with a gentle hand poppins was wounded sorely about the head and stomach and of what nature was the balm which his wife administered he robinson had longed for married bliss but now he longed no longer  on the following monday and tuesday he went silently about his work speaking hardly a word to anybody mr brown greeted him with an apologetic sigh and jones with a triumphant sneer but he responded to neither of them he once met maryanne in the passage and bowed to her with a low salute but he did not speak to her he did not speak to her but he saw the colour in her cheek and watched her downcast eye he was still weak as water and had she clung to him even then he would even then have forgiven her but she passed on and as she left the house she slammed the door behind her  a little incident happened on that day which is mentioned to show that even in his present frame of mind robinson was able to take advantage of the smallest incident on behalf of his firm a slight crowd had been collected round the door in the afternoon for there had been a quarrel between mr jones and one of the young men in which loud words had reached the street and a baby which a woman held in her arms had been somewhat pressed and hurt as soon as the tidings reached robinsons ears he was instantly at his desk and before the trifling accident was two hours passed the following bill was in the printers hands      caution to mothersmothers beware     three suckling infants were yesterday pressed to death in    their mothers arms by the crowd which had congregated    before the house of brown jones and robinson at nine    times nine bishopsgate street in their attempts to be    among the first purchasers of that wonderful lot of cheap    but yet excellent flannels which b j and r have just    imported such flannels at such a price were never before    offered to the british public the sale at the figures    quoted below will continue for three days more     magenta house   and then followed the list  it had chanced that mr brown had picked up a lot of remnants from a wholesale house in houndsditch and the genius of robinson immediately combined that fact with the little accident above mentioned     chapter xx  showing how mr brisket didnt see his way   then two months passed by and the summer was over early in september mr brown had been taken ill and he went to margate for a fortnight with his unmarried daughter this had been the means of keeping brisket quiet for a while with reference to that sum of money which he was to receive and had given a reason why the marriage with him should not be performed at once on mr browns return the matter was discussed and brisket became impatient but the middle of october had come before any steps were taken to which it will be necessary to allude in the annals of the firm  at that time brisket on two successive days was closeted with his proposed fatherinlaw and it was evident to robinson that after each of these interviews mr brown was left in an unhappy frame of mind at this time the affairs of the shop were not absolutely ruinousor would not have been so had there been a proper watch kept on the cash taken over the counter the heaviest amounts due were to the stationer printer and advertising agents this was wrong for such people of course press for their money and whatever hitch or stoppage there may be in trade there should at any rate be no hitch or stoppage in the capability for advertising for the goods disposed of by the house payments had been made if not with absolute punctuality on every side at any rate so fairly that some supply was always forthcoming the account at the bank had always been low and though a few small bills had been discounted nothing like a mercantile system of credit had been established all this was wrong and had already betrayed the fact that brown jones and robinson were little people trading in a little way it is useless to conceal the fact now and these memoirs would fail to render to commerce that service which is expected from them were the truth on this matter kept back from the public brown jones and robinson had not soared upwards into the empyrean vault of commercial greatness on eagles wings there are bodies so ponderous in their nature that for them no eagles wings can be found the firm had commenced their pecuniary transactions on a footing altogether weak and unsubstantial they had shown their own timidity and had confessed by the nature of their fiscal transactions that they knew themselves to be small to their advertising agents they should never have been behindhand in their payments for one day but they should have been bold in demanding credit from their bank and should have given their orders to the wholesale houses without any of that hesitation or reserve which so clearly indicates feebleness of purpose  but in spite of this acknowledged weakness a brisk trade over the counter had been produced and though the firm had never owned a large stock an unremitting sale was maintained of small goods such as ribbons stockings handkerchiefs and cotton gloves the katakarion shirts also had been successful and now there was a hope that during the coming winter something might be done in african monkey muffs at that time therefore the bill of the house at three months though not to be regarded as a banknote was not absolutely waste paper how far briskets eyes were open on this matter cannot now be said but he still expressed himself willing to take one hundred pounds in cash and the remainder of maryannes fortune in the bill of the firm at three months  and then mr brisket made a third visit to bishopsgate street on all these occasions he passed by the door of the little room in which robinson sat and well did his late rival know his ponderous step his late rivalfor brisket was now welcome to come and go mr brown said he on one occasion i have come here to have a settlement about this thing at once  ive been ill brisket very ill you know said mr brown pleadingly and im not strong now  but that cant make no difference about the money maryanne is willing and me also when christmas is coming on its a busy time in our trade and i cant be minding that sort of thing then if youve got the cash ready and that bit of paper well have it off next week  ive never spoken to him about the paper and mr brown as he uttered these words pointed down towards the room in which robinson was sitting  then youd better said brisket for i shant come here again after today ill see it out now one way or the other and so ive told maryanne  mr browns sigh when he heard these words was prolonged and deep you heard what he said that night continued brisket you ask him hes game for anything of that sort  all these words robinson had overheard for the doors of the two rooms were close together and neither of them had been absolutely closed now was the moment in which it behoved him to act no false delicacy as to the nature of the conversation between his partner and that partners proposed soninlaw withheld him but rising from his seat he walked straight into the upper room  here he is by jingo said brisket talk of the  speak of an angel and behold his wings said robinson with a faint smile i come on a visit which might befit an angel mr brown i consent that your daughters dowry shall be paid from the funds of the firm  but mr brown instead of expressing his thankful gratitude as was expected winked at his partner the dull brisket did not perceive it but robinson at once knew that this act of munificence on his part was not at the moment pleasing to the ladys father  youre a trump said brisket and when were settled at home like maryanne and i that is i hope youll let bygones be bygones and come and take pot luck with us sometimes if theres a tender bit of steak about the place it shall be sent to the kitchen fire when you show your face  brisket said robinson theres my hand ive loved her i dont deny it but youre welcome to her no woman shall ever sit at the hearth of george robinsonbut at her hearth george robinson will never sit  you shall be as welcome as if you did said brisket and a man cant say no fairer  but in the meantime mr brown still continued to wink and robinson understood that his consent to that bill transaction was not in truth desired perhaps mr brisket said he as this is a matter of business i and my partner had better discuss it for a moment together we can go down into my room mr brown  with all my heart said brisket but remember this both of you if i dont see my way before i leave the house i dont come here any more i know my way pretty well from aldersgate street and im sick of the road ive been true to my word all along and ill be true to the end but if i dont see my way before i leave this house remember im off  you shouldnt have said that whispered brown to his partner as soon as the two were together  why not  the money wont be there at the end of three months not if we pay them other things and wheres the hundred pounds of ready to come from  thats your lookout  i havent got it george jones has it i know but i cant get it out of him  jones got a hundred pounds and where should jones have gotten it  i know we have been wrong george i know we have but you cant wonder at me george can you i did bring four thousand pounds into it didnt i  and now you havent got a hundred pounds  if i have its as much as i can say but jones has it and ever so much more if brisket will wait we can frighten it out of jones  if i know anything of human nature said robinson brisket will not wait  he would if you hadnt spoke to him that way hed say he wouldnt and go away and maryanne would blow up but i should have worked the money out of jones at last and then brisket would have waited  when mr brown had made this disclosure whispering all the time as he leaned his head and shoulder on robinsons upright desk they both remained silent for a while we have been wrong he had said i know we have and robinson as he heard the words perceived that from the beginning to the end he had been a victim no wonder that the business should not have answered when such confessions as these were wrung from the senior partner but the fact alleged by mr brown in his own excuse was allowed its due weight by robinson even at that moment mr brown had possessed moneymoney which might have made his old age comfortable and respectable in obscurity it was not surprising that he should be anxious to keep in his own hand some small remnant of his own property but as for jones what excuse could be made for jones jones had been a thief and worse than ordinary thieves for his thefts were committed on his own friends  and he has got the money said robinson  oh yes said mr brown theres no doubt in life about that  then by the heaven above us he shall refund it to the firm from which he has stolen it shouted robinson striking the desk with his fist as he did so  whish george whish brisket will hear you  who cares i have been robbed on every side till i care for nothing what is brisket to me or what is your daughter what is anything  but george  is there no honesty left in the world mr brown that there is no love i had already learned ah me what an age is this in which we live deceit deceit deceitit is all deceit  the heart of a man is very deceitful said mr brown and a womans especially  delilah would have been a true wife nowadays but never mind that man is still there and he must be answered i have no hundred pounds to give him  no george no were sure of that  when this business is broken up as broken up it soon will be  oh george dont say so  ay but it will then i shall walk out from magenta house with empty pockets and with clean hands  but think of me george i had four thousand pounds when we began hadnt i now  i do think of you and i forgive you now go up to brisket for he will want his answer i can assist you no further my name is still left to me and of that you may avail yourself but as for money george robinson has none  about half an hour after that mr brisket again descended the stairs with his usual ponderous and slow step and went forth into the street shaking the dust from his feet as he did so he was sore offended and vowed in his heart that he would never enter that house again he had pressed mr brown home about the money and that gentleman had suggested to him first that it should be given to him on the day after the marriage and then that it should be included in the bill you offered to take it all in one bill before you know said mr brown hereupon brisket began to think that he did not see his way at all and finally left the house in great anger  he went direct from thence to mrs poppins lodgings where he knew that he would find miss brown poppins himself was of course at his work and the two ladies were together  ive come to wish you goodby he said as he walked into the room  laws mr brisket exclaimed mrs poppins  its all up about this marriage and so i thought it right to come and tell you i began straightforward and i mean to end straightforward  you mean to say youre not going to have her said mrs poppins  polly dont make a fool of yourself said maryanne do you think i want the man let him go and then he did go and miss brown was left without a suitor     chapter xxi  mr brown is taken ill   brisket kept his word and never entered magenta house again nor as far as george robinson is aware has he seen any of the brown family from that day on which he gave up his intended marriage to this present for awhile maryanne brown protested that she was well satisfied that this should be so she declared to mrs poppins that the man was mercenary senseless uninteresting heavy and brutaland though in the bosom of her own family she did not speak out with equal freedom yet from time to time she dropped words to show that she was not breaking her heart for william brisket but this mood did not last long before winter had come round the bitterness of gall had risen within her heart and when christmas was there her frame of mind was comfortable neither to herself nor to her unfortunate father  during this time the house still went on set a business going and it is astonishing how long it will continue to move by the force of mere daily routine people flocked in for shirts and stockings and young women came there to seek their gloves and ribbons although but little was done to attract them either in the way of advertisement or of excellence of supply throughout this wretched month or two robinson knew that failure was inevitable and with this knowledge it was almost impossible that he should actively engage himself in his own peculiar branch of business there was no confidence between the partners jones was conscious of what was coming and was more eager than ever to feather his own nest but in these days mr brown displayed a terrible activity he was constantly in the shop and though it was evident to all eyes that care and sorrow were heaping upon his shoulders a burden which he could hardly bear he watched his soninlaw with the eyes of an argus it was terrible to see him and terrible alas to hear himfor at this time he had no reserve before the men and women engaged behind the counters at first there had been a pretence of great love and confidence but this was now all over it was known to all the staff that mr brown watched his soninlaw and known also that the youngest partner had been treated with injustice by them both  they in the shop and even jones himself knew little of what in these days was going on upstairs but robinson knew for his room was close to that in which mr brown and his daughter lived and moreover in spite of the illfeeling which could not but exist between him and miss brown he passed many hours in that room with her father the bitterness of gall had now risen within her breast and she had begun to realize that truth which must be so terrible for a woman that she had fallen to the ground between two stools it is a truth terrible to a woman there is no position in a mans life of the same aspect a man may fail in business and feel that no further chance of any real success can ever come in his way or he may fail in love and in the soreness of his heart may know that the pleasant rippling waters of that fountain are for him dried for ever but with a woman the two things are joined together her battle must be fought all in one her success in life and her romance must go together hand in hand she is called upon to marry for love and if she marry not for love she disobeys the ordinance of nature and must pay the penalty but at the same time all her material fortune depends upon the nature of that love an industrious man may marry a silly fretful woman and may be triumphant in his countinghouse though he be bankrupt in his drawingroom but a woman has but the one chance she must choose her lifes companion because she loves him but she knows how great is the ruin of loving one who cannot win for her that worldly success which all in the world desire to win  with maryanne brown these considerations had become frightfully momentous she had in her way felt the desire for some romance in life but she had felt more strongly still how needful it was that she should attain by her feminine charms a position which would put her above want as long as i have a morsel you shall have half of it her father had said to her more than once and she had answered him with terrible harshness but what am i to do when you have no longer a morsel to share with me when you are ruined or dead where must i then look for support and shelter the words were harsh and she was a very regan to utter them but nevertheless they were natural it was manifest enough that her father would not provide for her and for her there was nothing but eves lot of finding an adam who would dig for her support she was hard coarsealmost heartless but it may perhaps be urged in her favour that she was not wilfully dishonest she had been promised to one man and though she did not love him she would have married him intending to do her duty but to this he would not consent except under certain money circumstances which she could not command then she learned to love another man and him she would have married but prudence told her that she should not do so until he had a home in which to place her and thus she fell to the ground between two stools and falling perceived that there was nothing before her on which her eye could rest with satisfaction  there are women very many women who could bear this if with sadness still without bitterness it is a lot which many women have to bear but maryanne brown was one within whose bosom all feelings were turned to gall by the prospect of such a destiny what had she done to deserve such degradation and misfortune she would have been an honest wife to either husband that it could be her own fault in any degree she did not for a moment admit it was the fault of those around her and she was not the woman to allow such a fault to pass unavenged  father she would say you will be in the workhouse before this new year is ended  i hope not my child  hope whats the good of hoping you will and where am i to go then mother left a handsome fortune behind her and this is what youve brought us to  ive done everything for the best maryanne  why didnt you give that man the money when you had it youd have had a home then when youd ruined yourself now youll have no home neither shall i  all this was very hard to be borne she nags at me that dreadful george he once said as he sat in his old armchair with his head hanging wearily on his chest that i dont know where i am or what im doing as for the workhouse i almost wish i was there  she would go also to poppins lodgings and there quarrel with her old friend polly it may be that at this time she did not receive all the respect that had been paid to her some months back and this reverse was to her proud spirit unendurable polly she said if you wish to turn your back upon me you can do so but i wont put up with your airs  theres nobody turning their back upon you only yourself polly replied but its frightful to hear the way youre always agrumblingas if other people hadnt had their ups and downs besides you  robinson also was taught by the manner of his friend poppins that he could not now expect to receive that high deference which was paid to him about the time that johnson of manchester had been in the ascendant those had been the halcyon days of the firm and robinson had then been happy men at that time would point him out as he passed as one worthy of notice his companions felt proud when he would join them and they would hint to him with a mysterious reverence that was very gratifying their assurance that he was so deeply occupied as to make it impossible that he should give his time to the ordinary slow courtesies of life all this was over now and he felt that he was pulled down with rough hands from the high place which he had occupied  its all very well poppins would say to him but the fact is youre adoing of nothing  if fourteen hours a day began robinson but poppins instantly stopped him  fourteen hours work a day is nothing if you dont do anything a man may sweat hard digging holes and filling them up again but what i say is he does not do any good youve been making out all these long stories about things that never existed but whats the world the better for itthats what i want to know when a man makes a pair of shoes and so he went on coming from such a man as poppins this was hard to be borne but nevertheless robinson did bear it men at the goose and gridiron also would shoulder him nowadays rather than make way for him geese whose names had never been heard beyond the walls of that room would presume to occupy his place and on one occasion when he rose to address the chamber the grand omitted the courtesy that had ever been paid to him and forgot to lay down his pipe this also he bore without flinching  it was about the middle of february when a catastrophe happened which was the immediate forerunner of the fall of the house robinson had been at his desk early in the morningfor though his efforts were now useless he was always there and had been struck with dismay by the loudness of maryannes tone as she rebuked her father then mrs jones had joined them and the battle had raged still more furiously the voice of the old man too was heard from time to time when roused by suffering to anger he would forget to speak in his usual falsetto treble and break out in a few natural words of rough impassioned wrath at about ten mr brown came down into robinsons room and seating himself on a low chair remained there for awhile without moving and almost without speaking is she gone george he asked at last which of them said robinson  sarah jane im not so used to her and its very bad then robinson looked out and said that mrs jones was gone whereupon mr brown returned to his own room  again and again throughout the day robinson heard the voices but he did not go up to the room he never did go there now unless specially called upon to do so by business at about noon however there came a sudden silencea silence so sudden that he noticed it and then he heard a quick step across the floor it was nothing to him and he did not move from his seat but still he kept his ears open and sat thoughtless of other matters as though he expected that something was about to happen the room above was perfectly still and for a minute or two nothing was done but then there came the fall of a quicker step across the room and the door was opened and maryanne descending the four stairs which led to his own closet was with him in an instant george she said forgetting all propriety of demeanour fathers in a fit  it is not necessary that the scene which followed should be described with minuteness in these pages robinson of course went up to mr browns room and a doctor was soon there in attendance upon the sick man he had been struck by paralysis and thus for a time had been put beyond the reach of his daughters anger sarah jane was very soon there but the wretched state in which the old man was lying quieted even her tongue she did not dare to carry on the combat as she looked on the contorted features and motionless limbs of the poor wretch as he lay on his bed on her mind came the conviction that this was partly her work and that if she now spoke above her breath those around her would accuse her of her cruelty so she slunk about into corners whispering now and again with her husband and quickly took herself off leaving the task of nursing the old man to the higher courage of her sister  and maryannes courage sufficed for the work now that she had a task before her she did itas she would have done her household tasks had she become the wife of brisket or of robinson to the former she would have been a good wife for he would have required no softness she would have been true to him tending him and his childrenscolding them from morning to night and laying not unfrequently a rough hand upon them but for this brisket would not have cared he would have been satisfied and all would have been well it is a thousand pities that in that matter brisket could not have seen his way  and now that her womans services were really needed she gave them to her father readily it cannot be said that she was a cheerful nurse had he been in a state in which cheerfulness would have relieved him her words would have again been sharp and pointed she was silent and sullen thinking always of the bad days that were coming to her but nevertheless she was attentive to himand during the time of his terrible necessity even good to him it is so natural to women to be so that i think even regan would have nursed lear had lears body become impotent instead of his mind there she sat close to his bed and there from time to time robinson would visit her in those days they always called each other george and maryanne and were courteous to each other speaking solely of the poor old sick man who was so near to them both of their former joint hopes no word was spoken then nor at any rate as regards the lady was there even a thought of love as to jones he very rarely came there he remained in the shop below where the presence of some member of the firm was very necessary for in these days the number of hands employed had become low  i suppose its all up down there she said one day and as she spoke she pointed towards the shop at this time her father had regained his consciousness and had recovered partially the use of his limbs but even yet he could not speak so as to be understood and was absolutely helpless the door of his bedroom was open and robinson was sitting in the front room to which it opened  im afraid so said he there are creditors who are pressing us and now that they have been frightened about mr brown we shall be sold up  you mean the advertising people  yes the stationer and printer and one or two of the agents the fact is that the money which should have satisfied them has been frittered away uselessly  its gone at any rate said she he hasnt got it and she pointed to her father  nor have i said robinson i came into it emptyhanded and i shall go out as empty no one shall say that i cared more for myself than for the firm ive done my best and we have failed thats all  i am not going to blame you george my lookout is bad enough but i will not say that you did it it is worse for a woman than for a man and what am i to do with him and again she pointed towards the inner room in answer to this robinson said something as to the wind being tempered for the shorn lamb as far as i can see she continued the sheep is best off that knows how to keep its own wool its always such cold comfort as that one gets when the world means to thrust one to the wall its only the sheep that lets themselves be shorn the lions and the tigers know how to keep their own coats on their own backs i believe the wind blows colder on poor naked wretches than it does on those as have their carriages to ride in providence is very good to them that know how to provide for themselves  you are young said he and beautiful  psha  you will always find a home if you require one  yes and sell myself ill tell you what it is george robinson i wish to enter no mans home unless i can earn my meat there by my work no man shall tell me that i am eating his bread for nothing as for love i dont believe in it its all very well for them as have nothing to do and nothing to think offor young ladies who get up at ten in the morning and ride about with young gentlemen and spend half their time before their lookingglasses its like those poetry books youre so fond of but its not meant for them as must earn their bread by their own sweat you talk about love but its only madness for the like of you  i shall talk about it no more  you cant afford it george nor yet cant i what a man wants in a wife is some one to see to his cooking and his clothes and what a woman wants is a man who can put a house over her head of course if she have something of her own shell have so much the better house as for me ive got nothing now  that would have made no difference with me robinson knew that he was wrong to say this but he could not help it he knew that he would be a madman if he again gave way to any feeling of tenderness for this girl who could be so hard in her manner so harsh in her speech and whose temperament was so utterly unsuited to his own but as she was hard and harsh so was he in all respects the reverse as she had told him over and over again he was tenderhearted even to softness  no it wouldnt she replied and therefore with all your cleverness you are little better than a fool you have been working hard and living poor these two years back and what better are you when that old man was weak enough to give you the last of his money you didnt keep a penny  not a penny said robinson with some feeling of pride at his heart  and what the better are you for that look at them joneses they have got money when the crash comes they wont have to walk out into the street theyll start somewhere in a little way and will do very well  and would you have had me become a thief  a thief you neednt have been a thief you neednt have taken it out of the drawers as some of them did i couldnt do that myself ive been sore tempted but i could never bring myself to that then she got up and went to her father and robinson returned again to the figures that were before him  what am i to do with him she again said when she returned when he is able to move and the house is taken away from us what am i to do with him hes been bad to me but i wont leave him  neither will i leave him maryanne  thats nonsense youve got nothing no more than he has and hes not your flesh and blood where would you have been now if wed been married on that day  i should have been nearer to him in blood but not truer to him as a partner  its lucky for you that your sort of partnership neednt last for ever youve got your hands and your brain and at any rate you can work but who can say what must become of us looking at it all through george i have been treated hardhavent i now  he could only say that of such hard treatment none of it rested on his conscience at such a moment as this he could not explain to her that had she herself been more willing to trust in others more prone to believe in providence less hard and worldly things would have been better with her even now could she have relaxed into tenderness for halfanhour there was one at her elbow who would have taken her at once with all that burden of a wornout pauper parent and have poured into her lap all the earnings of his life but maryanne brown could not relax into tenderness nor would she ever deign to pretend that she could do so  the first day on which mr brown was able to come out into the sittingroom was the very day on which brown jones and robinson were declared bankrupts craddock and giles the stationers of st mary axe held bills of theirs as to which they would notor probably could notwait and the city and west end commercial and agricultural jointstock bank refused to make any further advances it was a sad day but one at least of the partners felt relieved when the blow had absolutely fallen and the management of the affairs of the shop was taken out of the hands of the firm  and will we be took to prison asked mr brown they were almost the first articulate words which he had been heard to utter since the fit had fallen on him and robinson was quick to assure him that no such misfortune would befall him  they are not at all bitter against us said robinson they know we have done our best  and what will they do with us again asked mr brown  we shall have a sale and clear out everything and pay a dividendand then the world will be open to us for further efforts  the world will never be open to me again said mr brown and if i had only have kept the money when i had it  mr brown said robinson taking him by the hand you are ill now and seen through the sickly hue of weakness and infirmity affairs look bad and distressing but ere long you will regain your strength  no george i shall never do that  on this day the business of the shop still went on but the proceeds of such sales as were made were carried to the credit of the assignees mr jones was there throughout the day doing nothing and hardly speaking to any one he would walk slowly from the front of the shop to the back and then returning would stand in the doorway rubbing his hands one over the other when any female of specially smart appearance entered the shop he would hand to her a chair and whisper a few words of oily courtesy but to those behind the counter he did not speak a word in the afternoon mrs jones made her appearance and when she had been there a few minutes was about to raise the counter door and go behind but her husband took her almost roughly by the arm and muttering something to her caused her to leave the shop ah i knew what such dishonest doings must come to she said as she went her way and whats more i know whos to blame and yet it was she and her husband who had brought this ruin on the firm  george said mr brown that evening i have intended for the besti have indeed  nobody blames you sir  you blame me about maryanne  no by heaven not now  and she blames me about the money but ive meant it for the besti have indeed  all this occurred on a saturday and on that same evening robinson attended at his debating club for the express purpose of explaining to the members the state of his own firm it shall never be thrown in my teeth said he that i became a bankrupt and was ashamed to own it so he got up and made a speech in which he stated that brown jones and robinson had failed but that he could not lay it to his own charge that he had been guilty of any omission or commission of which he had reason to be ashamed as a british merchant this is mentioned here in order that a fitting record may be made of the very high compliment which was paid to him on the occasion by old pancabinet  most worthy grand said old pan and as he spoke he looked first at the chairman and then down the long table of the room i am sure i may truly say that we have all of us heard the statement made by the enterprising and worthy goose with sentiments of regret and pain but i am equally sure that we have none of us heard it with any idea that either dishonour or disgrace can attach itself in the matter to the name of order order order worthy geese are a little too quick continued the veteran debater with a smileto the name ofone whom we all so highly value hear hear hear and then old pancabinet moved that the enterprising and worthy goose was entitled to the full confidence of the chamber crowdy magnanimously seconded the motion and the resolution when carried was communicated to robinson by the worthy grand having thanked them in a few words which were almost inaudible from his emotion he left the chamber and immediately afterwards the meeting was adjourned     chapter xxii  wasteful and impetuous sale   there is no position in life in which a man receives so much distinguished attention as when he is a bankrupta bankrupt that is of celebrity it seems as though he had then realized the legitimate ends of trade and was brought forth in order that those men might do him honour with whom he had been good enough to have dealings on a large scale robinson was at first cowed when he was called upon to see men who were now becoming aware that they would not receive more than 2s 9d in the pound out of all the hundreds that were owed to them but this feeling very soon wore off and he found himself laughing and talking with giles the stationer and burrows the printer and sloman the official assignee as though a bankruptcy were an excellent joke and as though he as one of the bankrupts had by far the best of it these men were about to lose or rather had lost large sums of money but nevertheless they took it all as a matter of course and were perfectly goodhumoured no word of reproach fell from their lips and when they asked george robinson to give them the advantage of his recognized talents in drawing up the bills for the sale they put it to him quite as a favour and sloman the assignee went so far as to suggest that he should be remunerated for his work  if i can only be of any service to you said robinson modestly  of the greatest service said mr giles a tremendous sacrifice you knowenormous liabilitiesunreserved saleregardless of cost and all that sort of thing  lord bless you said mr burrows do you think he doesnt understand how to do all that better than you can tell him youll draw out the headings of the posters wont you mr robinson  and put the numbers and figures into the catalogue suggested mr sloman the best way is to put em down at about cost price we find we can generally do em at that if we can only get the people to come sharp enough and then as the evening had fallen upon them at their labours they adjourned to the four swans opposite and robinson was treated to his supper at the expense of his victims  on the next day the house was closed this was done in order that the goods might be catalogued and prepared for the final sale the shop would then be again opened for a week and after that there would be an end of brown jones and robinson in spite of the goodhumour which was shown by those from whom illhumour on such an occasion might have been expected there was a melancholy about this which was inexpressible it has been said that there is nothing so exciting in trade as a grand final sacrificial sale but it is like the last act of a tragedy it is very good while it lasts but what is to come after it robinson as he descended into the darkened shop and walked about amidst the lumber that was being dragged forth from the shelves and drawers felt that he was like marius on the ruins of carthage here had been the scene of his glory and then he remembered with what ecstasy he had walked down the shop when the crowd without were anxiously inquiring the fate of johnson of manchester that had been a great triumph but to what had such triumphs led him  the men and women had gone away to their breakfast and he was standing there alone leaning against one of the counters he heard a slight noise behind him and turning round saw mr brown who had crept down from his own room without assistance it was the first time since his illness that he had left the floor on which he lived and it had been intended that he should never go into the shop again oh mr brown is this prudent said he going up to him that he might give him the assistance of his arm  i wished to see it all once more george  there it is then there isnt much to see  but a deal to feel isnt there georgea deal to feel it did look very pretty that day we opened itvery pretty the colours seem to have got dirty now  bright colours will become dull and dirty mr brown its the way of the world the brighter they are in their brightness the more dull will they look when the tinsel and gloss are gone  but we should have painted it again this spring if wed stopped here  there are things mr brown which one cannot paint again  iron and wood you can or anything of the like of that  yes mr brown you may repaint iron and wood but who can restore the faded colours to broken hopes and a bankrupt ambition you see these arches here which with so light a span bear the burden of the house above them so was the span of my heart on that opening day no weight of labour then seemed to be too much for me the arches remain and will remain but as for the human heart  dont georgedont it will kill me if i see you down in the mouth  these will be repainted continued robinson and other breasts will glow beneath them with hopes as high as those we felt when you and the others stood here to welcome the public but what artist can ever repaint our aspirations the soiled columns of these windows will be regilded and all here will be bright and young again but for man when he loses his glory there is no regilding come mr brown we will go upstairs they will be here soon and this is no place now for you then he took him by the hand and led him tenderly to his apartment  there is something inexpressibly melancholy in the idea of bankruptcy in tradeunless indeed when it may have been produced by absolute fraud and in such a form as to allow of the bankrupts going forth with their pockets full but in an ordinary way i know nothing more sad than the fate of men who have embarked all in a trade venture and have failed it may be and probably is the fact that in almost all such cases the failure is the fault of the bankrupts but the fault is so generally hidden from their own eyes that they cannot see the justice of their punishment and is often so occult in its causes that the justice cannot be discerned by any without deep scrutiny they who have struggled and lost all feel only that they have worked hard and worked in vain that they have thrown away their money and their energy and that there is an end now and for ever to those sweet hopes of independence with which they embarked their small boats upon the wide ocean of commerce the fate of such men is very sad of course we hear of bankrupts who come forth again with renewed glories and who shine all the brighter in consequence of their temporary obscurity these are the men who can manage to have themselves repainted and regilded but their number is not great one hears of such because they are in their way memorable and one does not hear of the poor wretches who sink down out of the worldback behind counters and to menial work in warehouses of ordinary bankrupts one hears nothing they are generally men who having saved a little with long patience embark it all and lose it with rapid impotence they come forward once in their lives with their little ventures and then retire never more to be seen or noticed of all the shops that are opened year after year in london not above a half remain in existence for a period of twelve months and not a half ever afford a livelihood to those who open them is not that a matter which ought to fill one with melancholy on the establishment of every new shop there are the same high hopesthose very hopes with which brown jones and robinson commenced their career it is not that all expect to shine forth upon the world as merchant princes but all do expect to live upon the fruit of their labour and to put by that which will make their old age respectable alas alas of those who thus hope how much the larger proportion are doomed to disappointment the little lots of goods that are bought and brought together with so much pride turn themselves into dust and rubbish the gloss and gilding wear away as they wear away also from the heart of the adventurer and then the small aspirant sinks back into the mass of nothings from whom he had thought to rise when one thinks of it it is very sad but the sadness is not confined to commerce it is the same at the bar with the army and in the church we see only the few who rise above the waves and know nothing of the many who are drowned beneath the waters  perhaps something of all this was in the heart of our friend robinson as he placed himself at his desk in his little room now for this next day or two he would still be somebody in the career of magenta house his services were wanted and therefore though he was ruined men smiled on him but how would it be with him when that sale should be over and when he would be called upon to leave the premises and walk forth into the street he was aware now though he had never so thought of himself before that in the short days of his prosperity he had taken much upon himself as the member of a prosperous firm it had never then occurred to him that he had given himself airs because he was robinson of the house in bishopsgate street but now he bethought himself that he had perhaps done so how would men treat him when he should no longer be the same robinson how had he condescended to poppins how had he domineered at the goose and gridiron how had he patronized those who served him in the shop men remember these things of themselves quite as quickly as others remember them robinson thought of all this now and almost wished that those visits to blackfriars bridge had not been in vain  but nevertheless it behoved him to work he had promised that he would use his own peculiar skill for the benefit of the creditors and therefore shaking himself as it were out of his despondency he buckled himself to his desk it is a grand opportunity he said as he thought of the task before him but my work will be no longer for myself and partners      the lofty rhyme i still must make      though other hands shall touch the money    so do the bees for others sake      fill their waxen combs with honey   then when he had thus solaced himself with verse he sat down to his work  there was a mine of wealth before him from which to choose a tradesman in preparing the ordinary advertisements of his business is obliged to remember the morrow he must not risk everything on one cast of the die he must be in some degree modest and circumspect lest he shut himself out from all possibility of rising to a higher note on any future opportunity but in preparing for a final sacrifice the artist may give the reins to his imagination and plunge at once into all the luxuries of the superlative but to this pleasure there was one drawback the thing had been done so often that superlatives had lost their value and it had come to pass that the strongest language sounded impotently in the palled ears of the public what idea can in its own nature be more harrowing to the soul than that of a tremendous sacrifice but what effect would arise nowadays from advertising a sale under such a heading every little milliner about tottenham court road has her tremendous sacrifice when she desires to rid her shelves of ends of ribbons and bits of soiled flowers no some other language than this must be devised a phraseology not only startling but new must be invented in preparing the final sale of the house of brown jones and robinson  he threw himself back in his chair and sat for awhile silent with his finger fixed upon his brow the first words were everything and what should be the first words at last in a moment they came to him and he wrote as follows      ruin ruin ruin     wasteful and impetuous sale     at magenta house 81 bishopsgate street on march the    5th and three following days the stock in trade of    the bankrupts brown jones and robinson valued at    209657l 15s 3d will be thrown broadcast before    the public at the frightful reduction of 75 per cent on    the cost price     to acquire the impetus and force necessary for the    realization of so vast a property all goods are quoted for    true honest bonafide sale at onequarter the cost price     this is a solemn fact and one which well merits the    earnest attention of every mother of a family in england    the goods are of the first class and as no attempt in    trade has ever hitherto been made of equal magnitude to    that of the bankrupts it may with absolute truth be said    that no such opportunity as this has ever yet been afforded    to the public of supplying themselves with the richest    articles of luxury at prices which are all but nominal how    will any lady hereafter forgive herself who shall fail    to profit by such an opportunity as this   such was the heading of his bills and he read and reread the words not without a glow of pleasure one can be in love with ruin so long as the excitement lasts a solemn fact he repeated to himself or shall i say a glorious fact glorious would do well for the public view of the matter but as it touches the firm solemn perhaps is more appropriate mother of a family shall i say also of every father i should like to include all but then the fathers never come and it would sound loaded again he looked at the bill again read it and then proceeded to describe with great accuracy on a flyleaf the dimensions of the paper to be used the size of the different types and the adaptation of various colours that will do said he i think that will do  but this which he had now done though perhaps the most important part of his task was by no means the most laborious he had before him various catalogues of the goods and it remained for him to affix the prices to describe the qualities and to put down the amount of each on hand this was no light task and he worked hard at it into the middle of the night but long before that time came he had thrust away from him the inefficient lists with which he had been supplied and trusted himself wholly to his imagination so may be seen the inspired schoolmaster who has beneath his hands the wretched verses of a dull pupil for awhile he attempts to reduce to reason and prosody the futile efforts of the scholar but anon he lays aside in disgust the distasteful task and turning his eyes upwards to the muse who has ever been faithful he dashes off a few genial lines of warm poetry the happy juvenile with wondering pen copies the work and the parents heart rejoices over the prize which his child has won so was it now with robinson what could he do with a poor gross of hose numbered 7 to 10 or what with a score or two of middling kids there were five dozen and nine left of the katakairions was he to put down such numbers as those in his sacrificial catalogue for awhile he kept these entries before him as a guideas a guide which in some sort he might follow at a wide distance but he found that it was impossible for him to be so guided even at any distance and at last he thrust the poor figures from him altogether and trampled them under his feet tablecloths seven dozen and a half different sizes that was the last item he read and as he pushed it away the following were the words which his fertile pen produced      the renowned flemish treble table damasks of argentine    brightness and snowlike purity with designs of absolute    grandeur and artistic perfection of outline to dine eight    persons worth 1l 8s 6d for 7s 3d to dine    twelve worth 1l 18s 6d for 10s 11½d to    dine sixteen worth 3l 19s 6d for 19s 9¼d    and so on at the same rate to any size which the    epicurean habits of this convivial age can possibly    require   space will not permit us here to give the bill entire but after this fashion was it framed and then the final note was as follows      nbmany tons weight of firstclass table damasks and    sheetings soiled but not otherwise impaired also of    ribbons gloves hose shirts crinolines paletots    mantles shawls prints towels blankets quilts and    flouncings will be sold on the first two days at buyers    own prices   there said he as he closed down his inkbottle at three oclock in the morning that i suppose is my last days work in the house of brown jones and robinson i have worked not for myself but others and i have worked honestly then he went home and slept as though he had no trouble on his mind  on the following morning he again was there and messrs giles burrows and sloman attended with him mr brown also and mr jones were present on this occasion the meeting was held in mr browns sittingroom and they were all assembled in order that robinson might read over the sale list as he had prepared it poor mr brown sat in a corner of his old sofa very silent now and again as some long number or specially magniloquent phrase would strike his ear he expressed his surprise by a sort of gasp but throughout the whole morning he did not speak a word as to the business on hand jones for the first few minutes attempted to criticize but the authority of mr sloman and the burly aspect of mr giles the paperdealer were soon too much for his courage and he also collapsed into silence but the three gentlemen who were most concerned did not show all that silent acquiescence which george robinsons painful exertions on their behalf so richly deserved  impetuous said mr sloman what does impetuous mean i never heard tell before of an impetuous sacrifice tremendous is the proper word mr robinson  tremendous is not my word answered robinson and as to the meaning of impetuous  it sounds well i think said mr burrows and then they went on  broadcastbroadcast said mr giles that means sowing dont it  exactly said robinson have not i sown and are not you to reap if you will allow me i will go on he did go on and by degrees got through the whole heading but there was hardly a word which was not contested it is all very well for a man to write when he himself is the sole judge of what shall be written but it is a terrible thing to have to draw up any document for the approval of others ones choicest words are torn away ones figures of speech are maltreated ones stops are misunderstood and ones very syntax is put to confusion and then at last whole paragraphs are cashiered as unnecessary first comes the torture and then the execution come wilkins you have the pen of a ready writer prepare for us this document in such words is the victim addressed by his colleagues unhappy wilkins he little dreams of the misery before him as he proudly applies himself to his work  but it is beautiful to hear and see when two scribes have been appointed how at first they praise each others words as did trissotin and vadius how gradually each objects to this comma or to that epithet how from moment to moment their courage will arisetill at last every word that the other has written is foul nonsense and flat blasphemytill vadius at last will defy his friend in prose and verse in greek and latin  robinson on this occasion had no rival but not the less were his torments very great argentine brightness said mr giles whats argentine i dont like argentine youd better put that out mr robinson  its the most effective word in the whole notice said robinson and then he passed on  tons weight of towelling said mr sloman thats coming it a little too strong mr robinson  this was the end of the catalogue gentlemen said robinson rising from his chair what little i have been able to do for you in this matter i have done willingly there is the notice of your sale drawn out in such language as seems suitable to me if it answers your purpose i pray that you will use it if you can frame one that will do so better i beg that no regard for my feelings may stand in your way my only request to you is thisthat if my words be used they may not be changed or garbled then bowing to them all he left the room  they knew the genius of the man and the notice afterwards appeared exactly in the form in which robinson had framed it     chapter xxiii  farewell   for the four appointed days the sale was continued and it was wondrous to see with what animation the things went off it seemed as though ladies were desirous of having a souvenir from magenta house and that goods could be sold at a higher price under the name of a sacrifice than they would fetch in the ordinary way of trade if only we could have done as well robinson said to his partner jones wishing that if possible there might be good humour between them in these last days  we did do quite as well and better said jones only the money was thrown away in them horrid advertisements after that george robinson made no further effort to maintain friendly relations with mr jones  george said mr brown i hope theyll allow me something they ought oughtnt they there wouldnt have been nothing only for my four thousand pounds robinson did not take the trouble to explain to him that had he kept his four thousand pounds out of the way the creditors would not now have any lost money to lament robinson was careful to raise no hopes by his answer but nevertheless he resolved that when the sale was over he would do his best  on the fifth day when the shop had been well nigh cleared of all the goods the premises themselves were sold brown jones and robinson had taken them on a term of years and the lease with all the improvements was put up to auction when we say that the price which the property fetched exceeded the whole sum spent for external and internal decorations including the magenta paint and the plateglass we feel that the highest possible testimony is given to the taste and talent displayed by the firm  it was immediately after this that application was made to the creditors on behalf of mr brown  he brought four thousand pounds into the business said robinson and now he hasnt a penny of his own  and we have none of us got a penny whined out mr jones who was standing by  mr jones and i are young and can earn our bread said robinson but that old man must go into the workhouse if you do not feel it possible to do something for him  and so must my poor babbies said jones as to work i aint fit for it  but he was soon interrupted and made to understand that he might think himself lucky if he were not made to disgorge that which he already possessed as to mr brown the creditors with much generosity agreed that an annuity of 20s a week should be purchased for him out of the proceeds of the sale i aint long for this world george he said when he was told and they ought to get it cheap put em up to that george do now twenty shillings a week was not much for all his wants but nevertheless he might be more comfortable with that than he had been for many a year if only his daughter would be kind to him alas alas was it within the nature of things that his daughters should be kind  it was on this occasion when the charitable intention of the creditors was communicated to mr brown by robinson that that conversation took place to which allusion has been made in the opening chapter of these memoirs of course it was necessary that each member of the firm should provide in some way for his future necessities mr jones had signified his intention of opening a small hairdressers shop in grays inn lane i was brought up to it once he said and it dont require much ready money both mr brown and robinson knew that he was in possession of money but it was not now worth their while to say more about this the fox had made good his prey and who could say where it was hidden  and what will you do george asked mr brown  then it was that robinson communicated to them the fact that application had been made to him by the editor of a first class magazine for a written account of the doings of the firm i think it may be of advantage to commerce in general the editor had said with his customary dignity of expression and propriety of demeanour i quite agree with you robinson had replied if only the commercial world of great britain can be induced to read the lesson the editor seemed to think that the commercial world of great britain did read the cornhill magazine and an arrangement was quickly made between them those who have perused the chapter in question will remember how robinson yielded when the senior partner pleaded that as they had been partners so long they should still be partners to the end and how he had yielded again when it was suggested to him that he should receive some assistance in the literary portion of the work that assistance has been given and george robinson hopes that it may have been of advantage  i suppose we shall see each other sometimes george maryanne said to him when she came down to his little room to bid him farewell  i hope we shall maryanne  i dont suppose we shall ever dance together again at the hall of harmony  no maryanne never that phase of life is for me over neither with you nor with any other fair girl shall i again wanton away the flying hours life is too precious for that and the work which falls upon a mans shoulders is too exacting the hall of harmony is for children maryannefor grown children perhaps but still for children  you used to like it george  i did and could again so could i again stop with longing mouth at the window of that pastrycook whose tarts in early life attracted all my desires i could again be a boy in everything did i not recognize the stern necessity which calls me to be a man i could dance with you still whirling swiftly round the room to the sweet sound of the music stretching the hours of delight out to the very dawn were it not for adams doom in the sweat of my brow must i eat my bread there is a time for all things maryanne but with me the time for such pastimes as those is gone  youll keep company with some other young woman before long george and then youll be less gloomy  never that phase of life is also over why should i to what purpose  to be married of course  yes and become a womans slave like poor poppins or else have my heart torn again with racking jealousy as it was with you no maryanne let those plodding creatures link themselves with women whose bodies require comforting but whose minds never soar the world must be populated and therefore let the briskets marry  i suppose youve heard of him george  not a word  la now i declare youve no curiosity to inquire about any one if i was dead and buried tomorrow i believe youd never ask a word about me  i would go to your grave maryanne and sit there in silence  would you now i hope you wont all the same but about brisket you remember when that row was and you were so nigh choking him  do i remember ay maryanne when shall i forget it it was the last hour of my madness  i never admired you so much as i did then george but never mind thats all done and over nowisnt it  all done and over said robinson mournfully repeating her words  of course it is but about brisket immediately after that the very next day he went out to goghamwhere he was always going you know with that cart of his to buy sheep sheep indeed  and wasnt it for sheep  no george brisket was the sheep and there was there a little shewolf that has got him at last into her claws brisket is married george  what another poppins ha ha ha we shall not want for children  he has seen his way at last she was a drovers daughter and now hes married her and brought her home  a drovers daughter  well he says a graziers but its all the same he never would have done for me george never and ill tell you more i dont think i ever saw the man as would i should have taken either of youi was so knocked about among em but i should have made you miserable whichever it was its a consolation to me when i think of that  and it was a consolation also to him he had loved herhad loved her very dearly he had been almost mad for love of her but yet he had always known that had he won her she would have made him miserable there was consolation in that when he thought of his loss then at last he wished her goodby and now farewell maryanne be gentle with that old man  george she said as long as he wants me ill stick to him hes never been a good father to me but if he wants me ill stick to him as to being gentle its not in me i wasnt brought up gentle and you cant teach an old dog new tricks those were the last words she spoke to him and they had at any rate the merit of truth  and then before he walked out for the last time from the portals of magenta house he bade adieu to his old partner mr brown god bless you george said the old man god bless you  mr brown said he i cannot part from you without acknowledging that the loss of all your money sits very heavy on my heart  never think of it george  but i shall think of it you were an old man mr brown and the money was enough for you or if you did go into trade again the old way would have suited you best  well george now you mention it i think it would  it was the same mistake mr brown that we have so often heard ofputting old wine into a new bottle the bottle is broken and the wine is spilt for myself ive learned a lesson and i am a wiser man but im sorry for you mr brown  i shall never say a word to blame you george  as to my principlesthat system of commerce which i have advocatedas to that i am still without a doubt i am certain of the correctness of my views look at barlywig and his colossal fortune and 40000l a year spent in advertising  but then you should have your 40000l a year  by no means but the subject is a long one mr brown and cannot now be discussed with advantage this however i do feelthat i should not have embarked your little all in such an enterprise it was enough for you but to me with my views it was nothingless than nothing i will begin again with unimpeded wings and you shall hear of my success but for your sake mr brown i regret what is past then he pressed the old mans hand and went forth from magenta house from that day to this present one he has never again entered the door  and so brisket is married brisket is right brisket is a happy man he said to himself as he walked slowly down the passage by st botolphs church brisket is certainly right i will go and see brisket so he did and continuing his way along the back of the bank and the narrow street which used to be called lad lanei wish they would not alter the names of the streets was it not enough that the swan with two necks should be pulled down foreshadowing perhaps in its ruin the fate of another bird with two necks from which this one took its emblematic characterand so making his way out into aldersgate street he had never before visited the lares of brisket for brisket had been his enemy but brisket was his enemy no longer and he walked into the shop with a light foot and a pleasant smile there standing at some little distance behind the block looking with large wondering eyes at the carcases of the sheep which hung around her stood a wee little woman very pretty with red cheeks and red lips and short thick clustering curls this was the daughter of the grazier from gogham the shopman will be back in a minute said she i ought to be able to do it myself but im rather astray about the things yet awhile then george robinson told her who he was  she knew his name well and gave him her little plump hand in token of greeting laws a mercy are you george robinson ive heard such a deal about you hes inside just tidying hisself a bit for dinner who do you think there is here bill and she opened the door leading to the back premises heres george robinson that youre always so full of then he followed her out into a little yard where he found brisket in the neighbourhood of a pump smelling strongly of yellow soap with his sleeves tucked up and hard at work with a rough towel  robinson my boy cried he im glad to see you and so is mrs b aint you emly whereupon emly said that she was delighted to see mr robinson and youre just in time for as tidy a bit of roast veal as you wont see again in a hurryfed down at gogham by emlys mother i killed it myself with my own hands didnt i emly  robinson stopped and partook of the viands which were so strongly recommended to him and then after dinner he and brisket and the bride became very intimate and confidential over a glass of hot brandyandwater  i dont do this kind of thing only when ive got a friend said brisket tapping the tumbler with his spoon but i really am glad to see you ive took a fancy to you now ever since you went so nigh throttling me by jove though i began to think it was all up with meonly for sarah jane  but he didnt said emily looking first at her great husband and then at robinsons slender proportions  didnt he though but he just did and what do you think emly he wanted me once to sit with him on a barrel of gunpowder  a barrel of gunpowder  and smoke our pipes therequite comfortable and then he wanted me to go and fling ourselves into the river that was uncommon civil wasnt it and then he well nigh choked me  it was all about that young woman said emily with a toss of her head and from all i can hear tell she wasnt worth fighting for as for you bill i wonder at you so i do  i thought i saw my way said brisket  its well for you that youve got somebody near you that will see better now and as for you mr robinson i hope you wont be long in the dumps neither whereupon he explained to her that he was by no means in the dumps he had failed in trade no doubt but he was now engaged upon a literary work as to which considerable expectation had been raised and he fully hoped to provide for his humble wants in this way till he should be able to settle himself again to some new commercial enterprise  it isnt that as she means said brisket she means about taking a wife thats all the women ever thinks of  what i was saying is that as you and bill were both after her and as you are both broke with her and seeing that bills provided himself like  and a charming provision he has made said robinson  i did see my way said brisket with much selfcontent  so you ought to look elsewhere as well as he continued emily according to all accounts youve neither of you lost so very much in not getting maryanne brown  maryanne brown is a handsome young woman said robinson  why shes as red as red said mrs brisket quite carroty they tell me and as for handsome mr robinsonhandsome is as handsome does thats what i say if i had two sweethearts going about talking of gunpowder and throwing themselves into rivers along of me ididid never forgive myself so mr robinson i hope youll suit yourself soon bill dont you take any more of that brandy dont now when i tell you not  then robinson rose and took his leave promising to make future visits to aldersgate street and as brisket squeezed his hand at parting all the circumstances of that marriage were explained in a very few words she had three hundred down you knowreally down so i said done and done when i found the money wasnt there with maryanne and i think that ive seen my way  robinson congratulated him and assured him that he thought he had seen it very clearly     chapter xxiv  george robinsons dream   george robinson though his present wants were provided for by his pen was by no means disposed to sink into a literary hack it was by commerce that he desired to shine it was to tradetrade in the highest sense of the wordthat his ambition led him down at the crystal palace he had stood by the hour together before the statue of the great cheethamominous nameof him who three centuries ago had made money by dealing in manchester goods why should not he also have his statue but then how was he to begin he had begun and failed with hopeful words he had declared to mr brown that not on that account was he daunted but still there was before him the burden of another commencement many of us know what it is to have high hopes and yet to feel from time to time a terrible despondency when the labours come by which those hopes should be realized robinson had complained that he was impeded in his flight by brown and jones those impediments had dropped from him now and yet he knew not how to proceed upon his course  he walked forth one evening after his daily task pondering these things as he went he made his solitary way along the kingsland road through tottenham and on to edmonton thinking deeply of his future career what had john gilpin done that had made him a citizen of renown had he advertised or had he contented himself simply with standing behind his counter till customers should come to him in john gilpins time the science of advertisement was not bornor if born was in its earliest infancy and yet he had achieved renown and cheethambut probably cheetham had commenced with a capital  thus he walked on till he found himself among the fieldsthose first fields which greet the eyes of a londoner in which wheat is not grown but cabbages and carrots for the london market and here seating himself upon a gate he gave his mind up to a close study of the subject first he took from his pocket a short list which he always carried and once more read over the names and figures which it bore      barlywig £40000 per annum   how did barlywig begin such an outlay as that he knew that barlywig had as a boy walked up to town with twopence in his pocket and in his early days had swept out the shop of a shoemaker the giants of trade all have done that then he went on with the list      holloway       £30000 per annum    moses           10000         macassar oil      10000         dr de jongh      10000        what a glorious fraternity there were many others that followed with figures almost equally stupendous revalenta arabica bedsteads paletots food for cattle but then how did these great men begin he himself had begun with some money in his hand and had failed as to them he believed that they had all begun with twopence as for genius and special talent it was admitted on all sides that he possessed it of that he could feel no doubt as other men were willing to employ him  shall i never enjoy the fruits of my own labour said he to himself must i still be as the bee whose honey is robbed from him as soon as made      the lofty rhyme i still must build    though other hands shall touch the money   will this be my fate for ever      the patient oxen till the furrows    but never eat the generous corn   shall the corn itself never be my own  and as he sat there the words of poppins came upon his memory you advertising chaps never do anything all that printing never makes the world any richer at the moment he had laughed down poppins with absolute scorn but now at this solitary moment he began to reflect whether there might be any wisdom in his young friends words the question has been argued he continued in his soliloquy by the greatest philosopher of the age a man goes into hats and in order to force a sale he builds a large cart in the shape of a hat paints it blue and has it drawn through the streets he still finds that his sale is not rapid and with a view of increasing it what shall he do shall he make his felt hats better or shall he make his wooden hat bigger poppins and the philosopher say that the former plan will make the world the richer but they do not say that it will sell the greater number of hats am i to look after the world am i not to look to myself is not the world a collection of individuals all of whom are doing so has anything been done for the world by the quixotic aspirations of general philanthropy at all equal to that which individual enterprise has achieved poppins and the philosopher would spend their energies on a good hat but why not that they love the head that is to wear it the sale would still be their object they would sell hats not that the heads of men may be well covered but that they themselves might live and become rich to force a sale must be the first duty of a man in trade and a mans first duty should be all in all to him  if the hats sold from the different marts be not good enough with whom does the fault rest is it not with the customers who purchase them am i to protect the man who demands from me a cheap hat am i to say sir here is a cheap hat it is made of brown paper and the gum will run from it in the first shower it will come to pieces when worn and disgrace you among your female acquaintances by becoming dinged and bulged should i do him good he would buy his cheap hat elsewhere and tell pleasant stories of the madman he had met the world of purchasers will have cheap articles and the world of commerce must supply them the world of purchasers will have their ears tickled and the world of commerce must tickle them of what use is all this about adulteration if mrs jones will buy her sausages at a lower price per pound than pork fetches in the market has she a right to complain when some curious doctor makes her understand that her viands have not been supplied exclusively from the pig she insists on milk at three halfpence a quart but the cow will not produce it the cow cannot produce it at that price unless she be aided by the pump and therefore the pump aids her if there be dishonesty in this it is with the purchaser not with the vendorwith the public not with the tradesman  but still as he sat upon the gate thus arguing with himself a dream came over him a mist of thought as it were whispering to him strangely that even yet he might be wrong he endeavoured to throw it off shaking himself as it were and striving to fix his mind firmly upon his old principles but it was of no avail he knew he was awake but yet he dreamed and his dream was to him as a terrible nightmare  what if he were wrong what if those two philosophers had on their side some truth he would fain be honest if he knew the way what if those names upon his list were the names of false gods whose worship would lead him to a hell of swindlers instead of the bright heaven of commercial nobility barlywig is in parliament he said to himself over and over again in loud tones striving to answer the spirit of his dream in parliament he sits upon committees men jostle to speak to him and he talks loud among the big ones of the earth he spends forty thousand a year in his advertisements and grows incredibly rich by the expenditure men and women flock in crowds to his shop he lives at albert gate in a house big enough for a royal duke and is the lord of ten thousand acres in yorkshire barlywig cannot have been wrong let that philosopher philosophize as he will but still the dream was there crushing him like a nightmare  why dont you produce something so as to make the world richer poppins had said he knew well what poppins had meant by making the world richer if a man invent a katakairion shirt he does make the world richer if it be a good one he makes it much richer but the man who simply says that he has done so adds nothing to the worlds wealth his answer had been that it was his work to sell the shirts and that of the purchaser to buy them let each look to his own work if he could be successful in his selling then he would have a right to be proud of his success the world would be best served by close attention on the part of each to his own business such had been the arguments with which he had silenced his friend and contented himself while the excitement of the shop in bishopsgate street was continued but now as he sat there upon the gate this dream came upon him and he began to doubt could it be that a man had a double duty each separate from the othera duty domestic and private requiring his devotion and loyalty to his wife his children his partners and himself and another duty widely extended in all its bearings and due to the world in which he lived could poppins have seen this while he was blind was a man bound to produce true shirts for the worlds benefit even though he should make no money by so doingeither true shirts or none at all  the evening light fell upon him as he still sat there on the gate and he became very melancholy if i have been wrong he said to himself i must give up the fight i cannot begin again now and learn new precepts after all that i have done with that old mans money i cannot now own that i have been wrong and commence again on a theory taught to me by poppins if this be so then farewell to commerce and as he said so he dropped from his seat and leaning over the rail hid his face within his hands  as he stood there suddenly a sound struck his ears and he knew that the bells of edmonton were ringing the church was distant but nevertheless the tones came sharp upon him with their clear music they rang on quickly loudly and with articulate voice surely there were words within those sounds what was it they were saying to him he listened for a few seconds for a minute or two for five minutes and then his ear and senses had recognized the languageturn again robinson member of parliament he heard it so distinctly that his ear would not for a moment abandon the promise the words could not be mistaken turn again robinson member of parliament  then he did turn and walked back to london with a trusting heart    london printed by smith elder and co old bailey ec
