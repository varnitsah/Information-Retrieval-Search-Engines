a maelstrom  dont laugh you grinning ape  doyousee you frightful kid  whats all this about jimmy wyatt  mike and the ball arrived almost simultaneously  what the dickens are you doing here  psmith seized and emptied jellicoes jug over spiller  why did you say you didnt play cricket he asked  who he shouted who has done this  didyouputthatbootthere smith  mike dropped the sootcovered object in the fender     chapter i  mike   it was a morning in the middle of april and the jackson family were consequently breakfasting in comparative silence the cricket season had not begun and except during the cricket season they were in the habit of devoting their powerful minds at breakfast almost exclusively to the task of victualling against the labours of the day in may june july and august the silence was broken the three grownup jacksons played regularly in firstclass cricket and there was always keen competition among their brothers and sisters for the copy of the sportsman which was to be found on the hall table with the letters whoever got it usually gloated over it in silence till urged wrathfully by the multitude to let them know what had happened when it would appear that joe had notched his seventh century or that reggie had been run out when he was just getting set or as sometimes occurred that that ass frank had dropped fry or hayward in the slips before he had scored with the result that the spared expert had made a couple of hundred and was still going strong  in such a case the criticisms of the family circle particularly of the smaller jackson sisters were so breezy and unrestrained that mrs jackson generally felt it necessary to apply the closure indeed marjory jackson aged fourteen had on three several occasions been fined pudding at lunch for her caustic comments on the batting of her brother reggie in important fixtures cricket was a tradition in the family and the ladies unable to their sorrow to play the game themselves were resolved that it should not be their fault if the standard was not kept up  on this particular morning silence reigned a deep gasp from some small jackson wrestling with breadandmilk and an occasional remark from mr jackson on the letters he was reading alone broke it  mikes late again said mrs jackson plaintively at last  hes getting up said marjory i went in to see what he was doing and he was asleep so she added with a satanic chuckle i squeezed a sponge over him he swallowed an awful lot and then he woke up and tried to catch me so hes certain to be down soon  marjory  well he was on his back with his mouth wide open i had to he was snoring like anything  you might have choked him  i did said marjory with satisfaction jam please phyllis you pig  mr jackson looked up  mike will have to be more punctual when he goes to wrykyn he said  oh father is mike going to wrykyn asked marjory when  next term said mr jackson ive just heard from mr wain he added across the table to mrs jackson the house is full but he is turning a small room into an extra dormitory so he can take mike after all  the first comment on this momentous piece of news came from bob jackson bob was eighteen the following term would be his last at wrykyn and having won through so far without the infliction of a small brother he disliked the prospect of not being allowed to finish as he had begun  i say he said what  he ought to have gone before said mr jackson hes fifteen much too old for that private school he has had it all his own way there and it isnt good for him  hes got cheek enough for ten agreed bob  wrykyn will do him a world of good  we arent in the same house thats one comfort  bob was in donaldsons it softened the blow to a certain extent that mike should be going to wains he had the same feeling for mike that most boys of eighteen have for their fifteenyearold brothers he was fond of him in the abstract but preferred him at a distance  marjory gave tongue again she had rescued the jam from phyllis who had shown signs of finishing it and was now at liberty to turn her mind to less pressing matters mike was her special ally and anything that affected his fortunes affected her  hooray mikes going to wrykyn i bet he gets into the first eleven his first term  considering there are eight old colours left said bob loftily besides heaps of last years seconds its hardly likely that a kid like mikell get a look in he might get his third if he sweats  the aspersion stung marjory  i bet he gets in before you anyway she said  bob disdained to reply he was among those heaps of last years seconds to whom he had referred he was a sound bat though lacking the brilliance of his elder brothers and he fancied that his cap was a certainty this season last year he had been tried once or twice this year it should be all right  mrs jackson intervened  go on with your breakfast marjory she said you mustnt say i bet so much  marjory bit off a section of her slice of breadandjam  anyhow i bet he does she muttered truculently through it  there was a sound of footsteps in the passage outside the door opened and the missing member of the family appeared mike jackson was tall for his age his figure was thin and wiry his arms and legs looked a shade too long for his body he was evidently going to be very tall some day in face he was curiously like his brother joe whose appearance is familiar to every one who takes an interest in firstclass cricket the resemblance was even more marked on the cricket field mike had joes batting style to the last detail he was a pocket edition of his centurymaking brother hullo he said sorry im late  this was mere stereo he had made the same remark nearly every morning since the beginning of the holidays  all right marjory you little beast was his reference to the sponge incident  his third remark was of a practical nature  i say whats under that dish  mike began mr jacksonthis again was stereoyou really must learn to be more punctual  he was interrupted by a chorus  mike youre going to wrykyn next term shouted marjory  mike fathers just had a letter to say youre going to wrykyn next term from phyllis  mike youre going to wrykyn from ella  gladys maud evangeline aged three obliged with a solo of her own composition in sixeight time as follows mike wryky mike wryky mike wryke wryke wryke mike wryke wryke mike wryke mike wryke  oh put a green baize cloth over that kid somebody groaned bob  whereat gladys maud having fixed him with a chilly stare for some seconds suddenly drew a long breath and squealed deafeningly for more milk  mike looked round the table it was a great moment he rose to it with the utmost dignity  good he said i say whats under that dish                                       after breakfast mike and marjory went off together to the meadow at the end of the garden saunders the professional assisted by the gardeners boy was engaged in putting up the net mr jackson believed in private coaching and every spring since joe the eldest of the family had been able to use a bat a man had come down from the oval to teach him the best way to do so each of the boys in turn had passed from spectators to active participants in the net practice in the meadow for several years now saunders had been the chosen man and his attitude towards the jacksons was that of the faithful old retainer in melodrama mike was his special favourite he felt that in him he had material of the finest order to work upon there was nothing the matter with bob in bob he would turn out a good sound article bob would be a blue in his third or fourth year and probably a creditable performer among the rank and file of a county team later on but he was not a cricket genius like mike saunders would lie awake at night sometimes thinking of the possibilities that were in mike the strength could only come with years but the style was there already joes style with improvements  mike put on his pads and marjory walked with the professional to the bowling crease  mikes going to wrykyn next term saunders she said all the boys were there you know so was father ages ago  is he miss i was thinking he would be soon  do you think hell get into the school team  school team miss master mike get into a school team hell be playing for england in another eight years thats what hell be playing for  yes but i meant next term it would be a record if he did even joe only got in after hed been at school two years dont you think he might saunders hes awfully good isnt he hes better than bob isnt he and bobs almost certain to get in this term  saunders looked a little doubtful  next term he said well you see miss its this way its all there in a manner of speaking with master mike hes got as much style as mr joes got every bit the whole thing is you see miss you get these young gentlemen of eighteen and nineteen perhaps and it stands to reason theyre stronger theres a young gentleman perhaps doesnt know as much about what i call real playing as master mikes forgotten but then he can hit em harder when he does hit em and thats where the runs come in they arent going to play master mike because hell be in the england team when he leaves school theyll give the cap to somebody that can make a few then and there  but mikes jolly strong  ah im not saying it mightnt be miss i was only saying dont count on it so you wont be disappointed if it doesnt happen its quite likely that it will only all i say is dont count on it i only hope that they wont knock all the style out of him before theyre done with him you know these school professionals miss  no i dont saunders what are they like  well theres too much of the comerightoutateverything about em for my taste seem to think playing forward the alpha and omugger of batting theyll make him pat balls back to the bowler which hed cut for twos and threes if he was left to himself still well hope for the best miss ready master mike play  as saunders had said it was all there of mikes style there could be no doubt today too he was playing more strongly than usual marjory had to run to the end of the meadow to fetch one straight drive he hit that hard enough didnt he saunders she asked as she returned the ball  if he could keep on doing ones like that miss said the professional theyd have him in the team before you could say knife  marjory sat down again beside the net and watched more hopefully     chapter ii  the journey down   the seeing off of mike on the last day of the holidays was an imposing spectacle a sort of pageant going to a public school especially at the beginning of the summer term is no great hardship more particularly when the departing hero has a brother on the verge of the school eleven and three other brothers playing for counties and mike seemed in no way disturbed by the prospect mothers however to the end of time will foster a secret fear that their sons will be bullied at a big school and mrs jacksons anxious look lent a fine solemnity to the proceedings  and as marjory phyllis and ella invariably broke down when the time of separation arrived and made no exception to their rule on the present occasion a suitable gloom was the keynote of the gathering mr jackson seemed to bear the parting with fortitude as did mikes uncle john providentially roped in at the eleventh hour on his way to scotland in time to come down with a handsome tip to their coarsefibred minds there was nothing pathetic or tragic about the affair at all at the very moment when the train began to glide out of the station uncle john was heard to remark that in his opinion these bocks werent a patch on the old shaped larranaga among others present might have been noticed saunders practising late cuts rather coyly with a walkingstick in the background the village idiot who had rolled up on the chance of a dole gladys maud evangelines nurse smiling vaguely and gladys maud evangeline herself frankly bored with the whole business  the train gathered speed the air was full of last messages uncle john said on second thoughts he wasnt sure these bocks werent half a bad smoke after all gladys maud cried because she had taken a sudden dislike to the village idiot and mike settled himself in the corner and opened a magazine  he was alone in the carriage bob who had been spending the last week of the holidays with an aunt further down the line was to board the train at east wobsley and the brothers were to make a state entry into wrykyn together meanwhile mike was left to his milk chocolate his magazines and his reflections  the latter were not numerous nor profound he was excited he had been petitioning the home authorities for the past year to be allowed to leave his private school and go to wrykyn and now the thing had come about he wondered what sort of a house wains was and whether they had any chance of the cricket cup according to bob they had no earthly but then bob only recognised one house donaldsons he wondered if bob would get his first eleven cap this year and if he himself were likely to do anything at cricket marjory had faithfully reported every word saunders had said on the subject but bob had been so careful to point out his insignificance when compared with the humblest wrykynian that the professionals glowing prophecies had not had much effect it might be true that some day he would play for england but just at present he felt he would exchange his place in the team for one in the wrykyn third eleven a sort of mist enveloped everything wrykynian it seemed almost hopeless to try and compete with these unknown experts on the other hand there was bob bob by all accounts was on the verge of the first eleven and he was nothing special  while he was engaged on these reflections the train drew up at a small station opposite the door of mikes compartment was standing a boy of about mikes size though evidently some years older he had a sharp face with rather a prominent nose and a pair of pincenez gave him a supercilious look he wore a bowler hat and carried a small portmanteau  he opened the door and took the seat opposite to mike whom he scrutinised for a moment rather after the fashion of a naturalist examining some new and unpleasant variety of beetle he seemed about to make some remark but instead got up and looked through the open window  wheres that porter mike heard him say  the porter came skimming down the platform at that moment  porter  sir  are those frightful boxes of mine in all right  yes sir  because you know therell be a frightful row if any of them get lost  no chance of that sir  here you are then  thank you sir  the youth drew his head and shoulders in stared at mike again and finally sat down mike noticed that he had nothing to read and wondered if he wanted anything but he did not feel equal to offering him one of his magazines he did not like the looks of him particularly judging by appearances he seemed to carry enough side for three if he wanted a magazine thought mike let him ask for it  the other made no overtures and at the next stop got out that explained his magazineless condition he was only travelling a short way  good business said mike to himself he had all the englishmans love of a carriage to himself  the train was just moving out of the station when his eye was suddenly caught by the strangers bag lying snugly in the rack  and here i regret to say mike acted from the best motives which is always fatal  he realised in an instant what had happened the fellow had forgotten his bag  mike had not been greatly fascinated by the strangers looks but after all the most supercilious person on earth has a right to his own property besides he might have been quite a nice fellow when you got to know him anyhow the bag had better be returned at once the trainwas already moving quite fast and mikes compartment was nearing the end of the platform  he snatched the bag from the rack and hurled it out of the window porter robinson who happened to be in the line of fire escaped with a flesh wound then he sat down again with the inward glow of satisfaction which comes to one when one has risen successfully to a sudden emergency                                       the glow lasted till the next stoppage which did not occur for a good many miles then it ceased abruptly for the train had scarcely come to a standstill when the opening above the door was darkened by a head and shoulders the head was surmounted by a bowler and a pair of pincenez gleamed from the shadow  hullo i say said the stranger have you changed carriages or what  no said mike  then dash it wheres my frightful bag  life teems with embarrassing situations this was one of them  the fact is said mike i chucked it out  chucked it out what do you mean when  at the last station  the guard blew his whistle and the other jumped into the carriage  i thought youd got out there for good explained mike im awfully sorry  where is the bag  on the platform at the last station it hit a porter  against his will for he wished to treat the matter with fitting solemnity mike grinned at the recollection the look on porter robinsons face as the bag took him in the small of the back had been funny though not intentionally so  the bereaved owner disapproved of this levity and said as much  dont grin you little beast he shouted theres nothing to laugh at you go chucking bags that dont belong to you out of the window and then you have the frightful cheek to grin about it  it wasnt that said mike hurriedly only the porter looked awfully funny when it hit him  dash the porter whats going to happen about my bag i cant get out for half a second to buy a magazine without your flinging my things about the platform what you want is a frightful kicking  the situation was becoming difficult but fortunately at this moment the train stopped once again and looking out of the window mike saw a board with east wobsley upon it in large letters a moment later bobs head appeared in the doorway  hullo there you are said bob  his eye fell upon mikes companion  hullo gazeka he exclaimed where did you spring from do you know my brother hes coming to wrykyn this term by the way rather lucky youve met hes in your house firbysmiths head of wains mike  mike gathered that gazeka and firbysmith were one and the same person he grinned again firbysmith continued to look ruffled though not aggressive  oh are you in wains he said  i say bob said mike ive made rather an ass of myself  naturally  i mean what happened was this i chucked firbysmiths portmanteau out of the window thinking hed got out only he hadnt really and its at a station miles back  youre a bit of a rotter arent you had it got your name and address on it gazeka  yes  oh then its certain to be all right its bound to turn up some time theyll send it on by the next train and youll get it either tonight or tomorrow  frightful nuisance all the same lots of things in it i wanted  oh never mind its all right i say what have you been doing in the holidays i didnt know you lived on this line at all  from this point onwards mike was out of the conversation altogether bob and firbysmith talked of wrykyn discussing events of the previous term of which mike had never heard names came into their conversation which were entirely new to him he realised that school politics were being talked and that contributions from him to the dialogue were not required he took up his magazine again listening the while they were discussing wains now the name wyatt cropped up with some frequency wyatt was apparently something of a character mention was made of rows in which he had played a part in the past  it must be pretty rotten for him said bob he and wain never get on very well and yet they have to be together holidays as well as term pretty bad having a stepfather at alli shouldnt care toand when your housemaster and your stepfather are the same man its a bit thick  frightful agreed firbysmith  i swear if i were in wyatts place i should rot about like anything it isnt as if hed anything to look forward to when he leaves he told me last term that wain had got a nomination for him in some beastly bank and that he was going into it directly after the end of this term rather rough on a chap like wyatt good cricketer and footballer i mean and all that sort of thing its just the sort of life hell hate most hullo here we are  mike looked out of the window it was wrykyn at last     chapter iii  mike finds a friendly native   mike was surprised to find on alighting that the platform was entirely free from wrykynians in all the stories he had read the whole school came back by the same train and having smashed in one anothers hats and chaffed the porters made their way to the school buildings in a solid column but here they were alone  a remark of bobs to firbysmith explained this cant make out why none of the fellows came back by this train he said heaps of them must come by this line and its the only christian train they run  dont want to get here before the last minute they can possibly manage silly idea i suppose they think thered be nothing to do  what shall we do said bob come and have some tea at cooks  all right  bob looked at mike there was no disguising the fact that he would be in the way but how convey this fact delicately to him  look here mike he said with a happy inspiration firbysmith and i are just going to get some tea i think youd better nip up to the school probably wain will want to see you and tell you all about things which is your dorm and so on see you later he concluded airily any onell tell you the way to the school go straight on theyll send your luggage on later so long and his sole prop in this world of strangers departed leaving him to find his way for himself  there is no subject on which opinions differ so widely as this matter of finding the way to a place to the man who knows it is simplicity itself probably he really does imagine that he goes straight on ignoring the fact that for him the choice of three roads all more or less straight has no perplexities the man who does not know feels as if he were in a maze  mike started out boldly and lost his way go in which direction he would he always seemed to arrive at a square with a fountain and an equestrian statue in its centre on the fourth repetition of this feat he stopped in a disheartened way and looked about him he was beginning to feel bitter towards bob the man might at least have shown him where to get some tea  at this moment a ray of hope shone through the gloom crossing the square was a short thickset figure clad in grey flannel trousers a blue blazer and a straw hat with a coloured band plainly a wrykynian mike made for him  can you tell me the way to the school please he said  oh youre going to the school said the other he had a pleasant squarejawed face reminiscent of a goodtempered bulldog and a pair of very deepset grey eyes which somehow put mike at his ease there was something singularly cool and genial about them he felt that they saw the humour in things and that their owner was a person who liked most people and whom most people liked  you look rather lost said the stranger been hunting for it long  yes said mike  which house do you want  wains  wains then youve come to the right man this time what i dont know about wains isnt worth knowing  are you there too  am i not term and holidays theres no close season for me  oh are you wyatt then asked mike  hullo this is fame how did you know my name as the ass in the detective story always says to the detective whos seen it in the lining of his hat whos been talking about me  i heard my brother saying something about you in the train  whos your brother  jackson hes in donaldsons  i know a stout fellow so youre the newest make of jackson latest model with all the modern improvements are there any more of you  not brothers said mike  pity you cant quite raise a team then are you a sort of young tyldesley too  i played a bit at my last school only a private school you know added mike modestly  make any runs what was your best score  hundred and twentythree said mike awkwardly it was only against kids you know he was in terror lest he should seem to be bragging  thats pretty useful any more centuries  yes said mike shuffling  how many  seven altogether you know it was really awfully rotten bowling and i was a good bit bigger than most of the chaps there and my pater always has a pro down in the easter holidays which gave me a bit of an advantage  all the same seven centuries isnt so dusty against any bowling we shall want some batting in the house this term look here i was just going to have some tea you come along too  oh thanks awfully said mike my brother and firbysmith have gone to a place called cooks  the old gazeka i didnt know he lived in your part of the world hes head of wains  yes i know said mike why is he called gazeka he asked after a pause  dont you think he looks like one what did you think of him  i didnt speak to him much said mike cautiously it is always delicate work answering a question like this unless one has some sort of an inkling as to the views of the questioner  hes all right said wyatt answering for himself hes got a habit of talking to one as if he were a prince of the blood dropping a gracious word to one of the three smallheads at the hippodrome but thats his misfortune we all have our troubles thats his lets go in here its too far to sweat to cooks  it was about a mile from the teashop to the school mikes first impression on arriving at the school grounds was of his smallness and insignificance everything looked so bigthe buildings the grounds everything he felt out of the picture he was glad that he had met wyatt to make his entrance into this strange land alone would have been more of an ordeal than he would have cared to face  thats wains said wyatt pointing to one of half a dozen large houses which lined the road on the south side of the cricket field mike followed his finger and took in the size of his new home  i say its jolly big he said how many fellows are there in it  thirtyone this term i believe  thats more than there were at kinghalls  whats kinghalls  the private school i was at at emsworth  emsworth seemed very remote and unreal to him as he spoke  they skirted the cricket field walking along the path that divided the two terraces the wrykyn playingfields were formed of a series of huge steps cut out of the hill at the top of the hill came the school on the first terrace was a sort of informal practice ground where though no games were played on it there was a good deal of punting and dropkicking in the winter and fieldingpractice in the summer the next terrace was the biggest of all and formed the first eleven cricket ground a beautiful piece of turf a shade too narrow for its length bounded on the terrace side by a sharply sloping bank some fifteen feet deep and on the other by the precipice leading to the next terrace at the far end of the ground stood the pavilion and beside it a little ivycovered rabbithutch for the scorers old wrykynians always claimed that it was the prettiest school ground in england it certainly had the finest view from the verandah of the pavilion you could look over three counties  wains house wore an empty and desolate appearance there were signs of activity however inside and a smell of soap and warm water told of preparations recently completed  wyatt took mike into the matrons room a small room opening out of the main passage  this is jackson he said which dormitory is he in miss payne  the matron consulted a paper  hes in yours wyatt  good business whos in the other bed there are going to be three of us arent there  fereira was to have slept there but we have just heard that he is not coming back this term he has had to go on a seavoyage for his health  seems queer any one actually taking the trouble to keep fereira in the world said wyatt ive often thought of giving him rough on rats myself come along jackson and ill show you the room  they went along the passage and up a flight of stairs  here you are said wyatt  it was a fairsized room the window heavily barred looked out over a large garden  i used to sleep here alone last term said wyatt but the house is so full now theyve turned it into a dormitory  i say i wish these bars werent here it would be rather a rag to get out of the window on to that wall at night and hop down into the garden and explore said mike  wyatt looked at him curiously and moved to the window  im not going to let you do it of course he said because youd go getting caught and dropped on which isnt good for one in ones first term but just to amuse you  he jerked at the middle bar and the next moment he was standing with it in his hand and the way to the garden was clear  by jove said mike  thats simply an objectlesson you know said wyatt replacing the bar and pushing the screws back into their putty i get out at night myself because i think my health needs it besides its my last term anyhow so it doesnt matter what i do but if i find you trying to cut out in the small hours therell be trouble see  all right said mike reluctantly but i wish youd let me  not if i know it promise you wont try it on  all right but i say what do you do out there  i shoot at cats with an airpistol the beauty of which is that even if you hit them it doesnt hurtsimply keeps them bright and interested in life and if you miss youve had all the fun anyhow have you ever shot at a rocketing cat finest mark you can have societys latest craze buy a pistol and see life  i wish youd let me come  i daresay you do not much however now if you like ill take you over the rest of the school youll have to see it sooner or later so you may as well get it over at once     chapter iv  at the nets   there are few better things in life than a public school summer term the winter term is good especially towards the end and there are points though not many about the easter term but it is in the summer that one really appreciates public school life the freedom of it after the restrictions of even the most easygoing private school is intoxicating the change is almost as great as that from public school to varsity  for mike the path was made particularly easy the only drawback to going to a big school for the first time is the fact that one is made to feel so very small and inconspicuous new boys who have been leading lights at their private schools feel it acutely for the first week at one time it was the custom if we may believe writers of a generation or so back for boys to take quite an embarrassing interest in the newcomer he was asked a rain of questions and was generally in the very centre of the stage nowadays an absolute lack of interest is the fashion a new boy arrives and there he is one of a crowd  mike was saved this salutary treatment to a large extent at first by virtue of the greatness of his family and later by his own performances on the cricket field his three elder brothers were objects of veneration to most wrykynians and mike got a certain amount of reflected glory from them the brother of firstclass cricketers has a dignity of his own then bob was a help he was on the verge of the cricket team and had been the school fullback for two seasons mike found that people came up and spoke to him anxious to know if he were jacksons brother and became friendly when he replied in the affirmative influential relations are a help in every stage of life  it was wyatt who gave him his first chance at cricket there were nets on the first afternoon of term for all old colours of the three teams and a dozen or so of those most likely to fill the vacant places wyatt was there of course he had got his first eleven cap in the previous season as a mighty hitter and a fair slow bowler mike met him crossing the field with his cricket bag  hullo where are you off to asked wyatt coming to watch the nets  mike had no particular programme for the afternoon junior cricket had not begun and it was a little difficult to know how to fill in the time  i tell you what said wyatt nip into the house and shove on some things and ill try and get burgess to let you have a knock later on  this suited mike admirably a quarter of an hour later he was sitting at the back of the first eleven net watching the practice  burgess the captain of the wrykyn team made no pretence of being a bat he was the school fast bowler and concentrated his energies on that department of the game he sometimes took ten minutes at the wicket after everybody else had had an innings but it was to bowl that he came to the nets  he was bowling now to one of the old colours whose name mike did not know wyatt and one of the professionals were the other two bowlers two nets away firbysmith who had changed his pincenez for a pair of huge spectacles was performing rather ineffectively against some very bad bowling mike fixed his attention on the first eleven man  he was evidently a good bat there was style and power in his batting he had a way of gliding burgesss fastest to leg which mike admired greatly he was succeeded at the end of a quarter of an hour by another eleven man and then bob appeared  it was soon made evident that this was not bobs day nobody is at his best on the first day of term but bob was worse than he had any right to be he scratched forward at nearly everything and when burgess who had been resting took up the ball again he had each stump uprooted in a regular series in seven balls once he skied one of wyatts slows over the net behind the wicket and mike jumping up caught him neatly  thanks said bob austerely as mike returned the ball to him he seemed depressed  towards the end of the afternoon wyatt went up to burgess  burgess he said see that kid sitting behind the net  with the naked eye said burgess why  hes just come to wains hes bob jacksons brother and ive a sort of idea that hes a bit of a bat i told him id ask you if he could have a knock why not send him in at the end net theres nobody there now  burgesss amiability off the field equalled his ruthlessness when bowling  all right he said only if you think that im going to sweat to bowl to him youre making a fatal error  you neednt do a thing just sit and watch i rather fancy this kids something special                                       mike put on wyatts pads and gloves borrowed his bat and walked round into the net  not in a funk are you asked wyatt as he passed  mike grinned the fact was that he had far too good an opinion of himself to be nervous an entirely modest person seldom makes a good batsman batting is one of those things which demand first and foremost a thorough belief in oneself it need not be aggressive but it must be there  wyatt and the professional were the bowlers mike had seen enough of wyatts bowling to know that it was merely ordinary slow tosh and the professional did not look as difficult as saunders the first halfdozen balls he played carefully he was on trial and he meant to take no risks then the professional overpitched one slightly on the off mike jumped out and got the full face of the bat on to it the ball hit one of the ropes of the net and nearly broke it  hows that said wyatt with the smile of an impresario on the first night of a successful piece  not bad admitted burgess  a few moments later he was still more complimentary he got up and took a ball himself  mike braced himself up as burgess began his run this time he was more than a trifle nervous the bowling he had had so far had been tame this would be the real ordeal  as the ball left burgesss hand he began instinctively to shape for a forward stroke then suddenly he realised that the thing was going to be a yorker and banged his bat down in the block just as the ball arrived an unpleasant sensation as of having been struck by a thunderbolt was succeeded by a feeling of relief that he had kept the ball out of his wicket there are easier things in the world than stopping a fast yorker  well played said burgess  mike felt like a successful general receiving the thanks of the nation  the fact that burgesss next ball knocked middle and off stumps out of the ground saddened him somewhat but this was the last tragedy that occurred he could not do much with the bowling beyond stopping it and feeling repetitions of the thunderbolt experience but he kept up his end and a short conversation which he had with burgess at the end of his innings was full of encouragement to one skilled in reading between the lines  thanks awfully said mike referring to the square manner in which the captain had behaved in letting him bat  what school were you at before you came here asked burgess  a private school in hampshire said mike kinghalls at a place called emsworth  get much cricket there  yes a good lot one of the masters a chap called westbrook was an awfully good slow bowler  burgess nodded  you dont run away which is something he said  mike turned purple with pleasure at this stately compliment then having waited for further remarks but gathering from the captains silence that the audience was at an end he proceeded to unbuckle his pads wyatt overtook him on his way to the house  well played he said id no idea you were such hot stuff youre a regular pro  i say said mike gratefully it was most awfully decent of you getting burgess to let me go in it was simply ripping of you  oh thats all right if you dont get pushed a bit here you stay for ages in the hundredth game with the cripples and the kids now youve shown them what you can do you ought to get into the under sixteen team straight away probably into the third too  by jove that would be all right  i asked burgess afterwards what he thought of your batting and he said not bad but he says that about everything its his highest form of praise he says it when he wants to let himself go and simply butter up a thing if you took him to see n a knox bowl hed say he wasnt bad what he meant was that he was jolly struck with your batting and is going to play you for the under sixteen  i hope so said mike  the prophecy was fulfilled on the following wednesday there was a match between the under sixteen and a scratch side mikes name was among the under sixteen and on the saturday he was playing for the third eleven in a trial game  this place is ripping he said to himself as he saw his name on the list thought i should like it  and that night he wrote a letter to his father notifying him of the fact     chapter v  revelry by night   a succession of events combined to upset mike during his first fortnight at school he was far more successful than he had any right to be at his age there is nothing more heady than success and if it comes before we are prepared for it it is apt to throw us off our balance as a rule at school years of wholesome obscurity make us ready for any small triumphs we may achieve at the end of our time there mike had skipped these years he was older than the average new boy and his batting was undeniable he knew quite well that he was regarded as a find by the cricket authorities and the knowledge was not particularly good for him it did not make him conceited for his was not a nature at all addicted to conceit the effect it had on him was to make him excessively pleased with life and when mike was pleased with life he always found a difficulty in obeying authority and its rules his state of mind was not improved by an interview with bob  some evil genius put it into bobs mind that it was his duty to be if only for one performance the heavy elder brother to mike to give him good advice it is never the smallest use for an elder brother to attempt to do anything for the good of a younger brother at school for the latter rebels automatically against such interference in his concerns but bob did not know this he only knew that he had received a letter from home in which his mother had assumed without evidence that he was leading mike by the hand round the pitfalls of life at wrykyn and his conscience smote him beyond asking him occasionally when they met how he was getting on a question to which mike invariably replied oh all right he was not aware of having done anything brotherly towards the youngster so he asked mike to tea in his study one afternoon before going to the nets  mike arrived sidling into the study in the halfsheepish halfdefiant manner peculiar to small brothers in the presence of their elders and stared in silence at the photographs on the walls bob was changing into his cricket things the atmosphere was one of constraint and awkwardness  the arrival of tea was the cue for conversation  well how are you getting on asked bob  oh all right said mike  silence  sugar asked bob  thanks said mike  how many lumps  two please  cake  thanks  silence  bob pulled himself together  like wains  ripping  i asked firbysmith to keep an eye on you said bob  what said mike  the mere idea of a worm like the gazeka being told to keep an eye on him was degrading  he said hed look after you added bob making things worse  look after him him m jackson of the third eleven  mike helped himself to another chunk of cake and spoke crushingly  he neednt trouble he said i can look after myself all right thanks  bob saw an opening for the entry of the heavy elder brother  look here mike he said im only saying it for your good  i should like to state here that it was not bobs habit to go about the world telling people things solely for their good he was only doing it now to ease his conscience  yes said mike coldly  its only this you know i should keep an eye on myself if i were you theres nothing that gets a chap so barred here as side  what do you mean said mike outraged  oh im not saying anything against you so far said bob youve been all right up to now what i mean to say is youve got on so well at cricket in the third and so on theres just a chance you might start to side about a bit soon if you dont watch yourself im not saying a word against you so far of course only you see what i mean  mikes feelings were too deep for words in sombre silence he reached out for the jam while bob satisfied that he had delivered his message in a pleasant and tactful manner filled his cup and cast about him for further words of wisdom  seen you about with wyatt a good deal he said at length  yes said mike  like him  yes said mike cautiously  you know said bob i shouldnti mean i should take care what youre doing with wyatt  what do you mean  well hes an awfully good chap of course but still  still what  well i mean hes the sort of chap wholl probably get into some thundering row before he leaves he doesnt care a hang what he does hes that sort of chap hes never been dropped on yet but if you go on breaking rules youre bound to be sooner or later thing is it doesnt matter much for him because hes leaving at the end of the term but dont let him drag you into anything not that he would try to but you might think it was the blood thing to do to imitate him and the first thing you knew youd be dropped on by wain or somebody see what i mean  bob was wellintentioned but tact did not enter greatly into his composition  what rot said mike  all right but dont you go doing it im going over to the nets i see burgess has shoved you down for them youd better be going and changing stick on here a bit though if you want any more tea ive got to be off myself  mike changed for netpractice in a ferment of spiritual injury it was maddening to be treated as an infant who had to be looked after he felt very sore against bob  a good innings at the third eleven net followed by some strenuous fielding in the deep soothed his ruffled feelings to a large extent and all might have been well but for the intervention of firbysmith  that youth all spectacles and front teeth met mike at the door of wains  ah i wanted to see you young man he said mike disliked being called young man come up to my study  mike followed him in silence to his study and preserved his silence till firbysmith having deposited his cricketbag in a corner of the room and examined himself carefully in a lookingglass that hung over the mantelpiece spoke again  ive been hearing all about you young man mike shuffled  youre a frightful character from all accounts mike could not think of anything to say that was not rude so said nothing  your brother has asked me to keep an eye on you  mikes soul began to tie itself into knots again he was just at the age when one is most sensitive to patronage and most resentful of it  i promised i would said the gazeka turning round and examining himself in the mirror again youll get on all right if you behave yourself dont make a frightful row in the house dont cheek your elders and betters wash thats all cut along  mike had a vague idea of sacrificing his career to the momentary pleasure of flinging a chair at the head of the house overcoming this feeling he walked out of the room and up to his dormitory to change                                       in the dormitory that night the feeling of revolt of wanting to do something actively illegal increased like eric he burned not with shame and remorse but with rage and all that sort of thing he dropped off to sleep full of halfformed plans for asserting himself he was awakened from a dream in which he was batting against firbysmiths bowling and hitting it into space every time by a slight sound he opened his eyes and saw a dark figure silhouetted against the light of the window he sat up in bed  hullo he said is that you wyatt  are you awake said wyatt sorry if ive spoiled your beauty sleep  are you going out  i am said wyatt the cats are particularly strong on the wing just now mustnt miss a chance like this specially as theres a good moon too i shall be deadly  i say cant i come too  a moonlight prowl with or without an airpistol would just have suited mikes mood  no you cant said wyatt when im caught as im morally certain to be some day or night rather theyre bound to ask if youve ever been out as well as me then youll be able to put your hand on your little heart and do a big george washington act youll find that useful when the time comes  do you think you will be caught  shouldnt be surprised anyhow you stay where you are go to sleep and dream that youre playing for the school against ripton so long  and wyatt laying the bar he had extracted on the windowsill wriggled out mike saw him disappearing along the wall                                       it was all very well for wyatt to tell him to go to sleep but it was not so easy to do it the room was almost light and mike always found it difficult to sleep unless it was dark he turned over on his side and shut his eyes but he had never felt wider awake twice he heard the quarters chime from the school clock and the second time he gave up the struggle he got out of bed and went to the window it was a lovely night just the sort of night on which if he had been at home he would have been out after moths with a lantern  a sharp yowl from an unseen cat told of wyatts presence somewhere in the big garden he would have given much to be with him but he realised that he was on parole he had promised not to leave the house and there was an end of it  he turned away from the window and sat down on his bed then a beautiful consoling thought came to him he had given his word that he would not go into the garden but nothing had been said about exploring inside the house it was quite late now everybody would be in bed it would be quite safe and there must be all sorts of things to interest the visitor in wains part of the house food perhaps mike felt that he could just do with a biscuit and there were bound to be biscuits on the sideboard in wains diningroom  he crept quietly out of the dormitory  he had been long enough in the house to know the way in spite of the fact that all was darkness down the stairs along the passage to the left and up a few more stairs at the end the beauty of the position was that the diningroom had two doors one leading into wains part of the house the other into the boys section any interruption that there might be would come from the further door  to make himself more secure he locked that door then turning up the incandescent light he proceeded to look about him  mr wains diningroom repaid inspection there were the remains of supper on the table mike cut himself some cheese and took some biscuits from the box feeling that he was doing himself well this was life there was a little sodawater in the syphon he finished it as it swished into the glass it made a noise that seemed to him like three hundred niagaras but nobody else in the house appeared to have noticed it  he took some more biscuits and an apple  after which feeling a new man he examined the room  and this was where the trouble began  on a table in one corner stood a small gramophone and gramophones happened to be mikes particular craze  all thought of risk left him the sodawater may have got into his head or he may have been in a particularly reckless mood as indeed he was the fact remains that he inserted the first record that came to hand wound the machine up and set it going  the next moment very loud and nasal a voice from the machine announced that mr godfrey field would sing the quaint old bird and after a few preliminary chords mr field actually did so  auntie went to aldershot in a paris pompom hat  mike stood and drained it in   good gracious sang mr field what was that  it was a rattling at the handle of the door a rattling that turned almost immediately into a spirited banging a voice accompanied the banging who is there inquired the voice mike recognised it as mr wains he was not alarmed the man who holds the ace of trumps has no need to be alarmed his position was impregnable the enemy was held in check by the locked door while the other door offered an admirable and instantaneous way of escape  mike crept across the room on tiptoe and opened the window it had occurred to him just in time that if mr wain on entering the room found that the occupant had retired by way of the boys part of the house he might possibly obtain a clue to his identity if on the other hand he opened the window suspicion would be diverted mike had not read his raffles for nothing  the handlerattling was resumed this was good so long as the frontal attack was kept up there was no chance of his being taken in the rearhis only danger  he stopped the gramophone which had been pegging away patiently at the quaint old bird all the time and reflected it seemed a pity to evacuate the position and ring down the curtain on what was to date the most exciting episode of his life but he must not overdo the thing and get caught at any moment the noise might bring reinforcements to the besieging force though it was not likely for the diningroom was a long way from the dormitories and it might flash upon their minds that there were two entrances to the room or the same bright thought might come to wain himself  now what pondered mike would a j raffles have done in a case like this suppose hed been after somebodys jewels and found that they were after him and hed locked one door and could get away by the other  the answer was simple  hed clear out thought mike  two minutes later he was in bed  he lay there tingling all over with the consciousness of having played a masterly game when suddenly a gruesome idea came to him and he sat up breathless suppose wain took it into his head to make a tour of the dormitories to see that all was well wyatt was still in the garden somewhere blissfully unconscious of what was going on indoors he would be caught for a certainty     chapter vi  in which a tight corner is evaded   for a moment the situation paralysed mike then he began to be equal to it in times of excitement one thinks rapidly and clearly the main point the kernel of the whole thing was that he must get into the garden somehow and warn wyatt and at the same time he must keep mr wain from coming to the dormitory he jumped out of bed and dashed down the dark stairs  he had taken care to close the diningroom door after him it was open now and he could hear somebody moving inside the room evidently his retreat had been made just in time  he knocked at the door and went in  mr wain was standing at the window looking out he spun round at the knock and stared in astonishment at mikes pyjamaclad figure mike in spite of his anxiety could barely check a laugh mr wain was a tall thin man with a serious face partially obscured by a grizzled beard he wore spectacles through which he peered owlishly at mike his body was wrapped in a brown dressinggown his hair was ruffled he looked like some weird bird  please sir i thought i heard a noise said mike  mr wain continued to stare  what are you doing here said he at last  thought i heard a noise please sir  a noise  please sir a row  you thought you heard  the thing seemed to be worrying mr wain  so i came down sir said mike  the housemasters giant brain still appeared to be somewhat clouded he looked about him and catching sight of the gramophone drew inspiration from it  did you turn on the gramophone he asked  me sir said mike with the air of a bishop accused of contributing to the police news  of course not of course not said mr wain hurriedly of course not i dont know why i asked all this is very unsettling what are you doing here  thought i heard a noise please sir  a noise  a row sir  if it was mr wains wish that he should spend the night playing massa tambo to his massa bones it was not for him to baulk the housemasters innocent pleasure he was prepared to continue the snappy dialogue till breakfast time  i think there must have been a burglar in here jackson  looks like it sir  i found the window open  hes probably in the garden sir  mr wain looked out into the garden with an annoyed expression as if its behaviour in letting burglars be in it struck him as unworthy of a respectable garden  he might be still in the house said mr wain ruminatively  not likely sir  you think not  wouldnt be such a fool sir i mean such an ass sir  perhaps you are right jackson  i shouldnt wonder if he was hiding in the shrubbery sir  mr wain looked at the shrubbery as who should say et tu brute  by jove i think i see him cried mike he ran to the window and vaulted through it on to the lawn an inarticulate protest from mr wain rendered speechless by this move just as he had been beginning to recover his faculties and he was running across the lawn into the shrubbery he felt that all was well there might be a bit of a row on his return but he could always plead overwhelming excitement  wyatt was round at the back somewhere and the problem was how to get back without being seen from the diningroom window fortunately a belt of evergreens ran along the path right up to the house mike worked his way cautiously through these till he was out of sight then tore for the regions at the back  the moon had gone behind the clouds and it was not easy to find a way through the bushes twice branches sprang out from nowhere and hit mike smartly over the shins eliciting sharp howls of pain  on the second of these occasions a low voice spoke from somewhere on his right  who on earths that it said  mike stopped  is that you wyatt i say  jackson  the moon came out again and mike saw wyatt clearly his knees were covered with mould he had evidently been crouching in the bushes on all fours  you young ass said wyatt you promised me that you wouldnt get out  yes i know but  i heard you crashing through the shrubbery like a hundred elephants if you must get out at night and chance being sacked you might at least have the sense to walk quietly  yes but you dont understand  and mike rapidly explained the situation  but how the dickens did he hear you if you were in the diningroom asked wyatt its miles from his bedroom you must tread like a policeman  it wasnt that the thing was you see it was rather a rotten thing to do i suppose but i turned on the gramophone  youwhat  the gramophone it started playing the quaint old bird ripping it was till wain came along  wyatt doubled up with noiseless laughter  youre a genius he said i never saw such a man well whats the game now whats the idea  i think youd better nip back along the wall and in through the window and ill go back to the diningroom then itll be all right if wain comes and looks into the dorm or if you like you might come down too as if youd just woke up and thought youd heard a row  thats not a bad idea all right you dash along then ill get back  mr wain was still in the diningroom drinking in the beauties of the summer night through the open window he gibbered slightly when mike reappeared  jackson what do you mean by running about outside the house in this way i shall punish you very heavily i shall certainly report the matter to the headmaster i will not have boys rushing about the garden in their pyjamas you will catch an exceedingly bad cold you will do me two hundred lines latin and english exceedingly so i will not have it did you not hear me call to you  please sir so excited said mike standing outside with his hands on the sill  you have no business to be excited i will not have it it is exceedingly impertinent of you  please sir may i come in  come in of course come in have you no sense boy you are laying the seeds of a bad cold come in at once  mike clambered through the window  i couldnt find him sir he must have got out of the garden  undoubtedly said mr wain undoubtedly so it was very wrong of you to search for him you have been seriously injured exceedingly so  he was about to say more on the subject when wyatt strolled into the room wyatt wore the rather dazed expression of one who has been aroused from deep sleep he yawned before he spoke  i thought i heard a noise sir he said  he called mr wain father in private sir in public the presence of mike made this a public occasion  has there been a burglary  yes said mike only he has got away  shall i go out into the garden and have a look round sir asked wyatt helpfully  the question stung mr wain into active eruption once more  under no circumstances whatever he said excitedly stay where you are james i will not have boys running about my garden at night it is preposterous inordinately so both of you go to bed immediately i shall not speak to you again on this subject i must be obeyed instantly you hear me jackson james you understand me to bed at once and if i find you outside your dormitory again tonight you will both be punished with extreme severity i will not have this lax and reckless behaviour  but the burglar sir said wyatt  we might catch him sir said mike  mr wains manner changed to a slow and stately sarcasm in much the same way as a motorcar changes from the top speed to its first  i was under the impression he said in the heavy way almost invariably affected by weak masters in their dealings with the obstreperous i was distinctly under the impression that i had ordered you to retire immediately to your dormitory it is possible that you mistook my meaning in that case i shall be happy to repeat what i said it is also in my mind that i threatened to punish you with the utmost severity if you did not retire at once in these circumstances jamesand you jacksonyou will doubtless see the necessity of complying with my wishes  they made it so     chapter vii  in which mike is discussed   trevor and clowes of donaldsons were sitting in their study a week after the gramophone incident preparatory to going on the river at least trevor was in the study getting tea ready clowes was on the windowsill one leg in the room the other outside hanging over space he loved to sit in this attitude watching some one else work and giving his views on life to whoever would listen to them clowes was tall and looked sad which he was not trevor was shorter and very much in earnest over all that he did on the present occasion he was measuring out tea with a concentration worthy of a general planning a campaign  one for the pot said clowes  all right breathed trevor come and help you slacker  too busy  you arent doing a stroke  my lad im thinking of life thats a thing you couldnt do i often say to people good chap trevor but cant think of life give him a teapot and half a pound of butter to mess about with i say and hes all right but when it comes to deep thought where is he among the alsorans thats what i say  silly ass said trevor slicing bread what particular rot were you thinking about just then what fun it was sitting back and watching other fellows work i should think  my mind at the moment said clowes was tensely occupied with the problem of brothers at school have you got any brothers trevor  one couple of years younger than me i say we shall want some more jam tomorrow better order it today  see it done tigellinus as our old pal nero used to remark where is he your brother i mean  marlborough  that shows your sense i have always had a high opinion of your sense trevor if youd been a silly ass youd have let your people send him here  why not shouldnt have minded  i withdraw what i said about your sense consider it unsaid i have a brother myself aged fifteen not a bad chap in his way like the heroes of the school stories big blue eyes literally bubbling over with fun at least i suppose its fun to him cheeks what i call it my people wanted to send him here i lodged a protest i said one clowes is ample for any public school  you were right there said trevor  i said one clowes is luxury two excess i pointed out that i was just on the verge of becoming rather a blood at wrykyn and that i didnt want the work of years spoiled by a brother who would think it a rag to tell fellows who respected and admired me  such as who  anecdotes of a chequered infancy there are stories about me which only my brother knows did i want them spread about the school no laddie i did not hence we see my brother two terms ago packing up his little box and tooling off to rugby and here am i at wrykyn with an unstained reputation loved by all who know me revered by all who dont courted by boys fawned upon by masters peoples faces brighten when i throw them a nod if i frown  oh come on said trevor  bread and jam and cake monopolised clowess attention for the next quarter of an hour at the end of that period however he returned to his subject  after the serious business of the meal was concluded and a simple hymn had been sung by those present he said mr clowes resumed his very interesting remarks we were on the subject of brothers at school now take the melancholy case of jackson brothers my heart bleeds for bob  jacksons all right whats wrong with him besides naturally young jackson came to wrykyn when all his brothers had been here  what a rotten argument its just the one used by chaps people too they think how nice it will be for all the sons to have been at the same school it may be all right after theyre left but while theyre there its the limit you say jacksons all right at present perhaps he is but the terms hardly started yet  well  look here whats at the bottom of this sending young brothers to the same school as elder brothers  elder brother can keep an eye on him i suppose  thats just it for once in your life youve touched the spot in other words bob jackson is practically responsible for the kid thats where the whole rotten trouble starts  why  well what happens he either lets the kid rip in which case he may find himself any morning in the pleasant position of having to explain to his people exactly why it is that little willie has just received the boot and why he didnt look after him better or he spends all his spare time shadowing him to see that he doesnt get into trouble he feels that his reputation hangs on the kids conduct so he broods over him like a policeman which is pretty rotten for him and maddens the kid who looks on him as no sportsman bob seems to be trying the first way which is what i should do myself its all right so far but as i said the terms only just started  young jackson seems all right whats wrong with him he doesnt stick on side any way which he might easily do considering his cricket  theres nothing wrong with him in that way ive talked to him several times at the nets and hes very decent but his getting into trouble hasnt anything to do with us its the masters youve got to consider  whats up does he rag  from what i gather from fellows in his form hes got a genius for ragging thinks of things that dont occur to anybody else and does them too  he never seems to be in extra one always sees him about on halfholidays  thats always the way with that sort of chap he keeps on wriggling out of small rows till he thinks he can do anything he likes without being dropped on and then all of a sudden he finds himself up to the eyebrows in a record smash i dont say young jackson will land himself like that all i say is that hes just the sort who does hes asking for trouble besides who do you see him about with all the time  hes generally with wyatt when i meet him  yes well then  whats wrong with wyatt hes one of the decentest men in the school  i know but hes working up for a tremendous row one of these days unless he leaves before it comes off the odds are if jacksons so thick with him that hell be roped into it too wyatt wouldnt land him if he could help it but he probably wouldnt realise what he was letting the kid in for for instance i happen to know that wyatt breaks out of his dorm every other night i dont know if he takes jackson with him i shouldnt think so but theres nothing to prevent jackson following him on his own and if youre caught at that game its the boot every time  trevor looked disturbed  somebody ought to speak to bob  whats the good why worry him bob couldnt do anything youd only make him do the policeman business which he hasnt time for and which is bound to make rows between them better leave him alone  i dont know it would be a beastly thing for bob if the kid did get into a really bad row  if you must tell anybody tell the gazeka hes head of wains and has got far more chance of keeping an eye on jackson than bob has  the gazeka is a fool  all front teeth and side still hes on the spot but whats the good of worrying its nothing to do with us anyhow lets stagger out shall we                                       trevors conscientious nature however made it impossible for him to drop the matter it disturbed him all the time that he and clowes were on the river and walking back to the house he resolved to see bob about it during preparation  he found him in his study oiling a bat  i say bob he said look here are you busy  no why  its this way clowes and i were talking  if clowes was there he was probably talking well  about your brother  oh by jove said bob sitting up that reminds me i forgot to get the evening paper did he get his century all right  who asked trevor bewildered  my brother j w hed made sixtythree not out against kent in this mornings paper what happened  i didnt get a paper either i didnt mean that brother i meant the one here  oh mike whats mike been up to  nothing as yet that i know of but i say you know he seems a great pal of wyatts  i know i spoke to him about it  oh you did thats all right then  not that theres anything wrong with wyatt  not a bit only he is rather mucking about this term i hear its his last so i suppose he wants to have a rag  dont blame him  nor do i rather rot though if he lugged your brother into a row by accident  i should get blamed i think ill speak to him again  i should i think  i hope he isnt idiot enough to go out at night with wyatt if wyatt likes to risk it all right thats his look out but it wont do for mike to go playing the goat too  clowes suggested putting firbysmith on to him hed have more chance being in the same house of seeing that he didnt come a mucker than you would  ive done that smith said hed speak to him  thats all right then is that a new bat  got it today smashed my other yesterdayagainst the school house  donaldsons had played a friendly with the school house during the last two days and had beaten them  i thought i heard it go you were rather in form  better than at the beginning of the term anyhow i simply couldnt do a thing then but my last three innings have been 33 not out 18 and 51  i should think youre bound to get your first all right  hope so i see mikes playing for the second against the ows  yes pretty good for his first term you have a pro to coach you in the holidays dont you  yes i didnt go to him much this last time i was away a lot but mike fairly lived inside the net  well its not been chucked away i suppose hell get his first next year therell be a big clearingout of colours at the end of this term nearly all the first are leaving henfreyll be captain i expect  saunders the pro at home always says that mikes going to be the star cricketer of the family better than j w even he thinks i asked him what he thought of me and he said youll be making a lot of runs some day mr bob theres a subtle difference isnt there i shall have mike cutting me out before i leave school if im not careful  sort of infant prodigy said trevor dont think hes quite up to it yet though  he went back to his study and bob having finished his oiling and washed his hands started on his thucydides and in the stress of wrestling with the speech of an apparently delirious athenian general whose remarks seemed to contain nothing even remotely resembling sense and coherence he allowed the question of mikes welfare to fade from his mind like a dissolving view     chapter viii  a row with the town   the beginning of a big row one of those rows which turn a school upside down like a volcanic eruption and provide old boys with something to talk about when they meet for years is not unlike the beginning of a thunderstorm  you are walking along one seemingly fine day when suddenly there is a hush and there falls on you from space one big drop the next moment the thing has begun and you are standing in a showerbath it is just the same with a row some trivial episode occurs and in an instant the place is in a ferment it was so with the great picnic at wrykyn  the bare outlines of the beginning of this affair are included in a letter which mike wrote to his father on the sunday following the old wrykynian matches  this was the letter     dear fatherthanks awfully for your letter i hope you are quite    well i have been getting on all right at cricket lately my scores    since i wrote last have been 0 in a scratch game the sun got in my    eyes just as i played and i got bowled 15 for the third against an    eleven of masters without g b jones the surrey man and spence    28 not out in the under sixteen game and 30 in a form match rather    decent yesterday one of the men put down for the second against the    ows second couldnt play because his father was very ill so i    played wasnt it luck its the first time ive played for the    second i didnt do much because i didnt get an innings they stop    the cricket on ow matches day because they have a lot of rotten    greek plays and things which take up a frightful time and half the    chaps are acting so we stop from lunch to four rot i call it so i    didnt go in because they won the toss and made 215 and by the time    wed made 140 for 6 it was close of play theyd stuck me in eighth    wicket rather rot still i may get another shot and i made rather a    decent catch at midon low down i had to dive for it bob played for    the first but didnt do much he was run out after hed got ten i    believe hes rather sick about it     rather a rummy thing happened after lockup i wasnt in it but a    fellow called wyatt awfully decent chap hes wains stepson only    they bar one another told me about it he was in it all right    theres a dinner after the matches on ow day and some of the chaps    were going back to their houses after it when they got into a row with    a lot of brickies from the town and there was rather a row there was    a policeman mixed up in it somehow only i dont quite know where he    comes in ill find out and tell you next time i write love to    everybody tell marjory ill write to her in a day or two     your loving son                mike     psi say i suppose you couldnt send me five bob could you im    rather broke     ppshalfacrown would do only id rather it was five bob  and on the back of the envelope these words or a bob would be better than nothing                                       the outline of the case was as mike had stated but there were certain details of some importance which had not come to his notice when he sent the letter on the monday they were public property  the thing had happened after this fashion at the conclusion of the days cricket all those who had been playing in the four elevens which the school put into the field against the old boys together with the school choir were entertained by the headmaster to supper in the great hall the banquet lengthened by speeches songs and recitations which the reciters imagined to be songs lasted as a rule till about ten oclock when the revellers were supposed to go back to their houses by the nearest route and turn in this was the official programme the school usually performed it with certain modifications and improvements  about midway between wrykyn the school and wrykyn the town there stands on an island in the centre of the road a solitary lamppost it was the custom and had been the custom for generations back for the diners to trudge off to this lamppost dance round it for some minutes singing the school song or whatever happened to be the popular song of the moment and then race back to their houses antiquity had given the custom a sort of sanctity and the authorities if they knewwhich they must have donenever interfered  but there were others  wrykyn the town was peculiarly rich in gangs of youths like the vast majority of the inhabitants of the place they seemed to have no work of any kind whatsoever to occupy their time which they used accordingly to spend prowling about and indulging in a mild brainless rural type of hooliganism they seldom proceeded to practical rowdyism and never except with the school as a rule they amused themselves by shouting rude chaff the school regarded them with a lofty contempt much as an oxford man regards the townee the school was always anxious for a row but it was the unwritten law that only in special circumstances should they proceed to active measures a curious dislike for schoolandtown rows and most misplaced severity in dealing with the offenders when they took place were among the few flaws in the otherwise admirable character of the headmaster of wrykyn it was understood that one scragged bargees at ones own risk and as a rule it was not considered worth it  but after an excellent supper and much singing and joviality ones views are apt to alter risks which before supper seemed great show a tendency to dwindle  when therefore the twenty or so wrykynians who were dancing round the lamppost were aware in the midst of their festivities that they were being observed and criticised by an equal number of townees and that the criticisms were as usual essentially candid and personal they found themselves forgetting the headmasters prejudices and feeling only that these outsiders must be put to the sword as speedily as possible for the honour of the school  possibly if the town brigade had stuck to a purely verbal form of attack all might yet have been peace words can be overlooked  but tomatoes cannot  no man of spirit can bear to be pelted with overripe tomatoes for any length of time without feeling that if the thing goes on much longer he will be reluctantly compelled to take steps  in the present crisis the first tomato was enough to set matters moving  as the two armies stood facing each other in silence under the dim and mysterious rays of the lamp it suddenly whizzed out from the enemys ranks and hit wyatt on the right ear  there was a moment of suspense wyatt took out his handkerchief and wiped his face over which the succulent vegetable had spread itself  i dont know how you fellows are going to pass the evening he said quietly my idea of a good afterdinner game is to try and find the chap who threw that anybody coming  for the first five minutes it was as even a fight as one could have wished to see it raged up and down the road without a pause now in a solid mass now splitting up into little groups the science was on the side of the school most wrykynians knew how to box to a certain extent but at any rate at first it was no time for science to be scientific one must have an opponent who observes at least the more important rules of the ring it is impossible to do the latest ducks and hooks taught you by the instructor if your antagonist butts you in the chest and then kicks your shins while some dear friend of his of whose presence you had no idea hits you at the same time on the back of the head the greatest expert would lose his science in such circumstances  probably what gave the school the victory in the end was the righteousness of their cause they were smarting under a sense of injury and there is nothing that adds a force to ones blows and a recklessness to ones style of delivering them more than a sense of injury  wyatt one side of his face still showing traces of the tomato led the school with a vigour that could not be resisted he very seldom lost his temper but he did draw the line at bad tomatoes  presently the school noticed that the enemy were vanishing little by little into the darkness which concealed the town barely a dozen remained and their lonely condition seemed to be borne in upon these by a simultaneous brainwave for they suddenly gave the fight up and stampeded as one man  the leaders were beyond recall but two remained tackled low by wyatt and clowes after the fashion of the footballfield                                       the school gathered round its prisoners panting the scene of the conflict had shifted little by little to a spot some fifty yards from where it had started by the side of the road at this point was a green depressed looking pond gloomy in the daytime it looked unspeakable at night it struck wyatt whose finer feelings had been entirely blotted out by tomato as an ideal place in which to bestow the captives  lets chuck em in there he said  the idea was welcomed gladly by all except the prisoners a move was made towards the pond and the procession had halted on the brink when a new voice made itself heard  now then it said whats all this  a stout figure in policemans uniform was standing surveying them with the aid of a small bullseye lantern  whats all this  its all right said wyatt  all right is it whats on  one of the prisoners spoke  make em leave hold of us mr butt theyre agoing to chuck us in the pond  ho said the policeman with a change in his voice ho are they come now young gentleman a larks a lark but you ought to know where to stop  its anything but a lark said wyatt in the creamy voice he used when feeling particularly savage were the strong right arm of justice thats what we are this isnt a lark its an execution  i dont want none of your lip whoever you are said mr butt understanding but dimly and suspecting impudence by instinct  this is quite a private matter said wyatt you run along on your beat you cant do anything here  ho  shove em in you chaps  stop from mr butt  ooer from prisoner number one  there was a sounding splash as willing hands urged the first of the captives into the depths he ploughed his way to the bank scrambled out and vanished  wyatt turned to the other prisoner  youll have the worst of it going in second hell have churned up the mud a bit dont swallow more than you can help or youll go getting typhoid i expect there are leeches and things there but if you nip out quick they may not get on to you carry on you chaps  it was here that the regrettable incident occurred just as the second prisoner was being launched constable butt determined to assert himself even at the eleventh hour sprang forward and seized the captive by the arm a drowning man will clutch at a straw a man about to be hurled into an excessively dirty pond will clutch at a stout policeman the prisoner did  constable butt represented his one link with dry land as he came within reach he attached himself to his tunic with the vigour and concentration of a limpet  at the same moment the executioners gave their man the final heave the policeman realised his peril too late a medley of noises made the peaceful night hideous a howl from the townee a yell from the policeman a cheer from the launching party a frightened squawk from some birds in a neighbouring tree and a splash compared with which the first had been as nothing and all was over  the dark waters were lashed into a maelstrom and then two streaming figures squelched up the further bank  illustration the dark waters were lashed into a maelstrom  the school stood in silent consternation it was no occasion for light apologies  do you know said wyatt as he watched the law shaking the water from itself on the other side of the pond im not half sure that we hadnt better be moving     chapter ix  before the storm   your real devastating row has many points of resemblance with a prairie fire a man on a prairie lights his pipe and throws away the match the flame catches a bunch of dry grass and before any one can realise what is happening sheets of fire are racing over the country and the interested neighbours are following their example i have already compared a row with a thunderstorm but both comparisons may stand in dealing with so vast a matter as a row there must be no stint  the tomato which hit wyatt in the face was the thrownaway match but for the unerring aim of the town marksman great events would never have happened a tomato is a trivial thing though it is possible that the man whom it hits may not think so but in the present case it was the direct cause of epochmaking trouble  the tomato hit wyatt wyatt with others went to look for the thrower the remnants of the throwers friends were placed in the pond and with them as they say in the courts of law police constable alfred butt  following the chain of events we find mr butt having prudently changed his clothes calling upon the headmaster  the headmaster was grave and sympathetic mr butt fierce and revengeful  the imagination of the force is proverbial nurtured on motorcars and fed with stopwatches it has become worldfamous mr butt gave free rein to it  threw me in they did sir yes sir  threw you in  yes sir plop said mr butt with a certain sad relish  really really said the headmaster indeed this isdear me i shall certainlythey threw you inyes i shallcertainly  encouraged by this appreciative reception of his story mr butt started it again right from the beginning  i was on my beat sir and i thought i heard a disturbance i says to myself allo i says a frakkus lots of them all gathered together and fighting i says beginning to suspect something wots this all about i wonder i says blow me if i dont think its a frakkus and concluded mr butt with the air of one confiding a secret and it was a frakkus  and these boys actually threw you into the pond  plop sir mrs butt is drying my uniform at home at this very moment as we sit talking here sir she says to me why whatever ave you been adoing youre all wet and he added again with the confidential air i was wet too wringin wet  the headmasters frown deepened  and you are certain that your assailants were boys from the school  sure as i am that im sitting here sir they all ad their caps on their heads sir  i have never heard of such a thing i can hardly believe that it is possible they actually seized you and threw you into the water  splish sir said the policeman with a vividness of imagery both surprising and gratifying  the headmaster tapped restlessly on the floor with his foot  how many boys were there he asked  couple of undred sir said mr butt promptly  two hundred  it was dark sir and i couldnt see not to say properly but if you ask me my frank and private opinion i should say couple of undred  hmwell i will look into the matter at once they shall be punished  yes sir  yeeshmyesmost severely  yes sir  yesthank you constable goodnight  goodnight sir  the headmaster of wrykyn was not a motorist owing to this disadvantage he made a mistake had he been a motorist he would have known that statements by the police in the matter of figures must be divided by any number from two to ten according to discretion as it was he accepted constable butts report almost as it stood he thought that he might possibly have been mistaken as to the exact numbers of those concerned in his immersion but he accepted the statement in so far as it indicated that the thing had been the work of a considerable section of the school and not of only one or two individuals and this made all the difference to his method of dealing with the affair had he known how few were the numbers of those responsible for the cold in the head which subsequently attacked constable butt he would have asked for their names and an extra lesson would have settled the entire matter  as it was however he got the impression that the school as a whole was culpable and he proceeded to punish the school as a whole  it happened that about a week before the pond episode a certain member of the royal family had recovered from a dangerous illness which at one time had looked like being fatal no official holiday had been given to the schools in honour of the recovery but eton and harrow had set the example which was followed throughout the kingdom and wrykyn had come into line with the rest only two days before the ows matches the headmaster had given out a notice in the hall that the following friday would be a whole holiday and the school always ready to stop work had approved of the announcement exceedingly  the step which the headmaster decided to take by way of avenging mr butts wrongs was to stop this holiday  he gave out a notice to that effect on the monday  the school was thunderstruck it could not understand it the pond affair had of course become public property and those who had had nothing to do with it had been much amused therell be a frightful row about it they had said thrilled with the pleasant excitement of those who see trouble approaching and themselves looking on from a comfortable distance without risk or uneasiness they were not malicious they did not want to see their friends in difficulties but there is no denying that a row does break the monotony of a school term the thrilling feeling that something is going to happen is the salt of life  and here they were right in it after all the blow had fallen and crushed guilty and innocent alike                                       the schools attitude can be summed up in three words it was one vast blank astounded here i say  everybody was saying it though not always in those words when condensed everybodys comment on the situation came to that                                       there is something rather pathetic in the indignation of a school it must always or nearly always expend itself in words and in private at that even the consolation of getting on to platforms and shouting at itself is denied to it a public school has no hyde park  there is every probabilityin fact it is certainthat but for one malcontent the schools indignation would have been allowed to simmer down in the usual way and finally become a mere vague memory  the malcontent was wyatt he had been responsible for the starting of the matter and he proceeded now to carry it on till it blazed up into the biggest thing of its kind ever known at wrykynthe great picnic                                       any one who knows the public schools their ironbound conservatism and as a whole intense respect for order and authority will appreciate the magnitude of his feat even though he may not approve of it leaders of men are rare leaders of boys are almost unknown it requires genius to sway a school  it would be an absorbing task for a psychologist to trace the various stages by which an impossibility was changed into a reality wyatts coolness and matteroffact determination were his chief weapons his popularity and reputation for lawlessness helped him a conversation which he had with nevillesmith a dayboy is typical of the way in which he forced his point of view on the school  nevillesmith was thoroughly representative of the average wrykynian he could play his part in any minor rag which interested him and probably considered himself on the whole a daring sort of person but at heart he had an enormous respect for authority before he came to wyatt he would not have dreamed of proceeding beyond words in his revolt wyatt acted on him like some drug  nevillesmith came upon wyatt on his way to the nets the notice concerning the holiday had only been given out that morning and he was full of it he expressed his opinion of the headmaster freely and in wellchosen words he said it was a swindle that it was all rot and that it was a beastly shame he added that something ought to be done about it  what are you going to do asked wyatt  well said nevillesmith a little awkwardly guiltily conscious that he had been frothing and scenting sarcasm i dont suppose one can actually do anything  why not said wyatt  what do you mean  why dont you take the holiday  what not turn up on friday  yes im not going to  nevillesmith stopped and stared wyatt was unmoved  youre what  i simply shant go to school  youre rotting  all right  no but i say ragging barred are you just going to cut off though the holidays been stopped  thats the idea  youll get sacked  i suppose so but only because i shall be the only one to do it if the whole school took friday off they couldnt do much they couldnt sack the whole school  by jove nor could they i say  they walked on nevillesmiths mind in a whirl wyatt whistling  i say said nevillesmith after a pause it would be a bit of a rag  not bad  do you think the chaps would do it  if they understood they wouldnt be alone  another pause  shall i ask some of them said nevillesmith  do  i could get quite a lot i believe  that would be a start wouldnt it i could get a couple of dozen from wains we should be forty or fifty strong to start with  i say what a score wouldnt it be  yes  ill speak to the chaps tonight and let you know  all right said wyatt tell them that i shall be going anyhow i should be glad of a little company                                       the school turned in on the thursday night in a restless excited way there were mysterious whisperings and gigglings groups kept forming in corners apart to disperse casually and innocently on the approach of some person in authority  an air of expectancy permeated each of the houses     chapter x  the great picnic   morning school at wrykyn started at nine oclock at that hour there was a callover in each of the formrooms after callover the forms proceeded to the great hall for prayers  a strangely desolate feeling was in the air at nine oclock on the friday morning sit in the grounds of a public school any afternoon in the summer holidays and you will get exactly the same sensation of being alone in the world as came to the dozen or so dayboys who bicycled through the gates that morning wrykyn was a boardingschool for the most part but it had its leaven of dayboys the majority of these lived in the town and walked to school a few however whose homes were farther away came on bicycles one plutocrat did the journey in a motorcar rather to the scandal of the authorities who though unable to interfere looked askance when compelled by the warning toot of the horn to skip from road to pavement a formmaster has the strongest objection to being made to skip like a young ram by a boy to whom he has only the day before given a hundred lines for shuffling his feet in form  it seemed curious to these cyclists that there should be nobody about punctuality is the politeness of princes but it was not a leading characteristic of the school and at three minutes to nine as a general rule you might see the gravel in front of the buildings freely dotted with sprinters trying to get in in time to answer their names  it was curious that there should be nobody about today a wave of reform could scarcely have swept through the houses during the night  and yetwhere was everybody  time only deepened the mystery the formrooms like the gravel were empty  the cyclists looked at one another in astonishment what could it mean  it was an occasion on which sane people wonder if their brains are not playing them some unaccountable trick  i say said willoughby of the lower fifth to brown the only other occupant of the formroom the old man did stop the holiday today didnt he  just what i was going to ask you said brown its jolly rum i distinctly remember him giving it out in hall that it was going to be stopped because of the ows day row  so do i i cant make it out where is everybody  they cant all be late  somebody would have turned up by now why its just striking  perhaps he sent another notice round the houses late last night saying it was on again all right i say what a swindle if he did some one might have let us know i should have got up an hour later  so should i  hullo here is somebody  it was the master of the lower fifth mr spence he walked briskly into the room as was his habit seeing the obvious void he stopped in his stride and looked puzzled  willoughby brown are you the only two here where is everybody  please sir we dont know we were just wondering  have you seen nobody  no sir  we were just wondering sir if the holiday had been put on again after all  ive heard nothing about it i should have received some sort of intimation if it had been  yes sir  do you mean to say that you have seen nobody brown  only about a dozen fellows sir the usual lot who come on bikes sir  none of the boarders  no sir not a single one  this is extraordinary  mr spence pondered  well he said you two fellows had better go along up to hall i shall go to the common room and make inquiries perhaps as you say there is a holiday today and the notice was not brought to me  mr spence told himself as he walked to the common room that this might be a possible solution of the difficulty he was not a housemaster and lived by himself in rooms in the town it was just conceivable that they might have forgotten to tell him of the change in the arrangements  but in the common room the same perplexity reigned half a dozen masters were seated round the room and a few more were standing and they were all very puzzled  a brisk conversation was going on several voices hailed mr spence as he entered  hullo spence are you alone in the world too  any of your boys turned up spence  you in the same condition as we are spence  mr spence seated himself on the table  havent any of your fellows turned up either he said  when i accepted the honourable post of lower fourth master in this abode of sin said mr seymour it was on the distinct understanding that there was going to be a lower fourth yet i go into my formroom this morning and what do i find simply emptiness and pickersgill ii whistling the church parade all flat i consider i have been hardly treated  i have no complaint to make against brown and willoughby as individuals said mr spence but considered as a form i call them short measure  i confess that i am entirely at a loss said mr shields precisely i have never been confronted with a situation like this since i became a schoolmaster  it is most mysterious agreed mr wain plucking at his beard exceedingly so  the younger masters notably mr spence and mr seymour had begun to look on the thing as a huge jest  we had better teach ourselves said mr seymour spence do a hundred lines for laughing in form  the door burst open  hullo heres another scholastic little bopeep said mr seymour well appleby have you lost your sheep too  you dont mean to tell me began mr appleby  i do said mr seymour here we are fifteen of us all good men and true graduates of our universities and as far as i can see if we divide up the boys who have come to school this morning on fair shareandsharealike lines it will work out at about twothirds of a boy each spence will you take a third of pickersgill ii  i want none of your charity said mr spence loftily you dont seem to realise that im the best off of you all ive got two in my form its no good offering me your pickersgills i simply havent room for them  what does it all mean exclaimed mr appleby  if you ask me said mr seymour i should say that it meant that the school holding the sensible view that first thoughts are best have ignored the heads change of mind and are taking their holiday as per original programme  they surely cannot  well where are they then  do you seriously mean that the entire school hashas rebelled  nay sire quoted mr spence a revolution  i never heard of such a thing  were making history said mr seymour  it will be rather interesting said mr spence to see how the head will deal with a situation like this one can rely on him to do the statesmanlike thing but im bound to say i shouldnt care to be in his place it seems to me these boys hold all the cards you cant expel a whole school theres safety in numbers the thing is colossal  it is deplorable said mr wain with austerity exceedingly so  i try to think so said mr spence but its a struggle theres a napoleonic touch about the business that appeals to one disorder on a small scale is bad but this is immense ive never heard of anything like it at any public school when i was at winchester my last year there there was pretty nearly a revolution because the captain of cricket was expelled on the eve of the eton match i remember making inflammatory speeches myself on that occasion but we stopped on the right side of the line we were satisfied with growling but this  mr seymour got up  its an ill wind he said with any luck we ought to get the day off and its ideal weather for a holiday the head can hardly ask us to sit indoors teaching nobody if i have to stew in my formroom all day instructing pickersgill ii i shall make things exceedingly sultry for that youth he will wish that the pickersgill progeny had stopped short at his elder brother he will not value life in the meantime as its already ten past hadnt we better be going up to hall to see what the orders of the day are  look at shields said mr spence he might be posing for a statue to be called despair he reminds me of macduff macbeth act iv somewhere near the end what all my pretty chickens at one fell swoop thats what shields is saying to himself  its all very well to make a joke of it spence said mr shields querulously but it is most disturbing most  exceedingly agreed mr wain  the bereaved company of masters walked on up the stairs that led to the great hall     chapter xi  the conclusion of the picnic   if the formrooms had been lonely the great hall was doubly trebly so it was a vast room stretching from side to side of the middle block and its ceiling soared up into a distant dome at one end was a dais and an organ and at intervals down the room stood long tables the panels were covered with the names of wrykynians who had won scholarships at oxford and cambridge and of old wrykynians who had taken first in mods or greats or achieved any other recognised success such as a place in the indian civil service list a silent testimony these panels to the work the school had done in the world  nobody knew exactly how many the hall could hold when packed to its fullest capacity the six hundred odd boys at the school seemed to leave large gaps unfilled  this morning there was a mere handful and the place looked worse than empty  the sixth form were there and the school prefects the great picnic had not affected their numbers the sixth stood by their table in a solid group the other tables were occupied by ones and twos a buzz of conversation was going on which did not cease when the masters filed into the room and took their places every one realised by this time that the biggest row in wrykyn history was well under way and the thing had to be discussed  in the masters library mr wain and mr shields the spokesmen of the common room were breaking the news to the headmaster  the headmaster was a man who rarely betrayed emotion in his public capacity he heard mr shieldss rambling remarks punctuated by mr wains exceedinglys to an end then he gathered up his cap and gown  you say that the whole school is absent he remarked quietly  mr shields in a longwinded flow of words replied that that was what he did say  ah said the headmaster  there was a silence  m said the headmaster  there was another silence  yees said the headmaster  he then led the way into the hall  conversation ceased abruptly as he entered the school like an audience at a theatre when the hero has just appeared on the stage felt that the serious interest of the drama had begun there was a dead silence at every table as he strode up the room and on to the dais  there was something titanic in his calmness every eye was on his face as he passed up the hall but not a sign of perturbation could the school read to judge from his expression he might have been unaware of the emptiness around him  the master who looked after the music of the school and incidentally accompanied the hymn with which prayers at wrykyn opened was waiting puzzled at the foot of the dais it seemed improbable that things would go on as usual and he did not know whether he was expected to be at the organ or not the headmasters placid face reassured him he went to his post  the hymn began it was a long hymn and one which the school liked for its swing and noise as a rule when it was sung the hall reechoed today the thin sound of the voices had quite an uncanny effect the organ boomed through the deserted room  the school or the remnants of it waited impatiently while the prefect whose turn it was to read stammered nervously through the lesson they were anxious to get on to what the head was going to say at the end of prayers at last it was over the school waited all ears  the headmaster bent down from the dais and called to firbysmith who was standing in his place with the sixth  the gazeka blushing warmly stepped forward  bring me a school list firbysmith said the headmaster  the gazeka was wearing a pair of very squeaky boots that morning they sounded deafening as he walked out of the room  the school waited  presently a distant squeaking was heard and firbysmith returned bearing a large sheet of paper  the headmaster thanked him and spread it out on the readingdesk  then calmly as if it were an occurrence of every day he began to call the roll  abney  no answer  adams  no answer  allenby  here sir from a table at the end of the room allenby was a prefect in the science sixth  the headmaster made a mark against his name with a pencil  arkwright  no answer  he began to call the names more rapidly  arlington arthur ashe aston  here sir in a shrill treble from the rider in motorcars  the headmaster made another tick  the list came to an end after what seemed to the school an unconscionable time and he rolled up the paper again and stepped to the edge of the dais  all boys not in the sixth form he said will go to their formrooms and get their books and writingmaterials and return to the hall  good work murmured mr seymour to himself looks as if we should get that holiday after all  the sixth form will go to their formroom as usual i should like to speak to the masters for a moment  he nodded dismissal to the school  the masters collected on the daïs  i find that i shall not require your services today said the headmaster if you will kindly set the boys in your forms some work that will keep them occupied i will look after them here it is a lovely day he added with a smile and i am sure you will all enjoy yourselves a great deal more in the open air  that said mr seymour to mr spence as they went downstairs is what i call a genuine sportsman  my opinion neatly expressed said mr spence come on the river or shall we put up a net and have a knock  river i think meet you at the boathouse  all right dont be long  if every day were run on these lines schoolmastering wouldnt be such a bad profession i wonder if one could persuade ones form to run amuck as a regular thing  pity one cant it seems to me the ideal state of things ensures the greatest happiness of the greatest number  i say suppose the school has gone up the river too and we meet them what shall we do  thank them said mr spence most kindly theyve done us well  the school had not gone up the river they had marched in a solid body with the school band at their head playing sousa in the direction of worfield a market town of some importance distant about five miles of what they did and what the natives thought of it all no very distinct records remain the thing is a tradition on the countryside now an event colossal and heroic to be talked about in the taproom of the village inn during the long winter evenings the papers got hold of it but were curiously misled as to the nature of the demonstration this was the fault of the reporter on the staff of the worfield intelligencer and farmers guide who saw in the thing a legitimate marchout and questioning a straggler as to the reason for the expedition and gathering foggily that the restoration to health of the eminent person was at the bottom of it said so in his paper and two days later at about the time when retribution had got seriously to work the daily mail reprinted the account with comments and elaborations and headed it loyal schoolboys the writer said that great credit was due to the headmaster of wrykyn for his ingenuity in devising and organising so novel a thanksgiving celebration and there was the usual conversation between a rosycheeked lad of some sixteen summers and our representative in which the rosycheeked one spoke most kindly of the headmaster who seemed to be a warm personal friend of his  the remarkable thing about the great picnic was its orderliness considering that five hundred and fifty boys were ranging the country in a compact mass there was wonderfully little damage done to property wyatts genius did not stop short at organising the march in addition he arranged a system of officers which effectually controlled the animal spirits of the rank and file the prompt and decisive way in which rioters were dealt with during the earlier stages of the business proved a wholesome lesson to others who would have wished to have gone and done likewise a spirit of martial law reigned over the great picnic and towards the end of the day fatigue kept the rowdyminded quiet  at worfield the expedition lunched it was not a marketday fortunately or the confusion in the narrow streets would have been hopeless on ordinary days worfield was more or less deserted it is astonishing that the resources of the little town were equal to satisfying the needs of the picnickers they descended on the place like an army of locusts  wyatt as generalissimo of the expedition walked into the grasshopper and ant the leading inn of the town  anything i can do for you sir inquired the landlord politely  yes please said wyatt i want lunch for five hundred and fifty  that was the supreme moment in mine hosts life it was his big subject of conversation ever afterwards he always told that as his best story and he always ended with the words you could ha knocked me down with a feather  the first shock over the staff of the grasshopper and ant bustled about other inns were called upon for help private citizens rallied round with bread jam and apples and the army lunched sumptuously  in the early afternoon they rested and as evening began to fall the march home was started                                       at the school net practice was just coming to an end when faintly as the garrison of lucknow heard the first skirl of the pipes of the relieving force those on the grounds heard the strains of the school band and a murmur of many voices presently the sounds grew more distinct and up the wrykyn road came marching the vanguard of the column singing the school song they looked weary but cheerful  as the army drew near to the school it melted away little by little each house claiming its representatives at the school gates only a handful were left  bob jackson walking back to donaldsons met wyatt at the gate and gazed at him speechless  hullo said wyatt been to the nets i wonder if theres time for a gingerbeer before the shop shuts     chapter xii  mike gets his chance   the headmaster was quite bland and businesslike about it all there were no impassioned addresses from the dais he did not tell the school that it ought to be ashamed of itself nor did he say that he should never have thought it of them prayers on the saturday morning were marked by no unusual features there was indeed a stir of excitement when he came to the edge of the dais and cleared his throat as a preliminary to making an announcement now for it thought the school  this was the announcement  there has been an outbreak of chickenpox in the town all streets except the high street will in consequence be out of bounds till further notice  he then gave the nod of dismissal  the school streamed downstairs marvelling  the less astute of the picnickers unmindful of the homely proverb about hallooing before leaving the wood were openly exulting it seemed plain to them that the headmaster baffled by the magnitude of the thing had resolved to pursue the safe course of ignoring it altogether to lie low is always a shrewd piece of tactics and there seemed no reason why the head should not have decided on it in the present instance  nevillesmith was among these premature rejoicers  i say he chuckled overtaking wyatt in the cloisters this is all right isnt it hes funked it i thought he would finds the job too big to tackle  wyatt was damping  my dear chap he said its not over yet by a long chalk it hasnt started yet  what do you mean why didnt he say anything about it in hall then  why should he have you ever had tick at a shop  of course i have what do you mean why  well they didnt send in the bill right away but it came all right  do you think hes going to do something then  rather you wait  wyatt was right  between ten and eleven on wednesdays and saturdays old bates the school sergeant used to copy out the names of those who were in extra lesson and post them outside the school shop the school inspected the list during the quarter to eleven interval  today rushing to the shop for its midday bun the school was aware of a vast sheet of paper where usually there was but a small one they surged round it buns were forgotten what was it  then the meaning of the notice flashed upon them the headmaster had acted this bloated document was the extra lesson list swollen with names as a stream swells with rain it was a comprehensive document it left out little  the following boys will go in to extra lesson this afternoon and next wednesday it began and the following boys numbered four hundred  bates must have got writers cramp said clowes as he read the huge scroll                                       wyatt met mike after school as they went back to the house  seen the extra list he remarked none of the kids are in it i notice only the bigger fellows rather a good thing im glad you got off  thanks said mike who was walking a little stiffly i dont know what you call getting off it seems to me youre the chaps who got off  how do you mean  we got tanned said mike ruefully  what  yes everybody below the upper fourth  wyatt roared with laughter  by gad he said he is an old sportsman i never saw such a man he lowers all records  glad you think it funny you wouldnt have if youd been me i was one of the first to get it he was quite fresh  sting  should think it did  well buck up dont break down  im not breaking down said mike indignantly  all right i thought you werent anyhow youre better off than i am  an extras nothing much said mike  it is when it happens to come on the same day as the mcc match  oh by jove i forgot thats next wednesday isnt it you wont be able to play  no  i say what rot  it is rather still nobody can say i didnt ask for it if one goes out of ones way to beg and beseech the old man to put one in extra it would be a little rough on him to curse him when he does it  i should be awfully sick if it were me  well it isnt you so youre all right youll probably get my place in the team  mike smiled dutifully at what he supposed to be a humorous sally  or rather one of the places continued wyatt who seemed to be sufficiently in earnest theyll put a bowler in instead of me probably druce but therell be several vacancies lets see me adams ashe any more no thats the lot i should think theyd give you a chance  you neednt rot said mike uncomfortably he had his daydreams like everybody else and they always took the form of playing for the first eleven and incidentally making a century in record time to have to listen while the subject was talked about lightly made him hot and prickly all over  im not rotting said wyatt seriously ill suggest it to burgess tonight  you dont think theres any chance of it really do you said mike awkwardly  i dont see why not buck up in the scratch game this afternoon fielding especially burgess is simply mad on fielding i dont blame him either especially as hes a bowler himself hed shove a man into the team like a shot whatever his batting was like if his fielding was something extra special so you field like a demon this afternoon and ill carry on the good work in the evening  i say said mike overcome its awfully decent of you wyatt                                       billy burgess captain of wrykyn cricket was a genial giant who seldom allowed himself to be ruffled the present was one of the rare occasions on which he permitted himself that luxury wyatt found him in his study shortly before lockup full of strange oaths like the soldier in shakespeare  you rotter you rotter you worm he observed crisply as wyatt appeared  dear old billy said wyatt come on give me a kiss and lets be friends  you  william william  if it wasnt illegal id like to tie you and ashe and that blackguard adams up in a big sack and drop you into the river and id jump on the sack first what do you mean by letting the team down like this i know you were at the bottom of it all  he struggled into his shirthe was changing after a bathand his face popped wrathfully out at the other end  im awfully sorry bill said wyatt the fact is in the excitement of the moment the mcc match went clean out of my mind  you havent got a mind grumbled burgess youve got a cheap brown paper substitute thats your trouble  wyatt turned the conversation tactfully  how many wickets did you get today he asked  eight for a hundred and three i was on the spot young jackson caught a hot one off me at third man that kids good  why dont you play him against the mcc on wednesday said wyatt jumping at his opportunity  what are you sitting on my left shoe  no there it is in the corner  right ho what were you saying  why not play young jackson for the first  too small  rot what does size matter cricket isnt footer besides he isnt small hes as tall as i am  i suppose he is dash ive dropped my stud  wyatt waited patiently till he had retrieved it then he returned to the attack  hes as good a bat as his brother and a better field  old bob cant field for toffee i will say that for him dropped a sitter off me today why the deuce fellows cant hold catches when they drop slowly into their mouths im hanged if i can see  you play him said wyatt just give him a trial that kids a genius at cricket hes going to be better than any of his brothers even joe give him a shot  burgess hesitated  you know its a bit risky he said with you three lunatics out of the team we cant afford to try many experiments better stick to the men at the top of the second  wyatt got up and kicked the wall as a vent for his feelings  you rotter he said cant you see when youve got a good man heres this kid waiting for you ready made with a style like trumpers and you rave about top men in the second chaps who play forward at everything and pat halfvolleys back to the bowler do you realise that your only chance of being known to posterity is as the man who gave m jackson his colours at wrykyn in a few years hell be playing for england and youll think it a favour if he nods to you in the pav at lords when youre a whitehaired old man youll go doddering about gassing to your grandchildren poor kids how you discovered m jackson itll be the only thing theyll respect you for  wyatt stopped for breath  all right said burgess ill think it over frightful gift of the gab youve got wyatt  good said wyatt think it over and dont forget what i said about the grandchildren you would like little wyatt burgess and the other little burgesses to respect you in your old age wouldnt you very well then so long the bell went ages ago i shall be locked out                                       on the monday morning mike passed the noticeboard just as burgess turned away from pinning up the list of the team to play the mcc he read it and his heart missed a beat for bottom but one just above the w b burgess was a name that leaped from the paper at him his own name     chapter xiii  the mcc match   if the day happens to be fine there is a curious dreamlike atmosphere about the opening stages of a first eleven match everything seems hushed and expectant the rest of the school have gone in after the interval at eleven oclock and you are alone on the grounds with a cricketbag the only signs of life are a few pedestrians on the road beyond the railings and one or two blazer and flannelclad forms in the pavilion the sense of isolation is trying to the nerves and a school team usually bats 25 per cent better after lunch when the strangeness has worn off  mike walked across from wains where he had changed feeling quite hollow he could almost have cried with pure fright bob had shouted after him from a window as he passed donaldsons to wait so that they could walk over together but conversation was the last thing mike desired at that moment  he had almost reached the pavilion when one of the mcc team came down the steps saw him and stopped dead  by jove saunders cried mike  why master mike  the professional beamed and quite suddenly the lost hopeless feeling left mike he felt as cheerful as if he and saunders had met in the meadow at home and were just going to begin a little quiet netpractice  why master mike you dont mean to say youre playing for the school already  mike nodded happily  isnt it ripping he said  saunders slapped his leg in a sort of ecstasy  didnt i always say it sir he chuckled wasnt i right i used to say to myself it ud be a pretty good school team that ud leave you out  of course im only playing as a sub you know three chaps are in extra and i got one of the places  well youll make a hundred today master mike and then theyll have to put you in  wish i could  master joes come down with the club said saunders  joe has he really how ripping hullo here he is hullo joe  the greatest of all the jacksons was descending the pavilion steps with the gravity befitting an all england batsman he stopped short as saunders had done  mike you arent playing  yes  well im hanged young marvel isnt he saunders  he is sir said saunders got all the strokes i always said it master joe only wants the strength  joe took mike by the shoulder and walked him off in the direction of a man in a zingari blazer who was bowling slows to another of the mcc team mike recognised him with awe as one of the three best amateur wicketkeepers in the country  what do you think of this said joe exhibiting mike who grinned bashfully aged ten last birthday and playing for the school you are only ten arent you mike  brother of yours asked the wicketkeeper  probably too proud to own the relationship but he is  isnt there any end to you jacksons demanded the wicketkeeper in an aggrieved tone i never saw such a family  this is our star you wait till he gets at us today saunders is our only bowler and mikes been brought up on saunders youd better win the toss if you want a chance of getting a knock and lifting your average out of the minuses  i have won the toss said the other with dignity do you think i dont know the elementary duties of a captain                                       the school went out to field with mixed feelings the wicket was hard and true which would have made it pleasant to be going in first on the other hand they would feel decidedly better and fitter for centuries after the game had been in progress an hour or so burgess was glad as a private individual sorry as a captain for himself the sooner he got hold of the ball and began to bowl the better he liked it as a captain he realised that a side with joe jackson on it not to mention the other firstclass men was not a side to which he would have preferred to give away an advantage mike was feeling that by no possibility could he hold the simplest catch and hoping that nothing would come his way bob conscious of being an uncertain field was feeling just the same  the mcc opened with joe and a man in an oxford authentic cap the beginning of the game was quiet burgesss yorker was nearly too much for the latter in the first over but he contrived to chop it away and the pair gradually settled down at twenty joe began to open his shoulders twenty became forty with disturbing swiftness and burgess tried a change of bowling  it seemed for one instant as if the move had been a success for joe still taking risks tried to latecut a rising ball and snicked it straight into bobs hands at second slip it was the easiest of slipcatches but bob fumbled it dropped it almost held it a second time and finally let it fall miserably to the ground it was a moment too painful for words he rolled the ball back to the bowler in silence  one of those weary periods followed when the batsmans defence seems to the fieldsmen absolutely impregnable there was a sickening inevitableness in the way in which every ball was played with the very centre of the bat and as usual just when things seemed most hopeless relief came the authentic getting in front of his wicket to pull one of the simplest longhops ever seen on a cricket field missed it and was lbw and the next ball upset the newcomers leg stump  the school revived bowlers and field were infused with a new life another wickettwo stumps knocked out of the ground by burgesshelped the thing on when the bell rang for the end of morning school five wickets were down for a hundred and thirteen  but from the end of school till lunch things went very wrong indeed joe was still in at one end invincible and at the other was the great wicketkeeper and the pair of them suddenly began to force the pace till the bowling was in a tangled knot four after four all round the wicket with never a chance or a mishit to vary the monotony two hundred went up and two hundred and fifty then joe reached his century and was stumped next ball then came lunch  the rest of the innings was like the gentle rain after the thunderstorm runs came with fair regularity but wickets fell at intervals and when the wicketkeeper was run out at length for a lively sixtythree the end was very near saunders coming in last hit two boundaries and was then caught by mike his second hit had just lifted the mcc total over the three hundred                                       three hundred is a score that takes some making on any ground but on a fine day it was not an unusual total for the wrykyn eleven some years before against ripton they had run up four hundred and sixteen and only last season had massacred a very weak team of old wrykynians with a score that only just missed the fourth hundred  unfortunately on the present occasion there was scarcely time unless the bowling happened to get completely collared to make the runs it was a quarter to four when the innings began and stumps were to be drawn at a quarter to seven a hundred an hour is quick work  burgess however was optimistic as usual better have a go for them he said to berridge and marsh the school first pair  following out this courageous advice berridge after hitting three boundaries in his first two overs was stumped halfway through the third  after this things settled down morris the firstwicket man was a thoroughly sound bat a little on the slow side but exceedingly hard to shift he and marsh proceeded to play themselves in until it looked as if they were likely to stay till the drawing of stumps  a comfortable rather somnolent feeling settled upon the school a long stand at cricket is a soothing sight to watch there was an absence of hurry about the batsmen which harmonised well with the drowsy summer afternoon and yet runs were coming at a fair pace the hundred went up at five oclock the hundred and fifty at halfpast both batsmen were completely at home and the mcc thirdchange bowlers had been put on  then the great wicketkeeper took off the pads and gloves and the fieldsmen retired to posts at the extreme edge of the ground  lobs said burgess by jove i wish i was in  it seemed to be the general opinion among the members of the wrykyn eleven on the pavilion balcony that morris and marsh were in luck the team did not grudge them their good fortune because they had earned it but they were distinctly envious  lobs are the most dangerous insinuating things in the world everybody knows in theory the right way to treat them everybody knows that the man who is content not to try to score more than a single cannot get out to them yet nearly everybody does get out to them  it was the same story today the first over yielded six runs all through gentle taps along the ground in the second marsh hit an overpitched one along the ground to the terrace bank the next ball he swept round to the leg boundary and that was the end of marsh he saw himself scoring at the rate of twentyfour an over off the last ball he was stumped by several feet having done himself credit by scoring seventy  the long stand was followed as usual by a series of disasters marshs wicket had fallen at a hundred and eighty ellerby left at a hundred and eightysix by the time the scoringboard registered two hundred five wickets were down three of them victims to the lobs morris was still in at one end he had refused to be tempted he was jogging on steadily to his century  bob jackson went in next with instructions to keep his eye on the lobman  for a time things went well saunders who had gone on to bowl again after a rest seemed to give morris no trouble and bob put him through the slips with apparent ease twenty runs were added when the lobbowler once more got in his deadly work bob letting alone a ball wide of the offstump under the impression that it was going to break away was disagreeably surprised to find it break in instead and hit the wicket the bowler smiled sadly as if he hated to have to do these things  mikes heart jumped as he saw the bails go it was his turn next  two hundred and twentynine said burgess and its ten past six no good trying for the runs now stick in he added to mike thats all youve got to do  all mike felt as if he was being strangled his heart was racing like the engines of a motor he knew his teeth were chattering he wished he could stop them what a time bob was taking to get back to the pavilion he wanted to rush out and get the thing over  at last he arrived and mike fumbling at a glove tottered out into the sunshine he heard miles and miles away a sound of clapping and a thin shrill noise as if somebody were screaming in the distance as a matter of fact several members of his form and of the junior dayroom at wains nearly burst themselves at that moment  at the wickets he felt better bob had fallen to the last ball of the over and morris standing ready for saunderss delivery looked so calm and certain of himself that it was impossible to feel entirely without hope and selfconfidence mike knew that morris had made ninetyeight and he supposed that morris knew that he was very near his century yet he seemed to be absolutely undisturbed mike drew courage from his attitude  morris pushed the first ball away to leg mike would have liked to have run two but short leg had retrieved the ball as he reached the crease  the moment had come the moment which he had experienced only in dreams and in the dreams he was always full of confidence and invariably hit a boundary sometimes a drive sometimes a cut but always a boundary  to leg sir said the umpire  dont be in a funk said a voice play straight and you cant get out  it was joe who had taken the gloves when the wicketkeeper went on to bowl  mike grinned wryly but gratefully  saunders was beginning his run it was all so homelike that for a moment mike felt himself again how often he had seen those two little skips and the jump it was like being in the paddock again with marjory and the dogs waiting by the railings to fetch the ball if he made a drive  saunders ran to the crease and bowled  now saunders was a conscientious man and doubtless bowled the very best ball that he possibly could on the other hand it was mikes first appearance for the school and saunders besides being conscientious was undoubtedly kindhearted it is useless to speculate as to whether he was trying to bowl his best that ball if so he failed signally it was a halfvolley just the right distance away from the offstump the sort of ball mike was wont to send nearly through the net at home  the next moment the dreams had come true the umpire was signalling to the scoringbox the school was shouting extracover was trotting to the boundary to fetch the ball and mike was blushing and wondering whether it was bad form to grin  from that ball onwards all was for the best in this best of all possible worlds saunders bowled no more halfvolleys but mike played everything that he did bowl he met the lobs with a bat like a barndoor even the departure of morris caught in the slips off saunderss next over for a chanceless hundred and five did not disturb him all nervousness had left him he felt equal to the situation burgess came in and began to hit out as if he meant to knock off the runs the bowling became a shade loose twice he was given full tosses to leg which he hit to the terrace bank halfpast six chimed and two hundred and fifty went up on the telegraph board burgess continued to hit mikes whole soul was concentrated on keeping up his wicket there was only reeves to follow him and reeves was a victim to the first straight ball burgess had to hit because it was the only game he knew but he himself must simply stay in  the hands of the clock seemed to have stopped then suddenly he heard the umpire say last over and he settled down to keep those six balls out of his wicket  the lob bowler had taken himself off and the oxford authentic had gone on fast lefthand  the first ball was short and wide of the offstump mike let it alone number two yorker got him three straight halfvolley mike played it back to the bowler four beat him and missed the wicket by an inch five another yorker down on it again in the old familiar way  all was well the match was a draw now whatever happened to him he hit out almost at a venture at the last ball and midoff jumping just failed to reach it it hummed over his head and ran like a streak along the turf and up the bank and a great howl of delight went up from the school as the umpire took off the bails  mike walked away from the wickets with joe and the wicketkeeper  im sorry about your nose joe said the wicketkeeper in tones of grave solicitude  whats wrong with it  at present said the wicketkeeper nothing but in a few years im afraid its going to be put badly out of joint     chapter xiv  a slight imbroglio   mike got his third eleven colours after the mcc match as he had made twentythree not out in a crisis in a first eleven match this may not seem an excessive reward but it was all that he expected one had to take the rungs of the ladder singly at wrykyn first one was given ones third eleven cap that meant you are a promising man and we have our eye on you then came the second colours they might mean anything from well here you are you wont get any higher so you may as well have the thing now to this is just to show that we still have our eye on you  mike was a certainty now for the second but it needed more than one performance to secure the first cap  i told you so said wyatt naturally to burgess after the match  hes not bad said burgess ill give him another shot  but burgess as has been pointed out was not a person who ever became gushing with enthusiasm                                       so wilkins of the school house who had played twice for the first eleven dropped down into the second as many a good man had done before him and mike got his place in the next match against the gentlemen of the county unfortunately for him the visiting team however gentlemanly were not brilliant cricketers at any rate as far as bowling was concerned the school won the toss went in first and made three hundred and sixteen for five wickets morris making another placid century the innings was declared closed before mike had a chance of distinguishing himself in an innings which lasted for one over he made two runs not out and had to console himself for the cutting short of his performance by the fact that his average for the school was still infinity bob who was one of those lucky enough to have an unabridged innings did better in this match making twentyfive but with morris making a hundred and seventeen and berridge ellerby and marsh all passing the halfcentury this score did not show up excessively  we now come to what was practically a turningpoint in mikes career at wrykyn there is no doubt that his meteorlike flights at cricket had an unsettling effect on him he was enjoying life amazingly and as is not uncommon with the prosperous he waxed fat and kicked fortunately for himthough he did not look upon it in that light at the timehe kicked the one person it was most imprudent to kick the person he selected was firbysmith with anybody else the thing might have blown over to the detriment of mikes character but firbysmith having the most tender affection for his dignity made a fuss  it happened in this way the immediate cause of the disturbance was a remark of mikes but the indirect cause was the unbearably patronising manner which the head of wains chose to adopt towards him the fact that he was playing for the school seemed to make no difference at all firbysmith continued to address mike merely as the small boy  the following verbatim was the tactful speech which he addressed to him on the evening of the mcc match having summoned him to his study for the purpose  well he said you played a very decent innings this afternoon and i suppose youre frightfully pleased with yourself eh well mind you dont go getting swelled head see thats all run along  mike departed bursting with fury  the next link in the chain was forged a week after the gentlemen of the county match house matches had begun and wains were playing applebys applebys made a hundred and fifty odd shaping badly for the most part against wyatts slows then wains opened their innings the gazeka as head of the house was captain of the side and he and wyatt went in first wyatt made a few mighty hits and was then caught at cover mike went in first wicket  for some ten minutes all was peace firbysmith scratched away at his end getting here and there a single and now and then a two and mike settled down at once to play what he felt was going to be the innings of a lifetime applebys bowling was on the feeble side with raikes of the third eleven as the star supported by some small change mike pounded it vigorously to one who had been brought up on saunders raikes possessed few subtleties he had made seventeen and was thoroughly set when the gazeka who had the bowling hit one in the direction of coverpoint with a certain type of batsman a single is a thing to take big risks for and the gazeka badly wanted that single  come on he shouted prancing down the pitch  mike who had remained in his crease with the idea that nobody even moderately sane would attempt a run for a hit like that moved forward in a startled and irresolute manner firbysmith arrived shouting run and cover having thrown the ball in the wicketkeeper removed the bails  these are solemn moments  the only possible way of smoothing over an episode of this kind is for the guilty man to grovel  firbysmith did not grovel  easy run there you know he said reprovingly  the world swam before mikes eyes through the red mist he could see firbysmiths face the sun glinted on his rather prominent teeth to mikes distorted vision it seemed that the criminal was amused  dont laugh you grinning ape he cried it isnt funny  illustration dont laugh you grinning ape  he then made for the trees where the rest of the team were sitting  now firbysmith not only possessed rather prominent teeth he was also sensitive on the subject mikes shaft sank in deeply the fact that emotion caused him to swipe at a straight halfvolley miss it and be bowled next ball made the wound rankle  he avoided mike on his return to the trees and mike feeling now a little apprehensive avoided him  the gazeka brooded apart for the rest of the afternoon chewing the insult at close of play he sought burgess  burgess besides being captain of the eleven was also head of the school he was the man who arranged prefects meetings and only a prefects meeting thought firbysmith could adequately avenge his lacerated dignity  i want to speak to you burgess he said  whats up said burgess  you know young jackson in our house  what about him  hes been frightfully insolent  cheeked you said burgess a man of simple speech  i want you to call a prefects meeting and lick him  burgess looked incredulous  rather a large order a prefects meeting he said it has to be a pretty serious sort of thing for that  frightful cheek to a school prefect is a serious thing said firbysmith with the air of one uttering an epigram  well i supposewhat did he say to you  firbysmith related the painful details  burgess started to laugh but turned the laugh into a cough  yes he said meditatively rather thick still i meana prefects meeting rather like crushing a thingummy with a whatdyoucallit besides hes a decent kid  hes frightfully conceited  oh wellwell anyhow look here ill think it over and let you know tomorrow its not the sort of thing to rush through without thinking about it  and the matter was left temporarily at that     chapter xv  mike creates a vacancy   burgess walked off the ground feeling that fate was not using him well  here was he a wellmeaning youth who wanted to be on good terms with all the world being jockeyed into slaughtering a kid whose batting he admired and whom personally he liked and the worst of it was that he sympathised with mike he knew what it felt like to be run out just when one had got set and he knew exactly how maddening the gazekas manner would be on such an occasion on the other hand officially he was bound to support the head of wains prefects must stand together or chaos will come  he thought he would talk it over with somebody bob occurred to him it was only fair that bob should be told as the nearest of kin  and here was another grievance against fate bob was a person he did not particularly wish to see just then for that morning he had posted up the list of the team to play for the school against geddington one of the four schools which wrykyn met at cricket and bobs name did not appear on that list several things had contributed to that melancholy omission in the first place geddington to judge from the weekly reports in the sportsman and field were strong this year at batting in the second place the results of the last few matches and particularly the mcc match had given burgess the idea that wrykyn was weak at bowling it became necessary therefore to drop a batsman out of the team in favour of a bowler and either mike or bob must be the man  burgess was as rigidly conscientious as the captain of a school eleven should be bob was one of his best friends and he would have given much to be able to put him in the team but he thought the thing over and put the temptation sturdily behind him at batting there was not much to choose between the two but in fielding there was a great deal mike was good bob was bad so out bob had gone and nevillesmith a fair fast bowler at all times and on his day dangerous took his place  these clashings of public duty with private inclination are the drawbacks to the despotic position of captain of cricket at a public school it is awkward having to meet your best friend after you have dropped him from the team and it is difficult to talk to him as if nothing had happened  burgess felt very selfconscious as he entered bobs study and was rather glad that he had a topic of conversation ready to hand  busy bob he asked  hullo said bob with a cheerfulness rather overdone in his anxiety to show burgess the man that he did not hold him responsible in any way for the distressing acts of burgess the captain take a pew dont these studies get beastly hot this weather theres some gingerbeer in the cupboard have some  no thanks i say bob look here i want to see you  well you can cant you this is me sitting over here the tall dark handsome chap  its awfully awkward you know continued burgess gloomily that ass of a young brother of yourssorry but he is an ass though hes your brother  thanks for the though billy you know how to put a thing nicely whats mike been up to  its that old fool the gazeka he came to me frothing with rage and wanted me to call a prefects meeting and touch young mike up  bob displayed interest and excitement for the first time  prefects meeting what the dickens is up whats he been doing smith must be drunk whats all the row about  burgess repeated the main facts of the case as he had them from firbysmith  personally i sympathise with the kid he added still the gazeka is a prefect  bob gnawed a penholder morosely  silly young idiot he said  sickening thing being run out suggested burgess  still  i know its rather hard to see what to do i suppose if the gazeka insists ones bound to support him  i suppose so  awful rot prefects lickings arent meant for that sort of thing theyre supposed to be for kids who steal buns at the shop or muck about generally not for a chap who curses a fellow who runs him out i tell you what theres just a chance firbysmith wont press the thing he hadnt had time to get over it when he saw me by now hell have simmered down a bit look here youre a pal of his arent you well go and ask him to drop the business say youll curse your brother and make him apologise and that ill kick him out of the team for the geddington match  it was a difficult moment for bob one cannot help ones thoughts and for an instant the idea of going to geddington with the team as he would certainly do if mike did not play made him waver but he recovered himself  dont do that he said i dont see theres a need for anything of that sort you must play the best side youve got i can easily talk the old gazeka over he gets all right in a second if hes treated the right way ill go and do it now  burgess looked miserable  i say bob he said  yes  oh nothingi mean youre not a bad sort with which glowing eulogy he dashed out of the room thanking his stars that he had won through a confoundedly awkward business  bob went across to wains to interview and soothe firbysmith  he found that outraged hero sitting moodily in his study like achilles in his tent  seeing bob he became all animation  look here he said i wanted to see you you know that frightful young brother of yours  i know i know said bob burgess was telling me he wants kicking  he wants a frightful licking from the prefects emended the aggrieved party  well i dont know you know not much good lugging the prefects into it is there i mean apart from everything else not much of a catch for me would it be having to sit there and look on im a prefect too you know  firbysmith looked a little blank at this he had a great admiration for bob  i didnt think of you he said  i thought you hadnt said bob you see it now though dont you  firbysmith returned to the original grievance  well you know it was frightful cheek  of course it was still i think if i saw him and cursed him and sent him up to you to apologisehow would that do  all right after all i did run him out  yes theres that of course mikes all right really it isnt as if he did that sort of thing as a habit  no all right then  thanks said bob and went to find mike                                       the lecture on deportment which he read that future allengland batsman in a secluded passage near the junior dayroom left the latter rather limp and exceedingly meek for the moment all the jauntiness and exuberance had been drained out of him he was a punctured balloon reflection and the distinctly discouraging replies of those experts in school law to whom he had put the question what dyou think hell do had induced a very chastened frame of mind  he perceived that he had walked very nearly into a hornets nest and the realisation of his escape made him agree readily to all the conditions imposed the apology to the gazeka was made without reserve and the offensively forgiving saynomoreaboutitbuttake careinfuture air of the head of the house roused no spark of resentment in him so subdued was his fighting spirit all he wanted was to get the thing done with he was not inclined to be critical  and most of all he felt grateful to bob firbysmith in the course of his address had not omitted to lay stress on the importance of bobs intervention but for bob he gave him to understand he mike would have been prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law mike came away with a confused picture in his mind of a horde of furious prefects bent on his slaughter after the manner of a stage excited crowd and bob waving them back he realised that bob had done him a good turn he wished he could find some way of repaying him  curiously enough it was an enemy of bobs who suggested the wayburton of donaldsons burton was a slippery young gentleman fourteen years of age who had frequently come into contact with bob in the house and owed him many grudges with mike he had always tried to form an alliance though without success  he happened to meet mike going to school next morning and unburdened his soul to him it chanced that bob and he had had another small encounter immediately after breakfast and burton felt revengeful  i say said burton im jolly glad youre playing for the first against geddington  thanks said mike  im specially glad for one reason  whats that inquired mike without interest  because your beast of a brother has been chucked out hed have been playing but for you  at any other time mike would have heard bob called a beast without active protest he would have felt that it was no business of his to fight his brothers battles for him but on this occasion he deviated from his rule  he kicked burton not once or twice but several times so that burton retiring hurriedly came to the conclusion that it must be something in the jackson blood some taint as it were they were all beasts                                       mike walked on weighing this remark and gradually made up his mind it must be remembered that he was in a confused mental condition and that the only thing he realised clearly was that bob had pulled him out of an uncommonly nasty hole it seemed to him that it was necessary to repay bob he thought the thing over more fully during school and his decision remained unaltered  on the evening before the geddington match just before lockup mike tapped at burgesss study door he tapped with his right hand for his left was in a sling  come in yelled the captain hullo  im awfully sorry burgess said mike ive crocked my wrist a bit  how did you do that you were all right at the nets  slipped as i was changing said mike stolidly  is it bad  nothing much im afraid i shant be able to play tomorrow  i say thats bad luck beastly bad luck we wanted your batting too be all right though in a day or two i suppose  oh yes rather  hope so anyway  thanks goodnight  goodnight  and burgess with the comfortable feeling that he had managed to combine duty and pleasure after all wrote a note to bob at donaldsons telling him to be ready to start with the team for geddington by the 854 next morning     chapter xvi  an expert examination   mikes uncle john was a wanderer on the face of the earth he had been an army surgeon in the days of his youth and after an adventurous career mainly in afghanistan had inherited enough money to keep him in comfort for the rest of his life he had thereupon left the service and now spent most of his time flitting from one spot of europe to another he had been dashing up to scotland on the day when mike first became a wrykynian but a few weeks in an uncomfortable hotel in skye and a few days in a comfortable one in edinburgh had left him with the impression that he had now seen all that there was to be seen in north britain and might reasonably shift his camp again  coming south he had looked in on mikes people for a brief space and at the request of mikes mother took the early express to wrykyn in order to pay a visit of inspection  his telegram arrived during morning school mike went down to the station to meet him after lunch  uncle john took command of the situation at once  school playing anybody today mike i want to see a match  theyre playing geddington only its away theres a second match on  why arent youhullo i didnt see what have you been doing to yourself  crocked my wrist a bit its nothing much  how did you do that  slipped while i was changing after cricket  hurt  not much thanks  doctor seen it  no but its really nothing be all right by monday  hm somebody ought to look at it ill have a look later on  mike did not appear to relish this prospect  it isnt anything uncle john really it doesnt matter a bit  never mind it wont do any harm having somebody examine it who knows a bit about these things now what shall we do go on the river  i shouldnt be able to steer  i could manage about that still i think i should like to see the place first your mothers sure to ask me if you showed me round its like going over the stables when youre stopping at a countryhouse got to be done and better do it as soon as possible  it is never very interesting playing the part of showman at school both mike and his uncle were inclined to scamp the business mike pointed out the various landmarks without much enthusiasmit is only after one has left a few years that the school buildings take to themselves romanceand uncle john said ah yes i see very nice two or three times in an absent voice and they passed on to the cricket field where the second eleven were playing a neighbouring engineering school it was a glorious day the sun had never seemed to mike so bright or the grass so green it was one of those days when the ball looks like a large vermilioncoloured football as it leaves the bowlers hand if ever there was a day when it seemed to mike that a century would have been a certainty it was this saturday a sudden bitter realisation of all he had given up swept over him but he choked the feeling down the thing was done and it was no good brooding over the mighthavebeens now stilland the geddington ground was supposed to be one of the easiest scoring grounds of all the public schools  well hit by george remarked uncle john as trevor who had gone in first wicket for the second eleven swept a halfvolley to leg round to the bank where they were sitting  thats trevor said mike chap in donaldsons the fellow at the other end is wilkins hes in the school house they look as if they were getting set by jove he said enviously pretty good fun batting on a day like this  uncle john detected the envious note  i suppose you would have been playing here but for your wrist  no i was playing for the first  for the first for the school my word mike i didnt know that no wonder youre feeling badly treated of course i remember your father saying you had played once for the school and done well but i thought that was only as a substitute i didnt know you were a regular member of the team what bad luck will you get another chance  depends on bob  has bob got your place  mike nodded  if he does well today theyll probably keep him in  isnt there room for both of you  such a lot of old colours there are only three vacancies and henfrey got one of those a week ago i expect theyll give one of the other two to a bowler nevillesmith i should think if he does well against geddington then therell be only the last place left  rather awkward that  still its bobs last year ive got plenty of time but i wish i could get in this year  after they had watched the match for an hour uncle johns restless nature asserted itself  suppose we go for a pull on the river now he suggested  they got up  lets just call at the shop said mike there ought to be a telegram from geddington by this time i wonder how bobs got on  apparently bob had not had a chance yet of distinguishing himself the telegram read geddington 151 for four lunch  not bad that said mike but i believe theyre weak in bowling  they walked down the road towards the school landingstage  the worst of a school said uncle john as he pulled upstream with strong unskilful stroke is that one isnt allowed to smoke on the grounds i badly want a pipe the next piece of shade that you see sing out and well put in there  pull your left said mike that willows what you want  uncle john looked over his shoulder caught a crab recovered himself and steered the boat in under the shade of the branches  put the rope over that stump can you manage with one hand here let medone it good aah  he blew a great cloud of smoke into the air and sighed contentedly  i hope you dont smoke mike  no  rotten trick for a boy when you get to my age you need it boys ought to be thinking about keeping themselves fit and being good at games which reminds me lets have a look at the wrist  a hunted expression came into mikes eyes  its really nothing he began but his uncle had already removed the sling and was examining the arm with the neat rapidity of one who has been brought up to such things  to mike it seemed as if everything in the world was standing still and waiting he could hear nothing but his own breathing  his uncle pressed the wrist gingerly once or twice then gave it a little twist  that hurt he asked  yeno stammered mike  uncle john looked up sharply mike was crimson  whats the game inquired uncle john  mike said nothing  there was a twinkle in his uncles eyes  may as well tell me i wont give you away why this wounded warrior business when youve no more the matter with you than i have  mike hesitated  i only wanted to get out of having to write this morning there was an exam on  the idea had occurred to him just before he spoke it had struck him as neat and plausible  to uncle john it did not appear in the same light  do you always write with your left hand and if you had gone with the first eleven to geddington wouldnt that have got you out of your exam try again  when in doubt one may as well tell the truth mike told it  i know it wasnt that really only  well  oh well dash it all then old bob got me out of an awful row the day before yesterday and he seemed a bit sick at not playing for the first so i thought i might as well let him thats how it was look here swear you wont tell him  uncle john was silent inwardly he was deciding that the five shillings which he had intended to bestow on mike on his departure should become a sovereign this it may be mentioned as an interesting biographical fact was the only occasion in his life on which mike earned money at the rate of fifteen shillings a halfminute  swear you wont tell him hed be most frightfully sick if he knew  i wont tell him  conversation dwindled to vanishingpoint uncle john smoked on in weighty silence while mike staring up at the blue sky through the branches of the willow let his mind wander to geddington where his fate was even now being sealed how had the school got on what had bob done if he made about twenty would they give him his cap supposing  a faint snore from uncle john broke in on his meditations then there was a clatter as a briar pipe dropped on to the floor of the boat and his uncle sat up gaping  jove i was nearly asleep whats the time just on six didnt know it was so late  i ought to be getting back soon i think lockups at halfpast  up with the anchor then you can tackle that rope with two hands now eh we are not observed dont fall overboard im going to shove her off  therell be another telegram i should think said mike as they reached the school gates  shall we go and look  they walked to the shop  a second piece of grey paper had been pinned up under the first mike pushed his way through the crowd it was a longer message this time  it ran as follows     geddington 247 burgess six wickets nevillesmith four    wrykyn 270 for nine berridge 86 marsh 58 jackson 48  mike worked his way back through the throng and rejoined his uncle  well said uncle john  we won  he paused for a moment  bob made fortyeight he added carelessly  uncle john felt in his pocket and silently slid a sovereign into mikes hand  it was the only possible reply     chapter xvii  another vacancy   wyatt got back late that night arriving at the dormitory as mike was going to bed  by jove im done he said it was simply baking at geddington and i came back in a carriage with nevillesmith and ellerby and they ragged the whole time i wanted to go to sleep only they wouldnt let me old smith was awfully bucked because hed taken four wickets i should think hed go off his nut if he took eight ever he was singing comic songs when he wasnt trying to put ellerby under the seat hows your wrist  oh better thanks  wyatt began to undress  any colours asked mike after a pause first eleven colours were generally given in the pavilion after a match or on the journey home  no only one or two thirds jenkins and clephane and another chap cant remember who no first though  what was bobs innings like  not bad a bit lucky he ought to have been out before hed scored and he was out when hed made about sixteen only the umpire didnt seem to know that its lbw when you get your leg right in front of the wicket and the ball hits it never saw a clearer case in my life i was in at the other end bit rotten for the geddington chaps just lost them the match their umpire too bit of luck for bob he didnt give the ghost of a chance after that  i should have thought theyd have given him his colours  most captains would have done only burgess is so keen on fielding that he rather keeps off it  why did he field badly  rottenly and the man always will choose billys bowling to drop catches off and billy would cut his rich uncle from australia if he kept on dropping them off him bobs fieldings perfectly sinful he was pretty bad at the beginning of the season but now hes got so nervous that hes a dozen times worse he turns a delicate green when he sees a catch coming he let their best man off twice in one over off billy today and the chap went on and made a hundred odd ripping innings bar those two chances i hear hes got an average of eighty in school matches this season beastly man to bowl to knocked me off in half a dozen overs and when he does give a couple of easy chances bob puts them both on the floor billy wouldnt have given him his cap after the match if hed made a hundred bobs the sort of man who wouldnt catch a ball if you handed it to him on a plate with watercress round it  burgess reviewing the match that night as he lay awake in his cubicle had come to much the same conclusion he was very fond of bob but two missed catches in one over was straining the bonds of human affection too far there would have been serious trouble between david and jonathan if either had persisted in dropping catches off the others bowling he writhed in bed as he remembered the second of the two chances which the wretched bob had refused the scene was indelibly printed on his mind chap had got a late cut which he fancied rather with great guile he had fed this late cut sent down a couple which he put to the boundary then fired a third much faster and a bit shorter chap had a go at it just as he had expected and he felt that life was a good thing after all when the ball just touched the corner of the bat and flew into bobs hands and bob dropped it  the memory was too bitter if he dwelt on it he felt he would get insomnia so he turned to pleasanter reflections the yorker which had shattered the secondwicket man and the slow headball which had led to a big hitter being caught on the boundary soothed by these memories he fell asleep  next morning he found himself in a softened frame of mind he thought of bobs iniquities with sorrow rather than wrath he felt towards him much as a father feels towards a prodigal son whom there is still a chance of reforming he overtook bob on his way to chapel  directness was always one of burgesss leading qualities  look here bob about your fielding its simply awful  bob was all remorse  its those beastly slip catches i cant time them  that one yesterday was right into your hands both of them were  i know im frightfully sorry  well but i mean why cant you hold them its no good being a good batyoure that all rightif youre going to give away runs in the field  do you know i believe i should do better in the deep i could get time to watch them there i wish youd give me a shot in the deepfor the second  second be blowed i want your batting in the first do you think youd really do better in the deep  im almost certain i should ill practise like mad trevorll hit me up catches i hate the slips i get in the dickens of a funk directly the bowler starts his run now i know that if a catch does come i shall miss it im certain the deep would be much better  all right then try it  the conversation turned to less pressing topics                                       in the next two matches accordingly bob figured on the boundary where he had not much to do except throw the ball back to the bowler and stop an occasional drive along the carpet the beauty of fielding in the deep is that no unpleasant surprises can be sprung upon one there is just that moment or two for collecting ones thoughts which makes the whole difference bob as he stood regarding the game from afar found his selfconfidence returning slowly drop by drop  as for mike he played for the second and hoped for the day                                       his opportunity came at last it will be remembered that on the morning after the great picnic the headmaster made an announcement in hall to the effect that owing to an outbreak of chickenpox in the town all streets except the high street would be out of bounds this did not affect the bulk of the school for most of the shops to which any one ever thought of going were in the high street but there were certain inquiring minds who liked to ferret about in odd corners  among these was one leathertwigg of seymours better known in criminal circles as shoeblossom  shoeblossom was a curious mixture of the energetic ragger and the quiet student on a monday evening you would hear a hideous uproar proceeding from seymours junior dayroom and going down with a swaggerstick to investigate you would find a tangled heap of squealing humanity on the floor and at the bottom of the heap squealing louder than any two others would be shoeblossom his collar burst and blackened and his face apoplectically crimson on the tuesday afternoon strolling in some shady corner of the grounds you would come upon him lying on his chest deep in some work of fiction and resentful of interruption on the wednesday morning he would be in receipt of four hundred lines from his housemaster for breaking three windows and a gasglobe essentially a man of moods shoeblossom  it happened about the date of the geddington match that he took out from the school library a copy of the iron pirate and for the next day or two he wandered about like a lost spirit trying to find a sequestered spot in which to read it his inability to hit on such a spot was rendered more irritating by the fact that to judge from the first few chapters which he had managed to get through during prep one night under the eye of a shortsighted master the book was obviously the last word in hot stuff he tried the junior dayroom but people threw cushions at him he tried out of doors and a ball hit from a neighbouring net nearly scalped him anything in the nature of concentration became impossible in these circumstances  then he recollected that in a quiet backwater off the high street there was a little confectioners shop where tea might be had at a reasonable sum and also what was more important peace  he made his way there and in the dingy back shop all amongst the dust and bluebottles settled down to a thoughtful perusal of chapter six  upstairs at the same moment the doctor was recommending that master john george the son of the house be kept warm and out of draughts and not permitted to scratch himself however necessary such an action might seem to him in brief he was attending j g for chickenpox  shoeblossom came away entering the high street furtively lest authority should see him out of bounds and returned to the school where he went about his lawful occasions as if there were no such thing as chickenpox in the world  but all the while the microbe was getting in some unostentatious but clever work a week later shoeblossom began to feel queer he had occasional headaches and found himself oppressed by a queer distaste for food the professional advice of dr oakes the school doctor was called for and shoeblossom took up his abode in the infirmary where he read punch sucked oranges and thought of life  two days later barry felt queer he too disappeared from society  chickenpox is no respecter of persons the next victim was marsh of the first eleven marsh who was top of the school averages where were his drives now his late cuts that were wont to set the pavilion in a roar wrapped in a blanket and looking like the spotted marvel of a travelling circus he was driven across to the infirmary in a fourwheeler and it became incumbent upon burgess to select a substitute for him  and so it came about that mike soared once again into the ranks of the elect and found his name down in the team to play against the incogniti     chapter xviii  bob has news to impart   wrykyn went down badly before the incogs it generally happens at least once in a school cricket season that the team collapses hopelessly for no apparent reason some schools do it in nearly every match but wrykyn so far had been particularly fortunate this year they had only been beaten once and that by a mere twenty odd runs in a hardfought game but on this particular day against a not overwhelmingly strong side they failed miserably the weather may have had something to do with it for rain fell early in the morning and the school batting first on the drying wicket found themselves considerably puzzled by a slow lefthander morris and berridge left with the score still short of ten and after that the rout began bob going in fourth wicket made a dozen and mike kept his end up and was not out eleven but nobody except wyatt who hit out at everything and knocked up thirty before he was stumped did anything to distinguish himself the total was a hundred and seven and the incogniti batting when the wicket was easier doubled this  the general opinion of the school after this match was that either mike or bob would have to stand down from the team when it was definitely filled up for nevillesmith by showing up well with the ball against the incogniti when the others failed with the bat made it practically certain that he would get one of the two vacancies  if i do he said to wyatt there will be the biggest bust of modern times at my place my pater is away for a holiday in norway and im alone bar the servants and i can square them will you come  tea  tea said nevillesmith scornfully  well what then  dont you ever have feeds in the dorms after lightsout in the houses  used to when i was a kid too old now have to look after my digestion i remember three years ago when wains won the footer cup we got up and fed at about two in the morning all sorts of luxuries sardines on sugarbiscuits ive got the taste in my mouth still do you remember macpherson left a couple of years ago his food ran out so he spread brownboot polish on bread and ate that got through a slice too wonderful chap but what about this thing of yours what times it going to be  eleven suit you  all right  how about getting out  ill do it as quickly as the team did today i cant say more than that  you were all right  im an exceptional sort of chap  what about the jacksons  its going to be a close thing if bobs fielding were to improve suddenly he would just do it but young mikes all over him as a bat in a year or two that kidll be a marvel hes bound to get in next year of course so perhaps it would be better if bob got the place as its his last season still one wants the best man of course                                       mike avoided bob as much as possible during this anxious period and he privately thought it rather tactless of the latter when meeting him one day outside donaldsons he insisted on his coming in and having some tea  mike shuffled uncomfortably as his brother filled the kettle and lit the etna it required more tact than he had at his disposal to carry off a situation like this  bob being older was more at his ease he got tea ready making desultory conversation the while as if there were no particular reason why either of them should feel uncomfortable in the others presence when he had finished he poured mike out a cup passed him the bread and sat down  not seen much of each other lately mike what  mike murmured unintelligibly through a mouthful of breadandjam  its no good pretending it isnt an awkward situation continued bob because it is beastly awkward  awful rot the pater sending us to the same school  oh i dont know weve all been at wrykyn pity to spoil the record its your fault for being such a young infant prodigy and mine for not being able to field like an ordinary human being  you get on much better in the deep  bit better yes liable at any moment to miss a sitter though not that it matters much really whether i do now  mike stared  what why  thats what i wanted to see you about has burgess said anything to you yet  no why what about  well ive a sort of idea our little race is over i fancy youve won  ive not heard a word  i have ill tell you what makes me think the things settled i was in the pav just now in the first room trying to find a battingglove id mislaid there was a copy of the wrykynian lying on the mantelpiece and i picked it up and started reading it so there wasnt any noise to show anybody outside that there was some one in the room and then i heard burgess and spence jawing on the steps they thought the place was empty of course i couldnt help hearing what they said the pavs like a soundingboard i heard every word spence said well its about as difficult a problem as any captain of cricket at wrykyn has ever had to tackle i had a sort of idea that old billy liked to boss things all on his own but apparently he does consult spence sometimes after all hes cricketmaster and thats what hes there for well billy said i dont know what to do what do you think sir spence said well ill give you my opinion burgess but dont feel bound to act on it im simply saying what i think yes sir said old bill doing a big young disciple with wise master act i think m said spence decidedly m hes a shade better than r now and in a year or two of course therell be no comparison  oh rot muttered mike wiping the sweat off his forehead this was one of the most harrowing interviews he had ever been through  not at all billy agreed with him thats just what i think sir he said its rough on bob but still and then they walked down the steps i waited a bit to give them a good start and then sheered off myself and so home  mike looked at the floor and said nothing  there was nothing much to be said  well what i wanted to see you about was this resumed bob i dont propose to kiss you or anything but on the other hand dont lets go to the other extreme im not saying that it isnt a bit of a brick just missing my cap like this but it would have been just as bad for you if youd been the one dropped its the fortune of war i dont want you to go about feeling that youve blighted my life and so on and dashing up sidestreets to avoid me because you think the sight of you will be painful as it isnt me im jolly glad its you and i shall cadge a seat in the pavilion from you when youre playing for england at the oval congratulate you  it was the custom at wrykyn when you congratulated a man on getting colours to shake his hand they shook hands  thanks awfully bob said mike and after that there seemed to be nothing much to talk about so mike edged out of the room and tore across to wains  he was sorry for bob but he would not have been human which he certainly was if the triumph of having won through at last into the first eleven had not dwarfed commiseration it had been his one ambition and now he had achieved it  the annoying part of the thing was that he had nobody to talk to about it until the news was official he could not mention it to the common herd it wouldnt do the only possible confidant was wyatt and wyatt was at bisley shooting with the school eight for the ashburton for bullseyes as well as cats came within wyatts range as a marksman cricket took up too much of his time for him to be captain of the eight and the man chosen to shoot for the spencer as he would otherwise almost certainly have been but even though short of practice he was well up in the team  until he returned mike could tell nobody and by the time he returned the notice would probably be up in the senior block with the other cricket notices  in this fermenting state mike went into the house  the list of the team to play for wains v seymours on the following monday was on the board as he passed it a few words scrawled in pencil at the bottom caught his eye     all the above will turn out for housefielding at 630 tomorrow    morningw fs  oh dash it said mike what rot why on earth cant he leave us alone  for getting up an hour before his customary time for rising was not among mikes favourite pastimes still orders were orders he felt it would have to be done     chapter xix  mike goes to sleep again   mike was a stout supporter of the view that sleep in large quantities is good for one he belonged to the school of thought which holds that a man becomes plain and pasty if deprived of his full spell in bed he aimed at the peachbloom complexion  to be routed out of bed a clear hour before the proper time even on a summer morning was not therefore a prospect that appealed to him  when he woke it seemed even less attractive than it had done when he went to sleep he had banged his head on the pillow six times overnight and this silent alarm proved effective as it always does reaching out a hand for his watch he found that it was five minutes past six  this was to the good he could manage another quarter of an hour between the sheets it would only take him ten minutes to wash and get into his flannels  he took his quarter of an hour and a little more he woke from a sort of doze to find that it was twentyfive past  mans inability to get out of bed in the morning is a curious thing one may reason with oneself clearly and forcibly without the slightest effect one knows that delay means inconvenience perhaps it may spoil ones whole day and one also knows that a single resolute heave will do the trick but logic is of no use one simply lies there  mike thought he would take another minute  and during that minute there floated into his mind the question who was firbysmith that was the point who was he after all  this started quite a new train of thought previously mike had firmly intended to get upsome time now he began to waver  the more he considered the gazekas insignificance and futility and his own magnificence the more outrageous did it seem that he should be dragged out of bed to please firbysmiths vapid mind here was he about to receive his first eleven colours on this very day probably being ordered about inconveniencedin short put upon by a worm who had only just scraped into the third  was this right he asked himself was this proper  and the hands of the watch moved round to twenty to  what was the matter with his fielding it was all right make the rest of the team fag about yes but not a chap who dash it all had got his first for fielding  it was with almost a feeling of selfrighteousness that mike turned over on his side and went to sleep again  and outside in the cricketfield the massive mind of the gazeka was filled with rage as it was gradually borne in upon him that this was not a question of mere latenesswhich he felt would be bad enough for when he said sixthirty he meant sixthirtybut of actual desertion it was time he said to himself that the foot of authority was set firmly down and the strong right hand of justice allowed to put in some energetic work his comments on the teams fielding that morning were bitter and sarcastic his eyes gleamed behind their pincenez  the painful interview took place after breakfast the head of the house despatched his fag in search of mike and waited he paced up and down the room like a hungry lion adjusting his pincenez a thing by the way which lions seldom do and behaving in other respects like a monarch of the desert one would have felt looking at him that mike in coming to his den was doing a deed which would make the achievement of daniel seem in comparison like the tentative effort of some timid novice  and certainly mike was not without qualms as he knocked at the door and went in in response to the hoarse roar from the other side of it  firbysmith straightened his tie and glared  young jackson he said look here i want to know what it all means and jolly quick you werent at housefielding this morning didnt you see the notice  mike admitted that he had seen the notice  then you frightful kid what do you mean by it what  mike hesitated awfully embarrassing this his real reason for not turning up to housefielding was that he considered himself above such things and firbysmith a toothy weed could he give this excuse he had not his book of etiquette by him at the moment but he rather fancied not there was no arguing against the fact that the head of the house was a toothy weed but he felt a firm conviction that it would not be politic to say so  happy thought overslept himself  he mentioned this  overslept yourself you must jolly well not oversleep yourself what do you mean by oversleeping yourself  very trying this sort of thing  what time did you wake up  six said mike  it was not according to his complicated yet intelligible code of morality to tell lies to save himself when others were concerned he could suppress the true and suggest the false with a face of brass  six  five past  why didnt you get up then  i went to sleep again  oh you went to sleep again did you well just listen to me ive had my eye on you for some time and ive seen it coming on youve got swelled head young man thats what youve got frightful swelled head you think the place belongs to you  i dont said mike indignantly  yes you do said the gazeka shrilly you think the whole frightful place belongs to you you go siding about as if youd bought it just because youve got your second you think you can do what you like turn up or not as you please it doesnt matter whether im only in the third and youre in the first thats got nothing to do with it the point is that youre one of the house team and im captain of it so youve jolly well got to turn out for fielding with the others when i think it necessary see  mike said nothing  doyousee you frightful kid  illustration doyousee you frightful kid  mike remained stonily silent the rather large grain of truth in what firbysmith had said had gone home as the unpleasant truth about ourselves is apt to do and his feelings were hurt he was determined not to give in and say that he saw even if the head of the house invoked all the majesty of the prefects room to help him as he had nearly done once before he set his teeth and stared at a photograph on the wall  firbysmiths manner became ominously calm he produced a swaggerstick from a corner  do you see he asked again  mikes jaw set more tightly  what one really wants here is a row of stars                                       mike was still full of his injuries when wyatt came back wyatt was worn out but cheerful the school had finished sixth for the ashburton which was an improvement of eight places on their last years form and he himself had scored thirty at the two hundred and twentyseven at the five hundred totals which had put him in a very good humour with the world  me ancient skill has not deserted me he said thats the cats the man who can wing a cat by moonlight can put a bullet where he likes on a target i didnt hit the bull every time but that was to give the other fellows a chance my fatal modesty has always been a hindrance to me in life and i suppose it always will be well well and what of the old homestead anything happened since i went away me old father is he well has the lost will been discovered or is there a mortgage on the family estates by jove i could do with a stoup of malvoisie i wonder if the mokes gone to bed yet ill go down and look a jug of water drawn from the well in the old courtyard where my ancestors have played as children for centuries back would just about save my life  he left the dormitory and mike began to brood over his wrongs once more  wyatt came back brandishing a jug of water and a glass  oh for a beaker full of the warm south full of the true the blushful hippocrene have you ever tasted hippocrene young jackson rather like gingerbeer with a dash of raspberryvinegar very heady failing that water will do aah  he put down the glass and surveyed mike who had maintained a moody silence throughout this speech  whats your trouble he asked for pains in the back try jujar if its a broken heart zambuks what you want whos been quarrelling with you  its only that ass firbysmith  again i never saw such chaps as you two always at it what was the trouble this time call him a grinning ape again your passion for the truthll be getting you into trouble one of these days  he said i stuck on side  why  i dont know  i mean did he buttonhole you on your way to school and say jackson a word in your ear you stick on side or did he lead up to it in any way did he say talking of side you stick it on what had you been doing to him  it was the housefielding  but you cant stick on side at housefielding i defy any one to its too early in the morning  i didnt turn up  what why  oh i dont know  no but look here really did you simply bunk it  yes  wyatt leaned on the end of mikes bed and having observed its occupant thoughtfully for a moment proceeded to speak wisdom for the good of his soul  i say i dont want to jawim one of those quiet chaps with strong silent natures you may have noticed itbut i must put in a wellchosen word at this juncture dont pretend to be dropping off to sleep sit up and listen to what your kind old uncles got to say to you about manners and deportment otherwise blood as you are at cricket youll have a rotten time here there are some things you simply cant do and one of them is bunking a thing when youre put down for it it doesnt matter who it is puts you down if hes captain youve got to obey him thats discipline that ere is the speaker then paused and took a sip of water from the carafe which stood at his elbow cheers from the audience and a voice hear hear  mike rolled over in bed and glared up at the orator most of his face was covered by the waterjug but his eyes stared fixedly from above it he winked in a friendly way and putting down the jug drew a deep breath  nothing like this old 87 water he said such body  i like you jawing about discipline said mike morosely  and why my gentle cheild should i not talk about discipline  considering you break out of the house nearly every night  in passing rather rum when you think that a burglar would get it hot for breaking in while i get dropped on if i break out why should there be one law for the burglar and one for me but you were sayingjust so i thank you about my breaking out when youre a whitehaired old man like me young jackson youll see that there are two sorts of discipline at school one you can break if you feel like taking the risks the other you mustnt ever break i dont know why but it isnt done until you learn that you can never hope to become the perfect wrykynian like he concluded modestly me  mike made no reply he would have perished rather than admit it but wyatts words had sunk in that moment marked a distinct epoch in his career his feelings were curiously mixed he was still furious with firbysmith yet at the same time he could not help acknowledging to himself that the latter had had the right on his side he saw and approved of wyatts point of view which was the more impressive to him from his knowledge of his friends contempt for or rather cheerful disregard of most forms of law and order if wyatt reckless though he was as regarded written school rules held so rigid a respect for those that were unwritten these last must be things which could not be treated lightly that night for the first time in his life mike went to sleep with a clear idea of what the public school spirit of which so much is talked and written really meant     chapter xx  the team is filled up   when burgess at the end of the conversation in the pavilion with mr spence which bob jackson had overheard accompanied the cricketmaster across the field to the boardinghouses he had distinctly made up his mind to give mike his first eleven colours next day there was only one more match to be played before the school fixturelist was finished that was the match with ripton both at cricket and football ripton was the school that mattered most wrykyn did not always win its other school matches but it generally did the public schools of england divide themselves naturally into little groups as far as games are concerned harrow eton and winchester are one group westminster and charterhouse another bedford tonbridge dulwich haileybury and st pauls are a third in this way wrykyn ripton geddington and wilborough formed a group there was no actual championship competition but each played each and by the end of the season it was easy to see which was entitled to first place this nearly always lay between ripton and wrykyn sometimes an exceptional geddington team would sweep the board or wrykyn having beaten ripton would go down before wilborough but this did not happen often usually wilborough and geddington were left to scramble for the wooden spoon  secretaries of cricket at ripton and wrykyn always liked to arrange the date of the match towards the end of the term so that they might take the field with representative and not experimental teams by july the weedingout process had generally finished besides which the members of the teams had had time to get into form  at wrykyn it was the custom to fill up the team if possible before the ripton match a player is likely to show better form if he has got his colours than if his fate depends on what he does in that particular match  burgess accordingly had resolved to fill up the first eleven just a week before ripton visited wrykyn there were two vacancies one gave him no trouble nevillesmith was not a great bowler but he was steady and he had done well in the earlier matches he had fairly earned his place but the choice between bob and mike had kept him awake into the small hours two nights in succession finally he had consulted mr spence and mr spence had voted for mike  burgess was glad the thing was settled the temptation to allow sentiment to interfere with business might have become too strong if he had waited much longer he knew that it would be a wrench definitely excluding bob from the team and he hated to have to do it the more he thought of it the sorrier he was for him if he could have pleased himself he would have kept bob in but as the poet has it pleasure is pleasure and biz is biz and kep in a sepyrit jug the first duty of a captain is to have no friends  from small causes great events do spring if burgess had not picked up a particularly interesting novel after breakfast on the morning of mikes interview with firbysmith in the study the list would have gone up on the noticeboard after prayers as it was engrossed in his book he let the moments go by till the sound on the bell startled him into movement and then there was only time to gather up his cap and sprint the paper on which he had intended to write the list and the pen he had laid out to write it with lay untouched on the table  and as it was not his habit to put up notices except during the morning he postponed the thing he could write it after tea after all there was a week before the match                                       when school was over he went across to the infirmary to inquire about marsh the report was more than favourable marsh had better not see any one just yet in case of accident but he was certain to be out in time to play against ripton  doctor oakes thinks he will be back in school on tuesday  banzai said burgess feeling that life was good to take the field against ripton without marsh would have been to court disaster marshs fielding alone was worth the money with him at short slip burgess felt safe when he bowled  the uncomfortable burden of the knowledge that he was about temporarily to sour bob jacksons life ceased for the moment to trouble him he crooned extracts from musical comedy as he walked towards the nets  recollection of bobs hard case was brought to him by the sight of that abouttobesoured sportsman tearing across the ground in the middle distance in an effort to get to a high catch which trevor had hit up to him it was a difficult catch and burgess waited to see if he would bring it off  bob got to it with one hand and held it his impetus carried him on almost to where burgess was standing  well held said burgess  hullo said bob awkwardly a gruesome thought had flashed across his mind that the captain might think that this gallerywork was an organised advertisement  i couldnt get both hands to it he explained  youre hot stuff in the deep  easy when youre only practising  ive just been to the infirmary  oh hows marsh  they wouldnt let me see him but its all right hell be able to play on saturday  good said bob hoping he had said it as if he meant it it was decidedly a blow he was glad for the sake of the school of course but one has ones personal ambitions to the fact that mike and not himself was the eleventh cap he had become partially resigned but he had wanted rather badly to play against ripton  burgess passed on his mind full of bob once more what hard luck it was there was he dashing about in the sun to improve his fielding and all the time the team was filled up he felt as if he were playing some low trick on a pal  then the jekyll and hyde business completed itself he suppressed his personal feelings and became the cricket captain again  it was the cricket captain who towards the end of the evening came upon firbysmith and mike parting at the conclusion of a conversation that it had not been a friendly conversation would have been evident to the most casual observer from the manner in which mike stumped off swinging his cricketbag as if it were a weapon of offence there are many kinds of walk mikes was the walk of the overwrought soul  whats up inquired burgess  young jackson do you mean oh nothing i was only telling him that there was going to be housefielding tomorrow before breakfast  didnt he like the idea  hes jolly well got to like it said the gazeka as who should say this way for iron wills the frightful kid cut it this morning therell be worse trouble if he does it again  there was it may be mentioned not an ounce of malice in the head of wains house that by telling the captain of cricket that mike had shirked fieldingpractice he might injure the latters prospects of a first eleven cap simply did not occur to him that burgess would feel on being told of mikes slackness much as a bishop might feel if he heard that a favourite curate had become a mahometan or a mumbojumboist did not enter his mind all he considered was that the story of his dealings with mike showed him firbysmith in the favourable and dashing character of the fellowwhowillstandnononsense a sort of captain kettle on dry land in fact and so he proceeded to tell it in detail  burgess parted with him with the firm conviction that mike was a young slacker keenness in fielding was a fetish with him and to cut practice struck him as a crime  he felt that he had been deceived in mike                                       when therefore one takes into consideration his private bias in favour of bob and adds to it the reaction caused by this sudden unmasking of mike it is not surprising that the list burgess made out that night before he went to bed differed in an important respect from the one he had intended to write before school  mike happened to be near the noticeboard when he pinned it up it was only the pleasure of seeing his name down in blackandwhite that made him trouble to look at the list bobs news of the day before yesterday had made it clear how that list would run  the crowd that collected the moment burgess had walked off carried him right up to the board  he looked at the paper  hard luck said somebody  mike scarcely heard him  he felt physically sick with the shock of the disappointment for the initial before the name jackson was r  there was no possibility of mistake since writing was invented there had never been an r that looked less like an m than the one on that list  bob had beaten him on the tape     chapter xxi  marjory the frank   at the door of the senior block burgess going out met bob coming in hurrying as he was rather late  congratulate you bob he said and passed on  bob stared after him as he stared trevor came out of the block  congratulate you bob  whats the matter now  havent you seen  seen what  why the list youve got your first  mywhat youre rotting  no im not go and look  the thing seemed incredible had he dreamed that conversation between spence and burgess on the pavilion steps had he mixed up the names he was certain that he had heard spence give his verdict for mike and burgess agree with him  just then mike feeling very ill came down the steps he caught sight of bob and was passing with a feeble grin when something told him that this was one of those occasions on which one has to show a red indian fortitude and stifle ones private feelings  congratulate you bob he said awkwardly  thanks awfully said bob with equal awkwardness trevor moved on delicately this was no place for him bobs face was looking like a stuffed frogs which was bobs way of trying to appear unconcerned and at his ease while mike seemed as if at any moment he might burst into tears spectators are not wanted at these awkward interviews  there was a short silence  jolly glad youve got it said mike  i believe theres a mistake i swear i heard burgess say to spence  he changed his mind probably no reason why he shouldnt  well its jolly rummy  bob endeavoured to find consolation  anyhow youll have three years in the first youre a cert for next year  hope so said mike with such manifest lack of enthusiasm that bob abandoned this line of argument when one has missed ones colours next year seems a very very long way off  they moved slowly through the cloisters neither speaking and up the stairs that led to the great hall each was gratefully conscious of the fact that prayers would be beginning in another minute putting an end to an uncomfortable situation  heard from home lately inquired mike  bob snatched gladly at the subject  got a letter from mother this morning i showed you the last one didnt i ive only just had time to skim through this one as the post was late and i only got it just as i was going to dash across to school not much in it here it is if you want to read it  thanks itll be something to do during math  marjory wrote too for the first time in her life havent had time to look at it yet  after you sure it isnt meant for me she owes me a letter  no its for me all right ill give it you in the interval  the arrival of the headmaster put an end to the conversation                                       by a quarter to eleven mike had begun to grow reconciled to his fate the disappointment was still there but it was lessened these things are like kicks on the shin a brief spell of agony and then a dull pain of which we are not always conscious unless our attention is directed to it and which in time disappears altogether when the bell rang for the interval that morning mike was as it were sitting up and taking nourishment  he was doing this in a literal as well as in a figurative sense when bob entered the school shop  bob appeared curiously agitated he looked round and seeing mike pushed his way towards him through the crowd most of those present congratulated him as he passed and mike noticed with some surprise that in place of the blushful grin which custom demands from the man who is being congratulated on receipt of colours there appeared on his face a worried even an irritated look he seemed to have something on his mind  hullo said mike amiably got that letter  yes ill show it you outside  why not here  come on  mike resented the tone but followed evidently something had happened to upset bob seriously as they went out on the gravel somebody congratulated bob again and again bob hardly seemed to appreciate it  bob led the way across the gravel and on to the first terrace when they had left the crowd behind he stopped  whats up asked mike  i want you to read  jackson  they both turned the headmaster was standing on the edge of the gravel  bob pushed the letter into mikes hands  read that he said and went up to the headmaster mike heard the words english essay and seeing that the conversation was apparently going to be one of some length capped the headmaster and walked off he was just going to read the letter when the bell rang he put the missive in his pocket and went to his formroom wondering what marjory could have found to say to bob to touch him on the raw to such an extent she was a breezy correspondent with a style of her own but usually she entertained rather than upset people no suspicion of the actual contents of the letter crossed his mind  he read it during school under the desk and ceased to wonder bob had had cause to look worried for the thousand and first time in her career of crime marjory had been and done it with a strong hand she had shaken the cat out of the bag and exhibited it plainly to all whom it might concern  there was a curious absence of construction about the letter most authors of sensational matter nurse their bombshell lead up to it and display it to the best advantage marjory dropped hers into the body of the letter and let it take its chance with the other newsitems     dear bob the letter ran     i hope you are quite well i am quite well phyllis has a cold    ella cheeked mademoiselle yesterday and had to write out little    girls must be polite and obedient a hundred times in french she    was jolly sick about it i told her it served her right joe made    eightythree against lancashire reggie made a duck have you got    your first if you have it will be all through mike uncle john    told father that mike pretended to hurt his wrist so that you could    play instead of him for the school and father said it was very    sporting of mike but nobody must tell you because it wouldnt be    fair if you got your first for you to know that you owed it to mike    and i wasnt supposed to hear but i did because i was in the room    only they didnt know i was we were playing hideandseek and i was    hiding so im writing to tell you     from your affectionate sister                         marjory  there followed a ps     ill tell you what you ought to do ive been reading a jolly good    book called the boys of dormitory two and the heros an awfully    nice boy named lionel tremayne and his friend jack langdale saves    his life when a beast of a boatman whos really employed by lionels    cousin who wants the money that lionels going to have when he grows    up stuns him and leaves him on the beach to drown well lionel is    going to play for the school against loamshire and its the    match of the season but he goes to the headmaster and says he wants    jack to play instead of him why dont you do that     m     ppsthis has been a frightful fag to write  for the life of him mike could not help giggling as he pictured what bobs expression must have been when his brother read this document but the humorous side of the thing did not appeal to him for long what should he say to bob what would bob say to him dash it all it made him look such an awful ass anyhow bob couldnt do much in fact he didnt see that he could do anything the team was filled up and burgess was not likely to alter it besides why should he alter it probably he would have given bob his colours anyhow still it was beastly awkward marjory meant well but she had put her foot right in it girls oughtnt to meddle with these things no girl ought to be taught to write till she came of age and uncle john had behaved in many respects like the complete rotter if he was going to let out things like that he might at least have whispered them or looked behind the curtains to see that the place wasnt chockfull of female kids confound uncle john  throughout the dinnerhour mike kept out of bobs way but in a small community like a school it is impossible to avoid a man for ever they met at the nets  well said bob  how do you mean said mike  did you read it  yes  well is it all rot or did youyou know what i meansham a crocked wrist  yes said mike i did  bob stared gloomily at his toes  i mean he said at last apparently putting the finishingtouch to some train of thought i know i ought to be grateful and all that i suppose i am i mean it was jolly good of youdash it all he broke off hotly as if the putting his position into words had suddenly showed him how inglorious it was what did you want to do if for what was the idea what right have you got to go about playing providence over me dash it all its like giving a fellow money without consulting him  i didnt think youd ever know you wouldnt have if only that ass uncle john hadnt let it out  how did he get to know why did you tell him  he got it out of me i couldnt choke him off he came down when you were away at geddington and would insist on having a look at my arm and naturally he spotted right away there was nothing the matter with it so it came out thats how it was  bob scratched thoughtfully at the turf with a spike of his boot  of course it was awfully decent  then again the monstrous nature of the affair came home to him  but what did you do it for why should you rot up your own chances to give me a look in  oh i dont know you know you did me a jolly good turn  i dont remember when  that firbysmith business  what about it  well you got me out of a jolly bad hole  oh rot and do you mean to tell me it was simply because of that  mike appeared to him in a totally new light he stared at him as if he were some strange creature hitherto unknown to the human race mike shuffled uneasily beneath the scrutiny  anyhow its all over now mike said so i dont see whats the point of talking about it  im hanged if it is you dont think im going to sit tight and take my first as if nothing had happened  what can you do the lists up are you going to the old man to ask him if i can play like lionel tremayne  the hopelessness of the situation came over bob like a wave he looked helplessly at mike  besides added mike i shall get in next year all right half a second i just want to speak to wyatt about something  he sidled off  well anyhow said bob to himself i must see burgess about it     chapter xxii  wyatt is reminded of an engagement   there are situations in life which are beyond one the sensible man realises this and slides out of such situations admitting himself beaten others try to grapple with them but it never does any good when affairs get into a real tangle it is best to sit still and let them straighten themselves out or if one does not do that simply to think no more about them this is philosophy the true philosopher is the man who says all right and goes to sleep in his armchair ones attitude towards lifes little difficulties should be that of the gentleman in the fable who sat down on an acorn one day and happened to doze the warmth of his body caused the acorn to germinate and it grew so rapidly that when he awoke he found himself sitting in the fork of an oak sixty feet from the ground he thought he would go home but finding this impossible he altered his plans well well he said if i cannot compel circumstances to my will i can at least adapt my will to circumstances i decide to remain here which he did and had a not unpleasant time the oak lacked some of the comforts of home but the air was splendid and the view excellent  todays great thought for young readers imitate this man  bob should have done so but he had not the necessary amount of philosophy he still clung to the idea that he and burgess in council might find some way of making things right for everybody though at the moment he did not see how eleven caps were to be divided amongst twelve candidates in such a way that each should have one  and burgess consulted on the point confessed to the same inability to solve the problem it took bob at least a quarter of an hour to get the facts of the case into the captains head but at last burgess grasped the idea of the thing at which period he remarked that it was a rum business  very rum bob agreed still what you say doesnt help us out much seeing that the point is whats to be done  why do anything  burgess was a philosopher and took the line of least resistance like the man in the oaktree  but i must do something said bob cant you see how rotten it is for me  i dont see why its not your fault very sporting of your brother and all that of course though im blowed if id have done it myself but why should you do anything youre all right your brother stood out of the team to let you in it and here you are in it whats he got to grumble about  hes not grumbling its me  whats the matter with you dont you want your first  not like this cant you see what a rotten position it is for me  dont you worry you simply keep on saying youre all right besides what do you want me to do alter the list  but for the thought of those unspeakable outsiders lionel tremayne and his headmaster bob might have answered this question in the affirmative but he had the publicschool boys terror of seeming to pose or do anything theatrical he would have done a good deal to put matters right but he could not do the selfsacrificing young hero business it would not be in the picture these things if they are to be done at school have to be carried through stealthily after mikes fashion  i suppose you cant very well now its up tell you what though i dont see why i shouldnt stand out of the team for the ripton match i could easily fake up some excuse  i do i dont know if its occurred to you but the idea is rather to win the ripton match if possible so that im a lot keen on putting the best team into the field sorry if it upsets your arrangements in any way  you know perfectly well mikes every bit as good as me  he isnt so keen  what do you mean  fielding hes a young slacker  when burgess had once labelled a man as that he did not readily let the idea out of his mind  slacker what rot hes as keen as anything  anyhow his keenness isnt enough to make him turn out for housefielding if you really want to know thats why youve got your first instead of him you sweated away and improved your fielding twenty per cent and i happened to be talking to firbysmith and found that young mike had been shirking his so out he went a bad fields bad enough but a slack field wants skinning  smith oughtnt to have told you  well he did tell me so you see how it is there wont be any changes from the team ive put up on the board  oh all right said bob i was afraid you mightnt be able to do anything so long  mind the step said burgess                                       at about the time when this conversation was in progress wyatt crossing the cricketfield towards the school shop in search of something fizzy that might correct a burning thirst acquired at the nets espied on the horizon a suit of cricket flannels surmounted by a huge expansive grin as the distance between them lessened he discovered that inside the flannels was nevillesmiths body and behind the grin the rest of nevillesmiths face their visit to the nets not having coincided in point of time as the greek exercise books say wyatt had not seen his friend since the list of the team had been posted on the board so he proceeded to congratulate him on his colours  thanks said nevillesmith with a brilliant display of front teeth  feeling good  not the word for it i feel likei dont know what  ill tell you what you look like if thats any good to you that slight smile of yours will meet behind if you dont look out and then the top of your headll come off  i dont care ive got my first whatever happens little willies going to buy a nice new cap and a pretty striped jacket all for his own self i say thanks for reminding me not that you did but supposing you had at any rate i remember what it was i wanted to say to you you know what i was saying to you about the bust i meant to have at home in honour of my getting my first if i did which i havewell anyhow its tonight you can roll up cant you  delighted anything for a free feed in these hard times what time did you say it was  eleven make it a bit earlier if you like  no elevenll do me all right  how are you going to get out  stone walls do not a prison make nor iron bars a cage thats what the man said who wrote the libretto for the last set of latin verses we had to do i shall manage it  they ought to allow you a latchkey  yes ive often thought of asking my pater for one still i get on very well who are coming besides me  no boarders they all funked it  the race is degenerating  said it wasnt good enough  the school is going to the dogs who did you ask  clowes was one said he didnt want to miss his beautysleep and henfrey backed out because he thought the risk of being sacked wasnt good enough  thats an aspect of the thing that might occur to some people i dont blame himi might feel like that myself if id got another couple of years at school  but one or two dayboys are coming clephane is for one and beverley we shall have rather a rag im going to get the things now  when i get to your placei dont believe i know the way now i come to think of itwhat do i do ring the bell and send in my card or smash the nearest window and climb in  dont make too much row for goodness sake all the servantsll have gone to bed youll see the window of my room its just above the porch itll be the only one lighted up heave a pebble at it and ill come down  so will the glasswith a run i expect still ill try to do as little damage as possible after all i neednt throw a brick  you will turn up wont you  nothing shall stop me  good man  as wyatt was turning away a sudden compunction seized upon nevillesmith he called him back  i say you dont think its too risky do you i mean you always are breaking out at night arent you i dont want to get you into a row  oh thats all right said wyatt dont you worry about me i should have gone out anyhow tonight     chapter xxiii  a surprise for mr appleby   you may not know it said wyatt to mike in the dormitory that night but this is the maddest merriest day of all the glad new year  mike could not help thinking that for himself it was the very reverse but he did not state his view of the case  whats up he asked  nevillesmiths giving a meal at his place in honour of his getting his first i understand the preparations are on a scale of the utmost magnificence no expense has been spared gingerbeer will flow like water the oldest cask of lemonade has been broached and a sardine is roasting whole in the marketplace  are you going  if i can tear myself away from your delightful society the kickoff is fixed for eleven sharp i am to stand underneath his window and heave bricks till something happens i dont know if he keeps a dog if so i shall probably get bitten to the bone  when are you going to start  about five minutes after wain has been round the dormitories to see that alls well that ought to be somewhere about halfpast ten  dont go getting caught  i shall do my little best not to be rather tricky work though getting back ive got to climb two garden walls and i shall probably be so full of malvoisie that youll be able to hear it swishing about inside me no catch steeplechasing if youre like that theyve no thought for peoples convenience here now at bradford theyve got studies on the ground floor the windows looking out over the boundless prairie no climbing or steeplechasing needed at all all you have to do is to open the window and step out still we must make the best of things push us over a pinch of that toothpowder of yours ive used all mine  wyatt very seldom penetrated further than his own garden on the occasions when he roamed abroad at night for catshooting the wain spinneys were unsurpassed there was one particular dustbin where one might be certain of flushing a covey any night and the wall by the pottingshed was a feline clubhouse  but when he did wish to get out into the open country he had a special route which he always took he climbed down from the wall that ran beneath the dormitory window into the garden belonging to mr appleby the master who had the house next to mr wains crossing this he climbed another wall and dropped from it into a small lane which ended in the main road leading to wrykyn town  this was the route which he took tonight it was a glorious july night and the scent of the flowers came to him with a curious distinctness as he let himself down from the dormitory window at any other time he might have made a lengthy halt and enjoyed the scents and small summer noises but now he felt that it would be better not to delay there was a full moon and where he stood he could be seen distinctly from the windows of both houses they were all dark it is true but on these occasions it was best to take no risks  he dropped cautiously into applebys garden ran lightly across it and was in the lane within a minute  there he paused dusted his trousers which had suffered on the two walls and strolled meditatively in the direction of the town halfpast ten had just chimed from the school clock he was in plenty of time  what a night he said to himself sniffing as he walked                                     now it happened that he was not alone in admiring the beauty of that particular night at tenfifteen it had struck mr appleby looking out of his study into the moonlit school grounds that a pipe in the open would make an excellent break in his nights work he had acquired a slight headache as the result of correcting a batch of examination papers and he thought that an interval of an hour in the open air before approaching the halfdozen or so papers which still remained to be looked at might do him good the window of his study was open but the room had got hot and stuffy nothing like a little fresh air for putting him right  for a few moments he debated the rival claims of a stroll in the cricketfield and a seat in the garden then he decided on the latter the little gate in the railings opposite his house might not be open and it was a long way round to the main entrance so he took a deckchair which leaned against the wall and let himself out of the back door  he took up his position in the shadow of a firtree with his back to the house from here he could see the long garden he was fond of his garden and spent what few moments he could spare from work and games pottering about it he had his views as to what the ideal garden should be and he hoped in time to tinker his own three acres up to the desired standard at present there remained much to be done why not for instance take away those laurels at the end of the lawn and have a flowerbed there instead laurels lasted all the year round true whereas flowers died and left an empty brown bed in the winter but then laurels were nothing much to look at at any time and a garden always had a beastly appearance in winter whatever you did to it much better have flowers and get a decent show for ones money in summer at any rate  the problem of the bed at the end of the lawn occupied his complete attention for more than a quarter of an hour at the end of which period he discovered that his pipe had gone out  he was just feeling for his matches to relight it when wyatt dropped with a slight thud into his favourite herbaceous border  the surprise and the agony of feeling that large boots were trampling among his treasures kept him transfixed for just the length of time necessary for wyatt to cross the garden and climb the opposite wall as he dropped into the lane mr appleby recovered himself sufficiently to emit a sort of strangled croak but the sound was too slight to reach wyatt that reveller was walking down the wrykyn road before mr appleby had left his chair  it is an interesting point that it was the gardener rather than the schoolmaster in mr appleby that first awoke to action it was not the idea of a boy breaking out of his house at night that occurred to him first as particularly heinous it was the fact that the boy had broken out via his herbaceous border in four strides he was on the scene of the outrage examining on hands and knees with the aid of the moonlight the extent of the damage done  as far as he could see it was not serious by a happy accident wyatts boots had gone home to right and left of precious plants but not on them with a sigh of relief mr appleby smoothed over the cavities and rose to his feet  at this point it began to strike him that the episode affected him as a schoolmaster also  in that startled moment when wyatt had suddenly crossed his line of vision he had recognised him the moon had shone full on his face as he left the flowerbed there was no doubt in his mind as to the identity of the intruder  he paused wondering how he should act it was not an easy question there was nothing of the spy about mr appleby he went his way openly liked and respected by boys and masters he always played the game the difficulty here was to say exactly what the game was sentiment of course bade him forget the episode treat it as if it had never happened that was the simple way out of the difficulty there was nothing unsporting about mr appleby he knew that there were times when a master might without blame close his eyes or look the other way if he had met wyatt out of bounds in the daytime and it had been possible to convey the impression that he had not seen him he would have done so to be out of bounds is not a particularly deadly sin a master must check it if it occurs too frequently but he may use his discretion  breaking out at night however was a different thing altogether it was on another plane there are times when a master must waive sentiment and remember that he is in a position of trust and owes a duty directly to his headmaster and indirectly through the headmaster to the parents he receives a salary for doing this duty and if he feels that sentiment is too strong for him he should resign in favour of some one of tougher fibre  this was the conclusion to which mr appleby came over his relighted pipe he could not let the matter rest where it was  in ordinary circumstances it would have been his duty to report the affair to the headmaster but in the present case he thought that a slightly different course might be pursued he would lay the whole thing before mr wain and leave him to deal with it as he thought best it was one of the few cases where it was possible for an assistant master to fulfil his duty to a parent directly instead of through the agency of the headmaster                                       knocking out the ashes of his pipe against a tree he folded his deckchair and went into the house the examination papers were spread invitingly on the table but they would have to wait he turned down his lamp and walked round to wains  there was a light in one of the groundfloor windows he tapped on the window and the sound of a chair being pushed back told him that he had been heard the blind shot up and he had a view of a room littered with books and papers in the middle of which stood mr wain like a seabeast among rocks  mr wain recognised his visitor and opened the window mr appleby could not help feeling how like wain it was to work on a warm summers night in a hermetically sealed room there was always something queer and eccentric about wyatts stepfather  can i have a word with you wain he said  appleby is there anything the matter i was startled when you tapped exceedingly so  sorry said mr appleby wouldnt have disturbed you only its something important ill climb in through here shall i no need to unlock the door and greatly to mr wains surprise and rather to his disapproval mr appleby vaulted on to the windowsill and squeezed through into the room     chapter xxiv  caught   got some rather bad news for you im afraid began mr appleby ill smoke if you dont mind about wyatt  james  i was sitting in my garden a few minutes ago having a pipe before finishing the rest of my papers and wyatt dropped from the wall on to my herbaceous border  mr appleby said this with a tinge of bitterness the thing still rankled  james in your garden impossible why it is not a quarter of an hour since i left him in his dormitory  hes not there now  you astound me appleby i am astonished  so was i  how is such a thing possible his window is heavily barred  bars can be removed  you must have been mistaken  possibly said mr appleby a little nettled gaping astonishment is always apt to be irritating lets leave it at that then sorry to have disturbed you  no sit down appleby dear me this is most extraordinary exceedingly so you are certain it was james  perfectly its like daylight out of doors  mr wain drummed on the table with his fingers  what shall i do  mr appleby offered no suggestion  i ought to report it to the headmaster that is certainly the course i should pursue  i dont see why it isnt like an ordinary case youre the parent you can deal with the thing directly if you come to think of it a headmasters only a sort of middleman between boys and parents he plays substitute for the parent in his absence i dont see why you should drag in the master at all here  there is certainly something in what you say said mr wain on reflection  a good deal tackle the boy when he comes in and have it out with him remember that it must mean expulsion if you report him to the headmaster he would have no choice everybody who has ever broken out of his house here and been caught has been expelled i should strongly advise you to deal with the thing yourself  i will yes you are quite right appleby that is a very good idea of yours you are not going  must got a pile of examination papers to look over goodnight  goodnight  mr appleby made his way out of the window and through the gate into his own territory in a pensive frame of mind he was wondering what would happen he had taken the only possible course and if only wain kept his head and did not let the matter get through officially to the headmaster things might not be so bad for wyatt after all he hoped they would not he liked wyatt it would be a thousand pities he felt if he were to be expelled what would wain do what would he do in a similar case it was difficult to say probably talk violently for as long as he could keep it up and then consider the episode closed he doubted whether wain would have the common sense to do this altogether it was very painful and disturbing and he was taking a rather gloomy view of the assistant masters lot as he sat down to finish off the rest of his examination papers it was not all roses the life of an assistant master at a public school he had continually to be sinking his own individual sympathies in the claims of his duty mr appleby was the last man who would willingly have reported a boy for enjoying a midnight ramble but he was the last man to shirk the duty of reporting him merely because it was one decidedly not to his taste  mr wain sat on for some minutes after his companion had left pondering over the news he had heard even now he clung to the idea that appleby had made some extraordinary mistake gradually he began to convince himself of this he had seen wyatt actually in bed a quarter of an hour beforenot asleep it was true but apparently on the verge of dropping off and the bars across the window had looked so solid could appleby have been dreaming something of the kind might easily have happened he had been working hard and the night was warm  then it occurred to him that he could easily prove or disprove the truth of his colleagues statement by going to the dormitory and seeing if wyatt were there or not if he had gone out he would hardly have returned yet  he took a candle and walked quietly upstairs  arrived at his stepsons dormitory he turned the doorhandle softly and went in the light of the candle fell on both beds mike was there asleep he grunted and turned over with his face to the wall as the light shone on his eyes but the other bed was empty appleby had been right  if further proof had been needed one of the bars was missing from the window the moon shone in through the empty space  the housemaster sat down quietly on the vacant bed he blew the candle out and waited there in the semidarkness thinking for years he and wyatt had lived in a state of armed neutrality broken by various small encounters lately by silent but mutual agreement they had kept out of each others way as much as possible and it had become rare for the housemaster to have to find fault officially with his stepson but there had never been anything even remotely approaching friendship between them mr wain was not a man who inspired affection readily least of all in those many years younger than himself nor did he easily grow fond of others wyatt he had regarded from the moment when the threads of their lives became entangled as a complete nuisance  it was not therefore a sorrowful so much as an exasperated vigil that he kept in the dormitory there was nothing of the sorrowing father about his frame of mind he was the housemaster about to deal with a mutineer and nothing else  this breakingout he reflected wrathfully was the last straw wyatts presence had been a nervous inconvenience to him for years the time had come to put an end to it it was with a comfortable feeling of magnanimity that he resolved not to report the breach of discipline to the headmaster wyatt should not be expelled but he should leave and that immediately he would write to the bank before he went to bed asking them to receive his stepson at once and the letter should go by the first post next day the discipline of the bank would be salutary and steadying andthis was a particularly grateful reflectiona fortnight annually was the limit of the holiday allowed by the management to its junior employees  mr wain had arrived at this conclusion and was beginning to feel a little cramped when mike jackson suddenly sat up  hullo said mike  go to sleep jackson immediately snapped the housemaster  mike had often heard and read of peoples hearts leaping to their mouths but he had never before experienced that sensation of something hot and dry springing in the throat which is what really happens to us on receipt of a bad shock a sickening feeling that the game was up beyond all hope of salvation came to him he lay down again without a word  what a frightful thing to happen how on earth had this come about what in the world had brought wain to the dormitory at that hour poor old wyatt if it had upset him mike to see the housemaster in the room what would be the effect of such a sight on wyatt returning from the revels at nevillesmiths  and what could he do nothing there was literally no way out his mind went back to the night when he had saved wyatt by a brilliant coup the most brilliant of coups could effect nothing now absolutely and entirely the game was up                                       every minute that passed seemed like an hour to mike dead silence reigned in the dormitory broken every now and then by the creak of the other bed as the housemaster shifted his position twelve boomed across the field from the school clock mike could not help thinking what a perfect night it must be for him to be able to hear the strokes so plainly he strained his ears for any indication of wyatts approach but could hear nothing then a very faint scraping noise broke the stillness and presently the patch of moonlight on the floor was darkened  at that moment mr wain relit his candle  the unexpected glare took wyatt momentarily aback mike saw him start then he seemed to recover himself in a calm and leisurely manner he climbed into the room  james said mr wain his voice sounded ominously hollow  wyatt dusted his knees and rubbed his hands together hullo is that you father he said pleasantly     chapter xxv  marching orders   a silence followed to mike lying in bed holding his breath it seemed a long silence as a matter of fact it lasted for perhaps ten seconds then mr wain spoke  you have been out james  it is curious how in the more dramatic moments of life the inane remark is the first that comes to us  yes sir said wyatt  i am astonished exceedingly astonished  i got a bit of a start myself said wyatt  i shall talk to you in my study follow me there  yes sir  he left the room and wyatt suddenly began to chuckle  i say wyatt said mike completely thrown off his balance by the events of the night  wyatt continued to giggle helplessly he flung himself down on his bed rolling with laughter mike began to get alarmed  its all right said wyatt at last speaking with difficulty but i say how long had he been sitting there  it seemed hours about an hour i suppose really  its the funniest thing ive ever struck me sweating to get in quietly and all the time him camping out on my bed  but look here whatll happen  wyatt sat up  that reminds me suppose id better go down  whatll he do do you think  ah now what  but i say its awful whatll happen  thats for him to decide speaking at a venture i should say  you dont think  the boot the swift and sudden boot i shall be sorry to part with you but im afraid its a case of au revoir my little hyacinth we shall meet at philippi this is my moscow tomorrow i shall go out into the night with one long choking sob years hence a whitehaired bankclerk will tap at your door when youre a prosperous professional cricketer with your photograph in wisden thatll be me well i suppose id better go down wed better all get to bed some time tonight dont go to sleep  not likely  ill tell you all the latest news when i come back where are me slippers ha tis well lead on then minions i follow                                       in the study mr wain was fumbling restlessly with his papers when wyatt appeared  sit down james he said  wyatt sat down one of his slippers fell off with a clatter mr wain jumped nervously  only my slipper explained wyatt it slipped  mr wain took up a pen and began to tap the table  well james  wyatt said nothing  i should be glad to hear your explanation of this disgraceful matter  the fact is said wyatt  well  i havent one sir  what were you doing out of your dormitory out of the house at that hour  i went for a walk sir  and may i inquire are you in the habit of violating the strictest school rules by absenting yourself from the house during the night  yes sir  what  yes sir  this is an exceedingly serious matter  wyatt nodded agreement with this view  exceedingly  the pen rose and fell with the rapidity of the cylinder of a motorcar wyatt watching it became suddenly aware that the thing was hypnotising him in a minute or two he would be asleep  i wish you wouldnt do that father tap like that i mean its sending me to sleep  james  its like a woodpecker  studied impertinence  im very sorry only it was sending me off  mr wain suspended tapping operations and resumed the thread of his discourse  i am sorry exceedingly to see this attitude in you james it is not fitting it is in keeping with your behaviour throughout your conduct has been lax and reckless in the extreme it is possible that you imagine that the peculiar circumstances of our relationship secure you from the penalties to which the ordinary boy  no sir  i need hardly say continued mr wain ignoring the interruption that i shall treat you exactly as i should treat any other member of my house whom i had detected in the same misdemeanour  of course said wyatt approvingly  i must ask you not to interrupt me when i am speaking to you james i say that your punishment will be no whit less severe than would be that of any other boy you have repeatedly proved yourself lacking in ballast and a respect for discipline in smaller ways but this is a far more serious matter exceedingly so it is impossible for me to overlook it even were i disposed to do so you are aware of the penalty for such an action as yours  the sack said wyatt laconically  it is expulsion you must leave the school at once  wyatt nodded  as you know i have already secured a nomination for you in the london and oriental bank i shall write tomorrow to the manager asking him to receive you at once  after all they only gain an extra fortnight of me  you will leave directly i receive his letter i shall arrange with the headmaster that you are withdrawn privately  not the sack  withdrawn privately you will not go to school tomorrow do you understand that is all have you anything to say  wyatt reflected  no i dont think  his eye fell on a tray bearing a decanter and a syphon  oh yes he said cant i mix you a whisky and soda father before i go off to bed                                       well said mike  wyatt kicked off his slippers and began to undress  what happened  we chatted  has he let you off  like a gun i shoot off almost immediately tomorrow i take a wellearned rest away from school and the day after i become the gay young bankclerk all amongst the ink and ledgers  mike was miserably silent  buck up said wyatt cheerfully it would have happened anyhow in another fortnight so why worry  mike was still silent the reflection was doubtless philosophic but it failed to comfort him     chapter xxvi  the aftermath   bad news spreads quickly by the quarter to eleven interval next day the facts concerning wyatt and mr wain were public property mike as an actual spectator of the drama was in great request as an informant as he told the story to a group of sympathisers outside the school shop burgess came up his eyes rolling in a fine frenzy  anybody seen youngoh here you are whats all this about jimmy wyatt theyre saying hes been sacked or some rot  illustration whats all this about jimmy wyatt  so he hasat least hes got to leave  what when  hes left already he isnt coming to school again  burgesss first thought as befitted a good cricket captain was for his team  and the ripton match on saturday  nobody seemed to have anything except silent sympathy at his command  dash the man silly ass what did he want to do it for poor old jimmy though he added after a pause what rot for him  beastly agreed mike  all the same continued burgess with a return to the austere manner of the captain of cricket he might have chucked playing the goat till after the ripton match look here young jackson youll turn out for fielding with the first this afternoon youll play on saturday  all right said mike without enthusiasm the wyatt disaster was too recent for him to feel much pleasure at playing against ripton vice his friend withdrawn  bob was the next to interview him they met in the cloisters  hullo mike said bob i say whats all this about wyatt  wain caught him getting back into the dorm last night after nevillesmiths and hes taken him away from the school  whats he going to do going into that bank straight away  yes you know thats the part he bars most hed have been leaving anyhow in a fortnight you see only its awful rot for a chap like wyatt to have to go and froust in a bank for the rest of his life  hell find it rather a change i expect i suppose you wont be seeing him before he goes  i shouldnt think so not unless he comes to the dorm during the night hes sleeping over in wains part of the house but i shouldnt be surprised if he nipped out after wain has gone to bed hope he does anyway  i should like to say goodbye but i dont suppose itll be possible  they separated in the direction of their respective formrooms mike felt bitter and disappointed at the way the news had been received wyatt was his best friend his pal and it offended him that the school should take the tidings of his departure as they had done most of them who had come to him for information had expressed a sort of sympathy with the absent hero of his story but the chief sensation seemed to be one of pleasurable excitement at the fact that something big had happened to break the monotony of school routine they treated the thing much as they would have treated the announcement that a record score had been made in firstclass cricket the school was not so much regretful as comfortably thrilled and burgess had actually cursed before sympathising mike felt resentful towards burgess as a matter of fact the cricket captain wrote a letter to wyatt during preparation that night which would have satisfied even mikes sense of what was fit but mike had no opportunity of learning this  there was however one exception to the general rule one member of the school who did not treat the episode as if it were merely an interesting and impersonal item of sensational news nevillesmith heard of what had happened towards the end of the interval and rushed off instantly in search of mike he was too late to catch him before he went to his formroom so he waited for him at halfpast twelve when the bell rang for the end of morning school  i say jackson is this true about old wyatt  mike nodded  what happened  mike related the story for the sixteenth time it was a melancholy pleasure to have found a listener who heard the tale in the right spirit there was no doubt about nevillesmiths interest and sympathy he was silent for a moment after mike had finished  it was all my fault he said at length if it hadnt been for me this wouldnt have happened what a fool i was to ask him to my place i might have known he would be caught  oh i dont know said mike  it was absolutely my fault  mike was not equal to the task of soothing nevillesmiths wounded conscience he did not attempt it they walked on without further conversation till they reached wains gate where mike left him nevillesmith proceeded on his way plunged in meditation  the result of which meditation was that burgess got a second shock before the day was out bob going over to the nets rather late in the afternoon came upon the captain of cricket standing apart from his fellow men with an expression on his face that spoke of mental upheavals on a vast scale  whats up asked bob  nothing much said burgess with a forced and grisly calm only that as far as i can see we shall play ripton on saturday with a sort of second eleven you dont happen to have got sacked or anything by the way do you  whats happened now  nevillesmith in extra on saturday thats all only our first and secondchange bowlers out of the team for the ripton match in one day i suppose by tomorrow half the othersll have gone and we shall take the field on saturday with a scratch side of kids from the junior school  nevillesmith why whats he been doing  apparently he gave a sort of supper to celebrate his getting his first and it was while coming back from that that wyatt got collared well im blowed if nevillesmith doesnt toddle off to the old man after school today and tell him the whole yarn said it was all his fault what rot sort of thing that might have happened to any one if wyatt hadnt gone to him hed probably have gone out somewhere else  and the old man shoved him in extra  next two saturdays  are ripton strong this year asked bob for lack of anything better to say  very from all accounts they whacked the mcc jolly hot team of mcc too stronger than the one we drew with  oh well you never know whats going to happen at cricket i may hold a catch for a change  burgess grunted  bob went on his way to the nets mike was just putting on his pads  i say mike said bob i wanted to see you its about wyatt ive thought of something  whats that  a way of getting him out of that bank if it comes off thats to say  by jove hed jump at anything whats the idea  why shouldnt he get a job of sorts out in the argentine there ought to be heaps of sound jobs going there for a chap like wyatt hes a jolly good shot to start with i shouldnt wonder if it wasnt rather a score to be able to shoot out there and he can ride i know  by jove ill write to father tonight he must be able to work it i should think he never chucked the show altogether did he  mike as most other boys of his age would have been was profoundly ignorant as to the details by which his fathers money had been or was being made he only knew vaguely that the source of revenue had something to do with the argentine his brother joe had been born in buenos ayres and once three years ago his father had gone over there for a visit presumably on business all these things seemed to show that mr jackson senior was a useful man to have about if you wanted a job in that eldorado the argentine republic  as a matter of fact mikes father owned vast tracts of land up country where countless sheep lived and had their being he had long retired from active superintendence of his estate like mr spenlow he had a partner a stout fellow with the worktaint highly developed who asked nothing better than to be left in charge so mr jackson had returned to the home of his fathers glad to be there again but he still had a decided voice in the ordering of affairs on the ranches and mike was going to the fountainhead of things when he wrote to his father that night putting forward wyatts claims to attention and ability to perform any sort of job with which he might be presented  the reflection that he had done all that could be done tended to console him for the nonappearance of wyatt either that night or next morninga nonappearance which was due to the simple fact that he passed that night in a bed in mr wains dressingroom the door of which that cautious pedagogue who believed in taking no chances locked from the outside on retiring to rest     chapter xxvii  the ripton match   mike got an answer from his father on the morning of the ripton match a letter from wyatt also lay on his plate when he came down to breakfast  mr jacksons letter was short but to the point he said he would go and see wyatt early in the next week he added that being expelled from a public school was not the only qualification for success as a sheepfarmer but that if mikes friend added to this a general intelligence and amiability and a skill for picking off cats with an airpistol and bullseyes with a leeenfield there was no reason why something should not be done for him in any case he would buy him a lunch so that wyatt would extract at least some profit from his visit he said that he hoped something could be managed it was a pity that a boy accustomed to shoot cats should be condemned for the rest of his life to shoot nothing more exciting than his cuffs  wyatts letter was longer it might have been published under the title my first day in a bank by a beginner his advent had apparently caused little sensation he had first had a brief conversation with the manager which had run as follows  mr wyatt  yes sir  hm  sportsman  yes sir  cricketer  yes sir  play football  yes sir  hm  racquets  yes sir  everything  yes sir  hm  well you wont get any more of it now  after which a mr blenkinsop had led him up to a vast ledger in which he was to inscribe the addresses of all outgoing letters these letters he would then stamp and subsequently take in bundles to the post office once a week he would be required to buy stamps if i were one of those napoleons of finance wrote wyatt i should cook the accounts i suppose and embezzle stamps to an incredible amount but it doesnt seem in my line im afraid i wasnt cut out for a business career still i have stamped this letter at the expense of the office and entered it up under the heading sundries which is a sort of start look out for an article in the wrykynian hints for young criminals by j wyatt champion catchascatchcan stampstealer of the british isles so long i suppose you are playing against ripton now that the world of commerce has found that it cant get on without me mind you make a century and then perhaps burgessll give you your first after all there were twelve colours given three years ago because one chap left at halfterm and the man who played instead of him came off against ripton                                       this had occurred to mike independently the ripton match was a special event and the man who performed any outstanding feat against that school was treated as a sort of horatius honours were heaped upon him if he could only make a century or even fifty even twenty if it got the school out of a tight place he was as nervous on the saturday morning as he had been on the morning of the mcc match it was victory or westminster abbey now to do only averagely well to be among the ruck would be as useless as not playing at all as far as his chance of his first was concerned  it was evident to those who woke early on the saturday morning that this ripton match was not likely to end in a draw during the friday rain had fallen almost incessantly in a steady drizzle it had stopped late at night and at six in the morning there was every prospect of another hot day there was that feeling in the air which shows that the sun is trying to get through the clouds the sky was a dull grey at breakfast time except where a flush of deeper colour gave a hint of the sun it was a day on which to win the toss and go in first at eleventhirty when the match was timed to begin the wicket would be too wet to be difficult runs would come easily till the sun came out and began to dry the ground when that happened there would be trouble for the side that was batting  burgess inspecting the wicket with mr spence during the quarter to eleven interval was not slow to recognise this fact  i should win the toss today if i were you burgess said mr spence  just what i was thinking sir  that wickets going to get nasty after lunch if the sun comes out a regular rhodes wicket its going to be  i wish we had rhodes said burgess or even wyatt it would just suit him this  mr spence as a member of the staff was not going to be drawn into discussing wyatt and his premature departure so he diverted the conversation on to the subject of the general aspect of the schools attack  who will go on first with you burgess  who do you think sir ellerby it might be his wicket  ellerby bowled medium inclining to slow on a pitch that suited him he was apt to turn from leg and get people out caught at the wicket or short slip  certainly ellerby this end i think the others yours though im afraid youll have a poor time bowling fast today even with plenty of sawdust i doubt if it will be possible to get a decent foothold till after lunch  i must win the toss said burgess its a nuisance too about our batting marsh will probably be dead out of form after being in the infirmary so long if hed had a chance of getting a bit of practice yesterday it might have been all right  that rain will have a lot to answer for if we lose on a dry hard wicket im certain we should beat them four times out of six i was talking to a man who played against them for the nomads he said that on a true wicket there was not a great deal of sting in their bowling but that theyve got a slow legbreak man who might be dangerous on a day like this a boy called de freece i dont know of him he wasnt in the team last year  i know the chap he played wing three for them at footer against us this year on their ground he was crocked when they came here hes a pretty useful chap all round i believe plays racquets for them too  well my friend said he had one very dangerous ball of the bosanquet type looks as if it were going away and comes in instead  i dont think a lot of that said burgess ruefully one consolation is though that that sort of ball is easier to watch on a slow wicket i must tell the fellows to look out for it  i should and above all win the toss                                       burgess and maclaine the ripton captain were old acquaintances they had been at the same private school and they had played against one another at football and cricket for two years now  well go in first mac said burgess as they met on the pavilion steps after they had changed  its awfully good of you to suggest it said maclaine but i think well toss its a hobby of mine you call  heads  tails it is i ought to have warned you that you hadnt a chance ive lost the toss five times running so i was bound to win today  youll put us in i suppose  yesafter us  oh well we shant have long to wait for our knock thats a comfort buck up and send some one in and lets get at you  and burgess went off to tell the groundman to have plenty of sawdust ready as he would want the field paved with it                                       the policy of the ripton team was obvious from the first over they meant to force the game already the sun was beginning to peep through the haze for about an hour rungetting ought to be a tolerably simple process but after that hour singles would be as valuable as threes and boundaries an almost unheardof luxury  so ripton went in to hit  the policy proved successful for a time as it generally does burgess who relied on a run that was a series of tigerlike leaps culminating in a spring that suggested that he meant to lower the long jump record found himself badly handicapped by the state of the ground in spite of frequent libations of sawdust he was compelled to tread cautiously and this robbed his bowling of much of its pace the score mounted rapidly twenty came in ten minutes at thirtyfive the first wicket fell run out  at sixty ellerby who had found the pitch too soft for him and had been expensive gave place to grant grant bowled what were supposed to be slow legbreaks but which did not always break the change worked  maclaine after hitting the first two balls to the boundary skied the third to bob jackson in the deep and bob for whom constant practice had robbed this sort of catch of its terrors held it  a yorker from burgess disposed of the next man before he could settle down but the score seventyfour for three wickets was large enough in view of the fact that the pitch was already becoming more difficult and was certain to get worse to make ripton feel that the advantage was with them another hour of play remained before lunch the deterioration of the wicket would be slow during that period the sun which was now shining brightly would put in its deadliest work from two oclock onwards maclaines instructions to his men were to go on hitting  a too liberal interpretation of the meaning of the verb to hit led to the departure of two more riptonians in the course of the next two overs there is a certain type of school batsman who considers that to force the game means to swipe blindly at every ball on the chance of taking it halfvolley this policy sometimes leads to a boundary or two as it did on this occasion but it means that wickets will fall as also happened now seventyfour for three became eightysix for five burgess began to look happier  his contentment increased when he got the next man legbeforewicket with the total unaltered at this rate ripton would be out before lunch for under a hundred  but the rot stopped with the fall of that wicket dashing tactics were laid aside the pitch had begun to play tricks and the pair now in settled down to watch the ball they plodded on scoring slowly and jerkily till the hands of the clock stood at halfpast one then ellerby who had gone on again instead of grant beat the less steady of the pair with a ball that pitched on the middle stump and shot into the base of the off a hundred and twenty had gone up on the board at the beginning of the over  that period which is always so dangerous when the wicket is bad the ten minutes before lunch proved fatal to two more of the enemy the last man had just gone to the wickets with the score at a hundred and thirtyone when a quarter to two arrived and with it the luncheon interval  so far it was anybodys game     chapter xxviii  mike wins home   the ripton lastwicket man was de freece the slow bowler he was apparently a young gentleman wholly free from the curse of nervousness he wore a cheerful smile as he took guard before receiving the first ball after lunch and wrykyn had plenty of opportunity of seeing that that was his normal expression when at the wickets there is often a certain looseness about the attack after lunch and the bowler of googlies took advantage of it now he seemed to be a batsman with only one hit but he had also a very accurate eye and his one hit a semicircular stroke which suggested the golf links rather than the cricket field came off with distressing frequency he mowed burgesss first ball to the squareleg boundary missed his second and snicked the third for three over longslips head the other batsman played out the over and de freece proceeded to treat ellerbys bowling with equal familiarity the scoringboard showed an increase of twenty as the result of three overs every run was invaluable now and the ripton contingent made the pavilion reecho as a fluky shot over midons head sent up the hundred and fifty  there are few things more exasperating to the fielding side than a lastwicket stand it resembles in its effect the draggingout of a book or play after the dénouement has been reached at the fall of the ninth wicket the fieldsmen nearly always look on their outing as finished just a ball or two to the last man and it will be their turn to bat if the last man insists on keeping them out in the field they resent it  what made it especially irritating now was the knowledge that a straight yorker would solve the whole thing but when burgess bowled a yorker it was not straight and when he bowled a straight ball it was not a yorker a four and a three to de freece and a four bye sent up a hundred and sixty  it was beginning to look as if this might go on for ever when ellerby who had been missing the stumps by fractions of an inch for the last ten minutes did what burgess had failed to do he bowled a straight mediumpaced yorker and de freece swiping at it with a bright smile found his legstump knocked back he had made twentyeight his record score he explained to mike as they walked to the pavilion for this or any ground  the ripton total was a hundred and sixtysix                                       with the ground in its usual true hard condition wrykyn would have gone in against a score of a hundred and sixtysix with the cheery intention of knocking off the runs for the loss of two or three wickets it would have been a gentle canter for them  but ordinary standards would not apply here on a good wicket wrykyn that season were a two hundred and fifty to three hundred side on a bad wicketwell they had met the incogniti on a bad wicket and their totalwith wyatt playing and making top scorehad worked out at a hundred and seven  a grim determination to do their best rather than confidence that their best when done would be anything recordbreaking was the spirit which animated the team when they opened their innings  and in five minutes this had changed to a dull gloom  the tragedy started with the very first ball it hardly seemed that the innings had begun when morris was seen to leave the crease and make for the pavilion  its that googly man said burgess blankly  whats happened shouted a voice from the interior of the first eleven room  morris is out  good gracious how asked ellerby emerging from the room with one pad on his leg and the other in his hand  lbw first ball  my aunt whos in next not me  no berridge for goodness sake berry stick a bat in the way and not your legs watch that de freece man like a hawk he breaks like sin all over the shop hullo morris bad luck were you out do you think a batsman who has been given lbw is always asked this question on his return to the pavilion and he answers it in nine cases out of ten in the negative morris was the tenth case he thought it was all right he said  thought the thing was going to break but it didnt  hear that berry he doesnt always break you must look out for that said burgess helpfully morris sat down and began to take off his pads  that chapll have berry if he doesnt look out he said  but berridge survived the ordeal he turned his first ball to leg for a single  this brought marsh to the batting end and the second tragedy occurred  it was evident from the way he shaped that marsh was short of practice his visit to the infirmary had taken the edge off his batting he scratched awkwardly at three balls without hitting them the last of the over had him in two minds he started to play forward changed his stroke suddenly and tried to step back and the next moment the bails had shot up like the débris of a small explosion and the wicketkeeper was clapping his gloved hands gently and slowly in the introspective dreamy way wicketkeepers have on these occasions  a silence that could be felt brooded over the pavilion  the voice of the scorer addressing from his little wooden hut the melancholy youth who was working the telegraphboard broke it  one for two last man duck  ellerby echoed the remark he got up and took off his blazer  this is all right he said isnt it i wonder if the man at the other end is a sort of young rhodes too  fortunately he was not the star of the ripton attack was evidently de freece the bowler at the other end looked fairly plain he sent them down mediumpace and on a good wicket would probably have been simple but today there was danger in the most guilelesslooking deliveries  berridge relieved the tension a little by playing safely through the over and scoring a couple of twos off it and when ellerby not only survived the destructive de freeces second over but actually lifted a loose ball on to the roof of the scoringhut the cloud began perceptibly to lift a noball in the same over sent up the first ten ten for two was not good but it was considerably better than one for two  with the score at thirty ellerby was missed in the slips off de freece he had been playing with slowly increasing confidence till then but this seemed to throw him out of his stride he played inside the next ball and was all but bowled and then jumping out to drive he was smartly stumped the cloud began to settle again  bob was the next man in  ellerby took off his pads and dropped into the chair next to mikes mike was silent and thoughtful he was in after bob and to be on the eve of batting does not make one conversational  you in next asked ellerby  mike nodded  its getting trickier every minute said ellerby the only thing is if we can only stay in we might have a chance the wicketll get better and i dont believe theyve any bowling at all bar de freece by george bobs out no he isnt  bob had jumped out at one of de freeces slows as ellerby had done and had nearly met the same fate the wicketkeeper however had fumbled the ball  thats the way i was had said ellerby that mans keeping such a jolly good length that you dont know whether to stay in your ground or go out at them if only somebody would knock him off his length i believe we might win yet  the same idea apparently occurred to burgess he came to where mike was sitting  im going to shove you down one jackson he said i shall go in next myself and swipe and try and knock that man de freece off  all right said mike he was not quite sure whether he was glad or sorry at the respite  its a pity old wyatt isnt here said ellerby this is just the sort of time when he might have come off  bobs broken his egg said mike  good man every little helps oh you silly ass get back  berridge had called bob for a short run that was obviously no run third man was returning the ball as the batsmen crossed the next moment the wicketkeeper had the bails off berridge was out by a yard  fortyone for four said ellerby help  burgess began his campaign against de freece by skying his first ball over covers head to the boundary a howl of delight went up from the school which was repeated fortissimo when more by accident than by accurate timing the captain put on two more fours past extracover the bowlers cheerful smile never varied  whether burgess would have knocked de freece off his length or not was a question that was destined to remain unsolved for in the middle of the other bowlers over bob hit a single the batsmen crossed and burgess had his legstump uprooted while trying a gigantic pullstroke  the melancholy youth put up the figures 54 5 12 on the board  mike as he walked out of the pavilion to join bob was not conscious of any particular nervousness it had been an ordeal having to wait and look on while wickets fell but now that the time of inaction was at an end he felt curiously composed when he had gone out to bat against the mcc on the occasion of his first appearance for the school he experienced a quaint sensation of unreality he seemed to be watching his body walking to the wickets as if it were some one elses there was no sense of individuality  but now his feelings were different he was cool he noticed small thingsmidoff chewing bits of grass the bowler retying the scarf round his waist little patches of brown where the turf had been worn away he took guard with a clear picture of the positions of the fieldsmen photographed on his brain  fitness which in a batsman exhibits itself mainly in an increased power of seeing the ball is one of the most inexplicable things connected with cricket it has nothing or very little to do with actual health a man may come out of a sickroom with just that extra quickness in sighting the ball that makes all the difference or he may be in perfect training and play inside straight halfvolleys mike would not have said that he felt more than ordinarily well that day indeed he was rather painfully conscious of having bolted his food at lunch but something seemed to whisper to him as he settled himself to face the bowler that he was at the top of his batting form a difficult wicket always brought out his latent powers as a bat it was a standing mystery with the sporting press how joe jackson managed to collect fifties and sixties on wickets that completely upset men who were apparently finer players on days when the olympians of the cricket world were bringing their averages down with ducks and singles joe would be in his element watching the ball and pushing it through the slips as if there were no such thing as a tricky wicket and mike took after joe  a single off the fifth ball of the over opened his score and brought him to the opposite end bob played ball number six back to the bowler and mike took guard preparatory to facing de freece  the ripton slow bowler took a long run considering his pace in the early part of an innings he often trapped the batsmen in this way by leading them to expect a faster ball than he actually sent down a queer little jump in the middle of the run increased the difficulty of watching him  the smiting he had received from burgess in the previous over had not had the effect of knocking de freece off his length the ball was too short to reach with comfort and not short enough to take liberties with it pitched slightly to leg and whipped in quickly mike had faced halfleft and stepped back the increased speed of the ball after it had touched the ground beat him the ball hit his right pad  s that shouted midon midon has a habit of appealing for lbw in school matches  de freece said nothing the ripton bowler was as conscientious in the matter of appeals as a good bowler should be he had seen that the ball had pitched off the legstump  the umpire shook his head midon tried to look as if he had not spoken  mike prepared himself for the next ball with a glow of confidence he felt that he knew where he was now till then he had not thought the wicket was so fast the two balls he had played at the other end had told him nothing they had been well pitched up and he had smothered them he knew what to do now he had played on wickets of this pace at home against saunderss bowling and saunders had shown him the right way to cope with them  the next ball was of the same length but this time off the offstump mike jumped out and hit it before it had time to break it flew along the ground through the gap between cover and extracover a comfortable three  bob played out the over with elaborate care  off the second ball of the other mans over mike scored his first boundary it was a longhop on the off he banged it behind point to the terracebank the last ball of the over a halfvolley to leg he lifted over the other boundary  sixty up said ellerby in the pavilion as the umpire signalled another noball by george i believe these chaps are going to knock off the runs young jackson looks as if he was in for a century  you ass said berridge dont say that or hes certain to get out  berridge was one of those who are skilled in cricket superstitions  but mike did not get out he took seven off de freeces next over by means of two cuts and a drive and with bob still exhibiting a stolid and rocklike defence the score mounted to eighty thence to ninety and so mainly by singles to a hundred  at a hundred and four when the wicket had put on exactly fifty bob fell to a combination of de freece and extracover he had stuck like a limpet for an hour and a quarter and made twentyone  mike watched him go with much the same feelings as those of a man who turns away from the platform after seeing a friend off on a long railway journey his departure upset the scheme of things for himself he had no fear now he might possibly get out off his next ball but he felt set enough to stay at the wickets till nightfall he had had narrow escapes from de freece but he was full of that conviction which comes to all batsmen on occasion that this was his day he had made twentysix and the wicket was getting easier he could feel the sting going out of the bowling every over  henfrey the next man in was a promising rather than an effective bat he had an excellent style but he was uncertain two years later when he captained the wrykyn teams he made a lot of runs but this season his batting had been spasmodic  today he never looked like settling down he survived an over from de freece and hit a fast change bowler who had been put on at the other end for a couple of fluky fours then mike got the bowling for three consecutive overs and raised the score to a hundred and twentysix a bye brought henfrey to the batting end again and de freeces pet googly which had not been much in evidence hitherto led to his snicking an easy catch into shortslips hands  a hundred and twentyseven for seven against a total of a hundred and sixtysix gives the impression that the batting side has the advantage in the present case however it was ripton who were really in the better position apparently wrykyn had three more wickets to fall practically they had only one for neither ashe nor grant nor devenish had any pretensions to be considered batsmen ashe was the school wicketkeeper grant and devenish were bowlers between them the three could not be relied on for a dozen in a decent match  mike watched ashe shape with a sinking heart the wicketkeeper looked like a man who feels that his hour has come mike could see him licking his lips there was nervousness written all over him  he was not kept long in suspense de freeces first ball made a hideous wreck of his wicket  over said the umpire  mike felt that the schools one chance now lay in his keeping the bowling but how was he to do this it suddenly occurred to him that it was a delicate position that he was in it was not often that he was troubled by an inconvenient modesty but this happened now grant was a fellow he hardly knew and a school prefect to boot could he go up to him and explain that he jackson did not consider him competent to bat in this crisis would not this get about and be accounted to him for side he had made forty but even so  fortunately grant solved the problem on his own account he came up to mike and spoke with an earnestness born of nerves for goodness sake he whispered collar the bowling all you know or were done i shall get outed first ball  all right said mike and set his teeth forty to win a large order but it was going to be done his whole existence seemed to concentrate itself on those forty runs  the fast bowler who was the last of several changes that had been tried at the other end was wellmeaning but erratic the wicket was almost true again now and it was possible to take liberties  mike took them  a distant clapping from the pavilion taken up a moment later all round the ground and echoed by the ripton fieldsmen announced that he had reached his fifty  the last ball of the over he mishit it rolled in the direction of third man  come on shouted grant  mike and the ball arrived at the opposite wicket almost simultaneously another fraction of a second and he would have been run out  illustration mike and the ball arrived almost simultaneously  the last balls of the next two overs provided repetitions of this performance but each time luck was with him and his bat was across the crease before the bails were off the telegraphboard showed a hundred and fifty  the next over was doubly sensational the original mediumpaced bowler had gone on again in place of the fast man and for the first five balls he could not find his length during those five balls mike raised the score to a hundred and sixty  but the sixth was of a different kind faster than the rest and of a perfect length it all but got through mikes defence as it was he stopped it but he did not score the umpire called over and there was grant at the batting end with de freece smiling pleasantly as he walked back to begin his run with the comfortable reflection that at last he had got somebody except mike to bowl at  that over was an experience mike never forgot  grant pursued the fabian policy of keeping his bat almost immovable and trusting to luck point and the slips crowded round midoff and midon moved halfway down the pitch grant looked embarrassed but determined for four balls he baffled the attack though once nearly caught by point a yard from the wicket the fifth curled round his bat and touched the offstump a bail fell silently to the ground  devenish came in to take the last ball of the over  it was an aweinspiring moment a great stillness was over all the ground mikes knees trembled devenishs face was a delicate grey  the only person unmoved seemed to be de freece his smile was even more amiable than usual as he began his run  the next moment the crisis was past the ball hit the very centre of devenishs bat and rolled back down the pitch  the school broke into one great howl of joy there were still seven runs between them and victory but nobody appeared to recognise this fact as important mike had got the bowling and the bowling was not de freeces  it seemed almost an anticlimax when a four to leg and two twos through the slips settled the thing                                       devenish was caught and bowled in de freeces next over but the wrykyn total was one hundred and seventytwo                                       good game said maclaine meeting burgess in the pavilion who was the man who made all the runs how many by the way  eightythree it was young jackson brother of the other one  that family how many more of them are you going to have here  hes the last i say rough luck on de freece he bowled rippingly  politeness to a beaten foe caused burgess to change his usual not bad  the funny part of it is continued he that young jackson was only playing as a sub  youve got a rum idea of whats funny said maclaine     chapter xxix  wyatt again   it was a morning in the middle of september the jacksons were breakfasting mr jackson was reading letters the rest including gladys maud whose finely chiselled features were gradually disappearing behind a mask of breadandmilk had settled down to serious work the usual catchascatchcan contest between marjory and phyllis for the jam referee and timekeeper mrs jackson had resulted after both combatants had been cautioned by the referee in a victory for marjory who had duly secured the stakes the hour being ninefifteen and the official time for breakfast nine oclock mikes place was still empty  ive had a letter from macpherson said mr jackson  macpherson was the vigorous and persevering gentleman referred to in a previous chapter who kept a fatherly eye on the buenos ayres sheep  he seems very satisfied with mikes friend wyatt at the moment of writing wyatt is apparently incapacitated owing to a bullet in the shoulder but expects to be fit again shortly that young man seems to make things fairly lively wherever he is i dont wonder he found a public school too restricted a sphere for his energies  has he been fighting a duel asked marjory interested  bushrangers said phyllis  there arent any bushrangers in buenos ayres said ella  how do you know said phyllis clinchingly  bushray bushray bushray began gladys maud conversationally through the breadandmilk but was headed off  he gives no details perhaps that letter on mikes plate supplies them i see it comes from buenos ayres  i wish mike would come and open it said marjory shall i go and hurry him up  the missing member of the family entered as she spoke  buck up mike she shouted theres a letter from wyatt hes been wounded in a duel  with a bushranger added phyllis  bushray explained gladys maud  is there said mike sorry im late  he opened the letter and began to read  what does he say inquired marjory who was the duel with  how many bushrangers were there asked phyllis  mike read on  good old wyatt hes shot a man  killed him asked marjory excitedly  no only potted him in the leg this is what he says first page is mostly about the ripton match and so on here you are im dictating this to a sportsman of the name of danvers a good chap who cant help being ugly so excuse bad writing the fact is weve been having a bustup here and ive come out of it with a bullet in the shoulder which has crocked me for the time being it happened like this an ass of a gaucho had gone into the town and got jolly tight and coming back he wanted to ride through our place the old woman who keeps the lodge wouldnt have it at any price gave him the absolute missinbaulk so this rotter instead of shifting off proceeded to cut the fence and go through that way all the farms out here have their boundaries marked by wire fences and it is supposed to be a deadly sin to cut these well the lodgekeepers son dashed off in search of help a chap called chester an old wykehamist and i were dipping sheep close by so he came to us and told us what had happened we nipped on to a couple of horses pulled out our revolvers and tooled after him after a bit we overtook him and thats when the trouble began the johnny had dismounted when we arrived i thought he was simply tightening his horses girths what he was really doing was getting a steady aim at us with his revolver he fired as we came up and dropped poor old chester i thought he was killed at first but it turned out it was only his leg i got going then i emptied all the six chambers of my revolver and missed him clean every time in the meantime he got me in the right shoulder hurt like sin afterwards though it was only a sort of dull shock at the moment the next item of the programme was a forward move in force on the part of the enemy the man had got his knife out nowwhy he didnt shoot again i dont knowand toddled over in our direction to finish us off chester was unconscious and it was any money on the gaucho when i happened to catch sight of chesters pistol which had fallen just by where i came down i picked it up and loosed off missed the first shot but got him with the second in the ankle at about two yards and his days work was done thats the painful story danvers says hes getting writers cramp so i shall have to stop  by jove said mike  what a dreadful thing said mrs jackson  anyhow it was practically a bushranger said phyllis  i told you it was a duel and so it was said marjory  what a terrible experience for the poor boy said mrs jackson  much better than being in a beastly bank said mike summing up im glad hes having such a ripping time it must be almost as decent as wrykyn out there i say whats under that dish     chapter xxx  mr jackson makes up his mind   two years have elapsed and mike is home again for the easter holidays  if mike had been in time for breakfast that morning he might have gathered from the expression on his fathers face as mr jackson opened the envelope containing his school report and read the contents that the document in question was not exactly a paean of praise from beginning to end but he was late as usual mike always was late for breakfast in the holidays  when he came down on this particular morning the meal was nearly over mr jackson had disappeared taking his correspondence with him mrs jackson had gone into the kitchen and when mike appeared the thing had resolved itself into a mere vulgar brawl between phyllis and ella for the jam while marjory who had put her hair up a fortnight before looked on in a detached sort of way as if these juvenile gambols distressed her  hullo mike she said jumping up as he entered here you areive been keeping everything hot for you  have you thanks awfully i say his eye wandered in mild surprise round the table im a bit late  marjory was bustling about fetching and carrying for mike as she always did she had adopted him at an early age and did the thing thoroughly she was fond of her other brothers especially when they made centuries in firstclass cricket but mike was her favourite she would field out in the deep as a natural thing when mike was batting at the net in the paddock though for the others even for joe who had played in all five test matches in the previous summer she would do it only as a favour  phyllis and ella finished their dispute and went out marjory sat on the table and watched mike eat  your report came this morning mike she said  the kidneys failed to retain mikes undivided attention he looked up interested what did it say  i didnt seei only caught sight of the wrykyn crest on the envelope father didnt say anything  mike seemed concerned i say that looks rather rotten i wonder if it was awfully bad its the first ive had from appleby  it cant be any worse than the horrid ones mr blake used to write when you were in his form  no thats a comfort said mike philosophically think theres any more tea in that pot  i call it a shame said marjory they ought to be jolly glad to have you at wrykyn just for cricket instead of writing beastly reports that make father angry and dont do any good to anybody  last summer he said hed take me away if i got another one  he didnt mean it really i know he didnt he couldnt youre the best bat wrykyns ever had  what ho interpolated mike  you are everybody says you are why you got your first the very first term you were thereeven joe didnt do anything nearly so good as that saunders says youre simply bound to play for england in another year or two  saunders is a jolly good chap he bowled me a halfvolley on the off the first ball i had in a school match by the way i wonder if hes out at the net now lets go and see  saunders was setting up the net when they arrived mike put on his pads and went to the wickets while marjory and the dogs retired as usual to the far hedge to retrieve  she was kept busy saunders was a good sound bowler of the mcc minor match type and there had been a time when he had worried mike considerably but mike had been in the wrykyn team for three seasons now and each season he had advanced tremendously in his batting he had filled out in three years he had always had the style and now he had the strength as well saunderss bowling on a true wicket seemed simple to him it was early in the easter holidays but already he was beginning to find his form saunders who looked on mike as his own special invention was delighted  if you dont be worried by being too anxious now that youre captain master mike he said youll make a century every match next term  i wish i wasnt its a beastly responsibility  henfrey the wrykyn cricket captain of the previous season was not returning next term and mike was to reign in his stead he liked the prospect but it certainly carried with it a rather aweinspiring responsibility at night sometimes he would lie awake appalled by the fear of losing his form or making a hash of things by choosing the wrong men to play for the school and leaving the right men out it is no light thing to captain a public school at cricket  as he was walking towards the house phyllis met him oh ive been hunting for you mike father wants you  what for  i dont know  where  hes in the study he seems added phyllis throwing in the information by way of a makeweight in a beastly wax  mikes jaw fell slightly i hope the dickens its nothing to do with that bally report was his muttered exclamation  mikes dealings with his father were as a rule of a most pleasant nature mr jackson was an understanding sort of man who treated his sons as companions from time to time however breezes were apt to ruffle the placid sea of goodfellowship mikes endofterm report was an unfailing windraiser indeed on the arrival of mr blakes sarcastic résumé of mikes shortcomings at the end of the previous term there had been something not unlike a typhoon it was on this occasion that mr jackson had solemnly declared his intention of removing mike from wrykyn unless the critics became more flattering and mr jackson was a man of his word  it was with a certain amount of apprehension therefore that jackson entered the study  come in mike said his father kicking the wastepaper basket i want to speak to you  mike skilled in omens scented a row in the offing only in moments of emotion was mr jackson in the habit of booting the basket  there followed an awkward silence which mike broke by remarking that he had carted a halfvolley from saunders over the onside hedge that morning  it was just a bit short and off the leg stump so i stepped outmay i bag the paperknife for a jiffy ill just show  never mind about cricket now said mr jackson i want you to listen to this report  oh is that my report father said mike with a sort of sickly interest much as a dog about to be washed might evince in his tub  it is replied mr jackson in measured tones your report what is more it is without exception the worst report you have ever had  oh i say groaned the recordbreaker  his conduct quoted mr jackson has been unsatisfactory in the extreme both in and out of school  it wasnt anything really i only happened  remembering suddenly that what he had happened to do was to drop a cannonball the school weight on the formroom floor not once but on several occasions he paused  french bad conduct disgraceful  everybody rags in french  mathematics bad inattentive and idle  nobody does much work in math  latin poor greek very poor  we were doing thucydides book two last termall speeches and doubtful readings and cruxes and thingsbeastly hard everybody says so  here are mr applebys remarks the boy has genuine ability which he declines to use in the smallest degree  mike moaned a moan of righteous indignation  an abnormal proficiency at games has apparently destroyed all desire in him to realise the more serious issues of life there is more to the same effect  mr appleby was a master with very definite ideas as to what constituted a publicschool masters duties as a man he was distinctly promike he understood cricket and some of mikes shots on the off gave him thrills of pure aesthetic joy but as a master he always made it his habit to regard the manners and customs of the boys in his form with an unbiased eye and to an unbiased eye mike in a formroom was about as near the extreme edge as a boy could be and mr appleby said as much in a clear firm hand  you remember what i said to you about your report at christmas mike said mr jackson folding the lethal document and replacing it in its envelope  mike said nothing there was a sinking feeling in his interior  i shall abide by what i said  mikes heart thumped  you will not go back to wrykyn next term  somewhere in the world the sun was shining birds were twittering somewhere in the world lambkins frisked and peasants sang blithely at their toil flat perhaps but still blithely but to mike at that moment the sky was black and an icy wind blew over the face of the earth  the tragedy had happened and there was an end of it he made no attempt to appeal against the sentence he knew it would be useless his father when he made up his mind having all the unbending tenacity of the normally easygoing man  mr jackson was sorry for mike he understood him and for that reason he said very little now  i am sending you to sedleigh was his next remark  sedleigh mike sat up with a jerk he knew sedleigh by nameone of those schools with about a hundred fellows which you never hear of except when they send up their gymnasium pair to aldershot or their eight to bisley mikes outlook on life was that of a cricketer pure and simple what had sedleigh ever done what were they ever likely to do whom did they play what old sedleighan had ever done anything at cricket perhaps they didnt even play cricket  but its an awful hole he said blankly  mr jackson could read mikes mind like a book mikes point of view was plain to him he did not approve of it but he knew that in mikes place and at mikes age he would have felt the same he spoke drily to hide his sympathy  it is not a large school he said and i dont suppose it could play wrykyn at cricket but it has one meritboys work there young barlitt won a balliol scholarship from sedleigh last year barlitt was the vicars son a silent spectacled youth who did not enter very largely into mikes world they had met occasionally at tennisparties but not much conversation had ensued barlitts mind was massive but his topics of conversation were not mikes  mr barlitt speaks very highly of sedleigh added mr jackson  mike said nothing which was a good deal better than saying what he would have liked to have said     chapter xxxi  sedleigh   the train which had been stopping everywhere for the last halfhour pulled up again and mike seeing the name of the station got up opened the door and hurled a gladstone bag out on to the platform in an emphatic and vindictive manner then he got out himself and looked about him  for the school sir inquired the solitary porter bustling up as if he hoped by sheer energy to deceive the traveller into thinking that sedleigh station was staffed by a great army of porters  mike nodded a sombre nod the nod napoleon might have given if somebody had met him in 1812 and said so youre back from moscow eh mike was feeling thoroughly jaundiced the future seemed wholly gloomy and so far from attempting to make the best of things he had set himself deliberately to look on the dark side he thought for instance that he had never seen a more repulsive porter or one more obviously incompetent than the man who had attached himself with a firm grasp to the handle of the bag as he strode off in the direction of the luggagevan he disliked his voice his appearance and the colour of his hair also the boots he wore he hated the station and the man who took his ticket  young gents at the school sir said the porter perceiving from mikes distrait air that the boy was a stranger to the place goes up in the bus mostly its waiting here sir hi george  ill walk thanks said mike frigidly  its a goodish step sir  here you are  thank you sir ill send up your luggage by the bus sir which ouse was it you was going to  outwoods  right sir its straight on up this road to the school you cant miss it sir  worse luck said mike  he walked off up the road sorrier for himself than ever it was such absolutely rotten luck about now instead of being on his way to a place where they probably ran a diabolo team instead of a cricket eleven and played hunttheslipper in winter he would be on the point of arriving at wrykyn and as captain of cricket at that which was the bitter part of it he had never been in command for the last two seasons he had been the star man going in first and heading the averages easily at the end of the season and the three captains under whom he had played during his career as a wrykynian burgess enderby and henfrey had always been sportsmen to him but it was not the same thing he had meant to do such a lot for wrykyn cricket this term he had had an entirely new system of coaching in his mind now it might never be used he had handed it on in a letter to strachan who would be captain in his place but probably strachan would have some scheme of his own there is nobody who could not edit a paper in the ideal way and there is nobody who has not a theory of his own about cricketcoaching at school  wrykyn too would be weak this year now that he was no longer there strachan was a good free bat on his day and if he survived a few overs might make a century in an hour but he was not to be depended upon there was no doubt that mikes sudden withdrawal meant that wrykyn would have a bad time that season and it had been such a wretched athletic year for the school the football fifteen had been hopeless and had lost both the ripton matches the return by over sixty points sheens victory in the lightweights at aldershot had been their one success and now on top of all this the captain of cricket was removed during the easter holidays mikes heart bled for wrykyn and he found himself loathing sedleigh and all its works with a great loathing  the only thing he could find in its favour was the fact that it was set in a very pretty country of a different type from the wrykyn country but almost as good for three miles mike made his way through woods and past fields once he crossed a river it was soon after this that he caught sight from the top of a hill of a group of buildings that wore an unmistakably schoollike look  this must be sedleigh  ten minutes walk brought him to the school gates and a bakers boy directed him to mr outwoods  there were three houses in a row separated from the school buildings by a cricketfield outwoods was the middle one of these  mike went to the front door and knocked at wrykyn he had always charged in at the beginning of term at the boys entrance but this formal reporting of himself at sedleigh suited his mood  he inquired for mr outwood and was shown into a room lined with books presently the door opened and the housemaster appeared  there was something pleasant and homely about mr outwood in appearance he reminded mike of smee in peter pan he had the same eyebrows and pincenez and the same motherly look  jackson he said mildly  yes sir  i am very glad to see you very glad indeed perhaps you would like a cup of tea after your journey i think you might like a cup of tea you come from crofton in shropshire i understand jackson near brindleford it is a part of the country which i have always wished to visit i daresay you have frequently seen the cluniac priory of st ambrose at brindleford  mike who would not have recognised a cluniac priory if you had handed him one on a tray said he had not  dear me you have missed an opportunity which i should have been glad to have i am preparing a book on ruined abbeys and priories of england and it has always been my wish to see the cluniac priory of st ambrose a deeply interesting relic of the sixteenth century bishop geoffrey 113340  shall i go across to the boys part sir  what yes oh yes quite so and perhaps you would like a cup of tea after your journey no quite so quite so you should make a point of visiting the remains of the cluniac priory in the summer holidays jackson you will find the matron in her room in many respects it is unique the northern altar is in a state of really wonderful preservation it consists of a solid block of masonry five feet long and two and a half wide with chamfered plinth standing quite free from the apse wall it will well repay a visit goodbye for the present jackson goodbye  mike wandered across to the other side of the house his gloom visibly deepened all alone in a strange school where they probably played hopscotch with a housemaster who offered one cups of tea after ones journey and talked about chamfered plinths and apses it was a little hard  he strayed about finding his bearings and finally came to a room which he took to be the equivalent of the senior dayroom at a wrykyn house everywhere else he had found nothing but emptiness evidently he had come by an earlier train than was usual but this room was occupied  a very long thin youth with a solemn face and immaculate clothes was leaning against the mantelpiece as mike entered he fumbled in his top left waistcoat pocket produced an eyeglass attached to a cord and fixed it in his right eye with the help of this aid to vision he inspected mike in silence for a while then having flicked an invisible speck of dust from the left sleeve of his coat he spoke  hullo he said  he spoke in a tired voice  hullo said mike  take a seat said the immaculate one if you dont mind dirtying your bags thats to say personally i dont see any prospect of ever sitting down in this place it looks to me as if they meant to use these chairs as mustardandcress beds a nursery garden in the home that sort of idea my name he added pensively is smith whats yours     chapter xxxii  psmith   jackson said mike  are you the bully the pride of the school or the boy who is led astray and takes to drink in chapter sixteen  the last for choice said mike but ive only just arrived so i dont know  the boywhat will he become are you new here too then  yes why are you new  do i look as if i belonged here im the latest import sit down on yonder settee and i will tell you the painful story of my life by the way before i start theres just one thing if you ever have occasion to write to me would you mind sticking a p at the beginning of my name psmith see there are too many smiths and i dont care for smythe my fathers content to worry along in the oldfashioned way but ive decided to strike out a fresh line i shall found a new dynasty the resolve came to me unexpectedly this morning as i was buying a simple pennorth of butterscotch out of the automatic machine at paddington i jotted it down on the back of an envelope in conversation you may address me as rupert though i hope you wont or simply smith the p not being sounded cp the name zbysco in which the z is given a similar missinbaulk see  mike said he saw psmith thanked him with a certain stately oldworld courtesy  let us start at the beginning he resumed my infancy when i was but a babe my eldest sister was bribed with a shilling an hour by my nurse to keep an rye on me and see that i did not raise cain at the end of the first day she struck for oneand six and got it we now pass to my boyhood at an early age i was sent to eton everybody predicting a bright career for me but said psmith solemnly fixing an owllike gaze on mike through the eyeglass it was not to be  no said mike  no i was superannuated last term  bad luck  for eton yes but what eton loses sedleigh gains  but why sedleigh of all places  this is the most painful part of my narrative it seems that a certain scug in the next village to ours happened last year to collar a balliol  not barlitt exclaimed mike  that was the man the son of the vicar the vicar told the curate who told our curate who told our vicar who told my father who sent me off here to get a balliol too do you know barlitt  his paters vicar of our village it was because his son got a balliol that i was sent here  do you come from crofton  yes  ive lived at lower benford all my life we are practically longlost brothers cheer a little will you  mike felt as robinson crusoe felt when he met friday here was a fellow human being in this desert place he could almost have embraced psmith the very sound of the name lower benford was heartening his dislike for his new school was not diminished but now he felt that life there might at least be tolerable  where were you before you came here asked psmith you have heard my painful story now tell me yours  wrykyn my pater took me away because i got such a lot of bad reports  my reports from eton were simply scurrilous theres a libel action in every sentence how do you like this place from what youve seen of it  rotten  i am with you comrade jackson you wont mind my calling you comrade will you ive just become a socialist its a great scheme you ought to be one you work for the equal distribution of property and start by collaring all you can and sitting on it we must stick together we are companions in misfortune lost lambs sheep that have gone astray divided we fall together we may worry through have you seen professor radium yet i should say mr outwood what do you think of him  he doesnt seem a bad sort of chap bit off his nut jawed about apses and things  and thereby said psmith hangs a tale ive been making inquiries of a stout sportsman in a sort of salvation army uniform whom i met in the groundshes the school sergeant or something quite a solid manand i hear that comrade outwoods an archaeological cove goes about the country beating up old ruins and fossils and things theres an archaeological society in the school run by him it goes out on halfholidays prowling about and is allowed to break bounds and generally steep itself to the eyebrows in reckless devilry and mark you laddie if you belong to the archaeological society you get off cricket to get off cricket said psmith dusting his right trouserleg was the dream of my youth and the aspiration of my riper years a noble game but a bit too thick for me at eton i used to have to field out at the nets till the soles of my boots wore through i suppose you are a blood at the game play for the school against loamshire and so on  im not going to play here at any rate said mike  he had made up his mind on this point in the train there is a certain fascination about making the very worst of a bad job achilles knew his business when he sat in his tent the determination not to play cricket for sedleigh as he could not play for wrykyn gave mike a sort of pleasure to stand by with folded arms and a sombre frown as it were was one way of treating the situation and one not without its meed of comfort  psmith approved the resolve  stout fellow he said tis well you and i hand in hand will search the countryside for ruined abbeys we will snare the elusive fossil together above all we will go out of bounds we shall thus improve our minds and have a jolly good time as well i shouldnt wonder if one mightnt borrow a gun from some friendly native and do a bit of rabbitshooting here and there from what i saw of comrade outwood during our brief interview i shouldnt think he was one of the lynxeyed contingent with tact we ought to be able to slip away from the merry throng of fossilchasers and do a bit on our own account  good idea said mike we will a chap at wrykyn called wyatt used to break out at night and shoot at cats with an airpistol  it would take a lot to make me do that i am all against anything that interferes with my sleep but rabbits in the daytime is a scheme well nose about for a gun at the earliest opp meanwhile wed better go up to comrade outwood and get our names shoved down for the society  i vote we get some tea first somewhere  then lets beat up a study i suppose they have studies here lets go and look  they went upstairs on the first floor there was a passage with doors on either side psmith opened the first of these  thisll do us well he said  it was a biggish room looking out over the school grounds there were a couple of deal tables two empty bookcases and a lookingglass hung on a nail  might have been made for us said psmith approvingly  i suppose it belongs to some rotter  not now  you arent going to collar it  that said psmith looking at himself earnestly in the mirror and straightening his tie is the exact programme we must stake out our claims this is practical socialism  but the real owners bound to turn up some time or other  his misfortune not ours you cant expect two masterminds like us to pig it in that room downstairs there are moments when one wants to be alone it is imperative that we have a place to retire to after a fatiguing day and now if you want to be really useful come and help me fetch up my box from downstairs its got an etna and various things in it     chapter xxxiii  staking out a claim   psmith in the matter of decorating a study and preparing tea in it was rather a critic than an executant he was full of ideas but he preferred to allow mike to carry them out it was he who suggested that the wooden bar which ran across the window was unnecessary but it was mike who wrenched it from its place similarly it was mike who abstracted the key from the door of the next study though the idea was psmiths  privacy said psmith as he watched mike light the etna is what we chiefly need in this age of publicity if you leave a study door unlocked in these strenuous times the first thing you know is somebody comes right in sits down and begins to talk about himself i think with a little care we ought to be able to make this room quite decently comfortable that putrid calendar must come down though do you think you could make a long arm and haul it off the parent tintack thanks we make progress we make progress  we shall jolly well make it out of the window said mike spooning up tea from a paper bag with a postcard if a sort of young hackenschmidt turns up and claims the study what are you going to do about it  dont let us worry about it i have a presentiment that he will be an insignificantlooking little weed how are you getting on with the evening meal  just ready what would you give to be at eton now id give something to be at wrykyn  these school reports said psmith sympathetically are the very dickens many a bright young lad has been soured by them hullo whats this i wonder  a heavy body had plunged against the door evidently without a suspicion that there would be any resistance a rattling at the handle followed and a voice outside said dash the door  hackenschmidt said mike  the weed said psmith you couldnt make a long arm could you and turn the key we had better give this merchant audience remind me later to go on with my remarks on school reports i had several bright things to say on the subject  mike unlocked the door and flung it open framed in the entrance was a smallish freckled boy wearing a bowler hat and carrying a bag on his face was an expression of mingled wrath and astonishment  psmith rose courteously from his chair and moved forward with slow stateliness to do the honours  what the dickens inquired the newcomer are you doing here  illustration what the dickens are you doing here  we were having a little tea said psmith to restore our tissues after our journey come in and join us we keep open house we psmiths let me introduce you to comrade jackson a stout fellow homely in appearance perhaps but one of us i am psmith your own name will doubtless come up in the course of general chitchat over the teacups  my names spiller and this is my study  psmith leaned against the mantelpiece put up his eyeglass and harangued spiller in a philosophical vein  of all sad words of tongue or pen said he the saddest are these it might have been too late that is the bitter cry if you had torn yourself from the bosom of the spiller family by an earlier train all might have been well but no your father held your hand and said huskily edwin dont leave us your mother clung to you weeping and said edwin stay your sisters  i want to know what  your sisters froze on to your knees like little octopuses or octopi and screamed dont go edwin and so said psmith deeply affected by his recital you stayed on till the later train and on arrival you find strange faces in the familiar room a people that know not spiller psmith went to the table and cheered himself with a sip of tea spillers sad case had moved him greatly  the victim of fate seemed in no way consoled  its beastly cheek thats what i call it are you new chaps  the very latest thing said psmith  well its beastly cheek  mikes outlook on life was of the solid practical order he went straight to the root of the matter  what are you going to do about it he asked  spiller evaded the question  its beastly cheek he repeated you cant go about the place bagging studies  but we do said psmith in this life comrade spiller we must be prepared for every emergency we must distinguish between the unusual and the impossible it is unusual for people to go about the place bagging studies so you have rashly ordered your life on the assumption that it is impossible error ah spiller spiller let this be a lesson to you  look here i tell you what it  i was in a motor with a man once i said to him what would happen if you trod on that pedal thing instead of that other pedal thing he said i couldnt ones the footbrake and the others the accelerator but suppose you did i said i wouldnt he said now well let her rip so he stamped on the accelerator only it turned out to be the footbrake after all and we stopped dead and skidded into a ditch the advice i give to every young man starting life is never confuse the unusual and the impossible take the present case if you had only realised the possibility of somebody some day collaring your study you might have thought out dozens of sound schemes for dealing with the matter as it is you are unprepared the thing comes on you as a surprise the cry goes round spiller has been taken unawares he cannot cope with the situation  cant i ill  what are you going to do about it said mike  all i know is im going to have it it was simpsons last term and simpsons left and im next on the house list so of course its my study  but what steps said psmith are you going to take spiller the man of logic we know but what of spiller the man of action how do you intend to set about it force is useless i was saying to comrade jackson before you came in that i didnt mind betting you were an insignificantlooking little weed and you are an insignificantlooking little weed  well see what outwood says about it  not an unsound scheme by no means a scaly project comrade jackson and myself were about to interview him upon another point we may as well all go together  the trio made their way to the presence spiller pink and determined mike sullen psmith particularly debonair he hummed lightly as he walked and now and then pointed out to spiller objects of interest by the wayside  mr outwood received them with the motherly warmth which was evidently the leading characteristic of his normal manner  ah spiller he said and smith and jackson i am glad to see that you have already made friends  spillers sir said psmith laying a hand patronisingly on the studyclaimers shouldera proceeding violently resented by spilleris a character one cannot help but respect his nature expands before one like some beautiful flower  mr outwood received this eulogy with rather a startled expression and gazed at the object of the tribute in a surprised way  erquite so smith quite so he said at last i like to see boys in my house friendly towards one another  there is no vice in spiller pursued psmith earnestly his heart is the heart of a little child  please sir burst out this paragon of all the virtues i  but it was not entirely with regard to spiller that i wished to speak to you sir if you were not too busy  not at all smith not at all is there anything  please sir began spiller  i understand sir said psmith that there is an archaeological society in the school  mr outwoods eyes sparkled behind their pincenez it was a disappointment to him that so few boys seemed to wish to belong to his chosen band cricket and football games that left him cold appeared to be the main interest in their lives it was but rarely that he could induce new boys to join his colleague mr downing who presided over the school fire brigade never had any difficulty in finding support boys came readily at his call mr outwood pondered wistfully on this at times not knowing that the fire brigade owed its support to the fact that it provided its lighthearted members with perfectly unparalleled opportunities for ragging while his own band though small were in the main earnest  yes smith he said yes we have a small archaeological society ierin a measure look after it perhaps you would care to become a member  please sir said spiller  one moment spiller do you want to join smith  intensely sir archaeology fascinates me a grand pursuit sir  undoubtedly smith i am very pleased very pleased indeed i will put down your name at once  and jacksons sir  jackson too mr outwood beamed i am delighted most delighted this is capital this enthusiasm is most capital  spiller sir said psmith sadly i have been unable to induce to join  oh he is one of our oldest members  ah said psmith tolerantly that accounts for it  please sir said spiller  one moment spiller we shall have the first outing of the term on saturday we intend to inspect the roman camp at embury hill two miles from the school  we shall be there sir  capital  please sir said spiller  one moment spiller said psmith there is just one other matter if you could spare the time sir  certainly smith what is that  would there be any objection to jackson and myself taking simpsons old study  by all means smith a very good idea  yes sir it would give us a place where we could work quietly in the evenings  quite so quite so  thank you very much sir we will move our things in  thank you very much sir said mike  please sir shouted spiller arent i to have it im next on the list sir i come next after simpson cant i have it  im afraid i have already promised it to smith spiller you should have spoken before  but sir  psmith eyed the speaker pityingly  this tendency to delay spiller he said is your besetting fault correct it edwin fight against it  he turned to mr outwood  we should of course sir always be glad to see spiller in our study he would always find a cheery welcome waiting there for him there is no formality between ourselves and spiller  quite so an excellent arrangement smith i like this spirit of comradeship in my house then you will be with us on saturday  on saturday sir  all this sort of thing spiller said psmith as they closed the door is very very trying for a man of culture look us up in our study one of these afternoons     chapter xxxiv  guerrilla warfare   there are few pleasures said psmith as he resumed his favourite position against the mantelpiece and surveyed the commandeered study with the pride of a householder keener to the reflective mind than sitting under ones own rooftree this place would have been wasted on spiller he would not have appreciated it properly  mike was finishing his tea youre a jolly useful chap to have by you in a crisis smith he said with approval we ought to have known each other before  the loss was mine said psmith courteously we will now with your permission face the future for awhile i suppose you realise that we are now to a certain extent up against it spillers hot spanish blood is not going to sit tight and do nothing under a blow like this  what can he do outwoods given us the study  what would you have done if somebody had bagged your study  made it jolly hot for them  so will comrade spiller i take it that he will collect a gang and make an offensive movement against us directly he can to all appearances we are in a fairly tight place it all depends on how big comrade spillers gang will be i dont like rows but im prepared to take on a reasonable number of bravoes in defence of the home  mike intimated that he was with him on the point the difficulty is though he said about when we leave this room i mean were all right while we stick here but we cant stay all night  thats just what i was about to point out when you put it with such admirable clearness here we are in a stronghold they can only get at us through the door and we can lock that  and jam a chair against it  and as you rightly remark jam a chair against it but what of the nightfall what of the time when we retire to our dormitory  or dormitories i say if were in separate rooms we shall be in the cart  psmith eyed mike with approval he thinks of everything youre the man comrade jackson to conduct an affair of this kindsuch foresight such resource we must see to this at once if they put us in different rooms were donewe shall be destroyed singly in the watches of the night  wed better nip down to the matron right off  not the matroncomrade outwood is the man we are as sons to him there is nothing he can deny us im afraid we are quite spoiling his afternoon by these interruptions but we must rout him out once more  as they got up the door handle rattled again and this time there followed a knocking  this must be an emissary of comrade spillers said psmith let us parley with the man  mike unlocked the door a lighthaired youth with a cheerful rather vacant face and a receding chin strolled into the room and stood giggling with his hands in his pockets  i just came up to have a look at you he explained  if you move a little to the left said psmith you will catch the light and shade effects on jacksons face better  the newcomer giggled with renewed vigour are you the chap with the eyeglass who jaws all the time  i do wear an eyeglass said psmith as to the rest of the description  my names jellicoe  mine is psmithpsmithone of the shropshire psmiths the object on the skyline is comrade jackson  old spiller giggled jellicoe is cursing you like anything downstairs you are chaps do you mean to say you simply bagged his study hes making no end of a row about it  spillers fiery nature is a byword said psmith  whats he going to do asked mike in his practical way  hes going to get the chaps to turn you out  as i suspected sighed psmith as one mourning over the frailty of human nature about how many hornyhanded assistants should you say that he would be likely to bring will you for instance join the glad throng  me no fear i think spillers an ass  theres nothing like a common thought for binding people together i think spillers an ass  how many will there be then asked mike  he might get about half a dozen not more because most of the chaps dont see why they should sweat themselves just because spillers study has been bagged  sturdy common sense said psmith approvingly seems to be the chief virtue of the sedleigh character  we shall be able to tackle a crowd like that said mike the only thing is we must get into the same dormitory  this is where comrade jellicoes knowledge of the local geography will come in useful do you happen to know of any snug little room with say about four beds in it how many dormitories are there  fivetheres one with three beds in it only it belongs to three chaps  i believe in the equal distribution of property we will go to comrade outwood and stake out another claim  mr outwood received them even more beamingly than before yes smith he said  we must apologise for disturbing you sir  not at all smith not at all i like the boys in my house to come to me when they wish for my advice or help  we were wondering sir if you would have any objection to jackson jellicoe and myself sharing the dormitory with the three beds in it a very warm friendship explained psmith patting the gurgling jellicoe kindly on the shoulder has sprung up between jackson jellicoe and myself  you make friends easily smith i like to see iti like to see it  and we can have the room sir  certainlycertainly tell the matron as you go down  and now said psmith as they returned to the study we may say that we are in a fairly winning position a vote of thanks to comrade jellicoe for his valuable assistance  you are a chap said jellicoe  the handle began to revolve again  that door said psmith is getting a perfect incubus it cuts into ones leisure cruelly  this time it was a small boy they told me to come up and tell you to come down he said  psmith looked at him searchingly through his eyeglass  who  the senior dayroom chaps  spiller  spiller and robinson and stone and some other chaps  they want us to speak to them  they told me to come up and tell you to come down  go and give comrade spiller our compliments and say that we cant come down but shall be delighted to see him up here things he said as the messenger departed are beginning to move better leave the door open i think it will save trouble ah come in comrade spiller what can we do for you  spiller advanced into the study the others waited outside crowding in the doorway  look here said spiller are you going to clear out of here or not  after mr outwoods kindly thought in giving us the room you suggest a black and ungrateful action comrade spiller  youll get it hot if you dont  well risk it said mike  jellicoe giggled in the background the drama in the atmosphere appealed to him his was a simple and appreciative mind  come on you chaps cried spiller suddenly  there was an inward rush on the enemys part but mike had been watching he grabbed spiller by the shoulders and ran him back against the advancing crowd for a moment the doorway was blocked then the weight and impetus of mike and spiller prevailed the enemy gave back and mike stepping into the room again slammed the door and locked it  a neat piece of work said psmith approvingly adjusting his tie at the lookingglass the preliminaries may now be considered over the first shot has been fired the dogs of war are now loose  a heavy body crashed against the door  theyll have it down said jellicoe  we must act comrade jackson might i trouble you just to turn that key quietly and the handle and then to stand by for the next attack  there was a scrambling of feet in the passage outside and then a repetition of the onslaught on the door this time however the door instead of resisting swung open and the human batteringram staggered through into the study mike turning after relocking the door was just in time to see psmith with a display of energy of which one would not have believed him capable grip the invader scientifically by an arm and a leg  mike jumped to help but it was needless the captive was already on the windowsill as mike arrived psmith dropped him on to the flowerbed below  psmith closed the window gently and turned to jellicoe who was our guest he asked dusting the knees of his trousers where they had pressed against the wall  robinson i say you are a chap  robinson was it well we are always glad to see comrade robinson always i wonder if anybody else is thinking of calling  apparently frontal attack had been abandoned whisperings could be heard in the corridor  somebody hammered on the door  yes called psmith patiently  youd better come out you know youll only get it hotter if you dont  leave us spiller we would be alone  a bell rang in the distance  tea said jellicoe we shall have to go now  they wont do anything till after tea i shouldnt think said mike theres no harm in going out  the passage was empty when they opened the door the call to food was evidently a thing not to be treated lightly by the enemy  in the diningroom the beleaguered garrison were the object of general attention everybody turned to look at them as they came in it was plain that the study episode had been a topic of conversation spillers face was crimson and robinsons coatsleeve still bore traces of garden mould  mike felt rather conscious of the eyes but psmith was in his element his demeanour throughout the meal was that of some whimsical monarch condescending for a freak to revel with his humble subjects  towards the end of the meal psmith scribbled a note and passed it to mike it read directly this is over nip upstairs as quickly as you can  mike followed the advice they were first out of the room when they had been in the study a few moments jellicoe knocked at the door lucky you two cut away so quick he said they were going to try and get you into the senior dayroom and scrag you there  this said psmith leaning against the mantelpiece is exciting but it cant go on we have got for our sins to be in this place for a whole term and if we are going to do the hunted fawn business all the time life in the true sense of the word will become an impossibility my nerves are so delicately attuned that the strain would simply reduce them to hash we are not prepared to carry on a long campaignthe thing must be settled at once  shall we go down to the senior dayroom and have it out said mike  no we will play the fixture on our own ground i think we may take it as tolerably certain that comrade spiller and his hired ruffians will try to corner us in the dormitory tonight well of course we could fake up some sort of barricade for the door but then we should have all the trouble over again tomorrow and the day after that personally i dont propose to be chivvied about indefinitely like this so i propose that we let them come into the dormitory and see what happens is this meeting with me  i think thats sound said mike we neednt drag jellicoe into it  as a matter of factif you dont mind began that man of peace  quite right said psmith this is not comrade jellicoes scene at all he has got to spend the term in the senior dayroom whereas we have our little wooden châlet to retire to in times of stress comrade jellicoe must stand out of the game altogether we shall be glad of his moral support but otherwise ne pas and now as there wont be anything doing till bedtime i think ill collar this table and write home and tell my people that all is well with their rupert     chapter xxxv  unpleasantness in the small hours   jellicoe that human encyclopaedia consulted on the probable movements of the enemy deposed that spiller retiring at ten would make for dormitory one in the same passage where robinson also had a bed the rest of the opposing forces were distributed among other and more distant rooms it was probable therefore that dormitory one would be the rendezvous as to the time when an attack might be expected it was unlikely that it would occur before halfpast eleven mr outwood went the round of the dormitories at eleven  and touching said psmith the matter of noise must this business be conducted in a subdued and sotto voce manner or may we let ourselves go a bit here and there  i shouldnt think old outwoods likely to hear youhe sleeps miles away on the other side of the house he never hears anything we often rag half the night and nothing happens  this appears to be a thoroughly nice wellconducted establishment what would my mother say if she could see her rupert in the midst of these reckless youths  all the better said mike we dont want anybody butting in and stopping the show before its half started  comrade jacksons berserk blood is upi can hear it sizzling i quite agree these things are all very disturbing and painful but its as well to do them thoroughly when ones once in for them is there nobody else who might interfere with our gambols  barnes might said jellicoe only he wont  who is barnes  head of the housea rotter hes in a funk of stone and robinson they rag him hell simply sit tight  then i think said psmith placidly we may look forward to a very pleasant evening shall we be moving  mr outwood paid his visit at eleven as predicted by jellicoe beaming vaguely into the darkness over a candle and disappeared again closing the door  how about that door said mike shall we leave it open for them  not so but far otherwise if its shut we shall hear them at it when they come subject to your approval comrade jackson i have evolved the following plan of action i always ask myself on these occasions what would napoleon have done i think napoleon would have sat in a chair by his washhandstand which is close to the door he would have posted you by your washhandstand and he would have instructed comrade jellicoe directly he heard the doorhandle turned to give his celebrated imitation of a dormitory breathing heavily in its sleep he would then  i tell you what said mike how about tying a string at the top of the steps  yes napoleon would have done that too hats off to comrade jackson the man with the big brain  the floor of the dormitory was below the level of the door there were three steps leading down to it psmith lit a candle and they examined the ground the leg of a wardrobe and the leg of jellicoes bed made it possible for the string to be fastened in a satisfactory manner across the lower step psmith surveyed the result with approval  dashed neat he said practically the sunken road which dished the cuirassiers at waterloo i seem to see comrade spiller coming one of the finest purlers in the worlds history  if theyve got a candle  they wont have if they have stand by with your waterjug and douse it at once then theyll charge forward and all will be well if they have no candle fling the water at a venturefire into the brown lest we forget ill collar comrade jellicoes jug now and keep it handy a couple of sheets would also not be amisswe will enmesh the enemy  right ho said mike  these humane preparations being concluded said psmith we will retire to our posts and wait comrade jellicoe dont forget to breathe like an asthmatic sheep when you hear the door opened they may wait at the top of the steps listening  you are a chap said jellicoe  waiting in the dark for something to happen is always a trying experience especially if as on this occasion silence is essential mike found his thoughts wandering back to the vigil he had kept with mr wain at wrykyn on the night when wyatt had come in through the window and found authority sitting on his bed waiting for him mike was tired after his journey and he had begun to doze when he was jerked back to wakefulness by the stealthy turning of the doorhandle the faintest rustle from psmiths direction followed and a slight giggle succeeded by a series of deep breaths showed that jellicoe too had heard the noise  there was a creaking sound  it was pitchdark in the dormitory but mike could follow the invaders movements as clearly as if it had been broad daylight they had opened the door and were listening jellicoes breathing grew more asthmatic he was flinging himself into his part with the wholeheartedness of the true artist  the creak was followed by a sound of whispering then another creak the enemy had advanced to the top step another creak the vanguard had reached the second step in another moment  crash  and at that point the proceedings may be said to have formally opened  a struggling mass bumped against mikes shins as he rose from his chair he emptied his jug on to this mass and a yell of anguish showed that the contents had got to the right address  then a hand grabbed his ankle and he went down a million sparks dancing before his eyes as a fist flying out at a venture caught him on the nose  mike had not been welldisposed towards the invaders before but now he ran amok hitting out right and left at random his right missed but his left went home hard on some portion of somebodys anatomy a kick freed his ankle and he staggered to his feet at the same moment a sudden increase in the general volume of noise spoke eloquently of good work that was being put in by psmith  even at that crisis mike could not help feeling that if a row of this calibre did not draw mr outwood from his bed he must be an unusual kind of housemaster  he plunged forward again with outstretched arms and stumbled and fell over one of the onthefloor section of the opposing force they seized each other earnestly and rolled across the room till mike contriving to secure his adversarys head bumped it on the floor with such abandon that with a muffled yell the other let go and for the second time he rose as he did so he was conscious of a curious thudding sound that made itself heard through the other assorted noises of the battle  all this time the fight had gone on in the blackest darkness but now a light shone on the proceedings interested occupants of other dormitories roused from their slumbers had come to observe the sport they were crowding in the doorway with a candle  by the light of this mike got a swift view of the theatre of war the enemy appeared to number five the warrior whose head mike had bumped on the floor was robinson who was sitting up feeling his skull in a gingerly fashion to mikes right almost touching him was stone in the direction of the door psmith wielding in his right hand the cord of a dressinggown was engaging the remaining three with a patient smile they were clad in pyjamas and appeared to be feeling the dressinggown cord acutely  the sudden light dazed both sides momentarily the defence was the first to recover mike with a swing upsetting stone and psmith having seized and emptied jellicoes jug over spiller getting to work again with the cord in a manner that roused the utmost enthusiasm of the spectators  illustration psmith seized and emptied jellicoes jug over spiller  agility seemed to be the leading feature of psmiths tactics he was everywhereon mikes bed on his own on jellicoes drawing a passionate complaint from that noncombatant on whose face he inadvertently trod on the floorhe ranged the room sowing destruction  the enemy were disheartened they had started with the idea that this was to be a surprise attack and it was disconcerting to find the garrison armed at all points gradually they edged to the door and a final rush sent them through  hold the door for a second cried psmith and vanished mike was alone in the doorway  it was a situation which exactly suited his frame of mind he stood alone in direct opposition to the community into which fate had pitchforked him so abruptly he liked the feeling for the first time since his father had given him his views upon school reports that morning in the easter holidays he felt satisfied with life he hoped outnumbered as he was that the enemy would come on again and not give the thing up in disgust he wanted more  on an occasion like this there is rarely anything approaching concerted action on the part of the aggressors when the attack came it was not a combined attack stone who was nearest to the door made a sudden dash forward and mike hit him under the chin  stone drew back and there was another interval for rest and reflection  it was interrupted by the reappearance of psmith who strolled back along the passage swinging his dressinggown cord as if it were some clouded cane  sorry to keep you waiting comrade jackson he said politely duty called me elsewhere with the kindly aid of a guide who knows the lie of the land i have been making a short tour of the dormitories i have poured divers jugfuls of water over comrade spillers bed comrade robinsons bed comrade stonesspiller spiller these are harsh words where you pick them up i cant thinknot from me well well i suppose there must be an end to the pleasantest of functions goodnight goodnight  the door closed behind mike and himself for ten minutes shufflings and whisperings went on in the corridor but nobody touched the handle  then there was a sound of retreating footsteps and silence reigned  on the following morning there was a notice on the houseboard it ran     indoor games     dormitoryraiders are informed that in future neither    mr psmith nor mr jackson will be at home to visitors    this nuisance must now cease                                  r psmith                                 m jackson     chapter xxxvi  adair   on the same morning mike met adair for the first time  he was going across to school with psmith and jellicoe when a group of three came out of the gate of the house next door  thats adair said jellicoe in the middle  his voice had assumed a tone almost of awe  whos adair asked mike  captain of cricket and lots of other things  mike could only see the celebritys back he had broad shoulders and wiry light hair almost white he walked well as if he were used to running altogether a fitlooking sort of man even mikes jaundiced eye saw that  as a matter of fact adair deserved more than a casual glance he was that rare type the natural leader many boys and men if accident or the passage of time places them in a position where they are expected to lead can handle the job without disaster but that is a very different thing from being a born leader adair was of the sort that comes to the top by sheer force of character and determination he was not naturally clever at work but he had gone at it with a dogged resolution which had carried him up the school and landed him high in the sixth as a cricketer he was almost entirely selftaught nature had given him a good eye and left the thing at that adairs doggedness had triumphed over her failure to do her work thoroughly at the cost of more trouble than most people give to their lifework he had made himself into a bowler he read the authorities and watched firstclass players and thought the thing out on his own account and he divided the art of bowling into three sections first and most importantpitch second on the listbreak thirdpace he set himself to acquire pitch he acquired it bowling at his own pace and without any attempt at break he could now drop the ball on an envelope seven times out of ten  break was a more uncertain quantity sometimes he could get it at the expense of pitch sometimes at the expense of pace some days he could get all three and then he was an uncommonly bad man to face on anything but a plumb wicket  running he had acquired in a similar manner he had nothing approaching style but he had twice won the mile and halfmile at the sports off elegant runners who knew all about stride and the correct timing of the sprints and all the rest of it  briefly he was a worker he had heart  a boy of adairs type is always a force in a school in a big public school of six or seven hundred his influence is felt less but in a small school like sedleigh he is like a tidal wave sweeping all before him there were two hundred boys at sedleigh and there was not one of them in all probability who had not directly or indirectly been influenced by adair as a small boy his sphere was not large but the effects of his work began to be apparent even then it is human nature to want to get something which somebody else obviously values very much and when it was observed by members of his form that adair was going to great trouble and inconvenience to secure a place in the form eleven or fifteen they naturally began to think too that it was worth being in those teams the consequence was that his form always played hard this made other forms play hard and the net result was that when adair succeeded to the captaincy of football and cricket in the same year sedleigh as mr downing adairs housemaster and the nearest approach to a cricketmaster that sedleigh possessed had a fondness for saying was a keen school as a whole it both worked and played with energy  all it wanted now was opportunity  this adair was determined to give it he had that passionate fondness for his school which every boy is popularly supposed to have but which really is implanted in about one in every thousand the average publicschool boy likes his school he hopes it will lick bedford at footer and malvern at cricket but he rather bets it wont he is sorry to leave and he likes going back at the end of the holidays but as for any passionate deepseated love of the place he would think it rather bad form than otherwise if anybody came up to him slapped him on the back and cried come along jenkins my boy play up for the old school jenkins the dear old school the old place you love so he would feel seriously ill  adair was the exception  to adair sedleigh was almost a religion both his parents were dead his guardian with whom he spent the holidays was a man with neuralgia at one end of him and gout at the other and the only really pleasant times adair had had as far back as he could remember he owed to sedleigh the place had grown on him absorbed him where mike violently transplanted from wrykyn saw only a wretched little hole not to be mentioned in the same breath with wrykyn adair dreaming of the future saw a colossal establishment a public school among public schools a lump of human radium shooting out blues and balliol scholars year after year without ceasing  it would not be so till long after he was gone and forgotten but he did not mind that his devotion to sedleigh was purely unselfish he did not want fame all he worked for was that the school should grow and grow keener and better at games and more prosperous year by year till it should take its rank among the schools and to be an old sedleighan should be a badge passing its owner everywhere  hes captain of cricket and footer said jellicoe impressively hes in the shooting eight hes won the mile and half two years running he would have boxed at aldershot last term only he sprained his wrist and he plays fives jolly well  sort of little tin god said mike taking a violent dislike to adair from that moment  mikes actual acquaintance with this allround man dated from the dinnerhour that day mike was walking to the house with psmith psmith was a little ruffled on account of a slight passageofarms he had had with his formmaster during morning school  theres a p before the smith i said to him ah p smith i see replied the goat not peasmith i replied exercising wonderful selfrestraint just psmith it took me ten minutes to drive the thing into the mans head and when i had driven it in he sent me out of the room for looking at him through my eyeglass comrade jackson i fear me we have fallen among bad men i suspect that we are going to be much persecuted by scoundrels  both you chaps play cricket i suppose  they turned it was adair seeing him face to face mike was aware of a pair of very bright blue eyes and a square jaw in any other place and mood he would have liked adair at sight his prejudice however against all things sedleighan was too much for him i dont he said shortly  havent you ever played  my little sister and i sometimes play with a soft ball at home  adair looked sharply at him a temper was evidently one of his numerous qualities  oh he said well perhaps you wouldnt mind turning out this afternoon and seeing what you can do with a hard ballif you can manage without your little sister  i should think the form at this place would be about on a level with hers but i dont happen to be playing cricket as i think i told you  adairs jaw grew squarer than ever mike was wearing a gloomy scowl  psmith joined suavely in the dialogue  my dear old comrades he said dont let us brawl over this matter this is a time for the honeyed word the kindly eye and the pleasant smile let me explain to comrade adair speaking for comrade jackson and myself we should both be delighted to join in the mimic warfare of our national game as you suggest only the fact is we happen to be the young archaeologists we gave in our names last night when you are being carried back to the pavilion after your century against loamshiredo you play loamshirewe shall be grubbing in the hard ground for ruined abbeys the old choice between pleasure and duty comrade adair a boys crossroads  then you wont play  no said mike  archaeology said psmith with a deprecatory wave of the hand will brook no divided allegiance from her devotees  adair turned and walked on  scarcely had he gone when another voice hailed them with precisely the same question  both you fellows are going to play cricket eh  it was a master a short wiry little man with a sharp nose and a general resemblance both in manner and appearance to an excitable bullfinch  i saw adair speaking to you i suppose you will both play i like every new boy to begin at once the more new blood we have the better we want keenness here we are above all a keen school i want every boy to be keen  we are sir said psmith with fervour  excellent  on archaeology  mr downingfor it was no less a celebritystarted as one who perceives a loathly caterpillar in his salad  archaeology  we gave in our names to mr outwood last night sir archaeology is a passion with us sir when we heard that there was a society here we went singing about the house  i call it an unnatural pursuit for boys said mr downing vehemently i dont like it i tell you i dont like it it is not for me to interfere with one of my colleagues on the staff but i tell you frankly that in my opinion it is an abominable waste of time for a boy it gets him into idle loafing habits  i never loaf sir said psmith  i was not alluding to you in particular i was referring to the principle of the thing a boy ought to be playing cricket with other boys not wandering at large about the country probably smoking and going into low publichouses  a very wild lot sir i fear the archaeological society here sighed psmith shaking his head  if you choose to waste your time i suppose i cant hinder you but in my opinion it is foolery nothing else  he stumped off  now hes cross said psmith looking after him im afraid were getting ourselves disliked here  good job too  at any rate comrade outwood loves us lets go on and see what sort of a lunch that largehearted fossilfancier is going to give us     chapter xxxvii  mike finds occupation   there was more than one moment during the first fortnight of term when mike found himself regretting the attitude he had imposed upon himself with regard to sedleighan cricket he began to realise the eternal truth of the proverb about half a loaf and no bread in the first flush of his resentment against his new surroundings he had refused to play cricket and now he positively ached for a game any sort of a game an innings for a kindergarten v the second eleven of a home of rest for centenarians would have soothed him there were times when the sun shone and he caught sight of white flannels on a green ground and heard the plonk of bat striking ball when he felt like rushing to adair and shouting i will be good i was in the wrykyn team three years and had an average of over fifty the last two seasons lead me to the nearest net and let me feel a bat in my hands again  but every time he shrank from such a climb down it couldnt be done  what made it worse was that he saw after watching behind the nets once or twice that sedleigh cricket was not the childish burlesque of the game which he had been rash enough to assume that it must be numbers do not make good cricket they only make the presence of good cricketers more likely by the law of averages  mike soon saw that cricket was by no means an unknown art at sedleigh adair to begin with was a very good bowler indeed he was not a burgess but burgess was the only wrykyn bowler whom in his three years experience of the school mike would have placed above him he was a long way better than nevillesmith and wyatt and milton and the others who had taken wickets for wrykyn  the batting was not so good but there were some quite capable men barnes the head of outwoods he who preferred not to interfere with stone and robinson was a mild rather timidlooking youthnot unlike what mr outwood must have been as a boybut he knew how to keep balls out of his wicket he was a good bat of the old plodding type  stone and robinson themselves that swashbuckling pair who now treated mike and psmith with cold but consistent politeness were both fair batsmen and stone was a good slow bowler  there were other exponents of the game mostly in downings house  altogether quite worthy colleagues even for a man who had been a star at wrykyn                                       one solitary overture mike made during that first fortnight he did not repeat the experiment it was on a thursday afternoon after school the day was warm but freshened by an almost imperceptible breeze the air was full of the scent of the cut grass which lay in little heaps behind the nets this is the real cricket scent which calls to one like the very voice of the game  mike as he sat there watching could stand it no longer  he went up to adair  may i have an innings at this net he asked he was embarrassed and nervous and was trying not to show it the natural result was that his manner was offensively abrupt  adair was taking off his pads after his innings he looked up this net it may be observed was the first eleven net  what he said  mike repeated his request more abruptly this time from increased embarrassment  this is the first eleven net said adair coldly go in after lodge over there  over there was the end net where frenzied novices were bowling on a corrugated pitch to a redhaired youth with enormous feet who looked as if he were taking his first lesson at the game  mike walked away without a word                                       the archaeological society expeditions even though they carried with them the privilege of listening to psmiths views on life proved but a poor substitute for cricket psmith who had no counterattraction shouting to him that he ought to be elsewhere seemed to enjoy them hugely but mike almost cried sometimes from boredom it was not always possible to slip away from the throng for mr outwood evidently looked upon them as among the very faithful and kept them by his aide  mike on these occasions was silent and jumpy his brow sicklied oer with the pale cast of care but psmith followed his leader with the pleased and indulgent air of a father whose infant son is showing him round the garden psmiths attitude towards archaeological research struck a new note in the history of that neglected science he was amiable but patronising he patronised fossils and he patronised ruins if he had been confronted with the great pyramid he would have patronised that  he seemed to be consumed by a thirst for knowledge  that this was not altogether a genuine thirst was proved on the third expedition mr outwood and his band were pecking away at the site of an old roman camp psmith approached mike  having inspired confidence he said by the docility of our demeanour let us slip away and brood apart for awhile roman camps to be absolutely accurate give me the pip and i never want to see another putrid fossil in my life let us find some shady nook where a man may lie on his back for a bit  mike over whom the proceedings connected with the roman camp had long since begun to shed a blue depression offered no opposition and they strolled away down the hill  looking back they saw that the archaeologists were still hard at it their departure had passed unnoticed  a fatiguing pursuit this grubbing for mementoes of the past said psmith and above all dashed bad for the knees of the trousers mine are like some furrowed field its a great grief to a man of refinement i can tell you comrade jackson ah this looks a likely spot  they had passed through a gate into the field beyond at the further end there was a brook shaded by trees and running with a pleasant sound over pebbles  thus far said psmith hitching up the knees of his trousers and sitting down and no farther we will rest here awhile and listen to the music of the brook in fact unless you have anything important to say i rather think ill go to sleep in this busy life of ours these naps by the wayside are invaluable call me in about an hour and psmith heaving the comfortable sigh of the worker who by toil has earned rest lay down with his head against a mossy treestump and closed his eyes  mike sat on for a few minutes listening to the water and making centuries in his mind and then finding this a little dull he got up jumped the brook and began to explore the wood on the other side  he had not gone many yards when a dog emerged suddenly from the undergrowth and began to bark vigorously at him  mike liked dogs and on acquaintance they always liked him but when you meet a dog in some one elses wood it is as well not to stop in order that you may get to understand each other mike began to thread his way back through the trees  he was too late  stop what the dickens are you doing here shouted a voice behind him  in the same situation a few years before mike would have carried on and trusted to speed to save him but now there seemed a lack of dignity in the action he came back to where the man was standing  im sorry if im trespassing he said i was just having a look round  the dickens youwhy youre jackson  mike looked at him he was a short broad young man with a fair moustache mike knew that he had seen him before somewhere but he could not place him  i played against you for the free foresters last summer in passing you seem to be a bit of a free forester yourself dancing in among my nesting pheasants  im frightfully sorry  thats all right where do you spring from  of coursei remember you now youre prendergast you made fiftyeight not out  thanks i was afraid the only thing you would remember about me was that you took a century mostly off my bowling  you ought to have had me second ball only cover dropped it  dont rake up forgotten tragedies how is it youre not at wrykyn what are you doing down here  ive left wrykyn  prendergast suddenly changed the conversation when a fellow tells you that he has left school unexpectedly it is not always tactful to inquire the reason he began to talk about himself  i hang out down here i do a little farming and a good deal of pottering about  get any cricket asked mike turning to the subject next his heart  only village very keen but no great shakes by the way how are you off for cricket now have you ever got a spare afternoon  mikes heart leaped  any wednesday or saturday look here ill tell you how it is  and he told how matters stood with him  so you see he concluded im supposed to be hunting for ruins and thingsmikes ideas on the subject of archaeology were vaguebut i could always slip away we all start out together but i could nip back get on to my bikeive got it down hereand meet you anywhere you liked by jove im simply dying for a game i can hardly keep my hands off a bat  ill give you all you want what youd better do is to ride straight to lower borlockthats the name of the placeand ill meet you on the ground any one will tell you where lower borlock is its just off the london road theres a signpost where you turn off can you come next saturday  rather i suppose you can fix me up with a bat and pads i dont want to bring mine  ill lend you everything i say you know we cant give you a wrykyn wicket the lower borlock pitch isnt a shirtfront  ill play on a rockery if you want me to said mike                                       youre going to what asked psmith sleepily on being awakened and told the news  im going to play cricket for a village near here i say dont tell a soul will you i dont want it to get about or i may get lugged in to play for the school  my lips are sealed i think ill come and watch you cricket i dislike but watching cricket is one of the finest of britains manly sports ill borrow jellicoes bicycle                                        that saturday lower borlock smote the men of chidford hip and thigh their victory was due to a hurricane innings of seventyfive by a newcomer to the team m jackson     chapter xxxviii  the fire brigade meeting   cricket is the great safetyvalve if you like the game and are in a position to play it at least twice a week life can never be entirely grey as time went on and his average for lower borlock reached the fifties and stayed there mike began though he would not have admitted it to enjoy himself it was not wrykyn but it was a very decent substitute  the only really considerable element making for discomfort now was mr downing by bad luck it was in his form that mike had been placed on arrival and mr downing never an easy formmaster to get on with proved more than usually difficult in his dealings with mike  they had taken a dislike to each other at their first meeting and it grew with further acquaintance to mike mr downing was all that a master ought not to be fussy pompous and openly influenced in his official dealings with his form by his own private likes and dislikes to mr downing mike was simply an unamiable loafer who did nothing for the school and apparently had none of the instincts which should be implanted in the healthy boy mr downing was rather strong on the healthy boy  the two lived in a state of simmering hostility punctuated at intervals by crises which usually resulted in lower borlock having to play some unskilled labourer in place of their star batsman employed doing overtime  one of the most acute of these crises and the most important in that it was the direct cause of mikes appearance in sedleigh cricket had to do with the third weekly meeting of the school fire brigade  it may be remembered that this wellsupported institution was under mr downings special care it was indeed his pet hobby and the apple of his eye  just as you had to join the archaeological society to secure the esteem of mr outwood so to become a member of the fire brigade was a safe passport to the regard of mr downing to show a keenness for cricket was good but to join the fire brigade was best of all the brigade was carefully organised at its head was mr downing a sort of high priest under him was a captain and under the captain a vicecaptain these two officials were those sportive allies stone and robinson of outwoods house who having perceived at a very early date the gorgeous opportunities for ragging which the brigade offered to its members had joined young and worked their way up  under them were the rank and file about thirty in all of whom perhaps seven were earnest workers who looked on the brigade in the right or downing spirit the rest were entirely frivolous  the weekly meetings were always full of life and excitement  at this point it is as well to introduce sammy to the reader  sammy short for sampson was a young bullterrier belonging to mr downing if it is possible for a man to have two apples of his eye sammy was the other he was a large lighthearted dog with a white coat an engaging expression the tongue of an anteater and a manner which was a happy blend of hurricane and circular saw he had long legs a tenor voice and was apparently made of indiarubber  sammy was a great favourite in the school and a particular friend of mikes the wrykynian being always a firm ally of every dog he met after two minutes acquaintance  in passing jellicoe owned a clockwork rat much in request during french lessons  we will now proceed to the painful details                                       the meetings of the fire brigade were held after school in mr downings formroom the proceedings always began in the same way by the reading of the minutes of the last meeting after that the entertainment varied according to whether the members happened to be fertile or not in ideas for the disturbing of the peace  today they were in very fair form  as soon as mr downing had closed the minutebook wilson of the school house held up his hand  well wilson  please sir couldnt we have a uniform for the brigade  a uniform mr downing pondered  red with green stripes sir  red with a thin green stripe was the sedleigh colour  shall i put it to the vote sir asked stone  one moment stone  those in favour of the motion move to the left those against it to the right  a scuffling of feet a slamming of desklids and an upset blackboard and the meeting had divided  mr downing rapped irritably on his desk  sit down he said sit down i wont have this noise and disturbance stone sit downwilson get back to your place  please sir the motion is carried by twentyfive votes to six  please sir may i go and get measured this evening  please sir  silence the idea of a uniform is of course out of the question  oooooooo sirrr  be quiet entirely out of the question we cannot plunge into needless expense stone listen to me i cannot have this noise and disturbance another time when a point arises it must be settled by a show of hands well wilson  please sir may we have helmets  very useful as a protection against falling timbers sir said robinson  i dont think my people would be pleased sir if they knew i was going out to fires without a helmet said stone  the whole strength of the company please sir may we have helmets  those in favour began stone  mr downing banged on his desk silence silence silence helmets are of course perfectly preposterous  oooooooo sirrr  but sir the danger  please sir the falling timbers  the fire brigade had been in action once and once only in the memory of man and that time it was a haystack which had burnt itself out just as the rescuers had succeeded in fastening the hose to the hydrant  silence  then please sir couldnt we have an honour cap it wouldnt be expensive and it would be just as good as a helmet for all the timbers that are likely to fall on our heads  mr downing smiled a wry smile  our wilson is facetious he remarked frostily  sir no sir i wasnt facetious or couldnt we have footertops like the first fifteen have they  wilson leave the room  sir please sir  this moment wilson and as he reached the door do me one hundred lines  a pained oooooo sirrr was cut off by the closing door  mr downing proceeded to improve the occasion i deplore this growing spirit of flippancy he said i tell you i deplore it it is not right if this fire brigade is to be of solid use there must be less of this flippancy we must have keenness i want you boys above all to be keen iwhat is that noise  from the other side of the door proceeded a sound like water gurgling from a bottle mingled with cries halfsuppressed as if somebody were being prevented from uttering them by a hand laid over his mouth the sufferer appeared to have a high voice  there was a tap at the door and mike walked in he was not alone those near enough to see saw that he was accompanied by jellicoes clockwork rat which moved rapidly over the floor in the direction of the opposite wall  may i fetch a book from my desk sir asked mike  very wellbe quick jackson we are busy  being interrupted in one of his addresses to the brigade irritated mr downing  the muffled cries grew more distinct  whatisthatnoise shrilled mr downing  noise sir asked mike puzzled  i think its something outside the window sir said stone helpfully  a bird i think sir said robinson  dont be absurd snapped mr downing its outside the door wilson  yes sir said a voice off  are you making that whining noise  whining noise sir no sir im not making a whining noise  what sort of noise sir inquired mike as many wrykynians had asked before him it was a question invented by wrykyn for use in just such a case as this  i do not propose said mr downing acidly to imitate the noise you can all hear it perfectly plainly it is a curious whining noise  they are mowing the cricket field sir said the invisible wilson perhaps thats it  it may be one of the desks squeaking sir put in stone they do sometimes  or somebodys boots sir added robinson  silence wilson  yes sir bellowed the unseen one  dont shout at me from the corridor like that come in  yes sir  as he spoke the muffled whining changed suddenly to a series of tenor shrieks and the indiarubber form of sammy bounded into the room like an excited kangaroo  willing hands had by this time deflected the clockwork rat from the wall to which it had been steering and pointed it up the alleyway between the two rows of desks mr downing rising from his place was just in time to see sammy with a last leap spring on his prey and begin worrying it  chaos reigned  a rat shouted robinson  the twentythree members of the brigade who were not earnest instantly dealt with the situation each in the manner that seemed proper to him some leaped on to forms others flung books all shouted it was a stirring bustling scene  sammy had by this time disposed of the clockwork rat and was now standing like marius among the ruins barking triumphantly  the banging on mr downings desk resembled thunder it rose above all the other noises till in time they gave up the competition and died away  mr downing shot out orders threats and penalties with the rapidity of a maxim gun  stone sit down donovan if you do not sit down you will be severely punished henderson one hundred lines for gross disorder windham the same go to your seat vincent what are you doing broughtonknight i will not have this disgraceful noise and disorder the meeting is at an end go quietly from the room all of you jackson and wilson remain quietly i said durand dont shuffle your feet in that abominable way  crash  wolferstan i distinctly saw you upset that blackboard with a movement of your handone hundred lines go quietly from the room everybody  the meeting dispersed  jackson and wilson come here whats the meaning of this disgraceful conduct put that dog out of the room jackson  mike removed the yelling sammy and shut the door on him  well wilson  please sir i was playing with a clockwork rat  what business have you to be playing with clockwork rats  then i remembered said mike that i had left my horace in my desk so i came in  and by a fluke sir said wilson as one who tells of strange things the rat happened to be pointing in the same direction so he came in too  i met sammy on the gravel outside and he followed me  i tried to collar him but when you told me to come in sir i had to let him go and he came in after the rat  it was plain to mr downing that the burden of sin was shared equally by both culprits wilson had supplied the rat mike the dog but mr downing liked wilson and disliked mike wilson was in the fire brigade frivolous at times it was true but nevertheless a member also he kept wicket for the school mike was a member of the archaeological society and had refused to play cricket  mr downing allowed these facts to influence him in passing sentence  one hundred lines wilson he said you may go  wilson departed with the air of a man who has had a great deal of fun and paid very little for it  mr downing turned to mike you will stay in on saturday afternoon jackson it will interfere with your archaeological studies i fear but it may teach you that we have no room at sedleigh for boys who spend their time loafing about and making themselves a nuisance we are a keen school this is no place for boys who do nothing but waste their time that will do jackson  and mr downing walked out of the room in affairs of this kind a master has a habit of getting the last word     chapter xxxix  achilles leaves his tent   they say misfortunes never come singly as mike sat brooding over his wrongs in his study after the sammy incident jellicoe came into the room and without preamble asked for the loan of a sovereign  when one has been in the habit of confining ones lendings and borrowings to sixpences and shillings a request for a sovereign comes as something of a blow  what on earth for asked mike  i say do you mind if i dont tell you i dont want to tell anybody the fact is im in a beastly hole  oh sorry said mike as a matter of fact i do happen to have a quid you can freeze on to it if you like but its about all i have got so dont be shy about paying it back  jellicoe was profuse in his thanks and disappeared in a cloud of gratitude  mike felt that fate was treating him badly being kept in on saturday meant that he would be unable to turn out for little borlock against claythorpe the return match in the previous game he had scored ninetyeight and there was a lob bowler in the claythorpe ranks whom he was particularly anxious to meet again having to yield a sovereign to jellicoewhy on earth did the man want all thatmeant that unless a carefully worded letter to his brother bob at oxford had the desired effect he would be practically penniless for weeks  in a gloomy frame of mind he sat down to write to bob who was playing regularly for the varsity this season and only the previous week had made a century against sussex so might be expected to be in a sufficiently softened mood to advance the needful which it may be stated at once he did by return of post  mike was struggling with the opening sentences of this letterhe was never a very ready writerwhen stone and robinson burst into the room  mike put down his pen and got up he was in warlike mood and welcomed the intrusion if stone and robinson wanted battle they should have it  but the motives of the expedition were obviously friendly stone beamed robinson was laughing  youre a sportsman said robinson  what did he give you asked stone  they sat down robinson on the table stone in psmith s deckchair mikes heart warmed to them the little disturbance in the dormitory was a thing of the past done with forgotten contemporary with julius caesar he felt that he stone and robinson must learn to know and appreciate one another  there was as a matter of fact nothing much wrong with stone and robinson they were just ordinary raggers of the type found at every public school small and large they were absolutely free from brain they had a certain amount of muscle and a vast store of animal spirits they looked on school life purely as a vehicle for ragging the stones and robinsons are the swashbucklers of the school world they go about loud and boisterous with a wholehearted and cheerful indifference to other peoples feelings treading on the toes of their neighbour and shoving him off the pavement and always with an eye wide open for any adventure as to the kind of adventure they are not particular so long as it promises excitement sometimes they go through their whole school career without accident more often they run up against a snag in the shape of some seriousminded and muscular person who objects to having his toes trodden on and being shoved off the pavement and then they usually sober down to the mutual advantage of themselves and the rest of the community  ones opinion of this type of youth varies according to ones point of view small boys whom they had occasion to kick either from pure high spirits or as a punishment for some slip from the narrow path which the ideal small boy should tread regarded stone and robinson as bullies of the genuine eric and st winifreds brand masters were rather afraid of them adair had a smouldering dislike for them they were useful at cricket but apt not to take sedleigh as seriously as he could have wished  as for mike he now found them pleasant company and began to get out the teathings  those fire brigade meetings said stone are a rag you can do what you like and you never get more than a hundred lines  dont you said mike i got saturday afternoon  what  is wilson in too  no he got a hundred lines  stone and robinson were quite concerned  what a beastly swindle  thats because you dont play cricket old downing lets you do what you like if you join the fire brigade and play cricket  we are above all a keen school quoted stone dont you ever play  i have played a bit said mike  well why dont you have a shot we arent such flyers here if you know one end of a bat from the other you could get into some sort of a team were you at school anywhere before you came here  i was at wrykyn  why on earth did you leave asked stone were you sacked  no my pater took me away  wrykyn said robinson are you any relation of the jacksons therej w and the others  brother  what  well didnt you play at all there  yes said mike i did i was in the team three years and i should have been captain this year if id stopped on  there was a profound and gratifying sensation stone gaped and robinson nearly dropped his teacup  stone broke the silence  but i mean to saylook here what i mean is why arent you playing why dont you play now  i do i play for a village near here place called little borlock a man who played against wrykyn for the free foresters captains them he asked me if id like some games for them  but why not for the school  why should i its much better fun for the village you dont get ordered about by adair for a start  adair sticks on side said stone  enough for six agreed robinson  by jove said stone ive got an idea my word what a rag  whats wrong now inquired mike politely  why look here tomorrows midterm service day its nowhere near the middle of the term but they always have it in the fourth week theres chapel at halfpast nine till halfpast ten then the rest of the days a whole holiday there are always house matches were playing downings why dont you play and lets smash them  by jove yes said robinson why dont you theyre always sticking on side because theyve won the house cup three years running i say do you bat or bowl  bat why  robinson rocked on the table  why old downing fancies himself as a bowler you must play and knock the cover off him  masters dont play in house matches surely  this isnt a real house match only a friendly downing always turns out on midterm service day i say do play  think of the rag  but the teams full said mike  the list isnt up yet well nip across to barnes study and make him alter it  they dashed out of the room from down the passage mike heard yells of barnes the closing of a door and a murmur of excited conversation then footsteps returning down the passage  barnes appeared on his face the look of one who has seen visions  i say he said is it true or is stone rotting about wrykyn i mean  yes i was in the team  barnes was an enthusiastic cricketer he studied his wisden and he had an immense respect for wrykyn cricket  are you the m jackson then who had an average of fiftyone point nought three last year  illustration are you the m jackson then who had an average of fiftyone point nought three last year  yes  barness manner became like that of a curate talking to a bishop  i say he said thenerwill you play against downings tomorrow  rather said mike thanks awfully have some tea     chapter xl  the match with downings   it is the curious instinct which prompts most people to rub a thing in that makes the lot of the average convert an unhappy one only the very selfcontrolled can refrain from improving the occasion and scoring off the convert most leap at the opportunity  it was so in mikes case mike was not a genuine convert but to mr downing he had the outward aspect of one when you have been impressing upon a noncricketing boy for nearly a month that a the school is above all a keen school b that all members of it should play cricket and c that by not playing cricket he is ruining his chances in this world and imperilling them in the next and when quite unexpectedly you come upon this boy dressed in cricket flannels wearing cricket boots and carrying a cricket bag it seems only natural to assume that you have converted him that the seeds of your eloquence have fallen on fruitful soil and sprouted  mr downing assumed it  he was walking to the field with adair and another member of his team when he came upon mike  what he cried our jackson clad in suit of mail and armed for the fray  this was mr downings no 2 mannerthe playful  this is indeed saul among the prophets why this sudden enthusiasm for a game which i understood that you despised are our opponents so reduced  psmith who was with mike took charge of the affair with a languid grace which had maddened hundreds in its time and which never failed to ruffle mr downing  we are above all sir he said a keen house drones are not welcomed by us we are essentially versatile jackson the archaeologist of yesterday becomes the cricketer of today it is the right spirit sir said psmith earnestly i like to see it  indeed smith you are not playing yourself i notice your enthusiasm has bounds  in our house sir competition is fierce and the selection committee unfortunately passed me over                                       there were a number of pitches dotted about over the field for there was always a touch of the london park about it on midterm service day adair as captain of cricket had naturally selected the best for his own match it was a good wicket mike saw as a matter of fact the wickets at sedleigh were nearly always good adair had infected the groundman with some of his own keenness with the result that that onceleisurely official now found himself sometimes with a kind of mild surprise working really hard at the beginning of the previous season sedleigh had played a scratch team from a neighbouring town on a wicket which except for the creases was absolutely undistinguishable from the surrounding turf and behind the pavilion after the match adair had spoken certain home truths to the groundman the latters reformation had dated from that moment                                       barnes timidly jubilant came up to mike with the news that he had won the toss and the request that mike would go in first with him  in stories of the not really a duffer type where the nervous new boy who has been found crying in the bootroom over the photograph of his sister contrives to get an innings in a game nobody suspects that he is really a prodigy till he hits the bullys first ball out of the ground for six  with mike it was different there was no pitying smile on adairs face as he started his run preparatory to sending down the first ball mike on the cricket field could not have looked anything but a cricketer if he had turned out in a tweed suit and hobnail boots cricketer was written all over himin his walk in the way he took guard in his stand at the wickets adair started to bowl with the feeling that this was somebody who had more than a little knowledge of how to deal with good bowling and punish bad  mike started cautiously he was more than usually anxious to make runs today and he meant to take no risks till he could afford to do so he had seen adair bowl at the nets and he knew that he was good  the first over was a maiden six dangerous balls beautifully played the fieldsmen changed over  the general interest had now settled on the match between outwoods and downings the fact in mikes case had gone round the field and as several of the other games had not yet begun quite a large crowd had collected near the pavilion to watch mikes masterly treatment of the opening over had impressed the spectators and there was a popular desire to see how he would deal with mr downings slows it was generally anticipated that he would do something special with them  off the first ball of the masters over a legbye was run  mike took guard  mr downing was a bowler with a style of his own he took two short steps two long steps gave a jump took three more short steps and ended with a combination of step and jump during which the ball emerged from behind his back and started on its slow career to the wicket the whole business had some of the dignity of the oldfashioned minuet subtly blended with the careless vigour of a cakewalk the ball when delivered was billed to break from leg but the programme was subject to alterations  if the spectators had expected mike to begin any firework effects with the first ball they were disappointed he played the over through with a grace worthy of his brother joe the last ball he turned to leg for a single  his treatment of adairs next over was freer he had got a sight of the ball now halfway through the over a beautiful square cut forced a passage through the crowd by the pavilion and dashed up against the rails he drove the sixth ball past cover for three  the crowd was now reluctantly dispersing to its own games but it stopped as mr downing started his minuetcakewalk in the hope that it might see something more sensational  this time the hope was fulfilled  the ball was well up slow and off the wicket on the onside perhaps if it had been allowed to pitch it might have broken in and become quite dangerous mike went out at it and hit it a couple of feet from the ground the ball dropped with a thud and a spurting of dust in the road that ran along one side of the cricket field  it was returned on the instalment system by helpers from other games and the bowler began his manoeuvres again a halfvolley this time mike slammed it back and midon whose heart was obviously not in the thing failed to stop it  get to them jenkins said mr downing irritably as the ball came back from the boundary get to them  sir please sir  dont talk in the field jenkins  having had a fullpitch hit for six and a halfvolley for four there was a strong probability that mr downing would pitch his next ball short  the expected happened the third ball was a slow longhop and hit the road at about the same spot where the first had landed a howl of untuneful applause rose from the watchers in the pavilion and mike with the feeling that this sort of bowling was too good to be true waited in position for number four  there are moments when a sort of panic seizes a bowler this happened now with mr downing he suddenly abandoned science and ran amok his run lost its stateliness and increased its vigour he charged up to the wicket as a wounded buffalo sometimes charges a gun his whole idea now was to bowl fast  when a slow bowler starts to bowl fast it is usually as well to be batting if you can manage it  by the time the over was finished mikes score had been increased by sixteen and the total of his side in addition by three wides  and a shrill small voice from the neighbourhood of the pavilion uttered with painful distinctness the words take him off  that was how the most sensational days cricket began that sedleigh had known  a description of the details of the mornings play would be monotonous it is enough to say that they ran on much the same lines as the third and fourth overs of the match mr downing bowled one more over off which mike helped himself to sixteen runs and then retired moodily to coverpoint where in adairs fifth over he missed barnesthe first occasion since the game began on which that mild batsman had attempted to score more than a single scared by this escape outwoods captain shrank back into his shell sat on the splice like a limpet and offering no more chances was not out at lunch time with a score of eleven  mike had then made a hundred and three                                       as mike was taking off his pads in the pavilion adair came up  why did you say you didnt play cricket he asked abruptly  illustration why did you say you didnt play cricket he asked  when one has been bowling the whole morning and bowling well without the slightest success one is inclined to be abrupt  mike finished unfastening an obstinate strap then he looked up  i didnt say anything of the kind i said i wasnt going to play here theres a difference as a matter of fact i was in the wrykyn team before i came here three years  adair was silent for a moment  will you play for us against the old sedleighans tomorrow he said at length  mike tossed his pads into his bag and got up  no thanks  there was a silence  above it i suppose  not a bit not up to it i shall want a lot of coaching at that end net of yours before im fit to play for sedleigh  there was another pause  then you wont play asked adair  im not keeping you am i said mike politely  it was remarkable what a number of members of outwoods house appeared to cherish a personal grudge against mr downing it had been that masters somewhat injudicious practice for many years to treat his own house as a sort of chosen people of all masters the most unpopular is he who by the silent tribunal of a school is convicted of favouritism and the dislike deepens if it is a house which he favours and not merely individuals on occasions when boys in his own house and boys from other houses were accomplices and partners in wrongdoing mr downing distributed his thunderbolts unequally and the school noticed it the result was that not only he himself but alsowhich was rather unfairhis house too had acquired a good deal of unpopularity  the general consensus of opinion in outwoods during the luncheon interval was that having got downings up a tree they would be fools not to make the most of the situation  barness remark that he supposed unless anything happened and wickets began to fall a bit faster they had better think of declaring somewhere about halfpast three or four was met with a storm of opposition  declare said robinson great scott what on earth are you talking about  declare stones voice was almost a wail of indignation i never saw such a chump  theyll be rather sick if we dont wont they suggested barnes  sick i should think they would said stone thats just the gay idea cant you see that by a miracle weve got a chance of getting a jolly good bit of our own back against those downings ticks what weve got to do is to jolly well keep them in the field all day if we can and be jolly glad its so beastly hot if they lose about a dozen pounds each through sweating about in the sun after jacksons drives perhaps theyll stick on less side about things in general in future besides i want an innings against that bilge of old downings if i can get it  so do i said robinson  if you declare i swear i wont field nor will robinson  rather not  well i wont then said barnes unhappily only you know theyre rather sick already  dont you worry about that said stone with a wide grin theyll be a lot sicker before weve finished  and so it came about that that particular midterm serviceday match made history big scores had often been put up on midterm service day games had frequently been onesided but it had never happened before in the annals of the school that one side going in first early in the morning had neither completed its innings nor declared it closed when stumps were drawn at 630 in no previous sedleigh match after a full days play had the pathetic words did not bat been written against the whole of one of the contending teams  these are the things which mark epochs  play was resumed at 215 for a quarter of an hour mike was comparatively quiet adair fortified by food and rest was bowling really well and his first halfdozen overs had to be watched carefully but the wicket was too good to give him a chance and mike playing himself in again proceeded to get to business once more bowlers came and went adair pounded away at one end with brief intervals between the attacks mr downing took a couple more overs in one of which a horse passing in the road nearly had its useful life cut suddenly short changebowlers of various actions and paces each weirder and more futile than the last tried their luck but still the firstwicket stand continued  the bowling of a house team is all head and no body the first pair probably have some idea of length and break the firstchange pair are poor and the rest the small change are simply the sort of things one sees in dreams after a heavy supper or when one is out without ones gun  time mercifully generally breaks up a big stand at cricket before the field has suffered too much and that is what happened now at four oclock when the score stood at two hundred and twenty for no wicket barnes greatly daring smote lustily at a rather wide halfvolley and was caught at shortslip for thirtythree he retired blushfully to the pavilion amidst applause and stone came out  as mike had then made a hundred and eightyseven it was assumed by the field that directly he had topped his second century the closure would be applied and their ordeal finished there was almost a sigh of relief when frantic cheering from the crowd told that the feat had been accomplished the fieldsmen clapped in quite an indulgent sort of way as who should say capital capital and now lets start our innings some even began to edge towards the pavilion but the next ball was bowled and the next over and the next after that and still barnes made no sign the consciencestricken captain of outwoods was as a matter of fact being practically held down by robinson and other ruffians by force  a grey dismay settled on the field  the bowling had now become almost unbelievably bad lobs were being tried and stone nearly weeping with pure joy was playing an innings of the howtobrightencricket type he had an unorthodox style but an excellent eye and the road at this period of the game became absolutely unsafe for pedestrians and traffic  mikes pace had become slower as was only natural but his score too was mounting steadily  this is foolery snapped mr downing as the three hundred and fifty went up on the board barnes he called  there was no reply a committee of three was at that moment engaged in sitting on barness head in the first eleven changingroom in order to correct a more than usually feverish attack of conscience  barnes  please sir said stone some species of telepathy telling him what was detaining his captain i think barnes must have left the field he has probably gone over to the house to fetch something  this is absurd you must declare your innings closed the game has become a farce  declare sir we cant unless barnes does he might be awfully annoyed if we did anything like that without consulting him  absurd  hes very touchy sir  it is perfect foolery  i think jenkins is just going to bowl sir  mr downing walked moodily to his place                                       in a neat wooden frame in the senior dayroom at outwoods just above the mantelpiece there was on view a week later a slip of paper the writing on it was as follows                   outwoods v downings                  outwoods first innings       j p barnes c hammond b hassall  33      m jackson not out 277      w j stone not out 124            extras  37                                                                       total for one wicket 471                      downings did not bat     chapter xli  the singular behaviour of jellicoe   outwoods rollicked considerably that night mike if he had cared to take the part could have been the petted hero but a cordial invitation from the senior dayroom to be the guest of the evening at about the biggest rag of the century had been refused on the plea of fatigue one does not make two hundred and seventyseven runs on a hot day without feeling the effects even if one has scored mainly by the medium of boundaries and mike as he lay back in psmiths deckchair felt that all he wanted was to go to bed and stay there for a week his hands and arms burned as if they were redhot and his eyes were so tired that he could not keep them open  psmith leaning against the mantelpiece discoursed in a desultory way on the days happeningsthe score off mr downing the undeniable annoyance of that battered bowler and the probability of his venting his annoyance on mike next day  in theory said he the manly whatdyoucallit of cricket and all that sort of thing ought to make him fall on your neck tomorrow and weep over you as a foeman worthy of his steel but i am prepared to bet a reasonable sum that he will give no jiujitsu exhibition of this kind in fact from what i have seen of our bright little friend i should say that in a small way he will do his best to make it distinctly hot for you here and there  i dont care murmured mike shifting his aching limbs in the chair  in an ordinary way i suppose a man can put up with having his bowling hit a little but your performance was cruelty to animals twentyeight off one over not to mention three wides would have made job foam at the mouth you will probably get sacked on the other hand its worth it you have lit a candle this day which can never be blown out you have shown the lads of the village how comrade downings bowling ought to be treated i dont suppose hell ever take another wicket  he doesnt deserve to  psmith smoothed his hair at the glass and turned round again  the only blot on this day of mirth and goodwill is he said the singular conduct of our friend jellicoe when all the place was ringing with song and merriment comrade jellicoe crept to my side and slipping his little hand in mine touched me for three quid  this interested mike fagged as he was  what three quid  three jingling clinking sovereigns he wanted four  but the man must be living at the rate of i dont know what it was only yesterday that he borrowed a quid from me  he must be saving money fast there appear to be the makings of a financier about comrade jellicoe well i hope when hes collected enough for his needs hell pay me back a bit im pretty well cleaned out  i got some from my brother at oxford  perhaps hes saving up to get married we may be helping towards furnishing the home there was a siamese prince fellow at my dames at eton who had four wives when he arrived and gathered in a fifth during his first summer holidays it was done on the correspondence system his prime minister fixed it up at the other end and sent him the glad news on a picture postcard i think an eye ought to be kept on comrade jellicoe                                       mike tumbled into bed that night like a log but he could not sleep he ached all over psmith chatted for a time on human affairs in general and then dropped gently off jellicoe who appeared to be wrapped in gloom contributed nothing to the conversation  after psmith had gone to sleep mike lay for some time running over in his mind as the best substitute for sleep the various points of his innings that day he felt very hot and uncomfortable  just as he was wondering whether it would not be a good idea to get up and have a cold bath a voice spoke from the darkness at his side  are you asleep jackson  whos that  mejellicoe i cant get to sleep  nor can i im stiff all over  ill come over and sit on your bed  there was a creaking and then a weight descended in the neighbourhood of mikes toes  jellicoe was apparently not in conversational mood he uttered no word for quite three minutes at the end of which time he gave a sound midway between a snort and a sigh  i say jackson he said  yes  have youoh nothing  silence again  jackson  hullo  i say what would your people say if you got sacked  all sorts of things especially my pater why  oh i dont know so would mine  everybodys would i expect  yes  the bed creaked as jellicoe digested these great thoughts then he spoke again  it would be a jolly beastly thing to get sacked  mike was too tired to give his mind to the subject he was not really listening jellicoe droned on in a depressed sort of way  youd get home in the middle of the afternoon i suppose and youd drive up to the house and the servant would open the door and youd go in they might all be out and then youd have to hang about and wait and presently youd hear them come in and youd go out into the passage and theyd say hullo  jellicoe in order to give verisimilitude as it were to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative flung so much agitated surprise into the last word that it woke mike from a troubled doze into which he had fallen  hullo he said whats up  then youd say hullo and then theyd say what are you doing here and youd say  what on earth are you talking about  about what would happen  happen when  when you got home after being sacked you know  whos been sacked mikes mind was still under a cloud  nobody but if you were i meant and then i suppose thered be an awful row and general sickness and all that and then youd be sent into a bank or to australia or something  mike dozed off again  my pater would be frightfully sick my mater would be sick my sister would be jolly sick too have you got any sisters jackson i say jackson  hullo whats the matter whos that  mejellicoe  whats up  i asked you if youd got any sisters  any what  sisters  whose sisters  yours i asked if youd got any  any what  sisters  what about them  the conversation was becoming too intricate for jellicoe he changed the subject  i say jackson  well  i say you dont know any one who could lend me a pound do you  what cried mike sitting up in bed and staring through the darkness in the direction whence the numismatists voice was proceeding do what  i say look out youll wake smith  did you say you wanted some one to lend you a quid  yes said jellicoe eagerly do you know any one  mikes head throbbed this thing was too much the human brain could not be expected to cope with it here was a youth who had borrowed a pound from one friend the day before and three pounds from another friend that very afternoon already looking about him for further loans was it a hobby or was he saving up to buy an aeroplane  what on earth do you want a pound for  i dont want to tell anybody but its jolly serious i shall get sacked if i dont get it  mike pondered  those who have followed mikes career as set forth by the present historian will have realised by this time that he was a good long way from being perfect as the blueeyed hero he would have been a rank failure except on the cricket field where he was a natural genius he was just ordinary he resembled ninety per cent of other members of english public schools he had some virtues and a good many defects he was as obstinate as a mule though people whom he liked could do as they pleased with him he was goodnatured as a general thing but on occasion his temper could be of the worst and had in his childhood been the subject of much adverse comment among his aunts he was rigidly truthful where the issue concerned only himself where it was a case of saving a friend he was prepared to act in a manner reminiscent of an american expert witness  he had in addition one good quality without any defect to balance it he was always ready to help people and when he set himself to do this he was never put off by discomfort or risk he went at the thing with a singleness of purpose that asked no questions  bobs postal order which had arrived that evening was reposing in the breastpocket of his coat  it was a wrench but if the situation was so serious with jellicoe it had to be done                                       two minutes later the night was being made hideous by jellicoes almost tearful protestations of gratitude and the postal order had moved from one side of the dormitory to the other     chapter xlii  jellicoe goes on the sicklist   mike woke next morning with a confused memory of having listened to a great deal of incoherent conversation from jellicoe and a painfully vivid recollection of handing over the bulk of his worldly wealth to him the thought depressed him though it seemed to please jellicoe for the latter carolled in a gay undertone as he dressed till psmith who had a sensitive ear asked as a favour that these farmyard imitations might cease until he was out of the room  there were other things to make mike lowspirited that morning to begin with he was in detention which in itself is enough to spoil a day it was a particularly fine day which made the matter worse in addition to this he had never felt stiffer in his life it seemed to him that the creaking of his joints as he walked must be audible to every one within a radius of several yards finally there was the interview with mr downing to come that would probably be unpleasant as psmith had said mr downing was the sort of master who would be likely to make trouble the great match had not been an ordinary match mr downing was a curious man in many ways but he did not make a fuss on ordinary occasions when his bowling proved expensive yesterdays performance however stood in a class by itself it stood forth without disguise as a deliberate rag one side does not keep another in the field the whole day in a oneday match except as a grisly kind of practical joke and mr downing and his house realised this the houses way of signifying its comprehension of the fact was to be cold and distant as far as the seniors were concerned and abusive and pugnacious as regards the juniors young blood had been shed overnight and more flowed during the eleven oclock interval that morning to avenge the insult  mr downings methods of retaliation would have to be of necessity more elusive but mike did not doubt that in some way or other his formmaster would endeavour to get a bit of his own back  as events turned out he was perfectly right when a master has got his knife into a boy especially a master who allows himself to be influenced by his likes and dislikes he is inclined to single him out in times of stress and savage him as if he were the official representative of the evildoers just as at sea the skipper when he has trouble with the crew works it off on the boy  mr downing was in a sarcastic mood when he met mike that is to say he began in a sarcastic strain but this sort of thing is difficult to keep up by the time he had reached his peroration the rapier had given place to the bludgeon for sarcasm to be effective the user of it must be met halfway his hearer must appear to be conscious of the sarcasm and moved by it mike when masters waxed sarcastic towards him always assumed an air of stolid stupidity which was as a suit of mail against satire  so mr downing came down from the heights with a run and began to express himself with a simple strength which it did his form good to listen to veterans who had been in the form for terms said afterwards that there had been nothing to touch it in their experience of the orator since the glorious day when dunster that prince of raggers who had left at christmas to go to a crammers had introduced three lively grasssnakes into the room during a latin lesson  you are surrounded concluded mr downing snapping his pencil in two in his emotion by an impenetrable mass of conceit and vanity and selfishness it does not occur to you to admit your capabilities as a cricketer in an open straightforward way and place them at the disposal of the school no that would not be dramatic enough for you it would be too commonplace altogether far too commonplace mr downing laughed bitterly no you must conceal your capabilities you must act a lie you mustwho is that shuffling his feet i will not have it i will have silenceyou must hang back in order to make a more effective entrance like some wretched actor whoi will not have this shuffling i have spoken of this before macpherson are you shuffling your feet  sir no sir  please sir  well parsons  i think its the noise of the draught under the door sir  instant departure of parsons for the outer regions and in the excitement of this sideissue the speaker lost his inspiration and abruptly concluded his remarks by putting mike on to translate in cicero which mike who happened to have prepared the first halfpage did with much success                                       the old boys match was timed to begin shortly after eleven oclock during the interval most of the school walked across the field to look at the pitch one or two of the old boys had already changed and were practising in front of the pavilion  it was through one of these batsmen that an accident occurred which had a good deal of influence on mikes affairs  mike had strolled out by himself halfway across the field jellicoe joined him jellicoe was cheerful and rather embarrassingly grateful he was just in the middle of his harangue when the accident happened  to their left as they crossed the field a long youth with the faint beginnings of a moustache and a blazer that lit up the surrounding landscape like a glowing beacon was lashing out recklessly at a friends bowling already he had gone within an ace of slaying a small boy as mike and jellicoe proceeded on their way there was a shout of heads  the almost universal habit of batsmen of shouting heads at whatever height from the ground the ball may be is not a little confusing the average person on hearing the shout puts his hands over his skull crouches down and trusts to luck this is an excellent plan if the ball is falling but is not much protection against a skimming drive along the ground  when heads was called on the present occasion mike and jellicoe instantly assumed the crouching attitude  jellicoe was the first to abandon it he uttered a yell and sprang into the air after which he sat down and began to nurse his ankle  the brightblazered youth walked up  awfully sorry you know man hurt  jellicoe was pressing the injured spot tenderly with his fingertips uttering sharp howls whenever zeal outrunning discretion he prodded himself too energetically  silly ass dunster he groaned slamming about like that  awfully sorry but i did yell  its swelling up rather said mike youd better get over to the house and have it looked at can you walk  jellicoe tried but sat down again with a loud ow at that moment the bell rang  i shall have to be going in said mike or id have helped you over  ill give you a hand said dunster  he helped the sufferer to his feet and they staggered off together jellicoe hopping dunster advancing with a sort of polka step mike watched them start and then turned to go in     chapter xliii  mike receives a commission   there is only one thing to be said in favour of detention on a fine summers afternoon and that is that it is very pleasant to come out of the sun never seems so bright or the turf so green as during the first five minutes after one has come out of the detentionroom one feels as if one were entering a new and very delightful world there is also a touch of the rip van winkle feeling everything seems to have gone on and left one behind mike as he walked to the cricket field felt very much behind the times  arriving on the field he found the old boys batting he stopped and watched an over of adairs the fifth ball bowled a man mike made his way towards the pavilion  before he got there he heard his name called and turning found psmith seated under a tree with the brightblazered dunster  return of the exile said psmith a joyful occasion tinged with melancholy have a cherrytake one or two these little acts of unremembered kindness are what one needs after a couple of hours in extra pupilroom restore your tissues comrade jackson and when you have finished those apply again  is your name jackson inquired dunster because jellicoe wants to see you  alas poor jellicoe said psmith he is now prone on his bed in the dormitorythere a sheer hulk lies poor tom jellicoe the darling of the crew faithful below he did his duty but comrade dunster has broached him to i have just been hearing the melancholy details  old smith and i said dunster were at a private school together id no idea i should find him here  it was a wonderfully stirring sight when we met said psmith not unlike the meeting of ulysses and the hound argos of whom you have doubtless read in the course of your dabblings in the classics i was ulysses dunster gave a lifelike representation of the faithful dawg  you still jaw as much as ever i notice said the animal delineator fondling the beginnings of his moustache  more sighed psmith more is anything irritating you he added eyeing the others manoeuvres with interest  you neednt be a funny ass man said dunster pained heaps of people tell me i ought to have it waxed  what it really wants is topdressing with guano hullo another man out adairs bowling better today than he did yesterday  i heard about yesterday said dunster it must have been a rag couldnt we work off some other rag on somebody before i go i shall be stopping here till monday in the village well hit siradairs bowling is perfectly simple if you go out to it  comrade dunster went out to it first ball said psmith to mike  oh chuck it man the sun was in my eyes i hear adairs got a match on with the mcc at last  has he said psmith i hadnt heard archaeology claims so much of my time that i have little leisure for listening to cricket chitchat  what was it jellicoe wanted asked mike was it anything important  he seemed to think sohe kept telling me to tell you to go and see him  i fear comrade jellicoe is a bit of a weakminded blitherer  did you ever hear of a rag we worked off on jellicoe once asked dunster the man has absolutely no sense of humourcant see when hes being rotted well it was like thishullo were all outi shall have to be going out to field again i suppose dash it ill tell you when i see you again  i shall count the minutes said psmith  mike stretched himself the sun was very soothing after his two hours in the detentionroom he felt disinclined for exertion  i dont suppose its anything special about jellicoe do you he said i mean itll keep till teatime its no catch having to sweat across to the house now  dont dream of moving said psmith i have several rather profound observations on life to make and i cant make them without an audience soliloquy is a knack hamlet had got it but probably only after years of patient practice personally i need some one to listen when i talk i like to feel that i am doing good you stay where you aredont interrupt too much  mike tilted his hat over his eyes and abandoned jellicoe  it was not until the lockup bell rang that he remembered him he went over to the house and made his way to the dormitory where he found the injured one in a parlous state not so much physical as mental the doctor had seen his ankle and reported that it would be on the active list in a couple of days it was jellicoes mind that needed attention now  mike found him in a condition bordering on collapse  i say you might have come before said jellicoe  whats up i didnt know there was such a hurry about itwhat did you want  its no good now said jellicoe gloomily its too late i shall get sacked  what on earth are you talking about whats the row  its about that money  what about it  i had to pay it to a man today or he said hed write to the headthen of course i should get sacked i was going to take the money to him this afternoon only i got crocked so i couldnt move i wanted to get hold of you to ask you to take it for meits too late now  mikes face fell oh hang it he said im awfully sorry id no idea it was anything like thatwhat a fool i was dunster did say he thought it was something important only like an ass i thought it would do if i came over at lockup  it doesnt matter said jellicoe miserably it cant be helped  yes it can said mike i know what ill doits all right ill get out of the house after lightsout  jellicoe sat up you cant youd get sacked if you were caught  who would catch me there was a chap at wrykyn i knew who used to break out every night nearly and go and pot at cats with an airpistol its as easy as anything  the toadundertheharrow expression began to fade from jellicoes face i say do you think you could really  of course i can itll be rather a rag  i say its frightfully decent of you  what absolute rot  but look here are you certain  i shall be all right where do you want me to go  its a place about a mile or two from here called lower borlock  lower borlock  yes do you know it  rather ive been playing cricket for them all the term  i say have you do you know a man called barley  barley ratherhe runs the white boar  hes the chap i owe the money to  old barley  mike knew the landlord of the white boar well he was the wag of the village team every village team for some mysterious reason has its comic man in the lower borlock eleven mr barley filled the post he was a large stout man with a red and cheerful face who looked exactly like the jovial innkeeper of melodrama he was the last man mike would have expected to do the money by mondayweek or i write to the headmaster business  but he reflected that he had only seen him in his leisure moments when he might naturally be expected to unbend and be full of the milk of human kindness probably in business hours he was quite different after all pleasure is one thing and business another  besides five pounds is a large sum of money and if jellicoe owed it there was nothing strange in mr barleys doing everything he could to recover it  he wondered a little what jellicoe could have been doing to run up a bill as big as that but it did not occur to him to ask which was unfortunate as it might have saved him a good deal of inconvenience it seemed to him that it was none of his business to inquire into jellicoes private affairs he took the envelope containing the money without question  i shall bike there i think he said if i can get into the shed  the schools bicycles were stored in a shed by the pavilion  you can manage that said jellicoe its locked up at night but i had a key made to fit it last summer because i used to go out in the early morning sometimes before it was opened  got it on you  smiths got it  ill get it from him  i say  well  dont tell smith why you want it will you i dont want anybody to knowif a thing once starts getting about its all over the place in no time  all right i wont tell him  i say thanks most awfully i dont know what i should have done i  oh chuck it said mike     chapter xliv  and fulfils it   mike started on his ride to lower borlock with mixed feelings it is pleasant to be out on a fine night in summer but the pleasure is to a certain extent modified when one feels that to be detected will mean expulsion  mike did not want to be expelled for many reasons now that he had grown used to the place he was enjoying himself at sedleigh to a certain extent he still harboured a feeling of resentment against the school in general and adair in particular but it was pleasant in outwoods now that he had got to know some of the members of the house and he liked playing cricket for lower borlock also he was fairly certain that his father would not let him go to cambridge if he were expelled from sedleigh mr jackson was easygoing with his family but occasionally his foot came down like a steamhammer as witness the wrykyn school report affair  so mike pedalled along rapidly being wishful to get the job done without delay  psmith had yielded up the key but his inquiries as to why it was needed had been embarrassing mikes statement that he wanted to get up early and have a ride had been received by psmith with whom early rising was not a hobby with honest amazement and a flood of advice and warning on the subject  one of the georges said psmith i forget which once said that a certain number of hours sleep a dayi cannot recall for the moment how manymade a man something which for the time being has slipped my memory however there you are ive given you the main idea of the thing and a german doctor says that early rising causes insanity still if youre bent on it after which he had handed over the key  mike wished he could have taken psmith into his confidence probably he would have volunteered to come too mike would have been glad of a companion  it did not take him long to reach lower borlock the white boar stood at the far end of the village by the cricket field he rode past the churchstanding out black and mysterious against the light skyand the rows of silent cottages until he came to the inn  the place was shut of course and all the lights were outit was some time past eleven  the advantage an inn has over a private house from the point of view of the person who wants to get into it when it has been locked up is that a nocturnal visit is not so unexpected in the case of the former preparations have been made to meet such an emergency where with a private house you would probably have to wander round heaving rocks and end by climbing up a waterspout when you want to get into an inn you simply ring the nightbell which communicating with the boots room has that hardworked menial up and doing in no time  after mike had waited for a few minutes there was a rattling of chains and a shooting of bolts and the door opened  yes sir said the boots appearing in his shirtsleeves why ullo mr jackson sir  mike was well known to all dwellers in lower borlock his scores being the chief topic of conversation when the days labours were over  i want to see mr barley jack  hes bin in bed this halfhour back mr jackson  i must see him can you get him down  the boots looked doubtful roust the guvnor outer bed he said  mike quite admitted the gravity of the task the landlord of the white boar was one of those men who need a beauty sleep  i wish you wouldits a thing that cant wait ive got some money to give to him  oh if its that said the boots  five minutes later mine host appeared in person looking more than usually portly in a check dressinggown and red bedroom slippers of the dreadnought type  you can pop off jack  exit boots to his slumbers once more  well mr jackson whats it all about  jellicoe asked me to come and bring you the money  the money what money  what he owes you the five pounds of course  the five mr barley stared openmouthed at mike for a moment then he broke into a roar of laughter which shook the sporting prints on the wall and drew barks from dogs in some distant part of the house he staggered about laughing and coughing till mike began to expect a fit of some kind then he collapsed into a chair which creaked under him and wiped his eyes  oh dear he said oh dear the five pounds  mike was not always abreast of the rustic idea of humour and now he felt particularly fogged for the life of him he could not see what there was to amuse any one so much in the fact that a person who owed five pounds was ready to pay it back it was an occasion for rejoicing perhaps but rather for a solemn thankful eyesraisedtoheaven kind of rejoicing  whats up he asked  five pounds  you might tell us the joke  mr barley opened the letter read it and had another attack when this was finished he handed the letter to mike who was waiting patiently by hoping for light and requested him to read it  dear dear chuckled mr barley five pounds they may teach you young gentlemen to talk latin and greek and what not at your school but it ud do a lot more good if theyd teach you how many beans make five it ud do a lot more good if theyd teach you to come in when it rained it ud do  mike was reading the letter     dear mr barley it rani send the £5 which i could not get    before i hope it is in time because i dont want you to write to    the headmaster i am sorry jane and john ate your wifes hat and    the chicken and broke the vase  there was some more to the same effect it was signed t g jellicoe  what on earths it all about said mike finishing this curious document  mr barley slapped his leg why mr jellicoe keeps two dogs here i keep em for him till the young gentlemen go home for their holidays aberdeen terriers they are and as sharp as mustard mischief i believe you but love us they dont do no harm bite up an old shoe sometimes and such sort of things the other day last wednesday it were about ar parse five janeshes the worst of the two always up to it she isshe got hold of my old hat and had it in bits before you could say knife john upset a china vase in one of the bedrooms chasing a mouse and they got on the coffeeroom table and ate half a cold chicken what had been left there so i says to myself ill have a game with mr jellicoe over this and i sits down and writes off saying the little dogs have eaten a valuable hat and a chicken and what not and the damagell be five pounds and will he kindly remit same by saturday night at the latest or i write to his headmaster love us mr barley slapped his thigh he took it all in every wordand heres the five pounds in cash in this envelope here i havent had such a laugh since we got old tom raxley out of bed at twelve of a winters night by telling him his house was afire  it is not always easy to appreciate a joke of the practical order if one has been made even merely part victim of it mike as he reflected that he had been dragged out of his house in the middle of the night in contravention of all school rules and discipline simply in order to satisfy mr barleys sense of humour was more inclined to be abusive than mirthful running risks is all very well when they are necessary or if one chooses to run them for ones own amusement but to be placed in a dangerous position a position imperilling ones chance of going to the varsity is another matter altogether  but it is impossible to abuse the barley type of man barleys enjoyment of the whole thing was so honest and childlike probably it had given him the happiest quarter of an hour he had known for years since in fact the affair of old tom raxley it would have been cruel to damp the man  so mike laughed perfunctorily took back the envelope with the five pounds accepted a stone ginger beer and a plateful of biscuits and rode off on his return journey                                       mention has been made above of the difference which exists between getting into an inn after lockup and into a private house mike was to find this out for himself  his first act on arriving at sedleigh was to replace his bicycle in the shed this he accomplished with success it was pitchdark in the shed and as he wheeled his machine in his foot touched something on the floor without waiting to discover what this might be he leaned his bicycle against the wall went out and locked the door after which he ran across to outwoods  fortune had favoured his undertaking by decreeing that a stout drainpipe should pass up the wall within a few inches of his and psmiths study on the first day of term it may be remembered he had wrenched away the wooden bar which bisected the windowframe thus rendering exit and entrance almost as simple as they had been for wyatt during mikes first term at wrykyn  he proceeded to scale this waterpipe  he had got about halfway up when a voice from somewhere below cried whos that     chapter xlv  pursuit   these things are lifes little difficulties one can never tell precisely how one will act in a sudden emergency the right thing for mike to have done at this crisis was to have ignored the voice carried on up the waterpipe and through the study window and gone to bed it was extremely unlikely that anybody could have recognised him at night against the dark background of the house the position then would have been that somebody in mr outwoods house had been seen breaking in after lightsout but it would have been very difficult for the authorities to have narrowed the search down any further than that there were thirtyfour boys in outwoods of whom about fourteen were much the same size and build as mike  the suddenness however of the call caused mike to lose his head he made the strategic error of sliding rapidly down the pipe and running  there were two gates to mr outwoods front garden the carriage drive ran in a semicircle of which the house was the centre it was from the righthand gate nearest to mr downings house that the voice had come and as mike came to the ground he saw a stout figure galloping towards him from that direction he bolted like a rabbit for the other gate as he did so his pursuer again gave tongue  oooooo yer was the exact remark  whereby mike recognised him as the school sergeant  oooooo yer was that militant gentlemans habitual way of beginning a conversation  with this knowledge mike felt easier in his mind sergeant collard was a man of many fine qualities notably a talent for what he was wont to call spottn a mysterious gift which he exercised on the rifle range but he could not run there had been a time in his hot youth when he had sprinted like an untamed mustang in pursuit of volatile pathans in indian hill wars but time increasing his girth had taken from him the taste for such exercise when he moved now it was at a stately walk the fact that he ran tonight showed how the excitement of the chase had entered into his blood  oooooo yer he shouted again as mike passing through the gate turned into the road that led to the school mikes attentive ear noted that the bright speech was a shade more puffily delivered this time he began to feel that this was not such bad fun after all he would have liked to be in bed but if that was out of the question this was certainly the next best thing  he ran on taking things easily with the sergeant panting in his wake till he reached the entrance to the school grounds he dashed in and took cover behind a tree  presently the sergeant turned the corner going badly and evidently cured of a good deal of the fever of the chase mike heard him toil on for a few yards and then stop a sound of panting was borne to him  then the sound of footsteps returning this time at a walk they passed the gate and went on down the road  the pursuer had given the thing up  mike waited for several minutes behind his tree his programme now was simple he would give sergeant collard about half an hour in case the latter took it into his head to guard home by waiting at the gate then he would trot softly back shoot up the waterpipe once more and so to bed it had just struck a quarter to somethingtwelve he supposedon the school clock he would wait till a quarter past  meanwhile there was nothing to be gained from lurking behind a tree he left his cover and started to stroll in the direction of the pavilion having arrived there he sat on the steps looking out on to the cricket field  his thoughts were miles away at wrykyn when he was recalled to sedleigh by the sound of somebody running focussing his gaze he saw a dim figure moving rapidly across the cricket field straight for him  his first impression that he had been seen and followed disappeared as the runner instead of making for the pavilion turned aside and stopped at the door of the bicycle shed like mike he was evidently possessed of a key for mike heard it grate in the lock at this point he left the pavilion and hailed his fellow rambler by night in a cautious undertone  the other appeared startled  who the dickens is that he asked is that you jackson  mike recognised adairs voice the last person he would have expected to meet at midnight obviously on the point of going for a bicycle ride  what are you doing out here jackson  what are you if it comes to that  adair was lighting his lamp  im going for the doctor one of the chaps in our house is bad  oh  what are you doing out here  just been for a stroll  hadnt you better be getting back  plenty of time  i suppose you think youre doing something tremendously brave and dashing  hadnt you better be going to the doctor  if you want to know what i think  i dont so long  mike turned away whistling between his teeth after a moments pause adair rode off mike saw his light pass across the field and through the gate the school clock struck the quarter  it seemed to mike that sergeant collard even if he had started to wait for him at the house would not keep up the vigil for more than half an hour he would be safe now in trying for home again  he walked in that direction  now it happened that mr downing aroused from his first sleep by the news conveyed to him by adair that macphee one of the junior members of adairs dormitory was groaning and exhibiting other symptoms of acute illness was disturbed in his mind most housemasters feel uneasy in the event of illness in their houses and mr downing was apt to get jumpy beyond the ordinary on such occasions all that was wrong with macphee as a matter of fact was a very fair stomachache the direct and legitimate result of eating six buns half a cocoanut three doughnuts two ices an apple and a pound of cherries and washing the lot down with tea but mr downing saw in his attack the beginnings of some deadly scourge which would sweep through and decimate the house he had despatched adair for the doctor and after spending a few minutes prowling restlessly about his room was now standing at his front gate waiting for adairs return  it came about therefore that mike sprinting lightly in the direction of home and safety had his already shaken nerves further maltreated by being hailed at a range of about two yards with a cry of is that you adair the next moment mr downing emerged from his gate  mike stood not upon the order of his going he was off like an arrowa flying figure of guilt mr downing after the first surprise seemed to grasp the situation ejaculating at intervals the words who is that stop who is that stop he dashed after the muchenduring wrykynian at an extremely creditable rate of speed mr downing was by way of being a sprinter he had won handicap events at college sports at oxford and if mike had not got such a good start the race might have been over in the first fifty yards as it was that victim of fate going well kept ahead at the entrance to the school grounds he led by a dozen yards the procession passed into the field mike heading as before for the pavilion  as they raced across the soft turf an idea occurred to mike which he was accustomed in after years to attribute to genius the one flash of it which had ever illumined his life  it was this  one of mr downings first acts on starting the fire brigade at sedleigh had been to institute an alarm bell it had been rubbed into the school officiallyin speeches from the daïsby the headmaster and unofficiallyin earnest private conversationsby mr downing that at the sound of this bell at whatever hour of day or night every member of the school must leave his house in the quickest possible way and make for the open the bell might mean that the school was on fire or it might mean that one of the houses was on fire in any case the school had its ordersto get out into the open at once  nor must it be supposed that the school was without practice at this feat every now and then a notice would be found posted up on the board to the effect that there would be fire drill during the dinner hour that day sometimes the performance was bright and interesting as on the occasion when mr downing marshalling the brigade at his front gate had said my house is supposed to be on fire now lets do a record which the brigade headed by stone and robinson obligingly did they fastened the hose to the hydrant smashed a window on the ground floor mr downing having retired for a moment to talk with the headmaster and poured a stream of water into the room when mr downing was at liberty to turn his attention to the matter he found that the room selected was his private study most of the light furniture of which was floating on a miniature lake that episode had rather discouraged his passion for realism and fire drill since then had taken the form for the most part of practising escaping this was done by means of canvas shoots kept in the dormitories at the sound of the bell the prefect of the dormitory would heave one end of the shoot out of window the other end being fastened to the sill he would then go down it himself using his elbows as a brake then the second man would follow his example and these two standing below would hold the end of the shoot so that the rest of the dormitory could fly rapidly down it without injury except to their digestions  after the first novelty of the thing had worn off the school had taken a rooted dislike to fire drill it was a matter for selfcongratulation among them that mr downing had never been able to induce the headmaster to allow the alarm bell to be sounded for fire drill at night the headmaster a man who had his views on the amount of sleep necessary for the growing boy had drawn the line at night operations sufficient unto the day had been the gist of his reply if the alarm bell were to ring at night when there was no fire the school might mistake a genuine alarm of fire for a bogus one and refuse to hurry themselves  so mr downing had had to be content with day drill  the alarm bell hung in the archway leading into the school grounds the end of the rope when not in use was fastened to a hook halfway up the wall  mike as he raced over the cricket field made up his mind in a flash that his only chance of getting out of this tangle was to shake his pursuer off for a space of time long enough to enable him to get to the rope and tug it then the school would come out he would mix with them and in the subsequent confusion get back to bed unnoticed  the task was easier than it would have seemed at the beginning of the chase mr downing owing to the two facts that he was not in the strictest training and that it is only an alfred shrubb who can run for any length of time at top speed shouting who is that stop who is that stop was beginning to feel distressed there were bellows to mend in the downing camp mike perceived this and forced the pace he rounded the pavilion ten yards to the good then heading for the gate he put all he knew into one last sprint mr downing was not equal to the effort he worked gamely for a few strides then fell behind when mike reached the gate a good forty yards separated them  as far as mike could judgehe was not in a condition to make nice calculationshe had about four seconds in which to get busy with that bell rope  probably nobody has ever crammed more energetic work into four seconds than he did then  the night was as still as only an english summer night can be and the first clang of the clapper sounded like a million iron girders falling from a height on to a sheet of tin he tugged away furiously with an eye on the now rapidly advancing and loudly shouting figure of the housemaster  and from the darkened house beyond there came a gradually swelling hum as if a vast hive of bees had been disturbed  the school was awake     chapter xlvi  the decoration of sammy   smith leaned against the mantelpiece in the senior dayroom at outwoodssince mikes innings against downings the lost lambs had been received as brothers by that centre of disorder so that even spiller was compelled to look on the hatchet as buriedand gave his views on the events of the preceding night or rather of that morning for it was nearer one than twelve when peace had once more fallen on the school  nothing that happens in this lunybin said psmith has power to surprise me now there was a time when i might have thought it a little unusual to have to leave the house through a canvas shoot at one oclock in the morning but i suppose its quite the regular thing here old school tradition c men leave the school and find that theyve got so accustomed to jumping out of window that they look on it as a sort of affectation to go out by the door i suppose none of you merchants can give me any idea when the next knockabout entertainment of this kind is likely to take place  i wonder who rang that bell said stone jolly sporting idea  i believe it was downing himself if it was i hope hes satisfied  jellicoe who was appearing in society supported by a stick looked meaningly at mike and giggled receiving in answer a stony stare mike had informed jellicoe of the details of his interview with mr barley at the white boar and jellicoe after a momentary splutter of wrath against the practical joker was now in a particularly lighthearted mood he hobbled about giggling at nothing and at peace with all the world  it was a stirring scene said psmith the agility with which comrade jellicoe boosted himself down the shoot was a triumph of mind over matter he seemed to forget his ankle it was the nearest thing to a boneless acrobatic wonder that i have ever seen  i was in a beastly funk i can tell you  stone gurgled  so was i he said for a bit then when i saw that it was all a rag i began to look about for ways of doing the thing really well i emptied about six jugs of water on a gang of kids under my window  i rushed into downings and ragged some of the beds said robinson  it was an invigorating time said psmith a sort of pageant i was particularly struck with the way some of the bright lads caught hold of the idea there was no skimping some of the kids to my certain knowledge went down the shoot a dozen times theres nothing like doing a thing thoroughly i saw them come down rush upstairs and be saved again time after time the thing became chronic with them i should say comrade downing ought to be satisfied with the high state of efficiency to which he has brought us at any rate i hope  there was a sound of hurried footsteps outside the door and sharpe a member of the senior dayroom burst excitedly in he seemed amused  i say have you chaps seen sammy  seen who said stone sammy why  youll know in a second hes just outside here sammy sammy sammy sam sam  a bark and a patter of feet outside  come on sammy good dog  there was a moments silence then a great yell of laughter burst forth even psmiths massive calm was shattered as for jellicoe he sobbed in a corner  sammys beautiful white coat was almost entirely concealed by a thick covering of bright red paint his head with the exception of the ears was untouched and his serious friendly eyes seemed to emphasise the weirdness of his appearance he stood in the doorway barking and wagging his tail plainly puzzled at his reception he was a popular dog and was always well received when he visited any of the houses but he had never before met with enthusiasm like this  good old sammy  what on earths been happening to him  who did it  sharpe the introducer had no views on the matter  i found him outside downings with a crowd round him everybody seems to have seen him i wonder who on earth has gone and mucked him up like that  mike was the first to show any sympathy for the maltreated animal  poor old sammy he said kneeling on the floor beside the victim and scratching him under the ear what a beastly shame itll take hours to wash all that off him and hell hate it  it seems to me said psmith regarding sammy dispassionately through his eyeglass that its not a case for mere washing theyll either have to skin him bodily or leave the thing to time time the great healer in a year or two hell fade to a delicate pink i dont see why you shouldnt have a pink bullterrier it would lend a touch of distinction to the place crowds would come in excursion trains to see him by charging a small fee you might make him selfsupporting i think ill suggest it to comrade downing  therell be a row about this said stone  rows are rather sport when youre not mixed up in them said robinson philosophically therell be another if we dont start off for chapel soon its a quarter to  there was a general move mike was the last to leave the room as he was going jellicoe stopped him jellicoe was staying in that sunday owing to his ankle  i say said jellicoe i just wanted to thank you again about that  oh thats all right  no but it really was awfully decent of you you might have got into a frightful row were you nearly caught  jolly nearly  it was you who rang the bell wasnt it  yes it was but for goodness sake dont go gassing about it or somebody will get to hear who oughtnt to and i shall be sacked  all right but i say you are a chap  whats the matter now  i mean about sammy you know its a jolly good score off old downing hell be frightfully sick  sammy cried mike my good man you dont think i did that do you what absolute rot i never touched the poor brute  oh all right said jellicoe but i wasnt going to tell any one of course  what do you mean  you are a chap giggled jellicoe  mike walked to chapel rather thoughtfully     chapter xlvii  mr downing on the scent   there was just one moment the moment in which on going down to the junior dayroom of his house to quell an unseemly disturbance he was boisterously greeted by a vermilion bull terrier when mr downing was seized with a hideous fear lest he had lost his senses glaring down at the crimson animal that was pawing at his knees he clutched at his reason for one second as a drowning man clutches at a lifebelt  then the happy laughter of the young onlookers reassured him  who he shouted who has done this  illustration who he shouted who has done this  please sir we dont know shrilled the chorus  please sir he came in like that  please sir we were sitting here when he suddenly ran in all red  a voice from the crowd look at old sammy  the situation was impossible there was nothing to be done he could not find out by verbal inquiry who had painted the dog the possibility of sammy being painted red during the night had never occurred to mr downing and now that the thing had happened he had no scheme of action as psmith would have said he had confused the unusual with the impossible and the result was that he was taken by surprise  while he was pondering on this the situation was rendered still more difficult by sammy who taking advantage of the door being open escaped and rushed into the road thus publishing his condition to all and sundry you can hush up a painted dog while it confines itself to your own premises but once it has mixed with the great public this becomes out of the question sammys state advanced from a private trouble into a row mr downings next move was in the same direction that sammy had taken only instead of running about the road he went straight to the headmaster  the head who had had to leave his house in the small hours in his pyjamas and a dressinggown was not in the best of tempers he had a cold in the head and also a rooted conviction that mr downing in spite of his strict orders had rung the bell himself on the previous night in order to test the efficiency of the school in saving themselves in the event of fire he received the housemaster frostily but thawed as the latter related the events which had led up to the ringing of the bell  dear me he said deeply interested one of the boys at the school you think  i am certain of it said mr downing  was he wearing a school cap  he was bareheaded a boy who breaks out of his house at night would hardly run the risk of wearing a distinguishing cap  no no i suppose not a big boy you say  very big  you did not see his face  it was dark and he never looked backhe was in front of me all the time  dear me  there is another matter  yes  this boy whoever he was had done something before he rang the bellhe had painted my dog sampson red  the headmasters eyes protruded from their sockets hehewhat mr downing  he painted my dog redbright red mr downing was too angry to see anything humorous in the incident since the previous night he had been wounded in his tenderest feelings his fire brigade system had been most shamefully abused by being turned into a mere instrument in the hands of a malefactor for escaping justice and his dog had been held up to ridicule to all the world he did not want to smile he wanted revenge  the headmaster on the other hand did want to smile it was not his dog he could look on the affair with an unbiased eye and to him there was something ludicrous in a white dog suddenly appearing as a red dog  it is a scandalous thing said mr downing  quite so quite so said the headmaster hastily i shall punish the boy who did it most severely i will speak to the school in the hall after chapel  which he did but without result a cordial invitation to the criminal to come forward and be executed was received in wooden silence by the school with the exception of johnson iii of outwoods who suddenly reminded of sammys appearance by the headmasters words broke into a wild screech of laughter and was instantly awarded two hundred lines  the school filed out of the hall to their various lunches and mr downing was left with the conviction that if he wanted the criminal discovered he would have to discover him for himself  the great thing in affairs of this kind is to get a good start and fate feeling perhaps that it had been a little hard upon mr downing gave him a most magnificent start instead of having to hunt for a needle in a haystack he found himself in a moment in the position of being set to find it in a mere truss of straw  it was mr outwood who helped him sergeant collard had waylaid the archaeological expert on his way to chapel and informed him that at close on twelve the night before he had observed a youth unidentified attempting to get into his house via the waterpipe mr outwood whose thoughts were occupied with apses and plinths not to mention cromlechs at the time thanked the sergeant with absentminded politeness and passed on later he remembered the fact à propos of some reflections on the subject of burglars in mediaeval england and passed it on to mr downing as they walked back to lunch  then the boy was in your house exclaimed mr downing  not actually in as far as i understand i gather from the sergeant that he interrupted him before  i mean he must have been one of the boys in your house  but what was he doing out at that hour  he had broken out  impossible i think oh yes quite impossible i went round the dormitories as usual at eleven oclock last night and all the boys were asleepall of them  mr downing was not listening he was in a state of suppressed excitement and exultation which made it hard for him to attend to his colleagues slow utterances he had a clue now that the search had narrowed itself down to outwoods house the rest was comparatively easy perhaps sergeant collard had actually recognised the boy or reflection he dismissed this as unlikely for the sergeant would scarcely have kept a thing like that to himself but he might very well have seen more of him than he downing had seen it was only with an effort that he could keep himself from rushing to the sergeant then and there and leaving the house lunch to look after itself he resolved to go the moment that meal was at an end  sunday lunch at a publicschool house is probably one of the longest functions in existence it drags its slow length along like a languid snake but it finishes in time in due course mr downing after sitting still and eyeing with acute dislike everybody who asked for a second helping found himself at liberty  regardless of the claims of digestion he rushed forth on the trail                                       sergeant collard lived with his wife and a family of unknown dimensions in the lodge at the school front gate dinner was just over when mr downing arrived as a blind man could have told  the sergeant received his visitor with dignity ejecting the family who were torpid after roast beef and resented having to move in order to ensure privacy  having requested his host to smoke which the latter was about to do unasked mr downing stated his case  mr outwood he said tells me that last night sergeant you saw a boy endeavouring to enter his house  the sergeant blew a cloud of smoke oooooo yer he said i did sirspotted im i did feeflee good at spottin i am sir dook of connaught he used to say ere comes sergeant collard he used to say es feeflee good at spottin  what did you do  do oooooo i shouts oooooo yer yer young monkey what yer doin there  yes  but e was off in a flash and i doubles after im prompt  but you didnt catch him  no sir admitted the sergeant reluctantly  did you catch sight of his face sergeant  no sir e was doublin away in the opposite direction  did you notice anything at all about his appearance  e was a long young chap sir with a pair of legs on himfeeflee fast e run sir oooooo feeflee  you noticed nothing else  e wasnt wearing no cap of any sort sir  ah  bareeaded sir added the sergeant rubbing the point in  it was undoubtedly the same boy undoubtedly i wish you could have caught a glimpse of his face sergeant  so do i sir  you would not be able to recognise him again if you saw him you think  oooooo wouldnt go so far as to say that sir cos yer see im feeflee good at spottin but it was a dark night  mr downing rose to go  well he said the search is now considerably narrowed down considerably it is certain that the boy was one of the boys in mr outwoods house  young monkeys interjected the sergeant helpfully  goodafternoon sergeant  goodafternoon to you sir  pray do not move sergeant  the sergeant had not shown the slightest inclination of doing anything of the kind  i will find my way out very hot today is it not  feeflee warm sir weathers goin to breakworkin up for thunder  i hope not the school plays the mcc on wednesday and it would be a pity if rain were to spoil our first fixture with them good afternoon  and mr downing went out into the baking sunlight while sergeant collard having requested mrs collard to take the children out for a walk at once and furthermore to give young ernie a clip side of the ead if he persisted in making so much noise put a handkerchief over his face rested his feet on the table and slept the sleep of the just     chapter xlviii  the sleuthhound   for the doctor watsons of this world as opposed to the sherlock holmeses success in the province of detective work must always be to a very large extent the result of luck sherlock holmes can extract a clue from a wisp of straw or a flake of cigarash but doctor watson has got to have it taken out for him and dusted and exhibited clearly with a label attached  the average man is a doctor watson we are wont to scoff in a patronising manner at that humble follower of the great investigator but as a matter of fact we should have been just as dull ourselves we should not even have risen to the modest level of a scotland yard bungler we should simply have hung around saying  my dear holmes how and all the rest of it just as the downtrodden medico did  it is not often that the ordinary person has any need to see what he can do in the way of detection he gets along very comfortably in the humdrum round of life without having to measure footprints and smile quiet tightlipped smiles but if ever the emergency does arise he thinks naturally of sherlock holmes and his methods  mr downing had read all the holmes stories with great attention and had thought many times what an incompetent ass doctor watson was but now that he had started to handle his own first case he was compelled to admit that there was a good deal to be said in extenuation of watsons inability to unravel tangles it certainly was uncommonly hard he thought as he paced the cricket field after leaving sergeant collard to detect anybody unless you knew who had really done the crime as he brooded over the case in hand his sympathy for dr watson increased with every minute and he began to feel a certain resentment against sir arthur conan doyle it was all very well for sir arthur to be so shrewd and infallible about tracing a mystery to its source but he knew perfectly well who had done the thing before he started  now that he began really to look into this matter of the alarm bell and the painting of sammy the conviction was creeping over him that the problem was more difficult than a casual observer might imagine he had got as far as finding that his quarry of the previous night was a boy in mr outwoods house but how was he to get any farther that was the thing there were of course only a limited number of boys in mr outwoods house as tall as the one he had pursued but even if there had been only one other it would have complicated matters if you go to a boy and say either you or jones were out of your house last night at twelve oclock the boy does not reply sir i cannot tell a liei was out of my house last night at twelve oclock he simply assumes the animated expression of a stuffed fish and leaves the next move to you it is practically stalemate  all these things passed through mr downings mind as he walked up and down the cricket field that afternoon  what he wanted was a clue but it is so hard for the novice to tell what is a clue and what isnt probably if he only knew there were clues lying all over the place shouting to him to pick them up  what with the oppressive heat of the day and the fatigue of hard thinking mr downing was working up for a brainstorm when fate once more intervened this time in the shape of riglett a junior member of his house  riglett slunk up in the shamefaced way peculiar to some boys even when they have done nothing wrong and having capped mr downing with the air of one who has been caught in the act of doing something particularly shady requested that he might be allowed to fetch his bicycle from the shed  your bicycle snapped mr downing much thinking had made him irritable what do you want with your bicycle  riglett shuffled stood first on his left foot then on his right blushed and finally remarked as if it were not so much a sound reason as a sort of feeble excuse for the low and blackguardly fact that he wanted his bicycle that he had got leave for tea that afternoon  then mr downing remembered riglett had an aunt resident about three miles from the school whom he was accustomed to visit occasionally on sunday afternoons during the term  he felt for his bunch of keys and made his way to the shed riglett shambling behind at an interval of two yards  mr downing unlocked the door and there on the floor was the clue  a clue that even dr watson could not have overlooked  mr downing saw it but did not immediately recognise it for what it was what he saw at first was not a clue but just a mess he had a tidy soul and abhorred messes and this was a particularly messy mess the greater part of the flooring in the neighbourhood of the door was a sea of red paint the tin from which it had flowed was lying on its side in the middle of the shed the air was full of the pungent scent  pah said mr downing  then suddenly beneath the disguise of the mess he saw the clue a footmark no less a crimson footmark on the grey concrete  riglett who had been waiting patiently two yards away now coughed plaintively the sound recalled mr downing to mundane matters  get your bicycle riglett he said and be careful where you tread somebody has upset a pot of paint on the floor  riglett walking delicately through dry places extracted his bicycle from the rack and presently departed to gladden the heart of his aunt leaving mr downing his brain fizzing with the enthusiasm of the detective to lock the door and resume his perambulation of the cricket field  give dr watson a fair start and he is a demon at the game mr downings brain was now working with a rapidity and clearness which a professional sleuth might have envied  paint red paint obviously the same paint with which sammy had been decorated a footmark whose footmark plainly that of the criminal who had done the deed of decoration  yoicks  there were two things however to be considered your careful detective must consider everything in the first place the paint might have been upset by the groundman it was the groundmans paint he had been giving a fresh coating to the woodwork in front of the pavilion scoringbox at the conclusion of yesterdays match a labour of love which was the direct outcome of the enthusiasm for work which adair had instilled into him in that case the footmark might be his  note one interview the groundman on this point  in the second place adair might have upset the tin and trodden in its contents when he went to get his bicycle in order to fetch the doctor for the suffering macphee this was the more probable of the two contingencies for it would have been dark in the shed when adair went into it  note two interview adair as to whether he found on returning to the house that there was paint on his boots  things were moving                                       he resolved to take adair first he could get the groundmans address from him  passing by the trees under whose shade mike and psmith and dunster had watched the match on the previous day he came upon the head of his house in a deckchair reading a book a summer sunday afternoon is the time for reading in deckchairs  oh adair he said no dont get up i merely wished to ask you if you found any paint on your boots when you returned to the house last night  paint sir adair was plainly puzzled his book had been interesting and had driven the sammy incident out of his head  i see somebody has spilt some paint on the floor of the bicycle shed you did not do that i suppose when you went to fetch your bicycle  no sir  it is spilt all over the floor i wondered whether you had happened to tread in it but you say you found no paint on your boots this morning  no sir my bicycle is always quite near the door of the shed i didnt go into the shed at all  i see quite so thank you adair oh by the way adair where does markby live  i forget the name of his cottage sir but i could show you in a second its one of those cottages just past the school gates on the right as you turn out into the road there are three in a row his is the first you come to theres a barn just before you get to them  thank you i shall be able to find them i should like to speak to markby for a moment on a small matter  a sharp walk took him to the cottages adair had mentioned he rapped at the door of the first and the groundman came out in his shirtsleeves blinking as if he had just woke up as was indeed the case  oh markby  sir  you remember that you were painting the scoringbox in the pavilion last night after the match  yes sir it wanted a lick of paint bad the young gentlemen will scramble about and get through the window makes it look shabby sir so i thought id better give it a coating so as to look shipshape when the marylebone come down  just so an excellent idea tell me markby what did you do with the pot of paint when you had finished  put it in the bicycle shed sir  on the floor  on the floor sir no on the shelf at the far end with the can of whitening what i use for marking out the wickets sir  of course yes quite so just as i thought  do you want it sir  no thank you markby no thank you the fact is somebody who had no business to do so has moved the pot of paint from the shelf to the floor with the result that it has been kicked over and spilt you had better get some more tomorrow thank you markby that is all i wished to know  mr downing walked back to the school thoroughly excited he was hot on the scent now the only other possible theories had been tested and successfully exploded the thing had become simple to a degree all he had to do was to go to mr outwoods housethe idea of searching a fellowmasters house did not appear to him at all a delicate task somehow one grew unconsciously to feel that mr outwood did not really exist as a man capable of resenting libertiesfind the paintsplashed boot ascertain its owner and denounce him to the headmaster picture blue fire and god save the king by the full strength of the company there could be no doubt that a paintsplashed boot must be in mr outwoods house somewhere a boy cannot tread in a pool of paint without showing some signs of having done so it was sunday too so that the boot would not yet have been cleaned yoicks also tallyho this really was beginning to be something like business  regardless of the heat the sleuthhound hurried across to outwoods as fast as he could walk     chapter xlix  a check   the only two members of the house not out in the grounds when he arrived were mike and psmith they were standing on the gravel drive in front of the boys entrance mike had a deckchair in one hand and a book in the other psmithfor even the greatest minds will sometimes unbendwas playing diabolo that is to say he was trying without success to raise the spool from the ground  theres a kid in france said mike disparagingly as the bobbin rolled off the string for the fourth time who can do it three thousand seven hundred and something times  psmith smoothed a crease out of his waistcoat and tried again he had just succeeded in getting the thing to spin when mr downing arrived the sound of his footsteps disturbed psmith and brought the effort to nothing  enough of this spoolery said he flinging the sticks through the open window of the senior dayroom i was an ass ever to try it the philosophical mind needs complete repose in its hours of leisure hullo  he stared after the sleuthhound who had just entered the house  what the dickens said mike does he mean by barging in as if hed bought the place  comrade downing looks pleased with himself what brings him round in this direction i wonder still no matter the few articles which he may sneak from our study are of inconsiderable value he is welcome to them do you feel inclined to wait awhile till i have fetched a chair and book  ill be going on i shall be under the trees at the far end of the ground  tis well i will be with you in about two ticks  mike walked on towards the field and psmith strolling upstairs to fetch his novel found mr downing standing in the passage with the air of one who has lost his bearings  a warm afternoon sir murmured psmith courteously as he passed  ersmith  sir  ierwish to go round the dormitories  it was psmiths guiding rule in life never to be surprised at anything so he merely inclined his head gracefully and said nothing  i should be glad if you would fetch the keys and show me where the rooms are  with acute pleasure sir said psmith or shall i fetch mr outwood sir  do as i tell you smith snapped mr downing  psmith said no more but went down to the matrons room the matron being out he abstracted the bunch of keys from her table and rejoined the master  shall i lead the way sir he asked  mr downing nodded  here sir said psmith opening a door we have barnes dormitory an airy room constructed on the soundest hygienic principles each boy i understand has quite a considerable number of cubic feet of air all to himself it is mr outwoods boast that no boy has ever asked for a cubic foot of air in vain he argues justly  he broke off abruptly and began to watch the others manoeuvres in silence mr downing was peering rapidly beneath each bed in turn  are you looking for barnes sir inquired psmith politely i think hes out in the field  mr downing rose having examined the last bed crimson in the face with the exercise  show me the next dormitory smith he said panting slightly  this said psmith opening the next door and sinking his voice to an awed whisper is where i sleep  mr downing glanced swiftly beneath the three beds excuse me sir said psmith but are we chasing anything  be good enough smith said mr downing with asperity to keep your remarks to yourself  i was only wondering sir shall i show you the next in order  certainly  they moved on up the passage  drawing blank at the last dormitory mr downing paused baffled psmith waited patiently by an idea struck the master  the studies smith he cried  aha said psmith i beg your pardon sir the observation escaped me unawares the frenzy of the chase is beginning to enter into my blood here we have  mr downing stopped short  is this impertinence studied smith  fergusons study sir no sir thats further down the passage this is barnes  mr downing looked at him closely psmiths face was wooden in its gravity the master snorted suspiciously then moved on  whose is this he asked rapping a door  this sir is mine and jacksons  what have you a study you are low down in the school for it  i think sir that mr outwood gave it us rather as a testimonial to our general worth than to our proficiency in schoolwork  mr downing raked the room with a keen eye the absence of bars from the window attracted his attention  have you no bars to your windows here such as there are in my house  there appears to be no bar sir said psmith putting up his eyeglass  mr downing was leaning out of the window  a lovely view is it not sir said psmith the trees the field the distant hills  mr downing suddenly started his eye had been caught by the waterpipe at the side of the window the boy whom sergeant collard had seen climbing the pipe must have been making for this study  he spun round and met psmiths blandly inquiring gaze he looked at psmith carefully for a moment no the boy he had chased last night had not been psmith that exquisites figure and general appearance were unmistakable even in the dusk  whom did you say you shared this study with smith  jackson sir the cricketer  never mind about his cricket smith said mr downing with irritation  no sir  he is the only other occupant of the room  yes sir  nobody else comes into it  if they do they go out extremely quickly sir  ah thank you smith  not at all sir  mr downing pondered jackson the boy bore him a grudge the boy was precisely the sort of boy to revenge himself by painting the dog sammy and gadzooks the boy whom he had pursued last night had been just about jacksons size and build  mr downing was as firmly convinced at that moment that mikes had been the hand to wield the paintbrush as he had ever been of anything in his life  smith he said excitedly  on the spot sir said psmith affably  where are jacksons boots  there are moments when the giddy excitement of being right on the trail causes the amateur or watsonian detective to be incautious such a moment came to mr downing then if he had been wise he would have achieved his object the getting a glimpse of mikes boots by a devious and snaky route as it was he rushed straight on  his boots sir he has them on i noticed them as he went out just now  where is the pair he wore yesterday  where are the boots of yesteryear murmured psmith to himself i should say at a venture sir that they would be in the basket downstairs edmund our genial knifeandboot boy collects them i believe at early dawn  would they have been cleaned yet  if i know edmund sirno  smith said mr downing trembling with excitement go and bring that basket to me here  psmiths brain was working rapidly as he went downstairs what exactly was at the back of the sleuths mind prompting these manoeuvres he did not know but that there was something and that that something was directed in a hostile manner against mike probably in connection with last nights wild happenings he was certain psmith had noticed on leaving his bed at the sound of the alarm bell that he and jellicoe were alone in the room that might mean that mike had gone out through the door when the bell sounded or it might mean that he had been out all the time it began to look as if the latter solution were the correct one                                       he staggered back with the basket painfully conscious the while that it was creasing his waistcoat and dumped is down on the study floor mr downing stooped eagerly over it psmith leaned against the wall and straightened out the damaged garment  we have here sir he said a fair selection of our various bootings  mr downing looked up  you dropped none of the boots on your way up smith  not one sir it was a fine performance  mr downing uttered a grunt of satisfaction and bent once more to his task boots flew about the room mr downing knelt on the floor beside the basket and dug like a terrier at a rathole  at last he made a dive and with an exclamation of triumph rose to his feet in his hand he held a boot  put those back again smith he said  the exetonian wearing an expression such as a martyr might have worn on being told off for the stake began to pick up the scattered footgear whistling softly the tune of i do all the dirty work as he did so  thats the lot sir he said rising  ah now come across with me to the headmasters house leave the basket here you can carry it back when you return  shall i put back that boot sir  certainly not i shall take this with me of course  shall i carry it sir  mr downing reflected  yes smith he said i think it would be best  it occurred to him that the spectacle of a housemaster wandering abroad on the public highway carrying a dirty boot might be a trifle undignified you never knew whom you might meet on sunday afternoon  psmith took the boot and doing so understood what before had puzzled him  across the toe of the boot was a broad splash of red paint  he knew nothing of course of the upset tin in the bicycle shed but when a housemasters dog has been painted red in the night and when on the following day the housemaster goes about in search of a paintsplashed boot one puts two and two together psmith looked at the name inside the boot it was brown bootmaker bridgnorth bridgnorth was only a few miles from his own home and mikes undoubtedly it was mikes boot  can you tell me whose boot that is asked mr downing  psmith looked at it again  no sir i cant say the little chaps familiar to me  come with me then  mr downing left the room after a moment psmith followed him  the headmaster was in his garden thither mr downing made his way the bootbearing psmith in close attendance  the head listened to the amateur detectives statement with interest  indeed he said when mr downing had finished  indeed dear me it certainly seemsit is a curiously wellconnected thread of evidence you are certain that there was red paint on this boot you discovered in mr outwoods house  i have it with me i brought it on purpose to show to you smith  sir  you have the boot  ah said the headmaster putting on a pair of pincenez now let me look atthis you say is the just so just so just but er mr downing it may be that i have not examined this boot with sufficient care butcan you point out to me exactly where this paint is that you speak of  mr downing stood staring at the boot with a wild fixed stare of any suspicion of paint red or otherwise it was absolutely and entirely innocent     chapter l  the destroyer of evidence   the boot became the centre of attraction the cynosure of all eyes mr downing fixed it with the piercing stare of one who feels that his brain is tottering the headmaster looked at it with a mildly puzzled expression psmith putting up his eyeglass gazed at it with a sort of affectionate interest as if he were waiting for it to do a trick of some kind  mr downing was the first to break the silence  there was paint on this boot he said vehemently i tell you there was a splash of red paint across the toe smith will bear me out in this smith you saw the paint on this boot  paint sir  what do you mean to tell me that you did not see it  no sir there was no paint on this boot  this is foolery i saw it with my own eyes it was a broad splash right across the toe  the headmaster interposed  you must have made a mistake mr downing there is certainly no trace of paint on this boot these momentary optical delusions are i fancy not uncommon any doctor will tell you  i had an aunt sir said psmith chattily who was remarkably subject  it is absurd i cannot have been mistaken said mr downing i am positively certain the toe of this boot was red when i found it  it is undoubtedly black now mr downing  a sort of chameleon boot murmured psmith  the goaded housemaster turned on him  what did you say smith  did i speak sir said psmith with the start of one coming suddenly out of a trance  mr downing looked searchingly at him  you had better be careful smith  yes sir  i strongly suspect you of having something to do with this  really mr downing said the headmaster that is surely improbable smith could scarcely have cleaned the boot on his way to my house on one occasion i inadvertently spilt some paint on a shoe of my own i can assure you that it does not brush off it needs a very systematic cleaning before all traces are removed  exactly sir said psmith my theory if i may  certainly smith  psmith bowed courteously and proceeded  my theory sir is that mr downing was deceived by the light and shade effects on the toe of the boot the afternoon sun streaming in through the window must have shone on the boot in such a manner as to give it a momentary and fictitious aspect of redness if mr downing recollects he did not look long at the boot the picture on the retina of the eye consequently had not time to fade i remember thinking myself at the moment that the boot appeared to have a certain reddish tint the mistake  bah said mr downing shortly  well really said the headmaster it seems to me that that is the only explanation that will square with the facts a boot that is really smeared with red paint does not become black of itself in the course of a few minutes  you are very right sir said psmith with benevolent approval may i go now sir i am in the middle of a singularly impressive passage of ciceros speech de senectute  i am sorry that you should leave your preparation till sunday smith it is a habit of which i altogether disapprove  i am reading it sir said psmith with simple dignity for pleasure shall i take the boot with me sir  if mr downing does not want it  the housemaster passed the fraudulent piece of evidence to psmith without a word and the latter having included both masters in a kindly smile left the garden  pedestrians who had the good fortune to be passing along the road between the housemasters house and mr outwoods at that moment saw what if they had but known it was a most unusual sight the spectacle of psmith running psmiths usual mode of progression was a dignified walk he believed in the contemplative style rather than the hustling  on this occasion however reckless of possible injuries to the crease of his trousers he raced down the road and turning in at outwoods gate bounded upstairs like a highly trained professional athlete  on arriving at the study his first act was to remove a boot from the top of the pile in the basket place it in the small cupboard under the bookshelf and lock the cupboard then he flung himself into a chair and panted  brain he said to himself approvingly is what one chiefly needs in matters of this kind without brain where are we in the soup every time the next development will be when comrade downing thinks it over and is struck with the brilliant idea that its just possible that the boot he gave me to carry and the boot i did carry were not one boot but two boots meanwhile  he dragged up another chair for his feet and picked up his novel  he had not been reading long when there was a footstep in the passage and mr downing appeared  the possibility in fact the probability of psmith having substituted another boot for the one with the incriminating splash of paint on it had occurred to him almost immediately on leaving the headmasters garden psmith and mike he reflected were friends psmiths impulse would be to do all that lay in his power to shield mike feeling aggrieved with himself that he had not thought of this before he too hurried over to outwoods  mr downing was brisk and peremptory  i wish to look at these boots again he said psmith with a sigh laid down his novel and rose to assist him  sit down smith said the housemaster i can manage without your help  psmith sat down again carefully tucking up the knees of his trousers and watched him with silent interest through his eyeglass  the scrutiny irritated mr downing  put that thing away smith he said  that thing sir  yes that ridiculous glass put it away  why sir  why because i tell you to do so  i guessed that that was the reason sir sighed psmith replacing the eyeglass in his waistcoat pocket he rested his elbows on his knees and his chin on his hands and resumed his contemplative inspection of the bootexpert who after fidgeting for a few moments lodged another complaint  dont sit there staring at me smith  i was interested in what you were doing sir  never mind dont stare at me in that idiotic way  may i read sir asked psmith patiently  yes read if you like  thank you sir  psmith took up his book again and mr downing now thoroughly irritated pursued his investigations in the bootbasket  he went through it twice but each time without success after the second search he stood up and looked wildly round the room he was as certain as he could be of anything that the missing piece of evidence was somewhere in the study it was no use asking psmith pointblank where it was for psmiths ability to parry dangerous questions with evasive answers was quite out of the common  his eye roamed about the room there was very little cover there even for so small a fugitive as a number nine boot the floor could be acquitted on sight of harbouring the quarry  then he caught sight of the cupboard and something seemed to tell him that there was the place to look  smith he said  psmith had been reading placidly all the while  yes sir  what is in this cupboard  that cupboard sir  yes this cupboard mr downing rapped the door irritably  just a few odd trifles sir we do not often use it a ball of string perhaps possibly an old notebook nothing of value or interest  open it  i think you will find that it is locked sir  unlock it  but where is the key sir  have you not got the key  if the key is not in the lock sir you may depend upon it that it will take a long search to find it  where did you see it last  it was in the lock yesterday morning jackson might have taken it  where is jackson  out in the field somewhere sir  mr downing thought for a moment  i dont believe a word of it he said shortly i have my reasons for thinking that you are deliberately keeping the contents of that cupboard from me i shall break open the door  psmith got up  im afraid you mustnt do that sir  mr downing stared amazed  are you aware whom you are talking to smith he inquired acidly  yes sir and i know its not mr outwood to whom that cupboard happens to belong if you wish to break it open you must get his permission he is the sole lessee and proprietor of that cupboard i am only the acting manager  mr downing paused he also reflected mr outwood in the general rule did not count much in the scheme of things but possibly there were limits to the treating of him as if he did not exist to enter his house without his permission and search it to a certain extent was all very well but when it came to breaking up his furniture perhaps  on the other hand there was the maddening thought that if he left the study in search of mr outwood in order to obtain his sanction for the housebreaking work which he proposed to carry through smith would be alone in the room and he knew that if smith were left alone in the room he would instantly remove the boot to some other hidingplace he thoroughly disbelieved the story of the lost key he was perfectly convinced that the missing boot was in the cupboard  he stood chewing these thoughts for awhile psmith in the meantime standing in a graceful attitude in front of the cupboard staring into vacancy  then he was seized with a happy idea why should he leave the room at all if he sent smith then he himself could wait and make certain that the cupboard was not tampered with  smith he said go and find mr outwood and ask him to be good enough to come here for a moment     chapter li  mainly about boots   be quick smith he said as the latter stood looking at him without making any movement in the direction of the door  quick sir said psmith meditatively as if he had been asked a conundrum  go and find mr outwood at once  psmith still made no move  do you intend to disobey me smith mr downings voice was steely  yes sir  what  yes sir  there was one of those youcouldhaveheardapindrop silences psmith was staring reflectively at the ceiling mr downing was looking as if at any moment he might say thwarted to me face ha ha and by a very stripling  it was psmith however who resumed the conversation his manner was almost too respectful which made it all the more a pity that what he said did not keep up the standard of docility  i take my stand he said on a technical point i say to myself mr downing is a man i admire as a human being and respect as a master in  this impertinence is doing you no good smith  psmith waved a hand deprecatingly  if you will let me explain sir i was about to say that in any other place but mr outwoods house your word would be law i would fly to do your bidding if you pressed a button i would do the rest but in mr outwoods house i cannot do anything except what pleases me or what is ordered by mr outwood i ought to have remembered that before one cannot he continued as who should say let us be reasonable one cannot to take a parallel case imagine the colonel commanding the garrison at a naval station going on board a battleship and ordering the crew to splice the jibboom spanker it might be an admirable thing for the empire that the jibboom spanker should be spliced at that particular juncture but the crew would naturally decline to move in the matter until the order came from the commander of the ship so in my case if you will go to mr outwood and explain to him how matters stand and come back and say to me psmith mr outwood wishes you to ask him to be good enough to come to this study then i shall be only too glad to go and find him you see my difficulty sir  go and fetch mr outwood smith i shall not tell you again  psmith flicked a speck of dust from his coatsleeve  very well smith  i can assure you sir at any rate that if there is a boot in that cupboard now there will be a boot there when you return  mr downing stalked out of the room  but added psmith pensively to himself as the footsteps died away i did not promise that it would be the same boot  he took the key from his pocket unlocked the cupboard and took out the boot then he selected from the basket a particularly battered specimen placing this in the cupboard he relocked the door  his next act was to take from the shelf a piece of string attaching one end of this to the boot that he had taken from the cupboard he went to the window his first act was to fling the cupboardkey out into the bushes then he turned to the boot on a level with the sill the waterpipe up which mike had started to climb the night before was fastened to the wall by an iron band he tied the other end of the string to this and let the boot swing free he noticed with approval when it had stopped swinging that it was hidden from above by the windowsill  he returned to his place at the mantelpiece  as an afterthought he took another boot from the basket and thrust it up the chimney a shower of soot fell into the grate blackening his hand  the bathroom was a few yards down the corridor he went there and washed off the soot  when he returned mr downing was in the study and with him mr outwood the latter looking dazed as if he were not quite equal to the intellectual pressure of the situation  where have you been smith asked mr downing sharply  i have been washing my hands sir  hm said mr downing suspiciously  yes i saw smith go into the bathroom said mr outwood smith i cannot quite understand what it is mr downing wishes me to do  my dear outwood snapped the sleuth i thought i had made it perfectly clear where is the difficulty  i cannot understand why you should suspect smith of keeping his boots in a cupboard and added mr outwood with spirit catching sight of a goodgracioushasthemannosense look on the others face why he should not do so if he wishes it  exactly sir said psmith approvingly you have touched the spot  if i must explain again my dear outwood will you kindly give me your attention for a moment last night a boy broke out of your house and painted my dog sampson red  he painted said mr outwood roundeyed why  i dont know why at any rate he did during the escapade one of his boots was splashed with the paint it is that boot which i believe smith to be concealing in this cupboard now do you understand  mr outwood looked amazedly at smith and psmith shook his head sorrowfully at mr outwood psmitha expression said as plainly as if he had spoken the words we must humour him  so with your permission as smith declares that he has lost the key i propose to break open the door of this cupboard have you any objection  mr outwood started  objection none at all my dear fellow none at all let me see what is it you wish to do  this said mr downing shortly  there was a pair of dumbbells on the floor belonging to mike he never used them but they always managed to get themselves packed with the rest of his belongings on the last day of the holidays mr downing seized one of these and delivered two rapid blows at the cupboarddoor the wood splintered a third blow smashed the flimsy lock the cupboard with any skeletons it might contain was open for all to view  mr downing uttered a cry of triumph and tore the boot from its restingplace  i told you he said i told you  i wondered where that boot had got to said psmith ive been looking for it for days  mr downing was examining his find he looked up with an exclamation of surprise and wrath  this boot has no paint on it he said glaring at psmith this is not the boot  it certainly appears sir said psmith sympathetically to be free from paint theres a sort of reddish glow just there if you look at it sideways he added helpfully  did you place that boot there smith  i must have done then when i lost the key  are you satisfied now downing interrupted mr outwood with asperity or is there any more furniture you wish to break  the excitement of seeing his household goods smashed with a dumbbell had made the archaeological student quite a swashbuckler for the moment a little more and one could imagine him giving mr downing a good hard knock  the sleuthhound stood still for a moment baffled but his brain was working with the rapidity of a buzzsaw a chance remark of mr outwoods set him fizzing off on the trail once more mr outwood had caught sight of the little pile of soot in the grate he bent down to inspect it  dear me he said i must remember to have the chimneys swept it should have been done before  mr downings eye rolling in a fine frenzy from heaven to earth from earth to heaven also focussed itself on the pile of soot and a thrill went through him soot in the fireplace smith washing his hands you know my methods my dear watson apply them  mr downings mind at that moment contained one single thought and that thought was what ho for the chimney  he dived forward with a rush nearly knocking mr outwood off his feet and thrust an arm up into the unknown an avalanche of soot fell upon his hand and wrist but he ignored it for at the same instant his fingers had closed upon what he was seeking  ah he said i thought as much you were not quite clever enough after all smith  no sir said psmith patiently we all make mistakes  you would have done better smith not to have given me all this trouble you have done yourself no good by it  its been great fun though sir argued psmith  fun mr downing laughed grimly you may have reason to change your opinion of what constitutes  his voice failed as his eye fell on the allblack toe of the boot he looked up and caught psmiths benevolent gaze he straightened himself and brushed a bead of perspiration from his face with the back of his hand unfortunately he used the sooty hand and the result was like some gruesome burlesque of a nigger minstrel  didyouputthatbootthere smith he asked slowly  illustration didyouputthatbootthere smith  yes sir  then what did you mean by putting it there roared mr downing  animal spirits sir said psmith  what  animal spirits sir  what mr downing would have replied to this one cannot tell though one can guess roughly for just as he was opening his mouth mr outwood catching sight of his chirgwinlike countenance intervened  my dear downing he said your face it is positively covered with soot positively you must come and wash it you are quite black really you present a most curious appearance most let me show you the way to my room  in all times of storm and tribulation there comes a breakingpoint a point where the spirit definitely refuses to battle any longer against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune mr downing could not bear up against this crowning blow he went down beneath it in the language of the ring he took the count it was the knockout  soot he murmured weakly soot  your face is covered my dear fellow quite covered  it certainly has a faintly sooty aspect sir said psmith  his voice roused the sufferer to one last flicker of spirit  you will hear more of this smith he said i say you will hear more of it  then he allowed mr outwood to lead him out to a place where there were towels soap and sponges                                       when they had gone psmith went to the window and hauled in the string he felt the calm afterglow which comes to the general after a successfully conducted battle it had been trying of course for a man of refinement and it had cut into his afternoon but on the whole it had been worth it  the problem now was what to do with the painted boot it would take a lot of cleaning he saw even if he could get hold of the necessary implements for cleaning it and he rather doubted if he would be able to do so edmund the bootboy worked in some mysterious cell far from the madding crowd at the back of the house in the bootcupboard downstairs there would probably be nothing likely to be of any use  his fears were realised the bootcupboard was empty it seemed to him that for the time being the best thing he could do would be to place the boot in safe hiding until he should have thought out a scheme  having restored the basket to its proper place accordingly he went up to the study again and placed the redtoed boot in the chimney at about the same height where mr downing had found the other nobody would think of looking there a second time and it was improbable that mr outwood really would have the chimneys swept as he had said the odds were that he had forgotten about it already  psmith went to the bathroom to wash his hands again with the feeling that he had done a good days work     chapter lii  on the trail again   the most massive minds are apt to forget things at times the most adroit plotters make their little mistakes psmith was no exception to the rule he made the mistake of not telling mike of the afternoons happenings  it was not altogether forgetfulness psmith was one of those people who like to carry through their operations entirely by themselves where there is only one in a secret the secret is more liable to remain unrevealed there was nothing he thought to be gained from telling mike he forgot what the consequences might be if he did not  so psmith kept his own counsel with the result that mike went over to school on the monday morning in pumps  edmund summoned from the hinterland of the house to give his opinion why only one of mikes boots was to be found had no views on the subject he seemed to look on it as one of those things which no fellow can understand  eres one of em mr jackson he said as if he hoped that mike might be satisfied with a compromise  one whats the good of that edmund you chump i cant go over to school in one boot  edmund turned this over in his mind and then said no sir as much as to say i may have lost a boot but thank goodness i can still understand sound reasoning  well what am i to do where is the other boot  dont know mr jackson replied edmund to both questions  well i meanoh dash it theres the bell  and mike sprinted off in the pumps he stood in  it is only a deviation from those ordinary rules of school life which one observes naturally and without thinking that enables one to realise how strong publicschool prejudices really are at a school for instance where the regulations say that coats only of black or dark blue are to be worn a boy who appears one day in even the most respectable and unostentatious brown finds himself looked on with a mixture of awe and repulsion which would be excessive if he had sandbagged the headmaster so in the case of boots school rules decree that a boy shall go to his formroom in boots there is no real reason why if the day is fine he should not wear shoes should he prefer them but if he does the thing creates a perfect sensation boys say great scott what have you got on masters say jones what are you wearing on your feet in the few minutes which elapse between the assembling of the form for callover and the arrival of the formmaster some wag is sure either to stamp on the shoes accompanying the act with some satirical remark or else to pull one of them off and inaugurate an impromptu game of football with it there was once a boy who went to school one morning in elasticsided boots  mike had always been coldly distant in his relations to the rest of his form looking on them with a few exceptions as worms and the form since his innings against downings on the friday had regarded mike with respect so that he escaped the ragging he would have had to undergo at wrykyn in similar circumstances it was only mr downing who gave trouble  there is a sort of instinct which enables some masters to tell when a boy in their form is wearing shoes instead of boots just as people who dislike cats always know when one is in a room with them they cannot see it but they feel it in their bones  mr downing was perhaps the most bigoted antishoeist in the whole list of english schoolmasters he waged war remorselessly against shoes satire abuse lines detentionevery weapon was employed by him in dealing with their wearers it had been the late dunsters practice always to go over to school in shoes when as he usually did he felt shaky in the mornings lesson mr downing always detected him in the first five minutes and that meant a lecture of anything from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour on untidy habits and boys who looked like loaferswhich broke the back of the mornings work nicely on one occasion when a particularly tricky bit of livy was on the bill of fare dunster had entered the formroom in heelless turkish bathslippers of a vivid crimson and the subsequent proceedings including his journey over to the house to change the heelless atrocities had seen him through very nearly to the quarter to eleven interval  mike accordingly had not been in his place for three minutes when mr downing stiffening like a pointer called his name  yes sir said mike  what are you wearing on your feet jackson  pumps sir  you are wearing pumps are you not aware that pumps are not the proper things to come to school in why are you wearing pumps  the form leaning back against the next row of desks settled itself comfortably for the address from the throne  i have lost one of my boots sir  a kind of gulp escaped from mr downings lips he stared at mike for a moment in silence then turning to stone he told him to start translating  stone who had been expecting at least ten minutes respite was taken unawares when he found the place in his book and began to construe he floundered hopelessly but to his growing surprise and satisfaction the formmaster appeared to notice nothing wrong he said yes yes mechanically and finally that will do whereupon stone resumed his seat with the feeling that the age of miracles had returned  mr downings mind was in a whirl his case was complete mikes appearance in shoes with the explanation that he had lost a boot completed the chain as columbus must have felt when his ship ran into harbour and the first american interviewer jumping on board said wal sir and what are your impressions of our glorious country so did mr downing feel at that moment  when the bell rang at a quarter to eleven he gathered up his gown and sped to the headmaster     chapter liii  the kettle method   it was during the interval that day that stone and robinson discussing the subject of cricket over a bun and gingerbeer at the school shop came to a momentous decision to wit that they were fed up with adair administration and meant to strike the immediate cause of revolt was earlymorning fieldingpractice that searching test of cricket keenness mike himself to whom cricket was the great and serious interest of life had shirked earlymorning fieldingpractice in his first term at wrykyn and stone and robinson had but a lukewarm attachment to the game compared with mikes  as a rule adair had contented himself with practice in the afternoon after school which nobody objects to and no strain consequently had been put upon stones and robinsons allegiance in view of the mcc match on the wednesday however he had now added to this an extra dose to be taken before breakfast stone and robinson had left their comfortable beds that day at six oclock yawning and heavyeyed and had caught catches and fielded drives which in the cool morning air had stung like adders and bitten like serpents until the sun has really got to work it is no joke taking a high catch stones dislike of the experiment was only equalled by robinsons they were neither of them of the type which likes to undergo hardships for the common good they played well enough when on the field but neither cared greatly whether the school had a good season or not they played the game entirely for their own sakes  the result was that they went back to the house for breakfast with a neveragain feeling and at the earliest possible moment met to debate as to what was to be done about it at all costs another experience like todays must be avoided  its all rot said stone what on earths the good of sweating about before breakfast it only makes you tired  i shouldnt wonder said robinson if it wasnt bad for the heart rushing about on an empty stomach i mean and all that sort of thing  personally said stone gnawing his bun i dont intend to stick it  nor do i  i mean its such absolute rot if we arent good enough to play for the team without having to get up overnight to catch catches hed better find somebody else  yes  at this moment adair came into the shop  fieldingpractice again tomorrow he said briskly at six  before breakfast said robinson  rather you two must buck up you know you were rotten today and he passed on leaving the two malcontents speechless  stone was the first to recover  im hanged if i turn out tomorrow he said as they left the shop he can do what he likes about it besides what can he do after all only kick us out of the team and i dont mind that  nor do i  i dont think he will kick us out either he cant play the mcc with a scratch team if he does well go and play for that village jackson plays for well get jackson to shove us into the team  all right said robinson lets  their position was a strong one a cricket captain may seem to be an autocrat of tremendous power but in reality he has only one weapon the keenness of those under him with the majority of course the fear of being excluded or ejected from a team is a spur that drives the majority consequently are easily handled but when a cricket captain runs up against a boy who does not much care whether he plays for the team or not then he finds himself in a difficult position and unless he is a man of action practically helpless  stone and robinson felt secure taking it all round they felt that they would just as soon play for lower borlock as for the school the bowling of the opposition would be weaker in the former case and the chance of making runs greater to a certain type of cricketer runs are runs wherever and however made  the result of all this was that adair turning out with the team next morning for fieldingpractice found himself two short barnes was among those present but of the other two representatives of outwoods house there were no signs  barnes questioned on the subject had no information to give beyond the fact that he had not seen them about anywhere which was not a great help adair proceeded with the fieldingpractice without further delay  at breakfast that morning he was silent and apparently wrapped in thought mr downing who sat at the top of the table with adair on his right was accustomed at the morning meal to blend nourishment of the body with that of the mind as a rule he had ten minutes with the daily paper before the bell rang and it was his practice to hand on the results of his reading to adair and the other houseprefects who not having seen the paper usually formed an interested and appreciative audience today however though the houseprefects expressed varying degrees of excitement at the news that tyldesley had made a century against gloucestershire and that a butter famine was expected in the united states these worldshaking newsitems seemed to leave adair cold he champed his bread and marmalade with an abstracted air  he was wondering what to do in this matter of stone and robinson  many captains might have passed the thing over to take it for granted that the missing pair had overslept themselves would have been a safe and convenient way out of the difficulty but adair was not the sort of person who seeks for safe and convenient ways out of difficulties he never shirked anything physical or moral  he resolved to interview the absentees  it was not until after school that an opportunity offered itself he went across to outwoods and found the two nonstarters in the senior dayroom engaged in the intellectual pursuit of kicking the wall and marking the height of each kick with chalk adairs entrance coincided with a record effort by stone which caused the kicker to overbalance and stagger backwards against the captain  sorry said stone hullo adair  dont mention it why werent you two at fieldingpractice this morning  robinson who left the lead to stone in all matters said nothing stone spoke  we didnt turn up he said  i know you didnt why not  stone had rehearsed this scene in his mind and he spoke with the coolness which comes from rehearsal  we decided not to  oh  yes we came to the conclusion that we hadnt any use for earlymorning fielding  adairs manner became ominously calm  you were rather fedup i suppose  thats just the word  sorry it bored you  it didnt we didnt give it the chance to  robinson laughed appreciatively  whats the joke robinson asked adair  theres no joke said robinson with some haste i was only thinking of something  ill give you something else to think about soon  stone intervened  its no good making a row about it adair you must see that you cant do anything of course you can kick us out of the team if you like but we dont care if you do jackson will get us a game any wednesday or saturday for the village he plays for so were all right and the school team arent such a lot of flyers that you can afford to go chucking people out of it whenever you want to see what i mean  you and jackson seem to have fixed it all up between you  what are you going to do kick us out  no  good i thought youd see it was no good making a beastly row well play for the school all right theres no earthly need for us to turn out for fieldingpractice before breakfast  you dont think there is you may be right all the same youre going to tomorrow morning  what  six sharp dont be late  dont be an ass adair weve told you we arent going to  thats only your opinion i think you are ill give you till five past six as you seem to like lying in bed  you can turn out if you feel like it you wont find me there  thatll be a disappointment nor robinson  no said the junior partner in the firm but he said it without any deep conviction the atmosphere was growing a great deal too tense for his comfort  youve quite made up your minds  yes said stone  right said adair quietly and knocked him down  he was up again in a moment adair had pushed the table back and was standing in the middle of the open space  you cad said stone i wasnt ready  well you are now shall we go on  stone dashed in without a word and for a few moments the two might have seemed evenly matched to a not too intelligent spectator but science tells even in a confined space adair was smaller and lighter than stone but he was cooler and quicker and he knew more about the game his blow was always home a fraction of a second sooner than his opponents at the end of a minute stone was on the floor again  he got up slowly and stood leaning with one hand on the table  suppose we say ten past six said adair im not particular to a minute or two  stone made no reply  will ten past six suit you for fieldingpractice tomorrow said adair  all right said stone  thanks how about you robinson  robinson had been a petrified spectator of the captainkettlelike manoeuvres of the cricket captain and it did not take him long to make up his mind he was not altogether a coward in different circumstances he might have put up a respectable show but it takes a more than ordinarily courageous person to embark on a fight which he knows must end in his destruction robinson knew that he was nothing like a match even for stone and adair had disposed of stone in a little over one minute it seemed to robinson that neither pleasure nor profit was likely to come from an encounter with adair  all right he said hastily ill turn up  good said adair i wonder if either of you chaps could tell me which is jacksons study  stone was dabbing at his mouth with a handkerchief a task which precluded anything in the shape of conversation so robinson replied that mikes study was the first you came to on the right of the corridor at the top of the stairs  thanks said adair you dont happen to know if hes in i suppose  he went up with smith a quarter of an hour ago i dont know if hes still there  ill go and see said adair i should like a word with him if he isnt busy     chapter liv  adair has a word with mike   mike all unconscious of the stirring proceedings which had been going on below stairs was peacefully reading a letter he had received that morning from strachan at wrykyn in which the successor to the cricket captaincy which should have been mikes had a good deal to say in a lugubrious strain in mikes absence things had been going badly with wrykyn a broken arm contracted in the course of some rash experiments with a dayboys motorbicycle had deprived the team of the services of dunstable the only man who had shown any signs of being able to bowl a side out since this calamity wrote strachan everything had gone wrong the mcc led by mikes brother reggie the least of the three firstclasscricketing jacksons had smashed them by a hundred and fifty runs geddington had wiped them off the face of the earth the incogs with a team recruited exclusively from the rabbithutchnot a wellknown man on the side except stacey a veteran who had been playing for the club since fuller pilchs timehad got home by two wickets in fact it was strachans opinion that the wrykyn team that summer was about the most hopeless gang of deadbeats that had ever made an exhibition of itself on the school grounds the ripton match fortunately was off owing to an outbreak of mumps at that shrine of learning and athleticsthe second outbreak of the malady in two terms which said strachan was hard lines on ripton but a bit of jolly good luck for wrykyn as it had saved them from what would probably have been a record hammering ripton having eight of their last years team left including dixon the fast bowler against whom mike alone of the wrykyn team had been able to make runs in the previous season altogether wrykyn had struck a bad patch  mike mourned over his suffering school if only he could have been there to help it might have made all the difference in school cricket one good batsman to go in first and knock the bowlers off their length may take a weak team triumphantly through a season in school cricket the importance of a good start for the first wicket is incalculable  as he put strachans letter away in his pocket all his old bitterness against sedleigh which had been ebbing during the past few days returned with a rush he was conscious once more of that feeling of personal injury which had made him hate his new school on the first day of term  and it was at this point when his resentment was at its height that adair the concrete representative of everything sedleighan entered the room  there are moments in lifes placid course when there has got to be the biggest kind of row this was one of them                                       psmith who was leaning against the mantelpiece reading the serial story in a daily paper which he had abstracted from the senior dayroom made the intruder free of the study with a dignified wave of the hand and went on reading mike remained in the deckchair in which he was sitting and contented himself with glaring at the newcomer  psmith was the first to speak  if you ask my candid opinion he said looking up from his paper i should say that young lord antony trefusis was in the soup already i seem to see the consommé splashing about his ankles hes had a note telling him to be under the oaktree in the park at midnight hes just off there at the end of this instalment i bet long jack the poacher is waiting there with a sandbag care to see the paper comrade adair or dont you take any interest in contemporary literature  thanks said adair i just wanted to speak to jackson for a minute  fate said psmith has led your footsteps to the right place that is comrade jackson the pride of the school sitting before you  what do you want said mike  he suspected that adair had come to ask him once again to play for the school the fact that the mcc match was on the following day made this a probable solution of the reason for his visit he could think of no other errand that was likely to have set the head of downings paying afternoon calls  ill tell you in a minute it wont take long  that said psmith approvingly is right speed is the keynote of the present age promptitude despatch this is no time for loitering we must be strenuous we must hustle we must do it now we  buck up said mike  certainly said adair ive just been talking to stone and robinson  an excellent way of passing an idle halfhour said psmith  we werent exactly idle said adair grimly it didnt last long but it was pretty lively while it did stone chucked it after the first round  mike got up out of his chair he could not quite follow what all this was about but there was no mistaking the truculence of adairs manner for some reason which might possibly be made dear later adair was looking for trouble and mike in his present mood felt that it would be a privilege to see that he got it  psmith was regarding adair through his eyeglass with pain and surprise  surely he said you do not mean us to understand that you have been brawling with comrade stone this is bad hearing i thought that you and he were like brothers such a bad example for comrade robinson too leave us adair we would brood oh go thee knave ill none of thee shakespeare  psmith turned away and resting his elbows on the mantelpiece gazed at himself mournfully in the lookingglass  im not the man i was he sighed after a prolonged inspection there are lines on my face dark circles beneath my eyes the fierce rush of life at sedleigh is wasting me away  stone and i had a discussion about earlymorning fieldingpractice said adair turning to mike  mike said nothing  i thought his fielding wanted working up a bit so i told him to turn out at six tomorrow morning he said he wouldnt so we argued it out hes going to all right so is robinson  mike remained silent  so are you added adair  i get thinner and thinner said psmith from the mantelpiece  mike looked at adair and adair looked at mike after the manner of two dogs before they fly at one another there was an electric silence in the study psmith peered with increased earnestness into the glass  oh said mike at last what makes you think that  i dont think i know  any special reason for my turning out  yes  whats that  youre going to play for the school against the mcc tomorrow and i want you to get some practice  i wonder how you got that idea  curious i should have done isnt it  very you arent building on it much are you said mike politely  i am rather replied adair with equal courtesy  im afraid youll be disappointed  i dont think so  my eyes said psmith regretfully are a bit close together however he added philosophically its too late to alter that now  mike drew a step closer to adair  what makes you think i shall play against the mcc he asked curiously  im going to make you  mike took another step forward adair moved to meet him  would you care to try now said mike  for just one second the two drew themselves together preparatory to beginning the serious business of the interview and in that second psmith turning from the glass stepped between them  get out of the light smith said mike  psmith waved him back with a deprecating gesture  my dear young friends he said placidly if you will let your angry passions rise against the direct advice of doctor watts i suppose you must but when you propose to claw each other in my study in the midst of a hundred fragile and priceless ornaments i lodge a protest if you really feel that you want to scrap for goodness sake do it where theres some room i dont want all the study furniture smashed i know a bank whereon the wild thyme grows only a few yards down the road where you can scrap all night if you want to how would it be to move on there any objections none then shift ho and lets get it over     chapter lv  clearing the air   psmith was one of those people who lend a dignity to everything they touch under his auspices the most unpromising ventures became somehow enveloped in an atmosphere of measured stateliness on the present occasion what would have been without his guiding hand a mere unscientific scramble took on something of the impressive formality of the national sporting club  the rounds he said producing a watch as they passed through a gate into a field a couple of hundred yards from the house gate will be of three minutes duration with a minute rest in between a man who is down will have ten seconds in which to rise are you ready comrades adair and jackson very well then time  after which it was a pity that the actual fight did not quite live up to its referees introduction dramatically there should have been cautious sparring for openings and a number of tensely contested rounds as if it had been the final of a boxing competition but school fights when they do occurwhich is only once in a decade nowadays unless you count junior school scufflesare the outcome of weeks of suppressed bad blood and are consequently brief and furious in a boxing competition however much one may want to win one does not dislike ones opponent up to the moment when time was called one was probably warmly attached to him and at the end of the last round one expects to resume that attitude of mind in a fight each party as a rule hates the other  so it happened that there was nothing formal or cautious about the present battle all adair wanted was to get at mike and all mike wanted was to get at adair directly psmith called time they rushed together as if they meant to end the thing in half a minute  it was this that saved mike in an ordinary contest with the gloves with his opponent cool and boxing in his true form he could not have lasted three rounds against adair the latter was a clever boxer while mike had never had a lesson in his life if adair had kept away and used his head nothing could have prevented him winning  as it was however he threw away his advantages much as tom brown did at the beginning of his fight with slogger williams and the result was the same as on that historic occasion mike had the greater strength and thirty seconds from the start knocked his man clean off his feet with an unscientific but powerful righthander  this finished adairs chances he rose full of fight but with all the science knocked out of him he went in at mike with both hands the irish blood in him which for the ordinary events of life made him merely energetic and dashing now rendered him reckless he abandoned all attempt at guarding it was the frontal attack in its most futile form and as unsuccessful as a frontal attack is apt to be there was a swift exchange of blows in the course of which mikes left elbow coming into contact with his opponents right fist got a shock which kept it tingling for the rest of the day and then adair went down in a heap  he got up slowly and with difficulty for a moment he stood blinking vaguely then he lurched forward at mike  in the excitement of a fightwhich is after all about the most exciting thing that ever happens to one in the course of ones lifeit is difficult for the fighters to see what the spectators see where the spectators see an assault on an already beaten man the fighter himself only sees a legitimate piece of selfdefence against an opponent whose chances are equal to his own psmith saw as anybody looking on would have seen that adair was done mikes blow had taken him within a fraction of an inch of the point of the jaw and he was all but knocked out mike could not see this all he understood was that his man was on his feet again and coming at him so he hit out with all his strength and this time adair went down and stayed down  brief said psmith coming forward but exciting we may take that i think to be the conclusion of the entertainment i will now have a dash at picking up the slain i shouldnt stop if i were you hell be sitting up and taking notice soon and if he sees you he may want to go on with the combat which would do him no earthly good if its going to be continued in our next there had better be a bit of an interval for alterations and repairs first  is he hurt much do you think asked mike he had seen knockouts before in the ring but this was the first time he had ever effected one on his own account and adair looked unpleasantly corpselike  hes all right said psmith in a minute or two hell be skipping about like a little lambkin ill look after him you go away and pick flowers  mike put on his coat and walked back to the house he was conscious of a perplexing whirl of new and strange emotions chief among which was a curious feeling that he rather liked adair he found himself thinking that adair was a good chap that there was something to be said for his point of view and that it was a pity he had knocked him about so much at the same time he felt an undeniable thrill of pride at having beaten him the feat presented that interesting person mike jackson to him in a fresh and pleasing light as one who had had a tough job to face and had carried it through jackson the cricketer he knew but jackson the deliverer of knockout blows was strange to him and he found this new acquaintance a man to be respected  the fight in fact had the result which most fights have if they are fought fairly and until one side has had enough it revolutionised mikes view of things it shook him up and drained the bad blood out of him where before he had seemed to himself to be acting with massive dignity he now saw that he had simply been sulking like some wretched kid there had appeared to him something rather fine in his policy of refusing to identify himself in any way with sedleigh a touch of the stonewallsdonotaprisonmake sort of thing he now saw that his attitude was to be summed up in the words shant play  it came upon mike with painful clearness that he had been making an ass of himself  he had come to this conclusion after much earnest thought when psmith entered the study  hows adair asked mike  sitting up and taking nourishment once more we have been chatting hes not a bad cove  hes all right said mike  there was a pause psmith straightened his tie  look here he said i seldom interfere in terrestrial strife but it seems to me that theres an opening here for a capable peacemaker not afraid of work and willing to give his services in exchange for a comfortable home comrade adairs rather a stoutish fellow in his way im not much on the play up for the old school jones game but every one to his taste i shouldnt have thought anybody would get overwhelmingly attached to this abode of wrath but comrade adair seems to have done it hes all for giving sedleigh a muchneeded boostup its not a bad idea in its way i dont see why one shouldnt humour him apparently hes been sweating since early childhood to buck the school up and as hes leaving at the end of the term it mightnt be a scaly scheme to give him a bit of a sendoff if possible by making the cricket season a bit of a banger as a start why not drop him a line to say that youll play against the mcc tomorrow  mike did not reply at once he was feeling better disposed towards adair and sedleigh than he had felt but he was not sure that he was quite prepared to go as far as a complete climbdown  it wouldnt be a bad idea continued psmith theres nothing like giving a man a bit in every now and then it broadens the soul and improves the action of the skin what seems to have fed up comrade adair to a certain extent is that stone apparently led him to understand that you had offered to give him and robinson places in your village team you didnt of course  of course not said mike indignantly  i told him he didnt know the old noblesse oblige spirit of the jacksons i said that you would scorn to tarnish the jackson escutcheon by not playing the game my eloquence convinced him however to return to the point under discussion why not  i dontwhat i mean to say began mike  if your trouble is said psmith that you fear that you may be in unworthy company  dont be an ass  dismiss it i am playing  mike stared  youre what you  i said psmith breathing on a coatbutton and polishing it with his handkerchief  can you play cricket  you have discovered said psmith my secret sorrow  youre rotting  you wrong me comrade jackson  then why havent you played  why havent you  why didnt you come and play for lower borlock i mean  the last time i played in a village cricket match i was caught at point by a man in braces it would have been madness to risk another such shock to my system my nerves are so exquisitely balanced that a thing of that sort takes years off my life  no but look here smith bar rotting are you really any good at cricket  competent judges at eton gave me to understand so i was told that this year i should be a certainty for lords but when the cricket season came where was i gone gone like some beautiful flower that withers in the night  but you told me you didnt like cricket you said you only liked watching it  quite right i do but at schools where cricket is compulsory you have to overcome your private prejudices and in time the thing becomes a habit imagine my feelings when i found that i was degenerating little by little into a slow lefthand bowler with a swerve i fought against it but it was useless and after a while i gave up the struggle and drifted with the stream last year in a house matchpsmiths voice took on a deeper tone of melancholyi took seven for thirteen in the second innings on a hard wicket i did think when i came here that i had found a haven of rest but it was not to be i turn out tomorrow what comrade outwood will say when he finds that his keenest archaeological disciple has deserted i hate to think however  mike felt as if a young and powerful earthquake had passed the whole face of his world had undergone a quick change here was he the recalcitrant wavering on the point of playing for the school and here was psmith the last person whom he would have expected to be a player stating calmly that he had been in the running for a place in the eton eleven  then in a flash mike understood he was not by nature intuitive but he read psmiths mind now since the term began he and psmith had been acting on precisely similar motives just as he had been disappointed of the captaincy of cricket at wrykyn so had psmith been disappointed of his place in the eton team at lords and they had both worked it off each in his own waymike sullenly psmith whimsically according to their respective natureson sedleigh  if psmith therefore did not consider it too much of a climbdown to renounce his resolution not to play for sedleigh there was nothing to stop mike doing so asat the bottom of his hearthe wanted to do  by jove he said if youre playing ill play ill write a note to adair now but i say he stoppedim hanged if im going to turn out and field before breakfast tomorrow  thats all right you wont have to adair wont be there himself hes not playing against the mcc hes sprained his wrist     chapter lvi  in which peace is declared   sprained his wrist said mike how did he do that  during the brawl apparently one of his efforts got home on your elbow instead of your expressive countenance and whether it was that your elbow was particularly tough or his wrist particularly fragile i dont know anyhow it went its nothing bad but itll keep him out of the game tomorrow  i say what beastly rough luck id no idea ill go round  not a bad scheme close the door gently after you and if you see anybody downstairs who looks as if he were likely to be going over to the shop ask him to get me a small pot of some rare old jam and tell the man to chalk it up to me the jam comrade outwood supplies to us at tea is all right as a practical joke or as a food for those anxious to commit suicide but useless to anybody who values life  on arriving at mr downings and going to adairs study mike found that his late antagonist was out he left a note informing him of his willingness to play in the morrows match the lockup bell rang as he went out of the house  a spot of rain fell on his hand a moment later there was a continuous patter as the storm which had been gathering all day broke in earnest mike turned up his coatcollar and ran back to outwoods at this rate he said to himself there wont be a match at all tomorrow                                       when the weather decides after behaving well for some weeks to show what it can do in another direction it does the thing thoroughly when mike woke the next morning the world was grey and dripping leadencoloured clouds drifted over the sky till there was not a trace of blue to be seen and then the rain began again in the gentle determined way rain has when it means to make a day of it  it was one of those bad days when one sits in the pavilion damp and depressed while figures in mackintoshes with discoloured buckskin boots crawl miserably about the field in couples  mike shuffling across to school in a burberry met adair at downings gate  these moments are always difficult mike stoppedhe could hardly walk on as if nothing had happenedand looked down at his feet  coming across he said awkwardly  right ho said adair  they walked on in silence  its only about ten to isnt it said mike  adair fished out his watch and examined it with an elaborate care born of nervousness  about nine to  good weve got plenty of time  yes  i hate having to hurry over to school  so do i  i often do cut it rather fine though  yes so do i  beastly nuisance when one does  beastly  its only about a couple of minutes from the houses to the school i should think shouldnt you  not much more might be three  yes three if one didnt hurry  oh yes if one didnt hurry  another silence  beastly day said adair  rotten  silence again  i say said mike scowling at his toes awfully sorry about your wrist  oh thats all right it was my fault  does it hurt  oh no rather not thanks  id no idea youd crocked yourself  oh no thats all right it was only right at the end youd have smashed me anyhow  oh rot  i bet you anything you like you would  i bet you i shouldnt jolly hard luck just before the match  oh no i say thanks awfully for saying youd play  oh rot do you think we shall get a game  adair inspected the sky carefully  i dont know it looks pretty bad doesnt it  rotten i say how long will your wrist keep you out of cricket  be all right in a week less probably  good  now that you and smith are going to play we ought to have a jolly good season  rummy smith turning out to be a cricketer  yes i should think hed be a hot bowler with his height  he must be jolly good if he was only just out of the eton team last year  yes  whats the time asked mike  adair produced his watch once more  five to  weve heaps of time  yes heaps  lets stroll on a bit down the road shall we  right ho  mike cleared his throat  i say  hullo  ive been talking to smith he was telling me that you thought id promised to give stone and robinson places in the  oh no thats all right it was only for a bit smith told me you couldnt have done and i saw that i was an ass to think you could have it was stone seeming so dead certain that he could play for lower borlock if i chucked him from the school team that gave me the idea  he never even asked me to get him a place  no i know  of course i wouldnt have done it even if he had  of course not  i didnt want to play myself but i wasnt going to do a rotten trick like getting other fellows away from the team  no i know  it was rotten enough really not playing myself  oh no beastly rough luck having to leave wrykyn just when you were going to be captain and come to a small school like this  the excitement of the past few days must have had a stimulating effect on mikes mindshaken it up as it were for now for the second time in two days he displayed quite a creditable amount of intuition he might have been misled by adairs apparently deprecatory attitude towards sedleigh and blundered into a denunciation of the place adair had said a small school like this in the sort of voice which might have led his hearer to think that he was expected to say yes rotten little hole isnt it or words to that effect mike fortunately perceived that the words were used purely from politeness on the chinese principle when a chinaman wishes to pay a compliment he does so by belittling himself and his belongings  he eluded the pitfall  what rot he said sedleighs one of the most sporting schools ive ever come across everybodys as keen as blazes so they ought to be after the way youve sweated  adair shuffled awkwardly  ive always been fairly keen on the place he said but i dont suppose ive done anything much  youve loosened one of my front teeth said mike with a grin if thats any comfort to you  i couldnt eat anything except porridge this morning my jaw still aches  for the first time during the conversation their eyes met and the humorous side of the thing struck them simultaneously they began to laugh  what fools we must have looked said adair  you were all right i must have looked rotten ive never had the gloves on in my life im jolly glad no one saw us except smith who doesnt count hullo theres the bell wed better be moving on what about this match not much chance of it from the look of the sky at present  it might clear before eleven youd better get changed anyhow at the interval and hang about in case  all right its better than doing thucydides with downing weve got math till the interval so i dont see anything of him all day which wont hurt me  he isnt a bad sort of chap when you get to know him said adair  i cant have done then i dont know which id least soon be downing or a blackbeetle except that if one was downing one could tread on the blackbeetle dash this rain i got about half a pint down my neck just then we shant get a game today of anything like it as youre crocked im not sure that i care much youve been sweating for years to get the match on and it would be rather rot playing it without you  i dont know that so much i wish we could play because im certain with you and smith wed walk into them they probably arent sending down much of a team and really now that you and smith are turning out weve got a jolly hot lot theres quite decent batting all the way through and the bowling isnt so bad if only we could have given this mcc lot a really good hammering it might have been easier to get some good fixtures for next season you see its all right for a school like wrykyn but with a small place like this you simply cant get the best teams to give you a match till youve done something to show that you arent absolute rotters at the game as for the schools theyre worse theyd simply laugh at you you were cricket secretary at wrykyn last year what would you have done if youd had a challenge from sedleigh youd either have laughed till you were sick or else had a fit at the mere idea of the thing  mike stopped  by jove youve struck about the brightest scheme on record i never thought of it before lets get a match on with wrykyn  what they wouldnt play us  yes they would at least im pretty sure they would i had a letter from strachan the captain yesterday saying that the ripton match had had to be scratched owing to illness so theyve got a vacant date shall i try them ill write to strachan tonight if you like and they arent strong this year well smash them what do you say  adair was as one who has seen a vision  by jove he said at last if we only could     chapter lvii  mr downing moves   the rain continued without a break all the morning the two teams after hanging about dismally and whiling the time away with stumpcricket in the changingrooms lunched in the pavilion at one oclock after which the mcc captain approaching adair moved that this merry meeting be considered off and himself and his men permitted to catch the next train back to town to which adair seeing that it was out of the question that there should be any cricket that afternoon regretfully agreed and the first sedleigh v mcc match was accordingly scratched  mike and psmith wandering back to the house were met by a damp junior from downings with a message that mr downing wished to see mike as soon as he was changed  whats he want me for inquired mike  the messenger did not know mr downing it seemed had not confided in him all he knew was that the housemaster was in the house and would be glad if mike would step across  a nuisance said psmith this incessant demand for you thats the worst of being popular if he wants you to stop to tea edge away a meal on rather a sumptuous scale will be prepared in the study against your return  mike changed quickly and went off leaving psmith who was fond of simple pleasures in his spare time earnestly occupied with a puzzle which had been scattered through the land by a weekly paper the prize for a solution was one thousand pounds and psmith had already informed mike with some minuteness of his plans for the disposition of this sum meanwhile he worked at it both in and out of school generally with abusive comments on its inventor  he was still fiddling away at it when mike returned  mike though psmith was at first too absorbed to notice it was agitated  i dont wish to be in any way harsh said psmith without looking up but the man who invented this thing was a blighter of the worst type you come and have a shot for the moment i am baffled the whisper flies round the clubs psmith is baffled  the mans an absolute drivelling ass said mike warmly  me do you mean  what on earth would be the point of my doing it  youd gather in a thousand of the best give you a nice start in life  im not talking about your rotten puzzle  what are you talking about  that ass downing i believe hes off his nut  then your chat with comrade downing was not of the oldcollegechums meetingunexpectedlyafteryearsseparation type what has he been doing to you  hes off his nut  i know but what did he do how did the brainstorm burst did he jump at you from behind a door and bite a piece out of your leg or did he say he was a teapot  mike sat down  you remember that painting sammy business  as if it were yesterday said psmith which it was pretty nearly  he thinks i did it  why have you ever shown any talent in the painting line  the silly ass wanted me to confess that id done it he as good as asked me to jawed a lot of rot about my finding it to my advantage later on if i behaved sensibly  then what are you worrying about dont you know that when a master wants you to do the confessingact it simply means that he hasnt enough evidence to start in on you with youre all right the things a standoff  evidence said mike my dear man hes got enough evidence to sink a ship hes absolutely sweating evidence at every pore as far as i can see hes been crawling about doing the sherlock holmes business for all hes worth ever since the thing happened and now hes dead certain that i painted sammy  did you by the way asked psmith  no said mike shortly i didnt but after listening to downing i almost began to wonder if i hadnt the mans got stacks of evidence to prove that i did  such as what  its mostly about my boots but dash it you know all about that why you were with him when he came and looked for them  it is true said psmith that comrade downing and i spent a very pleasant halfhour together inspecting boots but how does he drag you into it  he swears one of the boots was splashed with paint  yes he babbled to some extent on that point when i was entertaining him but what makes him think that the boot if any was yours  hes certain that somebody in this house got one of his boots splashed and is hiding it somewhere and im the only chap in the house who hasnt got a pair of boots to show so he thinks its me i dont know where the dickens my other boot has gone edmund swears he hasnt seen it and its nowhere about of course ive got two pairs but ones being soled so i had to go over to school yesterday in pumps thats how he spotted me  psmith sighed  comrade jackson he said mournfully all this very sad affair shows the folly of acting from the best motives in my simple zeal meaning to save you unpleasantness i have landed you with a dull sickening thud right in the cart are you particular about dirtying your hands if you arent just reach up that chimney a bit  mike stared what the dickens are you talking about  go on get it over be a man and reach up the chimney  i dont know what the game is said mike kneeling beside the fender and groping buthullo  ah ha said psmith moodily  mike dropped the sootcovered object in the fender and glared at it  illustration mike dropped the sootcovered object in the fender  its my boot he said at last  it is said psmith your boot and what is that red stain across the toe is it blood no tis not blood it is red paint  mike seemed unable to remove his eyes from the boot  how on earth didby jove i remember now i kicked up against something in the dark when i was putting my bicycle back that night it must have been the paintpot  then you were out that night  rather thats what makes it so jolly awkward its too long to tell you now  your stories are never too long for me said psmith say on  well it was like this and mike related the events which had led up to his midnight excursion psmith listened attentively  this he said when mike had finished confirms my frequently stated opinion that comrade jellicoe is one of natures blitherers so thats why he touched us for our hardearned was it  yes of course there was no need for him to have the money at all  and the result is that you are in something of a tight place youre absolutely certain you didnt paint that dog didnt do it by any chance in a moment of absentmindedness and forgot all about it no no i suppose not i wonder who did  its beastly awkward you see downing chased me that night that was why i rang the alarm bell so you see hes certain to think that the chap he chased which was me and the chap who painted sammy are the same i shall get landed both ways  psmith pondered  it is a tightish place he admitted  i wonder if we could get this boot clean said mike inspecting it with disfavour  not for a pretty considerable time  i suppose not i say i am in the cart if i cant produce this boot theyre bound to guess why  what exactly asked psmith was the position of affairs between you and comrade downing when you left him had you definitely parted brassrags or did you simply sort of drift apart with mutual courtesies  oh he said i was illadvised to continue that attitude or some rot and i said i didnt care i hadnt painted his bally dog and he said very well then he must take steps andwell that was about all  sufficient too said psmith quite sufficient i take it then that he is now on the warpath collecting a gang so to speak  i suppose hes gone to the old man about it  probably a very worrying time our headmaster is having taking it all round in connection with this painful affair what do you think his move will be  i suppose hell send for me and try to get something out of me  hell want you to confess too masters are all whales on confession the worst of it is you cant prove an alibi because at about the time the foul act was perpetrated you were playing roundandroundthemulberrybush with comrade downing this needs thought you had better put the case in my hands and go out and watch the dandelions growing i will think over the matter  well i hope youll be able to think of something i cant  possibly you never know  there was a tap at the door  see how we have trained them said psmith they now knock before entering there was a time when they would have tried to smash in a panel come in  a small boy carrying a straw hat adorned with the schoolhouse ribbon answered the invitation  oh i say jackson he said the headmaster sent me over to tell you he wants to see you  i told you so said mike to psmith  dont go suggested psmith tell him to write  mike got up  all this is very trying said psmith im seeing nothing of you today he turned to the small boy tell willie he added that mr jackson will be with him in a moment  the emissary departed  youre all right said psmith encouragingly just you keep on saying youre all right stout denial is the thing dont go in for any airy explanations simply stick to stout denial you cant beat it  with which expert advice he allowed mike to go on his way  he had not been gone two minutes when psmith who had leaned back in his chair wrapped in thought heaved himself up again he stood for a moment straightening his tie at the lookingglass then he picked up his hat and moved slowly out of the door and down the passage thence at the same dignified rate of progress out of the house and in at downings front gate  the postman was at the door when he got there apparently absorbed in conversation with the parlourmaid psmith stood by politely till the postman who had just been told it was like his impudence caught sight of him and having handed over the letters in an ultraformal and professional manner passed away  is mr downing at home inquired psmith  he was it seemed psmith was shown into the diningroom on the left of the hall and requested to wait he was examining a portrait of mr downing which hung on the wall when the housemaster came in  an excellent likeness sir said psmith with a gesture of the hand towards the painting  well smith said mr downing shortly what do you wish to see me about  it was in connection with the regrettable painting of your dog sir  ha said mr downing  i did it sir said psmith stopping and flicking a piece of fluff off his knee     chapter lviii  the artist claims his work   the line of action which psmith had called stout denial is an excellent line to adopt especially if you really are innocent but it does not lead to anything in the shape of a bright and snappy dialogue between accuser and accused both mike and the headmaster were oppressed by a feeling that the situation was difficult the atmosphere was heavy and conversation showed a tendency to flag the headmaster had opened brightly enough with a summary of the evidence which mr downing had laid before him but after that a massive silence had been the order of the day there is nothing in this world quite so stolid and uncommunicative as a boy who has made up his mind to be stolid and uncommunicative and the headmaster as he sat and looked at mike who sat and looked past him at the bookshelves felt awkward it was a scene which needed either a dramatic interruption or a neat exit speech as it happened what it got was the dramatic interruption  the headmaster was just saying i do not think you fully realise jackson the extent to which appearances which was practically going back to the beginning and starting againwhen there was a knock at the door a voice without said mr downing to see you sir and the chief witness for the prosecution burst in  i would not have interrupted you said mr downing but  not at all mr downing is there anything i can  i have discoveredi have been informedin short it was not jackson who committed thewho painted my dog  mike and the headmaster both looked at the speaker mike with a feeling of relieffor stout denial unsupported by any weighty evidence is a wearing game to playthe headmaster with astonishment  not jackson said the headmaster  no it was a boy in the same house smith  psmith mike was more than surprised he could not believe it there is nothing which affords so clear an index to a boys character as the type of rag which he considers humorous between what is a rag and what is merely a rotten trick there is a very definite line drawn masters as a rule do not realise this but boys nearly always do mike could not imagine psmith doing a rotten thing like covering a housemasters dog with red paint any more than he could imagine doing it himself they had both been amused at the sight of sammy after the operation but anybody except possibly the owner of the dog would have thought it funny at first after the first surprise their feeling had been that it was a scuggish thing to have done and beastly rough luck on the poor brute it was a kids trick as for psmith having done it mike simply did not believe it  smith said the headmaster what makes you think that  simply this said mr downing with calm triumph that the boy himself came to me a few moments ago and confessed  mike was conscious of a feeling of acute depression it did not make him in the least degree jubilant or even thankful to know that he himself was cleared of the charge all he could think of was that psmith was done for this was bound to mean the sack if psmith had painted sammy it meant that psmith had broken out of his house at night and it was not likely that the rules about nocturnal wandering were less strict at sedleigh than at any other school in the kingdom mike felt if possible worse than he had felt when wyatt had been caught on a similar occasion it seemed as if fate had a special grudge against his best friends he did not make friends very quickly or easily though he had always had scores of acquaintancesand with wyatt and psmith he had found himself at home from the first moment he had met them  he sat there with a curious feeling of having swallowed a heavy weight hardly listening to what mr downing was saying mr downing was talking rapidly to the headmaster who was nodding from time to time  mike took advantage of a pause to get up may i go sir he said  certainly jackson certainly said the head oh and er if you are going back to your house tell smith that i should like to see him  yes sir  he had reached the door when again there was a knock  come in said the headmaster  it was adair  yes adair  adair was breathing rather heavily as if he had been running  it was about sammysampson sir he said looking at mr downing  ah we know well adair what did you wish to say  it wasnt jackson who did it sir  no no adair so mr downing  it was dunster sir  terrific sensation the headmaster gave a sort of strangled yelp of astonishment mr downing leaped in his chair mikes eyes opened to their fullest extent  adair  there was almost a wail in the headmasters voice the situation had suddenly become too much for him his brain was swimming that mike despite the evidence against him should be innocent was curious perhaps but not particularly startling but that adair should inform him two minutes after mr downings announcement of psmiths confession that psmith too was guiltless and that the real criminal was dunsterit was this that made him feel that somebody in the words of an american author had played a mean trick on him and substituted for his brain a sideorder of cauliflower why dunster of all people dunster who he remembered dizzily had left the school at christmas and why if dunster had really painted the dog had psmith asserted that he himself was the culprit whywhy anything he concentrated his mind on adair as the only person who could save him from impending brainfever  adair  yes sir  whatwhat do you mean  it was dunster sir i got a letter from him only five minutes ago in which he said that he had painted sammysampson the dog sir for a ragfor a joke and that as he didnt want any one here to get into a rowbe punished for it id better tell mr downing at once i tried to find mr downing but he wasnt in the house then i met smith outside the house and he told me that mr downing had gone over to see you sir  smith told you said mr downing  yes sir  did you say anything to him about your having received this letter from dunster  i gave him the letter to read sir  and what was his attitude when he had read it  he laughed sir  laughed mr downings voice was thunderous  yes sir he rolled about  mr downing snorted  but adair said the headmaster i do not understand how this thing could have been done by dunster he has left the school  he was down here for the old sedleighans match sir he stopped the night in the village  and that was the night theit happened  yes sir  i see well i am glad to find that the blame cannot be attached to any boy in the school i am sorry that it is even an old boy it was a foolish discreditable thing to have done but it is not as bad as if any boy still at the school had broken out of his house at night to do it  the sergeant said mr downing told me that the boy he saw was attempting to enter mr outwoods house  another freak of dunsters i suppose said the headmaster i shall write to him  if it was really dunster who painted my dog said mr downing i cannot understand the part played by smith in this affair if he did not do it what possible motive could he have had for coming to me of his own accord and deliberately confessing  to be sure said the headmaster pressing a bell it is certainly a thing that calls for explanation barlow he said as the butler appeared kindly go across to mr outwoods house and inform smith that i should like to see him  if you please sir mr smith is waiting in the hall  in the hall  yes sir he arrived soon after mr adair sir saying that he would wait as you would probably wish to see him shortly  hm ask him to step up barlow  yes sir  there followed one of the tensest stage waits of mikes experience it was not long but while it lasted the silence was quite solid nobody seemed to have anything to say and there was not even a clock in the room to break the stillness with its ticking a very faint dripdrip of rain could be heard outside the window  presently there was a sound of footsteps on the stairs the door was opened  mr smith sir  the old etonian entered as would the guest of the evening who is a few moments late for dinner he was cheerful but slightly deprecating he gave the impression of one who though sure of his welcome feels that some slight apology is expected from him he advanced into the room with a gentle halfsmile which suggested goodwill to all men  it is still raining he observed you wished to see me sir  sit down smith  thank you sir  he dropped into a deep armchair which both adair and mike had avoided in favour of less luxurious seats with the confidential cosiness of a fashionable physician calling on a patient between whom and himself time has broken down the barriers of restraint and formality  mr downing burst out like a reservoir that has broken its banks  smith  psmith turned his gaze politely in the housemasters direction  smith you came to me a quarter of an hour ago and told me that it was you who had painted my dog sampson  yes sir  it was absolutely untrue  i am afraid so sir  but smith began the headmaster  psmith bent forward encouragingly  this is a most extraordinary affair have you no explanation to offer what induced you to do such a thing  psmith sighed softly  the craze for notoriety sir he replied sadly the curse of the present age  what cried the headmaster  it is remarkable proceeded psmith placidly with the impersonal touch of one lecturing on generalities how frequently when a murder has been committed one finds men confessing that they have done it when it is out of the question that they should have committed it it is one of the most interesting problems with which anthropologists are confronted human nature  the headmaster interrupted  smith he said i should like to see you alone for a moment mr downing might i trouble adair jackson  he made a motion towards the door  when he and psmith were alone there was silence psmith leaned back comfortably in his chair the headmaster tapped nervously with his foot on the floor  ersmith  sir  the headmaster seemed to have some difficulty in proceeding he paused again then he went on  ersmith i do not for a moment wish to pain you but have youer do you remember ever having had as a child let us say anyersevere illness anyermental illness  no sir  there is noforgive me if i am touching on a sad subjectthere is nonone of your near relatives have ever suffered in the way ierhave described  there isnt a lunatic on the list sir said psmith cheerfully  of course smith of course said the headmaster hurriedly i did not mean to suggestquite so quite so you think then that you confessed to an act which you had not committed purely from some sudden impulse which you cannot explain  strictly between ourselves sir  privately the headmaster found psmiths mantoman attitude somewhat disconcerting but he said nothing  well smith  i should not like it to go any further sir  i will certainly respect any confidence  i dont want anybody to know sir this is strictly between ourselves  i think you are sometimes apt to forget smith the proper relations existing between boy andwell never mind that for the present we can return to it later for the moment let me hear what you wish to say i shall of course tell nobody if you do not wish it  well it was like this sir said psmith jackson happened to tell me that you and mr downing seemed to think he had painted mr downings dog and there seemed some danger of his being expelled so i thought it wouldnt be an unsound scheme if i were to go and say i had done it that was the whole thing of course dunster writing created a certain amount of confusion  there was a pause  it was a very wrong thing to do smith said the headmaster at last but you are a curious boy smith goodnight  he held out his hand  goodnight sir said psmith  not a bad old sort said psmith meditatively to himself as he walked downstairs by no means a bad old sort i must drop in from time to time and cultivate him                                       mike and adair were waiting for him outside the front door  well said mike  you are the limit said adair whats he done  nothing we had a very pleasant chat and then i tore myself away  do you mean to say hes not going to do a thing  not a thing  well youre a marvel said adair  psmith thanked him courteously they walked on towards the houses  by the way adair said mike as the latter started to turn in at downings ill write to strachan tonight about that match  whats that asked psmith  jacksons going to try and get wrykyn to give us a game said adair theyve got a vacant date i hope the dickens theyll do it  oh i should think theyre certain to said mike goodnight  and give comrade downing when you see him said psmith my very best love it is men like him who make this merrie england of ours what it is                                       i say psmith said mike suddenly what really made you tell downing youd done it  the craving for  oh chuck it you arent talking to the old man now i believe it was simply to get me out of a jolly tight corner  psmiths expression was one of pain  my dear comrade jackson said he you wrong me you make me writhe im surprised at you i never thought to hear those words from michael jackson  well i believe you did all the same said mike obstinately and it was jolly good of you too  psmith moaned     chapter lix  sedleigh v wrykyn   the wrykyn match was threeparts over and things were going badly for sedleigh in a way one might have said that the game was over and that sedleigh had lost for it was a one day match and wrykyn who had led on the first innings had only to play out time to make the game theirs  sedleigh were paying the penalty for allowing themselves to be influenced by nerves in the early part of the day nerves lose more school matches than good play ever won there is a certain type of school batsman who is a gift to any bowler when he once lets his imagination run away with him sedleigh with the exception of adair psmith and mike had entered upon this match in a state of the most azure funk ever since mike had received strachans answer and adair had announced on the noticeboard that on saturday july the twentieth sedleigh would play wrykyn the team had been all on the jump it was useless for adair to tell them as he did repeatedly on mikes authority that wrykyn were weak this season and that on their present form sedleigh ought to win easily the team listened but were not comforted wrykyn might be below their usual strength but then wrykyn cricket as a rule reached such a high standard that this probably meant little however weak wrykyn might befor themthere was a very firm impression among the members of the sedleigh first eleven that the other school was quite strong enough to knock the cover off them experience counts enormously in school matches sedleigh had never been proved the teams they played were the sort of sides which the wrykyn second eleven would play whereas wrykyn from time immemorial had been beating ripton teams and free foresters teams and mcc teams packed with county men and sending men to oxford and cambridge who got their blues as freshmen  sedleigh had gone on to the field that morning a depressed side  it was unfortunate that adair had won the toss he had had no choice but to take first innings the weather had been bad for the last week and the wicket was slow and treacherous it was likely to get worse during the day so adair had chosen to bat first  taking into consideration the state of nerves the team was in this in itself was a calamity a school eleven are always at their worst and nerviest before lunch even on their own ground they find the surroundings lonely and unfamiliar the subtlety of the bowlers becomes magnified unless the first pair make a really good start a collapse almost invariably ensues  today the start had been gruesome beyond words mike the bulwark of the side the man who had been brought up on wrykyn bowling and from whom whatever might happen to the others at least a fifty was expectedmike going in first with barnes and taking first over had played inside one from bruce the wrykyn slow bowler and had been caught at short slip off his second ball  that put the finishingtouch on the panic stone robinson and the others all quite decent punishing batsmen when their nerves allowed them to play their own game crawled to the wickets declined to hit out at anything and were clean bowled several of them playing back to halfvolleys adair did not suffer from panic but his batting was not equal to his bowling and he had fallen after hitting one four seven wickets were down for thirty when psmith went in  psmith had always disclaimed any pretensions to batting skill but he was undoubtedly the right man for a crisis like this he had an enormous reach and he used it three consecutive balls from bruce he turned into fulltosses and swept to the legboundary and assisted by barnes who had been sitting on the splice in his usual manner he raised the total to seventyone before being yorked with his score at thirtyfive ten minutes later the innings was over with barnes not out sixteen for seventynine  wrykyn had then gone in lost strachan for twenty before lunch and finally completed their innings at a quarter to four for a hundred and thirtyone  this was better than sedleigh had expected at least eight of the team had looked forward dismally to an afternoons leatherhunting but adair and psmith helped by the wicket had never been easy especially psmith who had taken six wickets his slows playing havoc with the tail  it would be too much to say that sedleigh had any hope of pulling the game out of the fire but it was a comfort they felt at any rate having another knock as is usual at this stage of a match their nervousness had vanished and they felt capable of better things than in the first innings  it was on mikes suggestion that psmith and himself went in first mike knew the limitations of the wrykyn bowling and he was convinced that if they could knock bruce off it might be possible to rattle up a score sufficient to give them the game always provided that wrykyn collapsed in the second innings and it seemed to mike that the wicket would be so bad then that they easily might  so he and psmith had gone in at four oclock to hit and they had hit the deficit had been wiped off all but a dozen runs when psmith was bowled and by that time mike was set and in his best vein he treated all the bowlers alike and when stone came in restored to his proper frame of mind and lashed out stoutly and after him robinson and the rest it looked as if sedleigh had a chance again the score was a hundred and twenty when mike who had just reached his fifty skied one to strachan at cover the time was twentyfive past five  as mike reached the pavilion adair declared the innings closed  wrykyn started batting at twentyfive minutes to six with sixtynine to make if they wished to make them and an hour and ten minutes during which to keep up their wickets if they preferred to take things easy and go for a win on the first innings  at first it looked as if they meant to knock off the runs for strachan forced the game from the first ball which was psmiths and which he hit into the pavilion but at fifteen adair bowled him and when two runs later psmith got the next man stumped and finished up his over with a candb wrykyn decided that it was not good enough seventeen for three with an hour all but five minutes to go was getting too dangerous so drummond and rigby the next pair proceeded to play with caution and the collapse ceased  this was the state of the game at the point at which this chapter opened seventeen for three had become twentyfour for three and the hands of the clock stood at ten minutes past six changes of bowling had been tried but there seemed no chance of getting past the batsmens defence they were playing all the good balls and refused to hit at the bad  a quarter past six struck and then psmith made a suggestion which altered the game completely  why dont you have a shot this end he said to adair as they were crossing over theres a spot on the off which might help you a lot you can break like blazes if only you land on it it doesnt help my legbreaks a bit because they wont hit at them  barnes was on the point of beginning to bowl when adair took the ball from him the captain of outwoods retired to short leg with an air that suggested that he was glad to be relieved of his prominent post  the next moment drummonds offstump was lying at an angle of fortyfive adair was absolutely accurate as a bowler and he had dropped his first ball right on the worn patch  two minutes later drummonds successor was retiring to the pavilion while the wicketkeeper straightened the stumps again  there is nothing like a couple of unexpected wickets for altering the atmosphere of a game five minutes before sedleigh had been lethargic and without hope now there was a stir and buzz all round the ground there were twentyfive minutes to go and five wickets were down sedleigh was on top again  the next man seemed to take an age coming out as a matter of fact he walked more rapidly than a batsman usually walks to the crease  adairs third ball dropped just short of the spot the batsman hitting out was a shade too soon the ball hummed through the air a couple of feet from the ground in the direction of midoff and mike diving to the right got to it as he was falling and chucked it up  after that the thing was a walkover psmith clean bowled a man in his next over and the tail demoralised by the sudden change in the game collapsed uncompromisingly sedleigh won by thirtyfive runs with eight minutes in hand                                       psmith and mike sat in their study after lockup discussing things in general and the game in particular  i feel like a beastly renegade playing against wrykyn said mike still im glad we won adairs a jolly good sort and itll make him happy for weeks  when i last saw comrade adair said psmith he was going about in a sort of trance beaming vaguely and wanting to stand people things at the shop  he bowled awfully well  yes said psmith i say i dont wish to cast a gloom over this joyful occasion in any way but you say wrykyn are going to give sedleigh a fixture again next year  well  well have you thought of the massacre which will ensue you will have left adair will have left incidentally i shall have left wrykyn will swamp them  i suppose they will still the great thing you see is to get the thing started thats what adair was so keen on now sedleigh has beaten wrykyn hes satisfied they can get on fixtures with decent clubs and work up to playing the big schools youve got to start somehow so its all right you see  and besides said psmith reflectively in an emergency they can always get comrade downing to bowl for them what let us now sally out and see if we cant promote a rag of some sort in this abode of wrath comrade outwood has gone over to dinner at the school house and it would be a pity to waste a somewhat golden opportunity shall we stagger  they staggered
