74869059	the fair maid of perth  or  st valentines day   by sir walter scott      introductory  the ashes here of murderd kings beneath my footsteps sleep and yonder lies the scene of death where mary learnd to weep  captain marjoribanks   every quarter of edinburgh has its own peculiar boast so that the city together combines within its precincts if you take the word of the inhabitants on the subject as much of historical interest as of natural beauty our claims in behalf of the canongate are not the slightest the castle may excel us in extent of prospect and sublimity of site the calton had always the superiority of its unrivalled panorama and has of late added that of its towers and triumphal arches and the pillars of its parthenon the high street we acknowledge had the distinguished honour of being defended by fortifications of which we can show no vestiges we will not descend to notice the claims of more upstart districts called old new town and new new town not to mention the favourite moray place which is the newest new town of all we will not match ourselves except with our equals and with our equals in age only for in dignity we admit of one we boast being the court end of the town possessing the palace and the sepulchral remains of monarchs and that we have the power to excite in a degree unknown to the less honoured quarters of the city the dark and solemn recollections of ancient grandeur which occupied the precincts of our venerable abbey from the time of st david till her deserted halls were once more made glad and her long silent echoes awakened by the visit of our present gracious sovereign  my long habitation in the neighbourhood and the quiet respectability of my habits have given me a sort of intimacy with good mrs policy the housekeeper in that most interesting part of the old building called queen marys apartments but a circumstance which lately happened has conferred upon me greater privileges so that indeed i might i believe venture on the exploit of chatelet who was executed for being found secreted at midnight in the very bedchamber of scotlands mistress  it chanced that the good lady i have mentioned was in the discharge of her function showing the apartments to a cockney from londonnot one of your quiet dull commonplace visitors who gape yawn and listen with an acquiescent umph to the information doled out by the provincial cicerone no such thing this was the brisk alert agent of a great house in the city who missed no opportunity of doing business as he termed itthat is of putting off the goods of his employers and improving his own account of commission he had fidgeted through the suite of apartments without finding the least opportunity to touch upon that which he considered as the principal end of his existence even the story of rizzios assassination presented no ideas to this emissary of commerce until the housekeeper appealed in support of her narrative to the dusky stains of blood upon the floor  these are the stains she said nothing will remove them from the place there they have been for two hundred and fifty years and there they will remain while the floor is left standingneither water nor anything else will ever remove them from that spot  now our cockney amongst other articles sold scouring drops as they are called and a stain of two hundred and fifty years standing was interesting to him not because it had been caused by the blood of a queens favourite slain in her apartment but because it offered so admirable an opportunity to prove the efficacy of his unequalled detergent elixir down on his knees went our friend but neither in horror nor devotion  two hundred and fifty years maam and nothing take it away why if it had been five hundred i have something in my pocket will fetch it out in five minutes dye see this elixir maam i will show you the stain vanish in a moment  accordingly wetting one end of his handkerchief with the all deterging specific he began to rub away on the planks without heeding the remonstrances of mrs policy she good soul stood at first in astonishment like the abbess of st bridgets when a profane visitant drank up the vial of brandy which had long passed muster among the relics of the cloister for the tears of the blessed saint the venerable guardian of st bridget probably expected the interference of her patronessshe of holyrood might perhaps hope that david ruzzios spectre would arise to prevent the profanation but mrs policy stood not long in the silence of horror she uplifted her voice and screamed as loudly as queen mary herself when the dreadful deed was in the act of perpetration  harrow now out and walawa she cried  i happened to be taking my morning walk in the adjoining gallery pondering in my mind why the kings of scotland who hung around me should be each and every one painted with a nose like the knocker of a door when lo the walls once more reechoed with such shrieks as formerly were as often heard in the scottish palaces as were sounds of revelry and music somewhat surprised at such an alarm in a place so solitary i hastened to the spot and found the well meaning traveller scrubbing the floor like a housemaid while mrs policy dragging him by the skirts of the coat in vain endeavoured to divert him from his sacrilegious purpose it cost me some trouble to explain to the zealous purifier of silk stockings embroidered waistcoats broadcloth and deal planks that there were such things in the world as stains which ought to remain indelible on account of the associations with which they are connected our good friend viewed everything of the kind only as the means of displaying the virtue of his vaunted commodity he comprehended however that he would not be permitted to proceed to exemplify its powers on the present occasion as two or three inhabitants appeared who like me threatened to maintain the housekeepers side of the question he therefore took his leave muttering that he had always heard the scots were a nasty people but had no idea they carried it so far as to choose to have the floors of their palaces blood boltered like banquos ghost when to remove them would have cost but a hundred drops of the infallible detergent elixir prepared and sold by messrs scrub and rub in five shilling and ten shilling bottles each bottle being marked with the initials of the inventor to counterfeit which would be to incur the pains of forgery  freed from the odious presence of this lover of cleanliness my good friend mrs policy was profuse in her expressions of thanks and yet her gratitude instead of exhausting itself in these declarations according to the way of the world continues as lively at this moment as if she had never thanked me at all it is owing to her recollection of this piece of good service that i have the permission of wandering like the ghost of some departed gentleman usher through these deserted halls sometimes as the old irish ditty expresses it  thinking upon things that are long enough agoand sometimes wishing i could with the good luck of most editors of romantic narrative light upon some hidden crypt or massive antique cabinet which should yield to my researches an almost illegible manuscript containing the authentic particulars of some of the strange deeds of those wild days of the unhappy mary  my dear mrs baliol used to sympathise with me when i regretted that all godsends of this nature had ceased to occur and that an author might chatter his teeth to pieces by the seaside without a wave ever wafting to him a casket containing such a history as that of automates that he might break his shins in stumbling through a hundred vaults without finding anything but rats and mice and become the tenant of a dozen sets of shabby tenements without finding that they contained any manuscript but the weekly bill for board and lodging a dairymaid of these degenerate days might as well wash and deck her dairy in hopes of finding the fairy tester in her shoe  it is a sad and too true a tale cousin said mrs baliol i am sure we all have occasion to regret the want of these ready supplements to a failing invention but you most of all have right to complain that the fairest have not favoured your researchesyou who have shown the world that the age of chivalry still existsyou the knight of croftangry who braved the fury of the london prentice bold in behalf of the fair dame policy and the memorial of rizzios slaughter is it not a pity cousin considering the feat of chivalry was otherwise so much according to ruleis it not i say a great pity that the lady had not been a little younger and the legend a little older  why as to the age at which a fair dame loses the benefit of chivalry and is no longer entitled to crave boon of brave knight that i leave to the statutes of the order of errantry but for the blood of rizzio i take up the gauntlet and maintain against all and sundry that i hold the stains to be of no modern date but to have been actually the consequence and the record of that terrible assassination  as i cannot accept the challenge to the field fair cousin i am contented to require proof  the unaltered tradition of the palace and the correspondence of the existing state of things with that tradition  explain if you please  i will the universal tradition bears that when rizzio was dragged out of the chamber of the queen the heat and fury of the assassins who struggled which should deal him most wounds despatched him at the door of the anteroom at the door of the apartment therefore the greater quantity of the ill fated minions blood was spilled and there the marks of it are still shown it is reported further by historians that mary continued her entreaties for his life mingling her prayers with screams and exclamations until she knew that he was assuredly slain on which she wiped her eyes and said i will now study revenge  all this is granted but the bloodwould it not wash out or waste out think you in so many years  i am coming to that presently the constant tradition of the palace says that mary discharged any measures to be taken to remove the marks of slaughter which she had resolved should remain as a memorial to quicken and confirm her purposed vengeance but it is added that satisfied with the knowledge that it existed and not desirous to have the ghastly evidence always under her eye she caused a traverse as it is called that is a temporary screen of boards to be drawn along the under part of the anteroom a few feet from the door so as to separate the place stained with the blood from the rest of the apartment and involve it in considerable obscurity now this temporary partition still exists and by running across and interrupting the plan of the roof and cornices plainly intimates that it has been intended to serve some temporary purpose since it disfigures the proportions of the room interferes with the ornaments of the ceiling and could only have been put there for some such purpose as hiding an object too disagreeable to be looked upon as to the objection that the bloodstains would have disappeared in course of time i apprehend that if measures to efface them were not taken immediately after the affair happenedif the blood in other words were allowed to sink into the wood the stain would become almost indelible now not to mention that our scottish palaces were not particularly well washed in those days and that there were no patent drops to assist the labours of the mop i think it very probable that these dark relics might subsist for a long course of time even if mary had not desired or directed that they should be preserved but screened by the traverse from public sight i know several instances of similar bloodstains remaining for a great many years and i doubt whether after a certain time anything can remove them save the carpenters plane if any seneschal by way of increasing the interest of the apartments had by means of paint or any other mode of imitation endeavoured to palm upon posterity supposititious stigmata i conceive that the impostor would have chosen the queens cabinet and the bedroom for the scene of his trick placing his bloody tracery where it could be distinctly seen by visitors instead of hiding it behind the traverse in this manner the existence of the said traverse or temporary partition is also extremely difficult to be accounted for if the common and ordinary tradition be rejected in short all the rest of this striking locality is so true to the historical fact that i think it may well bear out the additional circumstance of the blood on the floor  i profess to you answered mrs baliol that i am very willing to be converted to your faith we talk of a credulous vulgar without always recollecting that there is a vulgar incredulity which in historical matters as well as in those of religion finds it easier to doubt than to examine and endeavours to assume the credit of an esprit fort by denying whatever happens to be a little beyond the very limited comprehension of the sceptic and so that point being settled and you possessing as we understand the open sesamum into these secret apartments how if we may ask do you intend to avail yourself of your privilege do you propose to pass the night in the royal bedchamber  for what purpose my dear lady if to improve the rheumatism this east wind may serve the purpose  improve the rheumatism heaven forbid that would be worse than adding colours to the violet no i mean to recommend a night on the couch of the nose of scotland merely to improve the imagination who knows what dreams might be produced by a night spent in a mansion of so many memories for aught i know the iron door of the postern stair might open at the dead hour of midnight and as at the time of the conspiracy forth might sally the phantom assassins with stealthy step and ghastly look to renew the semblance of the deed there comes the fierce fanatic ruthven party hatred enabling him to bear the armour which would otherwise weigh down a form extenuated by wasting disease see how his writhen features show under the hollow helmet like those of a corpse tenanted by a demon whose vindictive purpose looks out at the flashing eyes while the visage has the stillness of death yonder appears the tall form of the boy darnley as goodly in person as vacillating in resolution yonder he advances with hesitating step and yet more hesitating purpose his childish fear having already overcome his childish passion he is in the plight of a mischievous lad who has fired a mine and who now expecting the explosion in remorse and terror would give his life to quench the train which his own hand lighted yonderyonderbut i forget the rest of the worthy cutthroats help me if you can  summon up said i the postulate george douglas the most active of the gang let him arise at your callthe claimant of wealth which he does not possess the partaker of the illustrious blood of douglas but which in his veins is sullied with illegitimacy paint him the ruthless the daring the ambitiousso nigh greatness yet debarred from it so near to wealth yet excluded from possessing it a political tantalus ready to do or dare anything to terminate his necessities and assert his imperfect claims  admirable my dear croftangry but what is a postulate  pooh my dear madam you disturb the current of my ideas the postulate was in scottish phrase the candidate for some benefice which he had not yet attained george douglas who stabbed rizzio was the postulate for the temporal possessions of the rich abbey of arbroath  i stand informed come proceed who comes next continued mrs baliol  who comes next yon tall thin made savage looking man with the petronel in his hand must be andrew ker of faldonside a brothers son i believe of the celebrated sir david ker of cessford his look and bearing those of a border freebooter his disposition so savage that during the fray in the cabinet he presented his loaded piece at the bosom of the young and beautiful queen that queen also being within a few weeks of becoming a mother  brave beau cousin well having raised your bevy of phantoms i hope you do not intend to send them back to their cold beds to warm them you will put them to some action and since you do threaten the canongate with your desperate quill you surely mean to novelise or to dramatise if you will this most singular of all tragedies  worsethat is less interestingperiods of history have been indeed shown up for furnishing amusement to the peaceable ages which have succeeded but dear lady the events are too well known in marys days to be used as vehicles of romantic fiction what can a better writer than myself add to the elegant and forcible narrative of robertson so adieu to my vision i awake like john bunyan and behold it is a dream well enough that i awake without a sciatica which would have probably rewarded my slumbers had i profaned queen marys bed by using it as a mechanical resource to awaken a torpid imagination  this will never do cousin answered mrs baliol you must get over all these scruples if you would thrive in the character of a romantic historian which you have determined to embrace what is the classic robertson to you the light which he carried was that of a lamp to illuminate the dark events of antiquity yours is a magic lantern to raise up wonders which never existed no reader of sense wonders at your historical inaccuracies any more than he does to see punch in the show box seated on the same throne with king solomon in his glory or to hear him hallooing out to the patriarch amid the deluge mighty hazy weather master noah  do not mistake me my dear madam said i i am quite conscious of my own immunities as a tale teller but even the mendacious mr fag in sheridans rivals assures us that though he never scruples to tell a lie at his masters command yet it hurts his conscience to be found out now this is the reason why i avoid in prudence all well known paths of history where every one can read the finger posts carefully set up to advise them of the right turning and the very boys and girls who learn the history of britain by way of question and answer hoot at a poor author if he abandons the highway  do not be discouraged however cousin chrystal there are plenty of wildernesses in scottish history through which unless i am greatly misinformed no certain paths have been laid down from actual survey but which are only described by imperfect tradition which fills up with wonders and with legends the periods in which no real events are recognised to have taken place even thus as mat prior says  geographers on pathless downs place elephants instead of towns  if such be your advice my dear lady said i the course of my story shall take its rise upon this occasion at a remote period of history and in a province removed from my natural sphere of the canongate  it was under the influence of those feelings that i undertook the following historical romance which often suspended and flung aside is now arrived at a size too important to be altogether thrown away although there may be little prudence in sending it to the press  i have not placed in the mouth of the characters the lowland scotch dialect now spoken because unquestionably the scottish of that day resembled very closely the anglo saxon with a sprinkling of french or norman to enrich it those who wish to investigate the subject may consult the chronicles of winton and the history of bruce by archdeacon barbour but supposing my own skill in the ancient scottish were sufficient to invest the dialogue with its peculiarities a translation must have been necessary for the benefit of the general reader the scottish dialect may be therefore considered as laid aside unless where the use of peculiar words may add emphasis or vivacity to the composition     preface  in continuing the lucubrations of chrystal croftangry it occurred that although the press had of late years teemed with works of various descriptions concerning the scottish gad no attempt had hitherto been made to sketch their manners as these might be supposed to have existed at the period when the statute book as well as the page of the chronicler begins to present constant evidence of the difficulties to which the crown was exposed while the haughty house of douglas all but overbalanced its authority on the southern border and the north was at the same time torn in pieces by the yet untamed savageness of the highland races and the daring loftiness to which some of the remoter chieftains still carried their pretensions  the well authenticated fact of two powerful clans having deputed each thirty champions to fight out a quarrel of old standing in presence of king robert iii his brother the duke of albany and the whole court of scotland at perth in the year of grace 1396 seemed to mark with equal distinctness the rancour of these mountain feuds and the degraded condition of the general government of the country and it was fixed upon accordingly as the point on which the main incidents of a romantic narrative might be made to hinge the characters of robert iii his ambitious brother and his dissolute son seemed to offer some opportunities of interesting contrast and the tragic fate of the heir of the throne with its immediate consequences might serve to complete the picture of cruelty and lawlessness  two features of the story of this barrier battle on the inch of perththe flight of one of the appointed champions and the reckless heroism of a townsman that voluntarily offered for a small piece of coin to supply his place in the mortal encountersuggested the imaginary persons on whom much of the novel is expended the fugitive celt might have been easily dealt with had a ludicrous style of colouring been adopted but it appeared to the author that there would be more of novelty as well as of serious interest if he could succeed in gaining for him something of that sympathy which is incompatible with the total absence of respect miss baillie had drawn a coward by nature capable of acting as a hero under the strong impulse of filial affection it seemed not impossible to conceive the case of one constitutionally weak of nerve being supported by feelings of honour and of jealousy up to a certain point and then suddenly giving way under circumstances to which the bravest heart could hardly refuse compassion  the controversy as to who really were the clans that figured in the barbarous conflict of the inch has been revived since the publication of the fair maid of perth and treated in particular at great length by mr robert mackay of thurso in his very curious history of the house and clan of mackay without pretending to say that he has settled any part of the question in the affirmative this gentleman certainly seems to have quite succeeded in proving that his own worthy sept had no part in the transaction the mackays were in that age seated as they have since continued to be in the extreme north of the island and their chief at the time was a personage of such importance that his name and proper designation could not have been omitted in the early narratives of the occurrence he on one occasion brought four thousand of his clan to the aid of the royal banner against the lord of the isles this historian is of opinion that the clan quhele of wyntoun were the camerons who appear to have about that period been often designated as macewans and to have gained much more recently the name of cameron ie wrynose from a blemish in the physiognomy of some heroic chief of the line of lochiel this view of the case is also adopted by douglas in his baronage where he frequently mentions the bitter feuds between clan chattan and clan kay and identifies the latter sept in reference to the events of 1396 with the camerons it is perhaps impossible to clear up thoroughly this controversy little interesting in itself at least to readers on this side of inverness the names as we have them in wyntoun are clanwhewyl and clachinya the latter probably not correctly transcribed in the scoti chronicon they are clanquhele and clankay hector boece writes clanchattan and clankay in which he is followed by leslie while buchanan disdains to disfigure his page with their gaelic designations at all and merely describes them as two powerful races in the wild and lawless region beyond the grampians out of this jumble what sassenach can pretend dare lucem the name clanwheill appears so late as 1594 in an act of james vi is it not possible that it may be after all a mere corruption of clan lochiel  the reader may not be displeased to have wyntouns original rhymes bk ix chap xvii        a thousand and thre hundyr yere      nynty and sex to mak all clere

artisan in offering to take a share in the conflict both incidents however were introduced no doubt from tradition by the continuator of fordun bower whose narrative is in these words   anno dom millesimo trecentesimo nonagesimo sexto magna pars borealis scotiae trans alpes inquietata fuit per duos pestiferos cateranos et eorum sequaces viz scheabeg et suos consanguinarios qui clankay et cristi jonsonem ac suos qui clanqwhele dicebantur qui nullo pacto vel tractatu pacificari poterant nullaque arte regis vel gubernatoris poterant edomari quoadusque nobilis et industriosus dominus david de lindesay de crawford at dominus thomas comes moraviae diligentiam et vires apposuerunt ac inter partes sic tractaverunt ut coram domino rege certo die convenirent apud perth et alterutra pars eligeret de progenie sua triginta personas adversus triginta de parte contraria cum gladiis tantum et arcubus et sagittis absque deploidibus vel armaturis aliis praeter bipennes et sic congredientes finem liti ponerant et terra pace potiretur utrique igitur parti summe placuit contractus et die lunae proximo ante festum sancti michaelis apud north insulam de perth coram rege et gubernatore et innumerabili multitudine comparentes conflictum acerrimum inierunt ubi de sexaginta interfecti sunt omnes excepto uno ex parte clankay et undecim exceptis ex parte altera hoc etiam ibi accidit quod omnes in procinctu belli constituti unus eorum locum diffugii considerans inter omnes in amnem elabitur et aquam de thaya natando transgreditur a millenis insequitur sed nusquam apprehenditur stant igitur partes attonitae tanquam non ad conflictum progressuri ob defectum evasi noluit enim pars integrum habens numerum sociorum consentire ut unus de suis demeretur nec potuit pars altera quocumque pretio alterum ad supplendum vicem fugientis inducere stupent igitur omnes haerentes de damno fugitivi conquerentes et cum totum illud opus cessare putaretur ecce in medio prorupit unus stipulosus vernaculus statura modicus sed efferus dicens ecce ego quis me conducet intrare cum operariis istis ad hunc ludum theatralem pro dimidia enim marca ludum experiar ultra hoc petens ut si vivus de palaestra evasero victum a quocumque vestrum recipiam dum vixero quia sicut dicitur majorem caritatem nemo habet quam ut animam suam ponat suis pro amicis quali mercede donabor qui animam meam pro

quievit nec ibidem fuit ut supra cateranorum excursus  the scene is heightened with many florid additions by boece and leslie and the contending savages in buchanan utter speeches after the most approved pattern of livy  the devotion of the young chief of clan quheles foster father and foster brethren in the novel is a trait of clannish fidelity of which highland story furnishes many examples in the battle of inverkeithing between the royalists and oliver cromwells troops a foster father and seven brave sons are known to have thus sacrificed themselves for sir hector maclean of duart the old man whenever one of his boys fell thrusting forward another to fill his place at the right hand of the beloved chief with the very words adopted in the novel another for hector  nay the feeling could outlive generations the late much lamented general stewart of garth in his account of the battle of killiecrankie informs us that lochiel was attended on the field by the son of his foster brother  this faithful adherent followed him like his shadow ready to assist him with his sword or cover him from the shot of the enemy suddenly the chief missed his friend from his side and turning round to look what had become of him saw him lying on his back with his breast pierced by an arrow he had hardly breath before he expired to tell lochiel that seeing an enemy a highlander in general mackays army aiming at him with a bow and arrow he sprung behind him and thus sheltered him from instant death this observes the gallant david stewart is a species of duty not often practised perhaps by our aide de camps of the present daysketches of the highlanders vol i p 65  i have only to add that the second series of chronicles of the canongate with the chapter introductory which precedes appeared in may 1828 and had a favourable reception  abbotsford aug 15 1831     chapter i       behold the tiber the vain roman cried      viewing the ample tay from baiglies side      but wheres the scot that would the vaunt repay      and hail the puny tiber for the tay       anonymous   among all the provinces in scotland if an intelligent stranger were asked to describe the most varied and the most beautiful it is probable he would name the county of perth a native also of any other district of caledonia though his partialities might lead him to prefer his native county in the first instance would certainly class that of perth in the second and thus give its inhabitants a fair right to plead that prejudice apart perthshire forms the fairest portion of the northern kingdom it is long since lady mary wortley montagu with that excellent taste which characterises her writings expressed her opinion that the most interesting district of every country and that which exhibits the varied beauties of natural scenery in greatest perfection is that where the mountains sink down upon the champaign or more level land the most picturesque if not the highest hills are also to be found in the county of perth the rivers find their way out of the mountainous region by the wildest leaps and through the most romantic passes connecting the highlands with the lowlands above the vegetation of a happier climate and soil is mingled with the magnificent characteristics of mountain scenery and woods groves and thickets in profusion clothe the base of the hills ascend up the ravines and mingle with the precipices it is in such favoured regions that the traveller finds what the poet gray or some one else has termed beauty lying in the lap of terror  from the same advantage of situation this favoured province presents a variety of the most pleasing character its lakes woods and mountains may vie in beauty with any that the highland tour exhibits while perthshire contains amidst this romantic scenery and in some places in connexion with it many fertile and habitable tracts which may vie with the richness of merry england herself the county has also been the scene of many remarkable exploits and events some of historical importance others interesting to the poet and romancer though recorded in popular tradition alone it was in these vales that the saxons of the plain and the gad of the mountains had many a desperate and bloody encounter in which it was frequently impossible to decide the palm of victory between the mailed chivalry of the low country and the plaided clans whom they opposed  perth so eminent for the beauty of its situation is a place of great antiquity and old tradition assigns to the town the importance of a roman foundation that victorious nation it is said pretended to recognise the tiber in the much more magnificent and navigable tay and to acknowledge the large level space well known by the name of the north inch as having a near resemblance to their campus martins the city was often the residence of our monarchs who although they had no palace at perth found the cistercian convent amply sufficient for the reception of their court it was here that james the first one of the wisest and best of the scottish kings fell a victim to the jealousy of the vengeful aristocracy here also occurred the mysterious conspiracy of gowrie the scene of which has only of late been effaced by the destruction of the ancient palace in which the tragedy was acted the antiquarian society of perth with just zeal for the objects of their pursuit have published an accurate plan of this memorable mansion with some remarks upon its connexion with the narrative of the plot which display equal acuteness and candour  one of the most beautiful points of view which britain or perhaps the world can afford is or rather we may say was the prospect from a spot called the wicks of baiglie being a species of niche at which the traveller arrived after a long stage from kinross through a waste and uninteresting country and from which as forming a pass over the summit of a ridgy eminence which he had gradually surmounted he beheld stretching beneath him the valley of the tay traversed by its ample and lordly stream the town of perth with its two large meadows or inches its steeples and its towers the hills of moncrieff and kinnoul faintly rising into picturesque rocks partly clothed with woods the rich margin of the river studded with elegant mansions and the distant view of the huge grampian mountains the northern screen of this exquisite landscape the alteration of the road greatly it must be owned to the improvement of general intercourse avoids this magnificent point of view and the landscape is introduced more gradually and partially to the eye though the approach must be still considered as extremely beautiful there is still we believe a footpath left open by which the station at the wicks of baiglie may be approached and the traveller by quitting his horse or equipage and walking a few hundred yards may still compare the real landscape with the sketch which we have attempted to give but it is not in our power to communicate or in his to receive the exquisite charm which surprise gives to pleasure when so splendid a view arises when least expected or hoped for and which chrystal croftangry experienced when he beheld for the first time the matchless scene  childish wonder indeed was an ingredient in my delight for i was not above fifteen years old and as this had been the first excursion which i was permitted to make on a pony of my own i also experienced the glow of independence mingled with that degree of anxiety which the most conceited boy feels when he is first abandoned to his own undirected counsels i recollect pulling up the reins without meaning to do so and gazing on the scene before me as if i had been afraid it would shift like those in a theatre before i could distinctly observe its different parts or convince myself that what i saw was real since that hour and the period is now more than fifty years past the recollection of that inimitable landscape has possessed the strongest influence over my mind and retained its place as a memorable thing when much that was influential on my own fortunes has fled from my recollection it is therefore unnatural that whilst deliberating on what might be brought forward for the amusement of the public i should pitch upon some narrative connected with the splendid scenery which made so much impression on my youthful imagination and which may perhaps have that effect in setting off the imperfections of the composition which ladies suppose a fine set of china to possess in heightening the flavour of indifferent tea  the period at which i propose to commence is however considerably earlier of the remarkable historical transactions to which i have already alluded as the events which i am about to recount occurred during the last years of the 14th century when the scottish sceptre was swayed by the gentle but feeble hand of john who on being called to the throne assumed the title of robert the third    chapter ii       a country lip may have the velvet touch      though shes no lady she may please as much       dryden   perth boasting as we have already mentioned so large a portion of the beauties of inanimate nature has at no time been without its own share of those charms which are at once more interesting and more transient to be called the fair maid of perth would at any period have been a high distinction and have inferred no mean superiority in beauty where there were many to claim that much envied attribute but in the feudal times to which we now call the readers attention female beauty was a quality of much higher importance than it has been since the ideas of chivalry have been in a great measure extinguished the love of the ancient cavaliers was a licensed species of idolatry which the love of heaven alone was theoretically supposed to approach in intensity and which in practice it seldom equalled god and the ladies were familiarly appealed to in the same breath and devotion to the fair sex was as peremptorily enjoined upon the aspirant to the honour of chivalry as that which was due to heaven at such a period in society the power of beauty was almost unlimited it could level the highest rank with that which was immeasurably inferior  it was but in the reign preceding that of robert iii that beauty alone had elevated a person of inferior rank and indifferent morals to share the scottish throne and many women less artful or less fortunate had risen to greatness from a state of concubinage for which the manners of the times made allowance and apology such views might have dazzled a girl of higher birth than catharine or katie glover who was universally acknowledged to be the most beautiful young woman of the city or its vicinity and whose renown as the fair maid of perth had drawn on her much notice from the young gallants of the royal court when it chanced to be residing in or near perth insomuch that more than one nobleman of the highest rank and most distinguished for deeds of chivalry were more attentive to exhibit feats of horsemanship as they passed the door of old simon glover in what was called couvrefew or curfew street than to distinguish themselves in the tournaments where the noblest dames of scotland were spectators of their address but the glovers daughterfor as was common with the citizens and artisans of that early period her father simon derived his surname from the trade which he practisedshowed no inclination to listen to any gallantry which came from those of a station highly exalted above that which she herself occupied and though probably in no degree insensible to her personal charms seemed desirous to confine her conquests to those who were within her own sphere of life indeed her beauty being of that kind which we connect more with the mind than with the person was notwithstanding her natural kindness and gentleness of disposition rather allied to reserve than to gaiety even when in company with her equals and the earnestness with which she attended upon the exercises of devotion induced many to think that catharine glover nourished the private wish to retire from the world and bury herself in the recesses of the cloister but to such a sacrifice should it be meditated it was not to be expected her father reputed a wealthy man and having this only child would yield a willing consent  in her resolution of avoiding the addresses of the gallant courtiers the reigning beauty of perth was confirmed by the sentiments of her parent  let them go he saidlet them go catharine those gallants with their capering horses their jingling spurs their plumed bonnets and their trim mustachios they are not of our class nor will we aim at pairing with them tomorrow is st valentines day when every bird chooses her mate but you will not see the linnet pair with the sparrow hawk nor the robin redbreast with the kite my father was an honest burgher of perth and could use his needle as well as i can did there come war to the gates of our fair burgh down went needles thread and shamoy leather and out came the good head piece and target from the dark nook and the long lance from above the chimney show me a day that either he or i was absent when the provost made his musters thus we have led our lives my girl working to win our bread and fighting to defend it i will have no son in law that thinks himself better than me and for these lords and knights i trust thou wilt always remember thou art too low to be their lawful love and too high to be their unlawful loon and now lay by thy work lass for it is holytide eve and it becomes us to go to the evening service and pray that heaven may send thee a good valentine tomorrow  so the fair maid of perth laid aside the splendid hawking glove which she was embroidering for the lady drummond and putting on her holyday kirtle prepared to attend her father to the blackfriars monastery which was adjacent to couvrefew street in which they lived on their passage simon glover an ancient and esteemed burgess of perth somewhat stricken in years and increased in substance received from young and old the homage due to his velvet jerkin and his golden chain while the well known beauty of catharine though concealed beneath her screenwhich resembled the mantilla still worn in flanderscalled both obeisances and doffings of the bonnet from young and old  as the pair moved on arm in arm they were followed by a tall handsome young man dressed in a yeomans habit of the plainest kind but which showed to advantage his fine limbs as the handsome countenance that looked out from a quantity of curled tresses surmounted by a small scarlet bonnet became that species of headdress he had no other weapon than a staff in his hand it not being thought fit that persons of his degree for he was an apprentice to the old glover should appear on the street armed with sword or dagger a privilege which the jackmen or military retainers of the nobility esteemed exclusively their own he attended his master at holytide partly in the character of a domestic or guardian should there be cause for his interference but it was not difficult to discern by the earnest attention which he paid to catharine glover that it was to her rather than to her father that he desired to dedicate his good offices  generally speaking there was no opportunity for his zeal displaying itself for a common feeling of respect induced passengers to give way to the father and daughter  but when the steel caps barrets and plumes of squires archers and men at arms began to be seen among the throng the wearers of these warlike distinctions were more rude in their demeanour than the quiet citizens more than once when from chance or perhaps from an assumption of superior importance such an individual took the wall of simon in passing the glovers youthful attendant bristled up with a look of defiance and the air of one who sought to distinguish his zeal in his mistresss service by its ardour as frequently did conachar for such was the lads name receive a check from his master who gave him to understand that he did not wish his interference before he required it  foolish boy he said hast thou not lived long enough in my shop to know that a blow will breed a brawl that a dirk will cut the skin as fast as a needle pierces leather that i love peace though i never feared war and care not which side of the causeway my daughter and i walk upon so we may keep our road in peace and quietness  conachar excused himself as zealous for his masters honour yet was scarce able to pacify the old citizen  what have we to do with honour said simon glover if thou wouldst remain in my service thou must think of honesty and leave honour to the swaggering fools who wear steel at their heels and iron on their shoulders if you wish to wear and use such garniture you are welcome but it shall not be in my house or in my company  conachar seemed rather to kindle at this rebuke than to submit to it but a sign from catharine if that slight raising of her little finger was indeed a sign had more effect than the angry reproof of his master and the youth laid aside the military air which seemed natural to him and relapsed into the humble follower of a quiet burgher  meantime the little party were overtaken by a tall young man wrapped in a cloak which obscured or muffled a part of his facea practice often used by the gallants of the time when they did not wish to be known or were abroad in quest of adventures he seemed in short one who might say to the world around him i desire for the present not to be known or addressed in my own character but as i am answerable to myself alone for my actions i wear my incognito but for forms sake and care little whether you see through it or not  he came on the right side of catharine who had hold of her fathers arm and slackened his pace as if joining their party  good even to you goodman  the same to your worship and thanks may i pray you to pass on our pace is too slow for that of your lordship our company too mean for that of your fathers son  my fathers son can best judge of that old man i have business to talk of with you and with my fair st catharine here the loveliest and most obdurate saint in the calendar  with deep reverence my lord said the old man i would remind you that this is good st valentines eve which is no time for business and that i can have your worshipful commands by a serving man as early as it pleases you to send them  there is no time like the present said the persevering youth whose rank seemed to be a kind which set him above ceremony i wish to know whether the buff doublet be finished which i commissioned some time since and from you pretty catharine here he sank his voice to a whisper i desire to be informed whether your fair fingers have been employed upon it agreeably to your promise but i need not ask you for my poor heart has felt the pang of each puncture that pierced the garment which was to cover it traitress how wilt thou answer for thus tormenting the heart that loves thee so dearly  let me entreat you my lord said catharine to forego this wild talk it becomes not you to speak thus or me to listen we are of poor rank but honest manners and the presence of the father ought to protect the child from such expressions even from your lordship  this she spoke so low that neither her father nor conachar could understand what she said  well tyrant answered the persevering gallant i will plague you no longer now providing you will let me see you from your window tomorrow when the sun first peeps over the eastern hills and give me right to be your valentine for the year  not so my lord my father but now told me that hawks far less eagles pair not with the humble linnet seek some court lady to whom your favours will be honour to meyour highness must permit me to speak the plain truththey can be nothing but disgrace  as they spoke thus the party arrived at the gate of the church  your lordship will i trust permit us here to take leave of you said her father i am well aware how little you will alter your pleasure for the pain and uneasiness you may give to such as us but from the throng of attendants at the gate your lordship may see that there are others in the church to whom even your gracious lordship must pay respect  yesrespect and who pays any respect to me said the haughty young lord a miserable artisan and his daughter too much honoured by my slightest notice have the insolence to tell me that my notice dishonours them well my princess of white doe skin and blue silk i will teach you to rue this  as he murmured thus the glover and his daughter entered the dominican church and their attendant conachar in attempting to follow them closely jostled it may be not unwillingly the young nobleman the gallant starting from his unpleasing reverie and perhaps considering this as an intentional insult seized on the young man by the breast struck him and threw him from him his irritated opponent recovered himself with difficulty and grasped towards his own side as if seeking a sword or dagger in the place where it was usually worn but finding none he made a gesture of disappointed rage and entered the church during the few seconds he remained the young nobleman stood with his arms folded on his breast with a haughty smile as if defying him to do his worst when conachar had entered the church his opponent adjusting his cloak yet closer about his face made a private signal by holding up one of his gloves he was instantly joined by two men who disguised like himself had waited his motions at a little distance they spoke together earnestly after which the young nobleman retired in one direction his friends or followers going off in another  simon glover before he entered the church cast a look towards the group but had taken his place among the congregation before they separated themselves he knelt down with the air of a man who has something burdensome on his mind but when the service was ended he seemed free from anxiety as one who had referred himself and his troubles to the disposal of heaven the ceremony of high mass was performed with considerable solemnity a number of noblemen and ladies of rank being present preparations had indeed been made for the reception of the good old king himself but some of those infirmities to which he was subject had prevented robert iii from attending the service as was his wont when the congregation were dismissed the glover and his beautiful daughter lingered for some time for the purpose of making their several shrifts in the confessionals where the priests had taken their places for discharging that part of their duty thus it happened that the night had fallen dark and the way was solitary when they returned along the now deserted streets to their own dwelling  most persons had betaken themselves to home and to bed they who still lingered in the street were night walkers or revellers the idle and swaggering retainers of the haughty nobles who were much wont to insult the peaceful passengers relying on the impunity which their masters court favour was too apt to secure them  it was perhaps in apprehension of mischief from some character of this kind that conachar stepping up to the glover said master walk fasterwe are doggd  doggd sayest thou by whom and by how many  by one man muffled in his cloak who follows us like our shadow  then will it never mend my pace along the couvrefew street for the best one man that ever trode it  but he has arms said conachar  and so have we and hands and legs and feet why sure conachar you are not afraid of one man  afraid answered conachar indignant at the insinuation you shall soon know if i am afraid  now you are as far on the other side of the mark thou foolish boy thy temper has no middle course there is no occasion to make a brawl though we do not run walk thou before with catharine and i will take thy place we cannot be exposed to danger so near home as we are  the glover fell behind accordingly and certainly observed a person keep so close to them as the time and place considered justified some suspicion when they crossed the street he also crossed it and when they advanced or slackened their pace the strangers was in proportion accelerated or diminished the matter would have been of very little consequence had simon glover been alone but the beauty of his daughter might render her the object of some profligate scheme in a country where the laws afforded such slight protection to those who had not the means to defend themselves  conachar and his fair charge having arrived on the threshold of their own apartment which was opened to them by an old female servant the burghers uneasiness was ended determined however to ascertain if possible whether there had been any cause for it he called out to the man whose motions had occasioned the alarm and who stood still though he seemed to keep out of reach of the light come step forward my friend and do not play at bo peep knowest thou not that they who walk like phantoms in the dark are apt to encounter the conjuration of a quarterstaff step forward i say and show us thy shapes man  why so i can master glover said one of the deepest voices that ever answered question i can show my shapes well enough only i wish they could bear the light something better  body of me exclaimed simon i should know that voice and is it thou in thy bodily person harry gow nay beshrew me if thou passest this door with dry lips what man curfew has not rung yet and if it had it were no reason why it should part father and son come in man dorothy shall get us something to eat and we will jingle a can ere thou leave us come in i say my daughter kate will be right glad to see thee  by this time he had pulled the person whom he welcomed so cordially into a sort of kitchen which served also upon ordinary occasions the office of parlour its ornaments were trenchers of pewter mixed with a silver cup or two which in the highest degree of cleanliness occupied a range of shelves like those of a beauffet popularly called the bink a good fire with the assistance of a blazing lamp spread light and cheerfulness through the apartment and a savoury smell of some victuals which dorothy was preparing did not at all offend the unrefined noses of those whose appetite they were destined to satisfy  their unknown attendant now stood in full light among them and though his appearance was neither dignified nor handsome his face and figure were not only deserving of attention but seemed in some manner to command it he was rather below the middle stature but the breadth of his shoulders length and brawniness of his arms and the muscular appearance of the whole man argued a most unusual share of strength and a frame kept in vigour by constant exercise his legs were somewhat bent but not in a manner which could be said to approach to deformity on the contrary which seemed to correspond to the strength of his frame though it injured in some degree its symmetry  his dress was of buff hide and he wore in a belt around his waist a heavy broadsword and a dirk or poniard as if to defend his purse which burgher fashion was attached to the same cincture the head was well proportioned round close cropped and curled thickly with black hair there was daring and resolution in the dark eye but the other features seemed to express a bashful timidity mingled with good humor and obvious satisfaction at meeting with his old friends  abstracted from the bashful expression which was that of the moment the forehead of henry gow or smith for he was indifferently so called was high and noble but the lower part of the face was less happily formed the mouth was large and well furnished with a set of firm and beautiful teeth the appearance of which corresponded with the air of personal health and muscular strength which the whole frame indicated a short thick beard and mustachios which had lately been arranged with some care completed the picture his age could not exceed eight and twenty  the family appeared all well pleased with the unexpected appearance of an old friend simon glover shook his hand again and again dorothy made her compliments and catharine herself offered freely her hand which henry held in his massive grasp as if he designed to carry it to his lips but after a moments hesitation desisted from fear lest the freedom might be ill taken not that there was any resistance on the part of the little hand which lay passive in his grasp but there was a smile mingled with the blush on her cheek which seemed to increase the confusion of the gallant  her father on his part called out frankly as he saw his friends hesitation her lips manher lips and thats a proffer i would not make to every one who crosses my threshold but by good st valentine whose holyday will dawn tomorrow i am so glad to see thee in the bonny city of perth again that it would be hard to tell the thing i could refuse thee  the smith for as has been said such was the craft of this sturdy artisan was encouraged modestly to salute the fair maid who yielded the courtesy with a smile of affection that might have become a sister saying at the same time let me hope that i welcome back to perth a repentant and amended man  he held her hand as if about to answer then suddenly as one who lost courage at the moment relinquished his grasp and drawing back as if afraid of what he had done his dark countenance glowing with bashfulness mixed with delight he sat down by the fire on the opposite side from that which catharine occupied  come dorothy speed thee with the food old woman and conacharwhere is conachar  he is gone to bed sir with a headache said catharine in a hesitating voice  go call him dorothy said the old glover i will not be used thus by him his highland blood forsooth is too gentle to lay a trencher or spread a napkin and he expects to enter our ancient and honourable craft without duly waiting and tending upon his master and teacher in all matters of lawful obedience go call him i say i will not be thus neglected  dorothy was presently heard screaming upstairs or more probably up a ladder to the cock loft to which the recusant apprentice had made an untimely retreat a muttered answer was returned and soon after conachar appeared in the eating apartment there was a gloom of deep sullenness on his haughty though handsome features and as he proceeded to spread the board and arrange the trenchers with salt spices and other condimentsto discharge in short the duties of a modern domestic which the custom of the time imposed upon all apprenticeshe was obviously disgusted and indignant with the mean office imposed upon him  the fair maid of perth looked with some anxiety at him as if apprehensive that his evident sullenness might increase her fathers displeasure but it was not till her eyes had sought out his for a second time that conachar condescended to veil his dissatisfaction and throw a greater appearance of willingness and submission into the services which he was performing  and here we must acquaint our reader that though the private interchange of looks betwixt catharine glover and the young mountaineer indicated some interest on the part of the former in the conduct of the latter it would have puzzled the strictest observer to discover whether that feeling exceeded in degree what might have been felt by a young person towards a friend and inmate of the same age with whom she had lived on habits of intimacy  thou hast had a long journey son henry said glover who had always used that affectionate style of speech though no ways akin to the young artisan ay and hast seen many a river besides tay and many a fair bigging besides st johnston  but none that i like half so well and none that are half so much worth my liking answered the smith i promise you father that when i crossed the wicks of baiglie and saw the bonny city lie stretched fairly before me like a fairy queen in romance whom the knight finds asleep among a wilderness of flowers i felt even as a bird when it folds its wearied wings to stoop down on its own nest  aha so thou canst play the maker old scottish for poet yet said the glover what shall we have our ballets and our roundels again our lusty carols for christmas and our mirthful springs to trip it round the maypole  such toys there may be forthcoming father said henry smith though the blast of the bellows and the clatter of the anvil make but coarse company to lays of minstrelsy but i can afford them no better since i must mend my fortune though i mar my verses  right againmy own son just answered the glover and i trust thou hast made a saving voyage of it  nay i made a thriving one father i sold the steel habergeon that you wot of for four hundred marks to the english warden of the east marches sir magnus redman he scarce scrupled a penny after i gave him leave to try a sword dint upon it the beggardly highland thief who bespoke it boggled at half the sum though it had cost me a years labour  what dost thou start at conachar said simon addressing himself by way of parenthesis to the mountain disciple wilt thou never learn to mind thy own business without listening to what is passing round thee what is it to thee that an englishman thinks that cheap which a scottishman may hold dear  conachar turned round to speak but after a moments consideration looked down and endeavoured to recover his composure which had been deranged by the contemptuous manner in which the smith had spoken of his highland customer  henry went on without paying any attention to him i sold at high prices some swords and whingers when i was at edinburgh they expect war there and if it please god to send it my merchandise will be worth its price st dunstan make us thankful for he was of our craft in short this fellow laying his hand on his purse who thou knowest father was somewhat lank and low in condition when i set out four months since is now as round and full as a six weeks porker  and that other leathern sheathed iron hilted fellow who hangs beside him said the glover has he been idle all this while come jolly smith confess the truthhow many brawls hast thou had since crossing the tay  nay now you do me wrong father to ask me such a question glancing a look at catharine in such a presence answered the armourer i make swords indeed but i leave it to other people to use them nono seldom have i a naked sword in my fist save when i am turning them on the anvil or grindstone and they slandered me to your daughter catharine that led her to suspect the quietest burgess in perth of being a brawler i wish the best of them would dare say such a word at the hill of kinnoul and never a man on the green but he and i  ayay said the glover laughing we should then have a fine sample of your patient sufferance out upon you henry that you will speak so like a knave to one who knows thee so well you look at kate too as if she did not know that a man in this country must make his hand keep his head unless he will sleep in slender security comecome beshrew me if thou hast not spoiled as many suits of armour as thou hast made  why he would be a bad armourer father simon that could not with his own blow make proof of his own workmanship if i did not sometimes cleave a helmet or strike a point through a harness i should not know what strength of fabric to give them and might jingle together such pasteboard work as yonder edinburgh smiths think not shame to put out of their hands  aha now would i lay a gold crown thou hast had a quarrel with some edinburgh burn the wind upon that very ground  burn the wind an old cant term for blacksmith appears in burns  then burnewin came on like death at every chaup etc   a quarrel no father replied the perth armourer but a measuring of swords with such a one upon st leonards crags for the honour of my bonny city i confess surely you do not think i would quarrel with a brother craftsman  ah to a surety no but how did your brother craftman come off  why as one with a sheet of paper on his bosom might come off from the stroke of a lance or rather indeed he came not off at all for when i left him he was lying in the hermits lodge daily expecting death for which father gervis said he was in heavenly preparation  well any more measuring of weapons said the glover  why truly i fought an englishman at berwick besides on the old question of the supremacy as they call iti am sure you would not have me slack at that debateand i had the luck to hurt him on the left knee  well done for st andrew to it again whom next had you to deal with said simon laughing at the exploits of his pacific friend  i fought a scotchman in the torwood answered henry smith upon a doubt which was the better swordsman which you are aware could not be known or decided without a trial the poor fellow lost two fingers  pretty well for the most peaceful lad in perth who never touches a sword but in the way of his profession well anything more to tell us  little for the drubbing of a highlandman is a thing not worth mentioning  for what didst thou drub him o man of peace inquired the glover  for nothing that i can remember replied the smith except his presenting himself on the south side of stirling bridge  well here is to thee and thou art welcome to me after all these exploits conachar bestir thee let the cans clink lad and thou shalt have a cup of the nut brown for thyself my boy  conachar poured out the good liquor for his master and for catharine with due observance but that done he set the flagon on the table and sat down  how now sirrah be these your manners fill to my guest the worshipful master henry smith  master smith may fill for himself if he wishes for liquor answered the youthful celt the son of my father has demeaned himself enough already for one evening  thats well crowed for a cockerel said henry but thou art so far right my lad that the man deserves to die of thirst who will not drink without a cupbearer  but his entertainer took not the contumacy of the young apprentice with so much patience now by my honest word and by the best glove i ever made said simon thou shalt help him with liquor from that cup and flagon if thee and i are to abide under one roof  conachar arose sullenly upon hearing this threat and approaching the smith who had just taken the tankard in his hand and was raising it to his head he contrived to stumble against him and jostle him so awkwardly that the foaming ale gushed over his face person and dress good natured as the smith in spite of his warlike propensities really was in the utmost degree his patience failed under such a provocation he seized the young mans throat being the part which came readiest to his grasp as conachar arose from the pretended stumble and pressing it severely as he cast the lad from him exclaimed had this been in another place young gallows bird i had stowed the lugs out of thy head as i have done to some of thy clan before thee  conachar recovered his feet with the activity of a tiger and exclaimed never shall you live to make that boast again drew a short sharp knife from his bosom and springing on henry smith attempted to plunge it into his body over the collarbone which must have been a mortal wound but the object of this violence was so ready to defend himself by striking up the assailants hand that the blow only glanced on the bone and scarce drew blood to wrench the dagger from the boys hand and to secure him with a grasp like that of his own iron vice was for the powerful smith the work of a single moment  conachar felt himself at once in the absolute power of the formidable antagonist whom he had provoked he became deadly pale as he had been the moment before glowing red and stood mute with shame and fear until relieving him from his powerful hold the smith quietly said it is well for thee that thou canst not make me angry thou art but a boy and i a grown man ought not to have provoked thee but let this be a warning  conachar stood an instant as if about to reply and then left the room ere simon had collected himself enough to speak dorothy was running hither and thither for salves and healing herbs catharine had swooned at the sight of the trickling blood  let me depart father simon said henry smith mournfully i might have guessed i should have my old luck and spread strife and bloodshed where i would wish most to bring peace and happiness care not for me look to poor catharine the fright of such an affray hath killed her and all through my fault  thy fault my son it was the fault of yon highland cateran whom it is my curse to be cumbered with but he shall go back to his glens tomorrow or taste the tolbooth of the burgh an assault upon the life of his masters guest in his house it breaks all bonds between us but let me see to thy wound  catharine repeated the armourerlook to catharine  dorothy will see to her said simon surprise and fear kill not skenes and dirks do and she is not more the daughter of my blood than thou my dear henry art the son of my affections let me see the wound the skene occle is an ugly weapon in a highland hand  i mind it no more than the scratch of a wildcat said the armourer and now that the colour is coming to catharines cheek again you shall see me a sound man in a moment  he turned to a corner in which hung a small mirror and hastily took from his purse some dry lint to apply to the slight wound he had received as he unloosed the leathern jacket from his neck and shoulders the manly and muscular form which they displayed was not more remarkable than the fairness of his skin where it had not as in hands and face been exposed to the effects of rough weather and of his laborious trade he hastily applied some lint to stop the bleeding and a little water having removed all other marks of the fray he buttoned his doublet anew and turned again to the table where catharine still pale and trembling was however recovered from her fainting fit  would you but grant me your forgiveness for having offended you in the very first hour of my return the lad was foolish to provoke me and yet i was more foolish to be provoked by such as he your father blames me not catharine and cannot you forgive me  i have no power to forgive answered catharine what i have no title to resent if my father chooses to have his house made the scene of night brawls i must witness themi cannot help myself perhaps it was wrong in me to faint and interrupt it may be the farther progress of a fair fray my apology is that i cannot bear the sight of blood  and is this the manner said her father in which you receive my friend after his long absence my friend did i say nay my son he escapes being murdered by a fellow whom i will tomorrow clear this house of and you treat him as if he had done wrong in dashing from him the snake which was about to sting him  it is not my part father returned the maid of perth to decide who had the right or wrong in the present brawl nor did i see what happened distinctly enough to say which was assailant or which defender but sure our friend master henry will not deny that he lives in a perfect atmosphere of strife blood and quarrels he hears of no swordsman but he envies his reputation and must needs put his valour to the proof he sees no brawl but he must strike into the midst of it has he friends he fights with them for love and honour has he enemies he fights with them for hatred and revenge and those men who are neither his friends nor foes he fights with them because they are on this or that side of a river his days are days of battle and doubtless he acts them over again in his dreams  daughter said simon your tongue wags too freely quarrels and fights are mens business not womens and it is not maidenly to think or speak of them  but if they are so rudely enacted in our presence said catharine it is a little hard to expect us to think or speak of anything else i will grant you my father that this valiant burgess of perth is one of the best hearted men that draws breath within its walls that he would walk a hundred yards out of the way rather than step upon a worm that he would be as loth in wantonness to kill a spider as if he were a kinsman to king robert of happy memory that in the last quarrel before his departure he fought with four butchers to prevent their killing a poor mastiff that had misbehaved in the bull ring and narrowly escaped the fate of the cur that he was protecting i will grant you also that the poor never pass the house of the wealthy armourer but they are relieved with food and alms but what avails all this when his sword makes as many starving orphans and mourning widows as his purse relieves  nay but catharine hear me but a word before going on with a string of reproaches against my friend that sound something like sense while they are in truth inconsistent with all we hear and see around us what continued the glover do our king and our court our knights and ladies our abbots monks and priests themselves so earnestly crowd to see is it not to behold the display of chivalry to witness the gallant actions of brave knights in the tilt and tourney ground to look upon deeds of honour and glory achieved by arms and bloodshed what is it these proud knights do that differs from what our good henry gow works out in his sphere who ever heard of his abusing his skill and strength to do evil or forward oppression and who knows not how often it has been employed as that of a champion in the good cause of the burgh and shouldst not thou of all women deem thyself honoured and glorious that so true a heart and so strong an arm has termed himself thy bachelor in what do the proudest dames take their loftiest pride save in the chivalry of their knight and has the boldest in scotland done more gallant deeds than my brave son henry though but of low degree is he not known to highland and lowland as the best armourer that ever made sword and the truest soldier that ever drew one  my dearest father answered catharine your words contradict themselves if you will permit your child to say so let us thank god and the good saints that we are in a peaceful rank of life below the notice of those whose high birth and yet higher pride lead them to glory in their bloody works of cruelty which haughty and lordly men term deeds of chivalry your wisdom will allow that it would be absurd in us to prank ourselves in their dainty plumes and splendid garments why then should we imitate their full blown vices why should we assume their hard hearted pride and relentless cruelty to which murder is not only a sport but a subject of vainglorious triumph let those whose rank claims as its right such bloody homage take pride and pleasure in it we who have no share in the sacrifice may the better pity the sufferings of the victim let us thank our lowliness since it secures us from temptation but forgive me father if i have stepped over the limits of my duty in contradicting the views which you entertain with so many others on these subjects  nay thou hast even too much talk for me girl said her father somewhat angrily i am but a poor workman whose best knowledge is to distinguish the left hand glove from the right but if thou wouldst have my forgiveness say something of comfort to my poor henry there he sits confounded and dismayed with all the preachment thou hast heaped together and he to whom a trumpet sound was like the invitation to a feast is struck down at the sound of a childs whistle  the armourer indeed while he heard the lips that were dearest to him paint his character in such unfavourable colours had laid his head down on the table upon his folded arms in an attitude of the deepest dejection or almost despair  i would to heaven my dearest father answered catharine that it were in my power to speak comfort to henry without betraying the sacred cause of the truths i have just told you and i maynay i must have such a commission she continued with something that the earnestness with which she spoke and the extreme beauty of her features caused for the moment to resemble inspiration  the truth of heaven she said in a solemn tone was never committed to a tongue however feeble but it gave a right to that tongue to announce mercy while it declared judgment arise henryrise up noble minded good and generous though widely mistaken man thy faults are those of this cruel and remorseless age thy virtues all thine own  while she thus spoke she laid her hand upon the smiths arm and extricating it from under his head by a force which however gentle he could not resist she compelled him to raise towards her his manly face and the eyes into which her expostulations mingled with other feelings had summoned tears  weep not she said or rather weep on but weep as those who have hope abjure the sins of pride and anger which most easily beset thee fling from thee the accursed weapons to the fatal and murderous use of which thou art so easily tempted  you speak to me in vain catharine returned the armourer i may indeed turn monk and retire from the world but while i live in it i must practise my trade and while i form armour and weapons for others i cannot myself withstand the temptation of using them you would not reproach me as you do if you knew how inseparably the means by which i gain my bread are connected with that warlike spirit which you impute to me as a fault though it is the consequence of inevitable necessity while i strengthen the shield or corselet to withstand wounds must i not have constantly in remembrance the manner and strength with which they may be dealt and when i forge the sword and temper it for war is it practicable for me to avoid the recollection of its use  then throw from you my dear henry said the enthusiastic girl clasping with both her slender hands the nervous strength and weight of one of the muscular armourers which they raised with difficulty permitted by its owner yet scarcely receiving assistance from his volitioncast from you i say the art which is a snare to you abjure the fabrication of weapons which can only be useful to abridge human life already too short for repentance or to encourage with a feeling of safety those whom fear might otherwise prevent from risking themselves in peril the art of forming arms whether offensive or defensive is alike sinful in one to whose violent and ever vehement disposition the very working upon them proves a sin and a snare resign utterly the manufacture of weapons of every description and deserve the forgiveness of heaven by renouncing all that can lead to the sin which most easily besets you  and what murmured the armourer am i to do for my livelihood when i have given over the art of forging arms for which henry of perth is known from the tay to the thames  your art itself said catharine has innocent and laudable resources if you renounce the forging of swords and bucklers there remains to you the task of forming the harmless spade and the honourable as well as useful ploughshareof those implements which contribute to the support of life or to its comforts thou canst frame locks and bars to defend the property of the weak against the stouthrief and oppression of the strong men will still resort to thee and repay thy honest industry  but here catharine was interrupted her father had heard her declaim against war and tournaments with a feeling that though her doctrine were new to him they might not nevertheless be entirely erroneous he felt indeed a wish that his proposed son in law should not commit himself voluntarily to the hazards which the daring character and great personal strength of henry the smith had hitherto led him to incur too readily and so far he would rather have desired that catharines arguments should have produced some effect upon the mind of her lover whom he knew to be as ductile when influenced by his affections as he was fierce and intractable when assailed by hostile remonstrances or threats but her arguments interfered with his views when he heard her enlarge upon the necessity of his designed son in law resigning a trade which brought in more ready income than any at that time practised in scotland and more profit to henry of perth in particular than to any armourer in the nation he had some indistinct idea that it would not be amiss to convert if possible henry the smith from his too frequent use of arms even though he felt some pride in being connected with one who wielded with such superior excellence those weapons which in that warlike age it was the boast of all men to manage with spirit but when he heard his daughter recommend as the readiest road to this pacific state of mind that her lover should renounce the gainful trade in which he was held unrivalled and which from the constant private differences and public wars of the time was sure to afford him a large income he could withhold his wrath no longer the daughter had scarce recommended to her lover the fabrication of the implements of husbandry than feeling the certainty of being right of which in the earlier part of their debate he had been somewhat doubtful the father broke in with  locks and bars plough graith and harrow teeth and why not grates and fire prongs and culross girdles and an ass to carry the merchandise through the country and thou for another ass to lead it by the halter why catharine girl has sense altogether forsaken thee or dost thou think that in these hard and iron days men will give ready silver for anything save that which can defend their own life or enable them to take that of their enemy we want swords to protect ourselves every moment now thou silly wench and not ploughs to dress the ground for the grain we may never see rise as for the matter of our daily bread those who are strong seize it and live those who are weak yield it and die of hunger happy is the man who like my worthy son has means of obtaining his living otherwise than by the point of the sword which he makes preach peace to him as much as thou wilt i will never be he will say thee nay but as for bidding the first armourer in scotland forego the forging of swords curtal axes and harness it is enough to drive patience itself mad out from my sight and next morning i prithee remember that shouldst thou have the luck to see henry the smith which is more than thy usage of him has deserved you see a man who has not his match in scotland at the use of broadsword and battle axe and who can work for five hundred marks a year without breaking a holyday  the daughter on hearing her father speak thus peremptorily made a low obeisance and without further goodnight withdrew to the chamber which was her usual sleeping apartment    chapter iii        whence cometh smith be he knight lord or squire       but from the smith that forged in the fire        verstegan   the armourers heart swelled big with various and contending sensations so that it seemed as if it would burst the leathern doublet under which it was shrouded he arose turned away his head and extended his hand towards the glover while he averted his face as if desirous that his emotion should not be read upon his countenance  nay hang me if i bid you farewell man said simon striking the flat of his hand against that which the armourer expanded towards him i will shake no hands with you for an hour to come at least tarry but a moment man and i will explain all this and surely a few drops of blood from a scratch and a few silly words from a foolish wenchs lips are not to part father and son when they have been so long without meeting stay then man if ever you would wish for a fathers blessing and st valentines whose blessed eve this chances to be  the glover was soon heard loudly summoning dorothy and after some clanking of keys and trampling up and down stairs dorothy appeared bearing three large rummer cups of green glass which were then esteemed a great and precious curiosity and the glover followed with a huge bottle equal at least to three quarts of these degenerate days  here is a cup of wine henry older by half than i am myself my father had it in a gift from stout old crabbe the flemish engineer who defended perth so stoutly in the minority of david the second we glovers could always do something in war though our connexion with it was less than yours who work in steel and iron and my father had pleased old crabbe some other day i will tell you how and also how long these bottles were concealed under ground to save them from the reiving southron so i will empty a cup to the souls health of my honoured fathermay his sins be forgiven him dorothy thou shalt drink this pledge and then be gone to thy cock loft i know thine ears are itching girl but i have that to say which no one must hear save henry smith the son of mine adoption  dorothy did not venture to remonstrate but taking off her glass or rather her goblet with good courage retired to her sleeping apartment according to her masters commands  the two friends were left alone  it grieves me friend henry said simon filling at the same time his own glass and his guestsit grieves me from my soul that my daughter retains this silly humor but also methinks thou mightst mend it why wouldst thou come hither clattering with thy sword and dagger when the girl is so silly that she cannot bear the sight of these dost thou not remember that thou hadst a sort of quarrel with her even before thy last departure from perth because thou wouldst not go like other honest quiet burghers but must be ever armed like one of the rascally jackmen that wait on the nobility sure it is time enough for decent burgesses to arm at the tolling of the common bell which calls us out bodin in effeir of war  why my good father that was not my fault but i had no sooner quitted my nag than i run hither to tell you of my return thinking if it were your will to permit me that i would get your advice about being mistress catharines valentine for the year and then i heard from mrs dorothy that you were gone to hear mass at the black friars so i thought i would follow thither partly to hear the same mass with you and partlyour lady and st valentine forgive meto look upon one who thinks little enough of me and as you entered the church methought i saw two or three dangerous looking men holding counsel together and gazing at you and at her and in especial sir john ramorny whom i knew well enough for all his disguise and the velvet patch over his eye and his cloak so like a serving mans so methought father simon that as you were old and yonder slip of a highlander something too young to do battle i would even walk quietly after you not doubting with the tools i had about me to bring any one to reason that might disturb you in your way home you know that yourself discovered me and drew me into the house whether i would or no otherwise i promise you i would not have seen your daughter till i had donnd the new jerkin which was made at berwick after the latest cut nor would i have appeared before her with these weapons which she dislikes so much although to say truth so many are at deadly feud with me for one unhappy chance or another that it is as needful for me as for any man in scotland to go by night with weapons about me  the silly wench never thinks of that said simon glover she never has sense to consider that in our dear native land of scotland every man deems it his privilege and duty to avenge his own wrong but harry my boy thou art to blame for taking her talk so much to heart i have seen thee bold enough with other wenches wherefore so still and tongue tied with her  because she is something different from other maidens father gloverbecause she is not only more beautiful but wiser higher holier and seems to me as if she were made of better clay than we that approach her i can hold my head high enough with the rest of the lasses round the maypole but somehow when i approach catharine i feel myself an earthly coarse ferocious creature scarce worthy to look on her much less to contradict the precepts which she expounds to me  you are an imprudent merchant harry smith replied simon and rate too high the goods you wish to purchase catharine is a good girl and my daughter but if you make her a conceited ape by your bashfulness and your flattery neither you nor i will see our wishes accomplished  i often fear it my good father said the smith for i feel how little i am deserving of catharine  feel a threads end said the glover feel for me friend smithfor catharine and me think how the poor thing is beset from morning to night and by what sort of persons even though windows be down and doors shut we were accosted today by one too powerful to be nameday and he showed his displeasure openly because i would not permit him to gallant my daughter in the church itself when the priest was saying mass there are others scarce less reasonable i sometimes wish that catharine were some degrees less fair that she might not catch that dangerous sort of admiration or somewhat less holy that she might sit down like an honest woman contented with stout henry smith who could protect his wife against every sprig of chivalry in the court of scotland  and if i did not said henry thrusting out a hand and arm which might have belonged to a giant for bone and muscle i would i may never bring hammer upon anvil again ay an it were come but that length my fair catharine should see that there is no harm in a man having the trick of defence but i believe she thinks the whole world is one great minster church and that all who live in it should behave as if they were at an eternal mass  nay in truth said the father she has strange influence over those who approach her the highland lad conachar with whom i have been troubled for these two or three years although you may see he has the natural spirit of his people obeys the least sign which catharine makes him and indeed will hardly be ruled by any one else in the house she takes much pains with him to bring him from his rude highland habits  here harry smith became uneasy in his chair lifted the flagon set it down and at length exclaimed the devil take the young highland whelp and his whole kindred what has catharine to do to instruct such a fellow as he he will be just like the wolf cub that i was fool enough to train to the offices of a dog and every one thought him reclaimed till in an ill hour i went to walk on the hill of moncrieff when he broke loose on the lairds flock and made a havoc that i might well have rued had the laird not wanted a harness at the time and i marvel that you being a sensible man father glover will keep this highland young fellowa likely one i promise youso nigh to catharine as if there were no other than your daughter to serve him for a schoolmistress  fie my sonfie now you are jealous said simon of a poor young fellow who to tell you the truth resides here because he may not so well live on the other side of the hill  ayay father simon retorted the smith who had all the narrow minded feelings of the burghers of his time an it were not for fear of offence i would say that you have even too much packing and peiling with yonder loons out of burgh  i must get my deer hides buckskins kidskins and so forth somewhere my good harry and highlandmen give good bargains  they can afford them replied henry drily for they sell nothing but stolen gear  wellwell be that as it may it is not my business where they get the bestial so i get the hides but as i was saying there are certain considerations why i am willing to oblige the father of this young man by keeping him here and he is but half a highlander neither and wants a thought of the dour spirit of a glune amie after all i have seldom seen him so fierce as he showed himself but now  you could not unless he had killed his man replied the smith in the same dry tone  nevertheless if you wish it harry ill set all other respects aside and send the landlouper to seek other quarters tomorrow morning  nay father said the smith you cannot suppose that harry gow cares the value of a smithy dander for such a cub as yonder catamountain i care little i promise you though all his clan were coming down the shoegate with slogan crying and pipes playing i would find fifty blades and bucklers would send them back faster than they came but to speak truth though it is a fools speech too i care not to see the fellow so much with catharine remember father glover your trade keeps your eyes and hands close employed and must have your heedful care even if this lazy lurdane wrought at it which you know yourself he seldom does  and that is true said simon he cuts all his gloves out for the right hand and never could finish a pair in his life  no doubt his notions of skin cutting are rather different said henry but with your leave father i would only say that work he or be he idle he has no bleared eyes no hands seared with the hot iron and welked by the use of the fore hammer no hair rusted in the smoke and singed in the furnace like the hide of a badger rather than what is fit to be covered with a christian bonnet now let catharine be as good a wench as ever lived and i will uphold her to be the best in perth yet she must see and know that these things make a difference betwixt man and man and that the difference is not in my favour  here is to thee with all my heart son harry said the old man filling a brimmer to his companion and another to himself i see that good smith as thou art thou kenst not the mettle that women are made of thou must be bold henry and bear thyself not as if thou wert going to the gallows lee but like a gay young fellow who knows his own worth and will not be slighted by the best grandchild eve ever had catharine is a woman like her mother and thou thinkest foolishly to suppose they are all set on what pleases the eye their ear must be pleased too man they must know that he whom they favour is bold and buxom and might have the love of twenty though he is suing for theirs believe an old man woman walk more by what others think than by what they think themselves and when she asks for the boldest man in perth whom can she hear named but harry burnthewind the best armourer that ever fashioned weapon on anvil why harry smith again the tightest dancer at the maypole why the lusty smith the gayest troller of ballads why who but harry gow the best wrestler sword and buckler player the king of the weapon shawing the breaker of mad horses the tamer of wild highlandmen evermore it is theetheeno one but thee and shall catharine prefer yonder slip of a highland boy to thee pshaw she might as well make a steel gauntlet out of kids leather i tell thee conachar is nothing to her but so far as she would fain prevent the devil having his due of him as of other highlandmen god bless her poor thing she would bring all mankind to better thoughts if she could  in which she will fail to a certainty said the smith who as the reader may have noticed had no goodwill to the highland race i will wager on old nick of whom i should know something he being indeed a worker in the same element with myself against catharine on that debate the devil will have the tartan that is sure enough  ay but catharine replied the glover hath a second thou knowest little of father clement has taken the young reiver in hand and he fears a hundred devils as little as i do a flock of geese  father clement said the smith you are always making some new saint in this godly city of st johnston pray who for a devils drubber may he be one of your hermits that is trained for the work like a wrestler for the ring and brings himself to trim by fasting and penance is he not  no that is the marvel of it said simon father clement eats drinks and lives much like other folksall the rules of the church nevertheless strictly observed  oh i comprehenda buxom priest that thinks more of good living than of good life tipples a can on fasterns eve to enable him to face lent has a pleasant in principio and confesses all the prettiest women about the town  you are on the bow hand still smith i tell you my daughter and i could nose out either a fasting hypocrite or a full one but father clement is neither the one nor the other  but what is he then in heavens name  one who is either greatly better than half his brethren of st johnston put together or so much worse than the worst of them that it is sin and shame that he is suffered to abide in the country  methinks it were easy to tell whether he be the one or the other said the smith  content you my friend said simon with knowing that if you judge father clement by what you see him do and hear him say you will think of him as the best and kindest man in the world with a comfort for every mans grief a counsel for every mans difficulty the rich mans surest guide and the poor mans best friend but if you listen to what the dominicans say of him he isbenedicitehere the glover crossed himself on brow and bosoma foul heretic who ought by means of earthly flames to be sent to those which burn eternally  the smith also crossed himself and exclaimed st mary father simon and do you who are so good and prudent that you have been called the wise glover of perth let your daughter attend the ministry of one whothe saints preserve usmay be in league with the foul fiend himself why was it not a priest who raised the devil in the meal vennel when hodge jacksons house was blown down in the great wind did not the devil appear in the midst of the tay dressed in a priests scapular gambolling like a pellack amongst the waves the morning when our stately bridge was swept away  i cannot tell whether he did or no said the glover i only know i saw him not as to catharine she cannot be said to use father clements ministry seeing her confessor is old father francis the dominican from whom she had her shrift today but women will sometimes be wilful and sure enough she consults with father clement more than i could wish and yet when i have spoken with him myself i have thought him so good and holy a man that i could have trusted my own salvation with him there are bad reports of him among the dominicans that is certain but what have we laymen to do with such things my son let us pay mother church her dues give our alms confess and do our penances duly and the saints will bear us out  ay truly and they will have consideration said the smith for any rash and unhappy blow that a man may deal in a fight when his party was on defence and standing up to him and thats the only creed a man can live upon in scotland let your daughter think what she pleases marry a man must know his fence or have a short lease of his life in any place where blows are going so rife five nobles to our altar have cleared me for the best man i ever had misfortune with  let us finish our flask then said the old glover for i reckon the dominican tower is tolling midnight and hark thee son henry be at the lattice window on our east gable by the very peep of dawn and make me aware thou art come by whistling the smiths call gently i will contrive that catharine shall look out at the window and thus thou wilt have all the privileges of being a gallant valentine through the rest of the year which if thou canst not use to thine own advantage i shall be led to think that for all thou best covered with the lions hide nature has left on thee the long ears of the ass  amen father said the armourer a hearty goodnight to you and gods blessing on your roof tree and those whom it covers you shall hear the smiths call sound by cock crowing i warrant i put sir chanticleer to shame  so saying he took his leave and though completely undaunted moved through the deserted streets like one upon his guard to his own dwelling which was situated in the mill wynd at the western end of perth    chapter iv       whats all this turmoil crammed into our parts      faith but the pitapat of poor young hearts       dryden   the sturdy armourer was not it may be believed slack in keeping the appointment assigned by his intended father in law he went through the process of his toilet with more than ordinary care throwing as far as he could those points which had a military air into the shade he was far too noted a person to venture to go entirely unarmed in a town where he had indeed many friends but also from the character of many of his former exploits several deadly enemies at whose hands should they take him at advantage he knew he had little mercy to expect he therefore wore under his jerkin a secret or coat of chain mail made so light and flexible that it interfered as little with his movements as a modern under waistcoat yet of such proof as he might safely depend upon every ring of it having been wrought and joined by his own hands above this he wore like others of his age and degree the flemish hose and doublet which in honour of the holy tide were of the best superfine english broadcloth light blue in colour slashed out with black satin and passamented laced that is with embroidery of black silk his walking boots were of cordovan leather his cloak of good scottish grey which served to conceal a whinger or couteau de chasse that hung at his belt and was his only offensive weapon for he carried in his hand but a rod of holly his black velvet bonnet was lined with steel quilted between the metal and his head and thus constituted a means of defence which might safely be trusted to  upon the whole henry had the appearance to which he was well entitled of a burgher of wealth and consideration assuming in his dress as much consequence as he could display without stepping beyond his own rank and encroaching on that of the gentry neither did his frank and manly deportment though indicating a total indifference to danger bear the least resemblance to that of the bravoes or swashbucklers of the day amongst whom henry was sometimes unjustly ranked by those who imputed the frays in which he was so often engaged to a quarrelsome and violent temper resting upon a consciousness of his personal strength and knowledge of his weapon on the contrary every feature bore the easy and goodhumoured expression of one who neither thought of inflicting mischief nor dreaded it from others  having attired himself in his best the honest armourer next placed nearest to his heart which throbbed at its touch a little gift which he had long provided for catharine glover and which his quality of valentine would presently give him the title to present and her to receive without regard to maidenly scruples it was a small ruby cut into the form of a heart transfixed with a golden arrow and was inclosed in a small purse made of links of the finest work in steel as if it had been designed for a hauberk to a king round the verge of the purse were these words  loves darts cleave hearts through mail shirts  this device had cost the armourer some thought and he was much satisfied with his composition because it seemed to imply that his skill could defend all hearts saving his own  he wrapped himself in his cloak and hastened through the still silent streets determined to appear at the window appointed a little before dawn  with this purpose he passed up the high street and turned down the opening where st johns church now stands in order to proceed to curfew street when it occurred to him from the appearance of the sky that he was at least an hour too early for his purpose and that it would be better not to appear at the place of rendezvous till nearer the time assigned other gallants were not unlikely to be on the watch as well as himself about the house of the fair maid of perth and he knew his own foible so well as to be sensible of the great chance of a scuffle arising betwixt them  i have the advantage he thought by my father simons friendship and why should i stain my fingers with the blood of the poor creatures that are not worthy my notice since they are so much less fortunate than myself nono i will be wise for once and keep at a distance from all temptation to a broil they shall have no more time to quarrel with me than just what it may require for me to give the signal and for my father simon to answer it i wonder how the old man will contrive to bring her to the window i fear if she knew his purpose he would find it difficult to carry it into execution  while these loverlike thoughts were passing through his brain the armourer loitered in his pace often turning his eyes eastward and eyeing the firmament in which no slight shades of grey were beginning to flicker to announce the approach of dawn however distant which to the impatience of the stout armourer seemed on that morning to abstain longer than usual from occupying her eastern barbican he was now passing slowly under the wall of st annes chapel not failing to cross himself and say an ace as he trode the consecrated ground when a voice which seemed to come from behind one of the flying buttresses of the chapel said he lingers that has need to run  who speaks said the armourer looking around him somewhat startled at an address so unexpected both in its tone and tenor  no matter who speaks answered the same voice do thou make great speed or thou wilt scarce make good speed bandy not words but begone  saint or sinner angel or devil said henry crossing himself your advice touches me but too dearly to be neglected st valentine be my speed  so saying he instantly changed his loitering pace to one with which few people could have kept up and in an instant was in couvrefew street he had not made three steps towards simon glovers which stood in the midst of the narrow street when two men started from under the houses on different sides and advanced as it were by concert to intercept his passage the imperfect light only permitted him to discern that they wore the highland mantle  clear the way cateran said the armourer in the deep stern voice which corresponded with the breadth of his chest  they did not answer at least intelligibly but he could see that they drew their swords with the purpose of withstanding him by violence conjecturing some evil but of what kind he could not anticipate henry instantly determined to make his way through whatever odds and defend his mistress or at least die at her feet he cast his cloak over his left arm as a buckler and advanced rapidly and steadily to the two men the nearest made a thrust at him but henry smith parrying the blow with his cloak dashed his arm in the mans face and tripping him at the same time gave him a severe fall on the causeway while almost at the same instant he struck a blow with his whinger at the fellow who was upon his right hand so severely applied that he also lay prostrate by his associate meanwhile the armourer pushed forward in alarm for which the circumstance of the street being guarded or defended by strangers who conducted themselves with such violence afforded sufficient reason he heard a suppressed whisper and a bustle under the glovers windowsthose very windows from which he had expected to be hailed by catharine as her valentine he kept to the opposite side of the street that he might reconnoitre their number and purpose but one of the party who were beneath the window observing or hearing him crossed the street also and taking him doubtless for one of the sentinels asked in a whisper what noise was yonder kenneth why gave you not the signal  villain said henry you are discovered and you shall die the death  as he spoke thus he dealt the stranger a blow with his weapon which would probably have made his words good had not the man raising his arm received on his hand the blow meant for his head the wound must have been a severe one for he staggered and fell with a deep groan  without noticing him farther henry smith sprung forward upon a party of men who seemed engaged in placing a ladder against the lattice window in the gable henry did not stop ether to count their numbers or to ascertain their purpose but crying the alarm word of the town and giving the signal at which the burghers were wont to collect he rushed on the night walkers one of whom was in the act of ascending the ladder the smith seized it by the rounds threw it down on the pavement and placing his foot on the body of the man who had been mounting prevented him from regaining his feet his accomplices struck fiercely at henry to extricate their companion but his mail coat stood him in good stead and he repaid their blows with interest shouting aloud helphelp for bonny st johnston bows and blades brave citizens bows and blades they break into our houses under cloud of night  these words which resounded far through the streets were accompanied by as many fierce blows dealt with good effect among those whom the armourer assailed in the mean time the inhabitants of the district began to awaken and appear on the street in their shirts with swords and targets and some of them with torches the assailants now endeavoured to make their escape which all of them effected excepting the man who had been thrown down along with the ladder him the intrepid armourer had caught by the throat in the scuffle and held as fast as the greyhound holds the hare the other wounded men were borne off by their comrades  here are a sort of knaves breaking peace within burgh said henry to the neighbours who began to assemble make after the rogues they cannot all get off for i have maimed some of them the blood will guide you to them  some highland caterans said the citizens up and chase neighbours  ay chasechase leave me to manage this fellow continued the armourer  the assistants dispersed in different directions their lights flashing and their cries resounding through the whole adjacent district  in the mean time the armourers captive entreated for freedom using both promises and threats to obtain it as thou art a gentleman he said let me go and what is past shall be forgiven  i am no gentleman said henryi am hal of the wynd a burgess of perth and i have done nothing to need forgiveness  villain then hast done thou knowest not what but let me go and i will fill thy bonnet with gold pieces  i shall fill thy bonnet with a cloven head presently said the armourer unless thou stand still as a true prisoner  what is the matter my son harry said simon who now appeared at the window i hear thy voice in another tone than i expected what is all this noise and why are the neighbours gathering to the affray  there have been a proper set of limmers about to scale your windows father simon but i am like to prove godfather to one of them whom i hold here as fast as ever vice held iron  hear me simon glover said the prisoner let me but speak one word with you in private and rescue me from the gripe of this iron fisted and leaden pated clown and i will show thee that no harm was designed to thee or thine and moreover tell thee what will much advantage thee  i should know that voice said simon glover who now came to the door with a dark lantern in his hand son smith let this young man speak with me there is no danger in him i promise you stay but an instant where you are and let no one enter the house either to attack or defend i will be answerable that this galliard meant but some st valentines jest  so saying the old man pulled in the prisoner and shut the door leaving henry a little surprised at the unexpected light in which his fatherinlaw had viewed the affray  a jest he said it might have been a strange jest if they had got into the maidens sleeping room and they would have done so had it not been for the honest friendly voice from betwixt the buttresses which if it were not that of the blessed saintthough what am i that the holy person should speak to mecould not sound in that place without her permission and assent and for which i will promise her a wax candle at her shrine as long as my whinger and i would i had had my two handed broadsword instead both for the sake of st johnston and of the rogues for of a certain those whingers are pretty toys but more fit for a boys hand than a mans oh my old two handed trojan hadst thou been in my hands as thou hangst presently at the tester of my bed the legs of those rogues had not carried their bodies so clean off the field but there come lighted torches and drawn swords so hostand are you for st johnston if friends to the bonny burgh you are well come  we have been but bootless hunters said the townsmen we followed by the tracks of the blood into the dominican burial ground and we started two fellows from amongst the tombs supporting betwixt them a third who had probably got some of your marks about him harry they got to the postern gate before we could overtake them and rang the sanctuary bell the gate opened and in went they so they are safe in girth and sanctuary and we may go to our cold beds and warm us  ay said one of the party the good dominicans have always some devout brother of their convent sitting up to open the gate of the sanctuary to any poor soul that is in trouble and desires shelter in the church  yes if the poor hunted soul can pay for it said another but truly if he be poor in purse as well as in spirit he may stand on the outside till the hounds come up with him  a third who had been poring for a few minutes upon the ground by advantage of his torch now looked upwards and spoke he was a brisk forward rather corpulent little man called oliver proudfute reasonably wealthy and a leading man in his craft which was that of bonnet makers he therefore spoke as one in authority  canst tell us jolly smithfor they recognised each other by the lights which were brought into the streetswhat manner of fellows they were who raised up this fray within burgh  the two that i first saw answered the armourer seemed to me as well as i could observe them to have highland plaids about them  like enoughlike enough answered another citizen shaking his head its a shame the breaches in our walls are not repaired and that these landlouping highland scoundrels are left at liberty to take honest men and women out of their beds any night that is dark enough  but look here neighbours said oliver proudfute showing a bloody hand which he had picked up from the ground when did such a hand as this tie a highlandmans brogues it is large indeed and bony but as fine as a ladys with a ring that sparkles like a gleaming candle simon glover has made gloves for this hand before now if i am not much mistaken for he works for all the courtiers  the spectators here began to gaze on the bloody token with various comments  if that is the case said one harry smith had best show a clean pair of heels for it since the justiciar will scarce think the protecting a burgesss house an excuse for cutting off a gentlemans hand there be hard laws against mutilation  fie upon you that you will say so michael webster answered the bonnet maker are we not representatives and successors of the stout old romans who built perth as like to their own city as they could and have we not charters from all our noble kings and progenitors as being their loving liegemen and would you have us now yield up our rights privileges and immunities our outfang and infang our handhaband our back bearand and our blood suits and amerciaments escheats and commodities and suffer an honest burgesss house to be assaulted without seeking for redress no brave citizens craftsmen and burgesses the tay shall flow back to dunkeld before we submit to such injustice  and how can we help it said a grave old man who stood leaning on a two handed sword what would you have us do  marry bailie craigdallie i wonder that you of all men ask the question i would have you pass like true men from this very place to the kings graces presence raise him from his royal rest and presenting to him the piteous case of our being called forth from our beds at this season with little better covering than these shirts i would show him this bloody token and know from his graces own royal lips whether it is just and honest that his loving lieges should be thus treated by the knights and nobles of his deboshed court and this i call pushing our cause warmly  warmly sayst thou replied the old burgess why so warmly that we shall all die of cold man before the porter turn a key to let us into the royal presence come friends the night is bitter we have kept our watch and ward like men and our jolly smith hath given a warning to those that would wrong us which shall be worth twenty proclamations of the king tomorrow is a new day we will consult on this matter on this self same spot and consider what measures should be taken for discovery and pursuit of the villains and therefore let us dismiss before the hearts blood freeze in our veins  bravobravo neighbour craigdallie st johnston for ever  oliver proudfute would still have spoken for he was one of those pitiless orators who think that their eloquence can overcome all inconveniences in time place and circumstances but no one would listen and the citizens dispersed to their own houses by the light of the dawn which began now to streak the horizon  they were scarce gone ere the door of the glovers house opened and seizing the smith by the hand the old man pulled him in  where is the prisoner demanded the armourer  he is goneescapedfledwhat do i know of him said the glover he got out at the back door and so through the little garden think not of him but come and see the valentine whose honour and life you have saved this morning  let me but sheathe my weapon said the smith let me but wash my hands  there is not an instant to lose she is up and almost dressed come on man she shall see thee with thy good weapon in thy hand and with villains blood on thy fingers that she may know what is the value of a true mans service she has stopped my mouth overlong with her pruderies and her scruples i will have her know what a brave mans love is worth and a bold burgesss to boot    chapter v       up lady fair and braid thy hair      and rouse thee in the breezy air      up quit thy bower late wears the hour      long have the rooks cawd round the tower       joanna baillie   startled from her repose by the noise of the affray the fair maid of perth had listened in breathless terror to the sounds of violence and outcry which arose from the street she had sunk on her knees to pray for assistance and when she distinguished the voices of neighbours and friends collected for her protection she remained in the same posture to return thanks she was still kneeling when her father almost thrust her champion henry smith into her apartment the bashful lover hanging back at first as if afraid to give offence and on observing her posture from respect to her devotion  father said the armourer she prays i dare no more speak to her than to a bishop when he says mass  now go thy ways for a right valiant and courageous blockhead said her fatherand then speaking to his daughter he added heaven is best thanked my daughter by gratitude shown to our fellow creatures here comes the instrument by whom god has rescued thee from death or perhaps from dishonour worse than death receive him catharine as thy true valentine and him whom i desire to see my affectionate son  not thusfather replied catharine i can seecan speak to no one now i am not ungratefulperhaps i am too thankful to the instrument of our safety but let me thank the guardian saint who sent me this timely relief and give me but a moment to don my kirtle  nay godamercy wench it were hard to deny thee time to busk thy body clothes since the request is the only words like a woman that thou hast uttered for these ten days truly son harry i would my daughter would put off being entirely a saint till the time comes for her being canonised for st catherine the second  nay jest not father for i will swear she has at least one sincere adorer already who hath devoted himself to her pleasure so far as sinful man may fare thee well then for the moment fair maiden he concluded raising his voice and heaven send thee dreams as peaceful as thy waking thoughts i go to watch thy slumbers and woe with him that shall intrude on them  nay good and brave henry whose warm heart is at such variance with thy reckless hand thrust thyself into no farther quarrels tonight but take the kindest thanks and with these try to assume the peaceful thoughts which you assign to me tomorrow we will meet that i may assure you of my gratitude farewell  and farewell lady and light of my heart said the armourer and descending the stair which led to catharines apartment was about to sally forth into the street when the glover caught him by the arm  i shall like the ruffle of tonight said he better than i ever thought to do the clashing of steel if it brings my daughter to her senses harry and teaches her what thou art worth by st macgrider i even love these roysterers and am sorry for that poor lover who will never wear left handed chevron again ay he has lost that which he will miss all the days of his life especially when he goes to pull on his gloves ay he will pay but half a fee to my craft in future nay not a step from this house tonight he continued thou dost not leave us i promise thee my son  i do not mean it but i will with your permission watch in the street the attack may be renewed  and if it be said simon thou wilt have better access to drive them back having the vantage of the house it is the way of fighting which suits us burghers bestthat of resisting from behind stone walls our duty of watch and ward teaches us that trick besides enough are awake and astir to ensure us peace and quiet till morning so come in this way  so saying he drew henry nothing loth into the same apartment where they had supped and where the old woman who was on foot disturbed as others had been by the nocturnal affray soon roused up the fire  and now my doughty son said the glover what liquor wilt thou pledge thy father in  henry smith had suffered himself to sink mechanically upon a seat of old black oak and now gazed on the fire that flashed back a ruddy light over his manly features he muttered to himself half audibly good henrybrave henry ah had she but said dear henry  what liquors be these said the old glover laughing my cellar holds none such but if sack or rhenish or wine of gascony can serve why say the word and the flagon foams that is all  the kindest thanks said the armourer still musing thats more than she ever said to me beforethe kindest thankswhat may not that stretch to  it shall stretch like kids leather man said the glover if thou wilt but be ruled and say what thou wilt take for thy mornings draught  whatever thou wilt father answered the armourer carelessly and relapsed into the analysis of catharines speech to him she spoke of my warm heart but she also spoke of my reckless hand what earthly thing can i do to get rid of this fighting fancy certainly i were best strike my right hand off and nail it to the door of a church that it may never do me discredit more  you have chopped off hands enough for one night said his friend setting a flagon of wine on the table why dost thou vex thyself man she would love thee twice as well did she not see how thou doatest upon her but it becomes serious now i am not to have the risk of my booth being broken and my house plundered by the hell raking followers of the nobles because she is called the fair maid of perth ant please ye no she shall know i am her father and will have that obedience to which law and gospel give me right i will have her thy wife henry my heart of goldthy wife my man of mettle and that before many weeks are over comecome here is to thy merry bridal jolly smith  the father quaffed a large cup and filled it to his adopted son who raised it slowly to his head then ere it had reached his lips replaced it suddenly on the table and shook his head  nay if thou wilt not pledge me to such a health i know no one who will said simon what canst thou mean thou foolish lad here has a chance happened which in a manner places her in thy power since from one end of the city to the other all would cry fie on her if she should say thee nay here am i her father not only consenting to the cutting out of the match but willing to see you two as closely united together as ever needle stitched buckskin and with all this on thy sidefortune father and allthou lookest like a distracted lover in a ballad more like to pitch thyself into the tay than to woo a lass that may be had for the asking if you can but choose the lucky minute  ay but that lucky minute father i question much if catharine ever has such a moment to glance on earth and its inhabitants as might lead her to listen to a coarse ignorant borrel man like me i cannot tell how it is father elsewhere i can hold up my head like another man but with your saintly daughter i lose heart and courage and i cannot help thinking that it would be well nigh robbing a holy shrine if i could succeed in surprising her affections her thoughts are too much fitted for heaven to be wasted on such a one as i am  een as you like henry answered the glover my daughter is not courting you any more than i ama fair offer is no cause offend only if you think that i will give in to her foolish notions of a convent take it with you that i will never listen to them i love and honour the church he said crossing himself i pay her rights duly and cheerfullytithes and alms wine and wax i pay them as justly i say as any man in perth of my means dothbut i cannot afford the church my only and single ewe lamb that i have in the world her mother was dear to me on earth and is now an angel in heaven catharine is all i have to remind me of her i have lost and if she goes to the cloister it shall be when these old eyes are closed for ever and not sooner but as for you friend gow i pray you will act according to your own best liking i want to force no wife on you i promise you  nay now you beat the iron twice over said henry it is thus we always end father by your being testy with me for not doing that thing in the world which would make me happiest were i to have it in my power why father i would the keenest dirk i ever forged were sticking in my heart at this moment if there is one single particle in it that is not more your daughters property than my own but what can i do i cannot think less of her or more of myself than we both deserve and what seems to you so easy and certain is to me as difficult as it would be to work a steel hauberk out of bards of flax but here is to you father he added in a more cheerful tone and here is to my fair saint and valentine as i hope your catharine will be mine for the season and let me not keep your old head longer from the pillow but make interest with your featherbed till daybreak and then you must be my guide to your daughters chamber door and my apology for entering it to bid her good morrow for the brightest that the sun will awaken in the city or for miles round  no bad advice my son said the honest glover but you what will you do will you lie down beside me or take a part of conachars bed  neither answered harry gow i should but prevent your rest and for me this easy chair is worth a down bed and i will sleep like a sentinel with my graith about me as he spoke he laid his hand on his sword  nay heaven send us no more need of weapons goodnight or rather good morrow till day peep and the first who wakes calls up the other  thus parted the two burghers the glover retired to his bed and it is to be supposed to rest the lover was not so fortunate his bodily frame easily bore the fatigue which he had encountered in the course of the night but his mind was of a different and more delicate mould in one point of view he was but the stout burgher of his period proud alike of his art in making weapons and wielding them when made his professional jealousy personal strength and skill in the use of arms brought him into many quarrels which had made him generally feared and in some instances disliked but with these qualities were united the simple good nature of a child and at the same time an imaginative and enthusiastic temper which seemed little to correspond with his labours at the forge or his combats in the field perhaps a little of the hare brained and ardent feeling which he had picked out of old ballads or from the metrical romances which were his sole source of information or knowledge may have been the means of pricking him on to some of his achievements which had often a rude strain of chivalry in them at least it was certain that his love to the fair catharine had in it a delicacy such as might have become the squire of low degree who was honoured if song speaks truth with the smiles of the king of hungarys daughter his sentiments towards her were certainly as exalted as if they had been fixed upon an actual angel which made old simon and others who watched his conduct think that his passion was too high and devotional to be successful with maiden of mortal mould they were mistaken however catharine coy and reserved as she was had a heart which could feel and understand the nature and depth of the armourers passion and whether she was able to repay it or not she had as much secret pride in the attachment of the redoubted henry gow as a lady of romance may be supposed to have in the company of a tame lion who follows to provide for and defend her it was with sentiments of the most sincere gratitude that she recollected as she awoke at dawn the services of henry during the course of the eventful night and the first thought which she dwelt upon was the means of making him understand her feelings  arising hastily from bed and half blushing at her own purposei have been cold to him and perhaps unjust i will not be ungrateful she said to herself though i cannot yield to his suit i will not wait till my father compels me to receive him as my valentine for the year i will seek him out and choose him myself i have thought other girls bold when they did something like this but i shall thus best please my father and but discharge the rites due to good st valentine by showing my gratitude to this brave man  hastily slipping on her dress which nevertheless was left a good deal more disordered than usual she tripped downstairs and opened the door of the chamber in which as she had guessed her lover had passed the hours after the fray catharine paused at the door and became half afraid of executing her purpose which not only permitted but enjoined the valentines of the year to begin their connexion with a kiss of affection it was looked upon as a peculiarly propitious omen if the one party could find the other asleep and awaken him or her by performance of this interesting ceremony  never was a fairer opportunity offered for commencing this mystic tie than that which now presented itself to catharine after many and various thoughts sleep had at length overcome the stout armourer in the chair in which he had deposited himself his features in repose had a more firm and manly cast than catharine had thought who having generally seen them fluctuating between shamefacedness and apprehension of her displeasure had been used to connect with them some idea of imbecility  he looks very stern she said if he should be angry and then when he awakeswe are aloneif i should call dorothyif i should wake my father but no it is a thing of custom and done in all maidenly and sisterly love and honour i will not suppose that henry can misconstrue it and i will not let a childish bashfulness put my gratitude to sleep  so saying she tripped along the floor of the apartment with a light though hesitating step and a cheek crimsoned at her own purpose and gliding to the chair of the sleeper dropped a kiss upon his lips as light as if a rose leaf had fallen on them the slumbers must have been slight which such a touch could dispel and the dreams of the sleeper must needs have been connected with the cause of the interruption since henry instantly starting up caught the maiden in his arms and attempted to return in ecstasy the salute which had broken his repose but catharine struggled in his embrace and as her efforts implied alarmed modesty rather than maidenly coyness her bashful lover suffered her to escape a grasp from which twenty times her strength could not have extricated her  nay be not angry good henry said catharine in the kindest tone to her surprised lover i have paid my vows to st valentine to show how i value the mate which he has sent me for the year let but my father be present and i will not dare to refuse thee the revenge you may claim for a broken sleep  let not that be a hinderance said the old glover rushing in ecstasy into the room to her smithto her strike while the iron is hot and teach her what it is not to let sleeping dogs lie still  thus encouraged henry though perhaps with less alarming vivacity again seized the blushing maiden in his arms who submitted with a tolerable grace to receive repayment of her salute a dozen times repeated and with an energy very different from that which had provoked such severe retaliation at length she again extricated herself from her lovers arms and as if frightened and repenting what she had done threw herself into a seat and covered her face with her hands  cheer up thou silly girl said her father and be not ashamed that thou hast made the two happiest men in perth since thy old father is one of them never was kiss so well bestowed and meet it is that it should be suitably returned look up my darling look up and let me see thee give but one smile by my honest word the sun that now rises over our fair city shows no sight that can give me greater pleasure what he continued in a jocose tone thou thoughtst thou hadst jamie keddies ring and couldst walk invisible but not so my fairy of the dawning just as i was about to rise i heard thy chamber door open and watched thee downstairs not to protect thee against this sleepy headed henry but to see with my own delighted eyes my beloved girl do that which her father most wished come put down these foolish hands and though thou blushest a little it will only the better grace st valentines morn when blushes best become a maidens cheek  as simon glover spoke he pulled away with gentle violence the hands which hid his daughters face she blushed deeply indeed but there was more than maidens shame in her face and her eyes were fast filling with tears  what weeping love continued her father naynay this is more than need henry help me to comfort this little fool  catharine made an effort to collect herself and to smile but the smile was of a melancholy and serious cast  i only meant to say father said the fair maid of perth with continued exertion that in choosing henry gow for my valentine and rendering to him the rights and greeting of the morning according to wonted custom i meant but to show my gratitude to him for his manly and faithful service and my obedience to you but do not lead him to thinkand oh dearest father do not yourself entertain an ideathat i meant more than what the promise to be his faithful and affectionate valentine through the year requires of me  ayayayay we understand it all said simon in the soothing tone which nurses apply to children we understand what the meaning is enough for onceenough for once thou shalt not be frightened or hurried loving true and faithful valentines are ye and the rest as heaven and opportunity shall permit come prithee have done wring not thy tiny hands nor fear farther persecution now thou hast done bravely excellently and now away to dorothy and call up the old sluggard we must have a substantial breakfast after a night of confusion and a morning of joy and thy hand will be needed to prepare for us some of these delicate cakes which no one can make but thyself and well hast thou a right to the secret seeing who taught it thee ah health to the soul of thy dearest mother he added with a sigh how blythe would she have been to see this happy st valentines morning  catharine took the opportunity of escape which was thus given her and glided from the room to henry it seemed as if the sun had disappeared from the heaven at midday and left the world in sudden obscurity even the high swelled hopes with which the late incident had filled him began to quail as he reflected upon her altered demeanourthe tears in her eyes the obvious fear which occupied her features and the pains she had taken to show as plainly as delicacy would permit that the advances which she had made to him were limited to the character with which the rites of the day had invested him her father looked on his fallen countenance with something like surprise and displeasure  in the name of good st john what has befallen you that makes you look as grave as an owl when a lad of your spirit having really such a fancy for this poor girl as you pretend ought to be as lively as a lark  alas father replied the crestfallen lover there is that written on her brow which says she loves me well enough to be my valentine especially since you wish it but not well enough to be my wife  now a plague on thee for a cold downhearted goosecap answered the father i can read a womans brow as well and better than thou and i can see no such matter on hers what the foul fiend man there thou wast lying like a lord in thy elbow chair as sound asleep as a judge when hadst thou been a lover of any spirit thou wouldst have been watching the east for the first ray of the sun but there thou layest snoring i warrant thinking nought about her or anything else and the poor girl rises at peep of day lest any one else should pick up her most precious and vigilant valentine and wakes thee with a grace whichso help me st macgriderwould have put life in an anvil and thou awakest to hone and pine and moan as if she had drawn a hot iron across thy lips i would to st john she had sent old dorothy on the errand and bound thee for thy valentine service to that bundle of dry bones with never a tooth in her head she were fittest valentine in perth for so craven a wooer  as to craven father answered the smith there are twenty good cocks whose combs i have plucked can tell thee if i am craven or no and heaven knows that i would give my good land held by burgess tenure with smithy bellows tongs anvil and all providing it would make your view of the matter the true one but it is not of her coyness or her blushes that i speak it is of the paleness which so soon followed the red and chased it from her cheeks and it is of the tears which succeeded it was like the april showers stealing upon and obscuring the fairest dawning that ever beamed over the tay  tutti taitti replied the glover neither rome nor perth were built in a day thou hast fished salmon a thousand times and mightst have taken a lesson when the fish has taken the fly to pull a hard strain on the line would snap the tackle to pieces were it made of wire ease your hand man and let him rise take leisure and in half an hour thou layest him on the bank there is a beginning as fair as you could wish unless you expect the poor wench to come to thy bedside as she did to thy chair and that is not the fashion of modest maidens but observe me after we have had our breakfast i will take care thou hast an opportunity to speak thy mind only beware thou be neither too backward nor press her too hard give her line enough but do not slack too fast and my life for yours upon the issue  do what i can father answered henry you will always lay the blame on meeither that i give too much head or that i strain the tackle i would give the best habergeon i ever wrought that the difficulty in truth rested with me for there were then the better chance of its being removed i own however i am but an ass in the trick of bringing about such discourse as is to the purpose for the occasion  come into the booth with me my son and i will furnish thee with a fitting theme thou knowest the maiden who ventures to kiss a sleeping man wins of him a pair of gloves come to my booth thou shalt have a pair of delicate kid skin that will exactly suit her hand and arm i was thinking of her poor mother when i shaped them added honest simon with a sigh and except catharine i know not the woman in scotland whom they would fit though i have measured most of the high beauties of the court come with me i say and thou shalt be provided with a theme to wag thy tongue upon providing thou hast courage and caution to stand by thee in thy wooing    chapter vi       never to man shall catharine give her hand       taming of the shrew   the breakfast was served and the thin soft cakes made of flour and honey according to the family receipt were not only commended with all the partiality of a father and a lover but done liberal justice to in the mode which is best proof of cake as well as pudding they talked jested and laughed catharine too had recovered her equanimity where the dames and damsels of the period were apt to lose theirsin the kitchen namely and in the superintendence of household affairs in which she was an adept i question much if the perusal of seneca for as long a period would have had equal effect in composing her mind  old dorothy sat down at the board end as was the homespun fashion of the period and so much were the two men amused with their own conversation and catharine occupied either in attending to them or with her own reflections that the old woman was the first who observed the absence of the boy conachar  it is true said the master glover go call him the idle highland loon he was not seen last night during the fray neither at least i saw him not did any of you observe him  the reply was negative and henrys observation followed  there are times when highlanders can couch like their own deeray and run from danger too as fast i have seen them do so myself for the matter of that  and there are times replied simon when king arthur and his round table could not make stand against them i wish henry you would speak more reverently of the highlanders they are often in perth both alone and in numbers and you ought to keep peace with them so long as they will keep peace with you  an answer of defiance rose to henrys lips but he prudently suppressed it why thou knowest father he said smiling that we handicrafts best love the folks we live by now my craft provides for valiant and noble knights gentle squires and pages stout men at arms and others that wear the weapons which we make it is natural i should like the ruthvens the lindsays the ogilvys the oliphants and so many others of our brave and noble neighbours who are sheathed in steel of my making like so many paladins better than those naked snatching mountaineers who are ever doing us wrong especially since no five of each clan have a rusty shirt of mail as old as their brattach and that is but the work of the clumsy clan smith after all who is no member of our honourable mystery but simply works at the anvil where his father wrought before him i say such people can have no favour in the eyes of an honest craftsman  wellwell answered simon i prithee let the matter rest even now for here comes the loitering boy and though it is a holyday morn i want no more bloody puddings  the youth entered accordingly his face was pale his eyes red and there was an air of discomposure about his whole person he sat down at the lower end of the table opposite to dorothy and crossed himself as if preparing for his mornings meal as he did not help himself to any food catharine offered him a platter containing some of the cakes which had met with such general approbation at first he rejected her offered kindness rather sullenly but on her repeating the offer with a smile of goodwill he took a cake in his hand broke it and was about to eat a morsel when the effort to swallow seemed almost too much for him and though he succeeded he did not repeat it  you have a bad appetite for st valentines morning conachar said his good humoured master and yet i think you must have slept soundly the night before since i conclude you were not disturbed by the noise of the scuffle why i thought a lively glune amie would have been at his masters side dirk in hand at the first sound of danger which arose within a mile of us  i heard but an indistinct noise said the youth his face glowing suddenly like a heated coal which i took for the shout of some merry revellers and you are wont to bid me never open door or window or alarm the house on the score of such folly  wellwell said simon i thought a highlander would have known better the difference betwixt the clash of swords and the twanging on harps the wild war cry and the merry hunts up but let it pass boy i am glad thou art losing thy quarrelsome fashions eat thy breakfast any way as i have that to employ thee which requires haste  i have breakfasted already and am in haste myself i am for the hills have you any message to my father  none replied the glover in some surprise but art thou beside thyself boy or what a vengeance takes thee from the city like the wing of the whirlwind  my warning has been sudden said conachar speaking with difficulty but whether arising from the hesitation incidental to the use of a foreign language or whether from some other cause could not easily be distinguished there is to be a meetinga great hunting here he stopped  and when are you to return from this blessed hunting said the master that is if i may make so bold as to ask  i cannot exactly answer replied the apprentice perhaps never if such be my fathers pleasure continued conachar with assumed indifference  i thought said simon glover rather seriously that all this was to be laid aside when at earnest intercession i took you under my roof i thought that when i undertook being very loth to do so to teach you an honest trade we were to hear no more of hunting or hosting or clan gatherings or any matters of the kind  i was not consulted when i was sent hither said the lad haughtily i cannot tell what the terms were  but i can tell you sir conachar said the glover angrily that there is no fashion of honesty in binding yourself to an honest craftsman and spoiling more hides than your own is worth and now when you are of age to be of some service in taking up the disposal of your time at your pleasure as if it were your own property not your masters  reckon with my father about that answered conachar he will pay you gallantlya french mutton for every hide i have spoiled and a fat cow or bullock for each day i have been absent  close with him friend gloverclose with him said the armourer drily thou wilt be paid gallantly at least if not honestly methinks i would like to know how many purses have been emptied to fill the goat skin sporran that is to be so free to you of its gold and whose pastures the bullocks have been calved in that are to be sent down to you from the grampian passes  you remind me friend said the highland youth turning haughtily towards the smith that i have also a reckoning to hold with you  keep at arms length then said henry extending his brawny arm i will have no more close hugsno more bodkin work like last night i care little for a wasps sting yet i will not allow the insect to come near me if i have warning  conachar smiled contemptuously i meant thee no harm he said my fathers son did thee but too much honour to spill such churls blood i will pay you for it by the drop that it may be dried up and no longer soil my fingers  peace thou bragging ape said the smith the blood of a true man cannot be valued in gold the only expiation would be that thou shouldst come a mile into the low country with two of the strongest galloglasses of thy clan and while i dealt with them i would leave thee to the correction of my apprentice little jankin  here catharine interposed peace she said my trusty valentine whom i have a right to command and peace you conachar who ought to obey me as your masters daughter it is ill done to awaken again on the morrow the evil which has been laid to sleep at night  farewell then master said conachar after another look of scorn at the smith which he only answered with a laughfarewell and i thank you for your kindness which has been more than i deserve if i have at times seemed less than thankful it was the fault of circumstances and not of my will catharine he cast upon the maiden a look of strong emotion in which various feelings were blended he hesitated as if to say something and at length turned away with the single word farewell  five minutes afterwards with highland buskins on his feet and a small bundle in his hand he passed through the north gate of perth and directed his course to the highlands  there goes enough of beggary and of pride for a whole highland clan said henry he talks as familiarly of gold pieces as i would of silver pennies and yet i will be sworn that the thumb of his mothers worsted glove might hold the treasure of the whole clan  like enough said the glover laughing at the idea his mother was a large boned woman especially in the fingers and wrist  and as for cattle continued henry i reckon his father and brothers steal sheep by one at a time  the less we say of them the better said the glover becoming again grave brothers he hath none his father is a powerful manhath long handsreaches as far as he can and hears farther than it is necessary to talk of him  and yet he hath bound his only son apprentice to a glover in perth said henry why i should have thought the gentle craft as it is called of st crispin would have suited him best and that if the son of some great mac or o was to become an artisan it could only be in the craft where princes set him the example  this remark though ironical seemed to awaken our friend simons sense of professional dignity which was a prevailing feeling that marked the manners of the artisans of the time  you err son henry he replied with much gravity the glovers are the more honourable craft of the two in regard they provide for the accommodation of the hands whereas the shoemakers and cordwainers do but work for the feet  both equally necessary members of the body corporate said henry whose father had been a cordwainer  it may be so my son said the glover but not both alike honourable bethink you that we employ the hands as pledges of friendship and good faith and the feet have no such privilege brave men fight with their hands cowards employ their feet in flight a glove is borne aloft a shoe is trampled in the mire a man greets a friend with his open hand he spurns a dog or one whom he holds as mean as a dog with his advanced foot a glove on the point of a spear is a sign and pledge of faith all the wide world over as a gauntlet flung down is a gage of knightly battle while i know no other emblem belonging to an old shoe except that some crones will fling them after a man by way of good luck in which practice i avow myself to entertain no confidence  nay said the smith amused with his friends eloquent pleading for the dignity of the art he practised i am not the man i promise you to disparage the glovers mystery bethink you i am myself a maker of gauntlets but the dignity of your ancient craft removes not my wonder that the father of this conachar suffered his son to learn a trade of any kind from a lowland craftsman holding us as they do altogether beneath their magnificent degree and a race of contemptible drudges unworthy of any other fate than to be ill used and plundered as often as these bare breeched dunnie wassals see safety and convenience for doing so  ay answered the glover but there were powerful reasons forfor he withheld something which seemed upon his lips and went on for conachars father acting as he did well i have played fair with him and i do not doubt but he will act honourably by me but conachars sudden leave taking has put me to some inconvenience he had things under his charge i must look through the booth  can i help you father said henry gow deceived by the earnestness of his manner  youno said simon with a dryness which made henry so sensible of the simplicity of his proposal that he blushed to the eyes at his own dulness of comprehension in a matter where love ought to have induced him to take his cue easily up  you catharine said the glover as he left the room entertain your valentine for five minutes and see he departs not till my return come hither with me old dorothy and bestir thy limbs in my behalf  he left the room followed by the old woman and henry smith remained with catharine almost for the first time in his life entirely alone there was embarrassment on the maidens part and awkwardness on that of the lover for about a minute when henry calling up his courage pulled the gloves out of his pocket with which simon had supplied him and asked her to permit one who had been so highly graced that morning to pay the usual penalty for being asleep at the moment when he would have given the slumbers of a whole twelvemonth to be awake for a single minute  nay but said catharine the fulfilment of my homage to st valentine infers no such penalty as you desire to pay and i cannot therefore think of accepting them  these gloves said henry advancing his seat insidiously towards catharine as he spoke were wrought by the hands that are dearest to you and seethey are shaped for your own  he extended them as he spoke and taking her arm in his robust hand spread the gloves beside it to show how well they fitted  look at that taper arm he said look at these small fingers think who sewed these seams of silk and gold and think whether the glove and the arm which alone the glove can fit ought to remain separate because the poor glove has had the misfortune to be for a passing minute in the keeping of a hand so swart and rough as mine  they are welcome as coming from my father said catharine and surely not less so as coming from my friend and there was an emphasis on the word as well as my valentine and preserver  let me aid to do them on said the smith bringing himself yet closer to her side they may seem a little over tight at first and you may require some assistance  you are skilful in such service good henry gow said the maiden smiling but at the same time drawing farther from her lover  in good faith no said henry shaking his head my experience has been in donning steel gauntlets on mailed knights more than in fitting embroidered gloves upon maidens  i will trouble you then no further and dorothy shall aid me though there needs no assistance my fathers eye and fingers are faithful to his craft what work he puts through his hands is always true to the measure  let me be convinced of it said the smithlet me see that these slender gloves actually match the hands they were made for  some other time good henry answered the maiden i will wear the gloves in honour of st valentine and the mate he has sent me for the season i would to heaven i could pleasure my father as well in weightier matters at present the perfume of the leather harms the headache i have had since morning  headache dearest maiden echoed her lover  if you call it heartache you will not misname it said catharine with a sigh and proceeded to speak in a very serious tone  henry she said i am going perhaps to be as bold as i gave you reason to think me this morning for i am about to speak the first upon a subject on which it may well be i ought to wait till i had to answer you but i cannot after what has happened this morning suffer my feelings towards you to remain unexplained without the possibility of my being greatly misconceived nay do not answer till you have heard me out you are brave henry beyond most men honest and true as the steel you work upon  stopstop catharine for mercys sake you never said so much that was good concerning me save to introduce some bitter censure of which your praises were the harbingers i am honest and so forth you would say but a hot brained brawler and common sworder or stabber  i should injure both myself and you in calling you such no henry to no common stabber had he worn a plume in his bonnet and gold spurs on his heels would catharine glover have offered the little grace she has this day voluntarily done to you if i have at times dwelt severely upon the proneness of your spirit to anger and of your hand to strife it is because i would have you if i could so persuade you hate in yourself the sins of vanity and wrath by which you are most easily beset i have spoken on the topic more to alarm your own conscience than to express my opinion i know as well as my father that in these forlorn and desperate days the whole customs of our nation nay of every christian nation may be quoted in favour of bloody quarrels for trifling causes of the taking deadly and deep revenge for slight offences and the slaughter of each other for emulation of honour or often in mere sport but i knew that for all these things we shall one day be called into judgment and fain would i convince thee my brave and generous friend to listen oftener to the dictates of thy good heart and take less pride in the strength and dexterity of thy unsparing arm  i ami am convinced catharine exclaimed henry thy words shall henceforward be a law to me i have done enough far too much indeed for proof of my bodily strength and courage but it is only from you catharine that i can learn a better way of thinking remember my fair valentine that my ambition of distinction in arms and my love of strife if it can be called such do not fight even handed with my reason and my milder dispositions but have their patrons and sticklers to egg them on is there a quarrel and suppose that i thinking on your counsels am something loth to engage in it believe you i am left to decide between peace or war at my own choosing not so by st mary there are a hundred round me to stir me on why how now smith is thy mainspring rusted says one jolly henry is deaf on the quarrelling ear this morning says another stand to it for the honour of perth says my lord the provost harry against them for a gold noble cries your father perhaps now what can a poor fellow do catharine when all are hallooing him on in the devils name and not a soul putting in a word on the other side  nay i know the devil has factors enough to utter his wares said catharine but it is our duty to despise such idle arguments though they may be pleaded even by those to whom we owe much love and honour  then there are the minstrels with their romaunts and ballads which place all a mans praise in receiving and repaying hard blows it is sad to tell catharine how many of my sins that blind harry the minstrel hath to answer for when i hit a downright blow it is notso save meto do any man injury but only to strike as william wallace struck  the minstrels namesake spoke this in such a tone of rueful seriousness that catharine could scarce forbear smiling but nevertheless she assured him that the danger of his own and other mens lives ought not for a moment to be weighed against such simple toys  ay but replied henry emboldened by her smiles methinks now the good cause of peace would thrive all the better for an advocate suppose for example that when i am pressed and urged to lay hand on my weapon i could have cause to recollect that there was a gentle and guardian angel at home whose image would seem to whisper henry do no violence it is my hand which you crimson with blood henry rush upon no idle danger it is my breast which you expose to injury such thoughts would do more to restrain my mood than if every monk in perth should cry hold thy hand on pain of bell book and candle  if such a warning as could be given by the voice of sisterly affection can have weight in the debate said catharine do think that in striking you empurple this hand that in receiving wounds you harm this heart  the smith took courage at the sincerely affectionate tone in which these words were delivered  and wherefore not stretch your regard a degree beyond these cold limits why since you are so kind and generous as to own some interest in the poor ignorant sinner before you should you not at once adopt him as your scholar and your husband your father desires it the town expects it glovers and smiths are preparing their rejoicings and you only you whose words are so fair and so kind you will not give your consent  henry said catharine in a low and tremulous voice believe me i should hold it my duty to comply with my fathers commands were there not obstacles invincible to the match which he proposes  yet thinkthink but for a moment i have little to say for myself in comparison of you who can both read and write but then i wish to hear reading and could listen to your sweet voice for ever you love music and i have been taught to play and sing as well as some minstrels you love to be charitable i have enough to give and enough to keep as large a daily alms as a deacon gives would never be missed by me your father gets old for daily toil he would live with us as i should truly hold him for my father also i would be as chary of mixing in causeless strife as of thrusting my hand into my own furnace and if there came on us unlawful violence its wares would be brought to an ill chosen market  may you experience all the domestic happiness which you can conceive henry but with some one more happy than i am  so spoke or rather so sobbed the fair maiden of perth who seemed choking in the attempt to restrain her tears  you hate me then said the lover after a pause  heaven is my witness no  or you love some other better  it is cruel to ask what it cannot avail you to know but you are entirely mistaken  yon wildcat conachar perhaps said henry i have marked his looks  you avail yourself of this painful situation to insult me henry though i have little deserved it conachar is nothing to me more than the trying to tame his wild spirit by instruction might lead me to take some interest in a mind abandoned to prejudices and passions and therein henry not unlike your own  it must then be some of these flaunting silkworm sirs about the court said the armourer his natural heat of temper kindling from disappointment and vexationsome of those who think they carry it off through the height of their plumed bonnets and the jingle of their spurs i would i knew which it was that leaving his natural mates the painted and perfumed dames of the court comes to take his prey among the simple maidens of the burgher craft i would i knew but his name and surname  henry smith said catharine shaking off the weakness which seemed to threaten to overpower her a moment before this is the language of an ungrateful fool or rather of a frantic madman i have told you already there was no one who stood at the beginning of this conference more high in my opinion than he who is now losing ground with every word he utters in the tone of unjust suspicion and senseless anger you had no title to know even what i have told you which i pray you to observe implies no preference to you over others though it disowns any preference of another to you it is enough you should be aware that there is as insuperable an objection to what you desire as if an enchanter had a spell over my destiny  spells may be broken by true men said the smith i would it were come to that thorbiorn the danish armourer spoke of a spell he had for making breastplates by singing a certain song while the iron was heating i told him that his runic rhymes were no proof against the weapons which fought at loncartywhat farther came of it it is needless to tell but the corselet and the wearer and the leech who salved his wound know if henry gow can break a spell or no  catharine looked at him as if about to return an answer little approving of the exploit he had vaunted which the downright smith had not recollected was of a kind that exposed him to her frequent censure but ere she had given words to her thoughts her father thrust his head in at the door  henry he said i must interrupt your more pleasing affairs and request you to come into my working room in all speed to consult about certain matters deeply affecting the weal of the burgh  henry making his obeisance to catharine left the apartment upon her fathers summons indeed it was probably in favour of their future friendly intercourse that they were parted on this occasion at the turn which the conversation seemed likely to take for as the wooer had begun to hold the refusal of the damsel as somewhat capricious and inexplicable after the degree of encouragement which in his opinion she had afforded catharine on the other hand considered him rather as an encroacher upon the grace which she had shown him than one whose delicacy rendered him deserving of such favour but there was living in their bosoms towards each other a reciprocal kindness which on the termination of the dispute was sure to revive inducing the maiden to forget her offended delicacy and the lover his slighted warmth of passion    chapter vii       this quarrel may draw blood another day       henry iv part i   the conclave of citizens appointed to meet for investigating the affray of the preceding evening had now assembled the workroom of simon glover was filled to crowding by personages of no little consequence some of whom wore black velvet cloaks and gold chains around their necks they were indeed the fathers of the city and there were bailies and deacons in the honoured number there was an ireful and offended air of importance upon every brow as they conversed together rather in whisper than aloud or in detail busiest among the busy the little important assistant of the previous night oliver proudfute by name and bonnet maker by profession was bustling among the crowd much after the manner of the seagull which flutters screams and sputters most at the commencement of a gale of wind though one can hardly conceive what the bird has better to do than to fly to its nest and remain quiet till the gale is over  be that as it may master proudfute was in the midst of the crowd his fingers upon every ones button and his mouth in every mans ear embracing such as were near to his own stature that he might more closely and mysteriously utter his sentiments and standing on tiptoe and supporting himself by the cloak collars of tall men that he might dole out to them also the same share of information he felt himself one of the heroes of the affair being conscious of the dignity of superior information on the subject as an eyewitness and much disposed to push his connexion with the scuffle a few points beyond the modesty of truth it cannot be said that his communications were in especial curious and important consisting chiefly of such assertions as these  it is all true by st john i was there and saw it myselfwas the first to run to the fray and if it had not been for me and another stout fellow who came in about the same time they had broken into simon glovers house cut his throat and carried his daughter off to the mountains it is too evil usagenot to be suffered neighbour crookshank not to be endured neighbour glass not to be borne neighbours balneaves rollock and chrysteson it was a mercy that i and that stout fellow came in was it not neighbour and worthy bailie craigdallie  these speeches were dispersed by the busy bonnet maker into sundry ears bailie craigdallie a portly guild brother the same who had advised the prorogation of their civic council to the present place and hour a big burly good looking man shook the deacon from his cloak with pretty much the grace with which a large horse shrugs off the importunate fly that has beset him for ten minutes and exclaimed silence good citizens here comes simon glover in whom no man ever saw falsehood we will hear the outrage from his own mouth  simon being called upon to tell his tale did so with obvious embarrassment which he imputed to a reluctance that the burgh should be put in deadly feud with any one upon his account it was he dared to say a masking or revel on the part of the young gallants about court and the worst that might come of it would be that he would put iron stanchions on his daughters window in case of such another frolic  why then if this was a mere masking or mummery said craigdallie our townsman harry of the wind did far wrong to cut off a gentlemans hand for such a harmless pleasantry and the town may be brought to a heavy fine for it unless we secure the person of the mutilator  our lady forbid said the glover did you know what i do you would be as much afraid of handling this matter as if it were glowing iron but since you will needs put your fingers in the fire truth must be spoken and come what will i must say that the matter might have ended ill for me and mine but for the opportune assistance of henry gow the armourer well known to you all  and mine also was not awanting said oliver proudfute though i do not profess to be utterly so good a swordsman as our neighbour henry gow you saw me neighbour glover at the beginning of the fray  i saw you after the end of it neighbour answered the glover drily  truetrue i had forgot you were in your house while the blows were going and could not survey who were dealing them  peace neighbour proudfutei prithee peace said craigdallie who was obviously tired of the tuneless screeching of the worthy deacon  there is something mysterious here said the bailie but i think i spy the secret our friend simon is as you all know a peaceful man and one that will rather sit down with wrong than put a friend or say a neighbourhood in danger to seek his redress thou henry who art never wanting where the burgh needs a defender tell us what thou knowest of this matter  our smith told his story to the same purpose which we have already related and the meddling maker of bonnets added as before and thou sawest me there honest smith didst thou not  not i in good faith neighbour answered henry but you are a little man you know and i might overlook you  this reply produced a laugh at olivers expense who laughed for company but added doggedly i was one of the foremost to the rescue for all that  why where wert thou then neighbour said the smith for i saw you not and i would have given the worth of the best suit of armour i ever wrought to have seen as stout a fellow as thou at my elbow  i was no farther off however honest smith and whilst thou wert laying on blows as if on an anvil i was parrying those that the rest of the villains aimed at thee behind thy back and that is the cause thou sawest me not  i have heard of smiths of old time who had but one eye said henry i have two but they are both set in my forehead and so i could not see behind my back neighbour  the truth is however persevered master oliver there i was and i will give master bailie my account of the matter for the smith and i were first up to the fray  enough at present said the bailie waving to master proudfute an injunction of silence the precognition of simon glover and henry gow would bear out a matter less worthy of belief and now my masters your opinion what should be done here are all our burgher rights broken through and insulted and you may well fancy that it is by some man of power since no less dared have attempted such an outrage my masters it is hard on flesh and blood to submit to this the laws have framed us of lower rank than the princes and nobles yet it is against reason to suppose that we will suffer our houses to be broken into and the honour of our women insulted without some redress  it is not to be endured answered the citizens unanimously  here simon glover interfered with a very anxious and ominous countenance i hope still that all was not meant so ill as it seemed to us my worthy neighbours and i for one would cheerfully forgive the alarm and disturbance to my poor house providing the fair city were not brought into jeopardy for me i beseech you to consider who are to be our judges that are to hear the case and give or refuse redress i speak among neighbours and friends and therefore i speak openly the king god bless him is so broken in mind and body that he will but turn us over to some great man amongst his counsellors who shall be in favour for the time perchance he will refer us to his brother the duke of albany who will make our petition for righting of our wrongs the pretence for squeezing money out of us  we will none of albany for our judge answered the meeting with the same unanimity as before  or perhaps added simon he will bid the duke of rothsay take charge of it and the wild young prince will regard the outrage as something for his gay companions to scoff at and his minstrels to turn into song  away with rothsay he is too gay to be our judge again exclaimed the citizens  simon emboldened by seeing he was reaching the point he aimed at yet pronouncing the dreaded name with a half whisper next added would you like the black douglas better to deal with  there was no answer for a minute they looked on each other with fallen countenances and blanched lips  but henry smith spoke out boldly and in a decided voice the sentiments which all felt but none else dared give words to the black douglas to judge betwixt a burgher and a gentleman nay a nobleman for all i know or care the black devil of hell sooner you are mad father simon so much as to name so wild a proposal  there was again a silence of fear and uncertainty which was at length broken by bailie craigdallie who looking very significantly to the speaker replied you are confident in a stout doublet neighbour smith or you would not talk so boldly  i am confident of a good heart under my doublet such as it is bailie answered the undaunted henry and though i speak but little my mouth shall never be padlocked by any noble of them all  wear a thick doublet good henry or do not speak so loud reiterated the bailie in the same significant tone there are border men in the town who wear the bloody heart on their shoulder but all this is no rede what shall we do  short rede good rede said the smith let us to our provost and demand his countenance and assistance  a murmur of applause went through the party and oliver proudfute exclaimed that is what i have been saying for this half hour and not one of ye would listen to me let us go to our provost said i he is a gentleman himself and ought to come between the burgh and the nobles in all matters  hush neighbourshush be wary what you say or do said a thin meagre figure of a man whose diminutive person seemed still more reduced in size and more assimilated to a shadow by his efforts to assume an extreme degree of humility and make himself to suit his argument look meaner yet and yet more insignificant than nature had made him  pardon me said he i am but a poor pottingar nevertheless i have been bred in paris and learned my humanities and my cursus medendi as well as some that call themselves learned leeches methinks i can tent this wound and treat it with emollients here is our friend simon glover who is as you all know a man of worship think you he would not be the most willing of us all to pursue harsh courses here since his family honour is so nearly concerned and since he blenches away from the charge against these same revellers consider if he may not have some good reason more than he cares to utter for letting the matter sleep it is not for me to put my finger on the sore but alack we all know that young maidens are what i call fugitive essences suppose now an honest maideni mean in all innocenceleaves her window unlatched on st valentines morn that some gallant cavalier mayin all honesty i meanbecome her valentine for the season and suppose the gallant be discovered may she not scream out as if the visit were unexpected andandbray all this in a mortar and then consider will it be a matter to place the town in feud for  the pottingar delivered his opinion in a most insinuating manner but he seemed to shrink into something less than his natural tenuity when he saw the blood rise in the old cheek of simon glover and inflame to the temples the complexion of the redoubted smith  the last stepping forward and turning a stern look on the alarmed pottingar broke out as follows thou walking skeleton thou asthmatic gallipot thou poisoner by profession if i thought that the puff of vile breath thou hast left could blight for the tenth part of a minute the fair fame of catharine glover i would pound thee quacksalver in thine own mortar and beat up thy wretched carrion with flower of brimstone the only real medicine in thy booth to make a salve to rub mangy hounds with  hold son henryhold cried the glover in a tone of authority no man has title to speak of this matter but me worshipful bailie craigdallie since such is the construction that is put upon my patience i am willing to pursue this riot to the uttermost and though the issue may prove that we had better have been patient you will all see that my catharine hath not by any lightness or folly of hers afforded grounds for this great scandal  the bailie also interposed neighbour henry said he we came here to consult and not to quarrel as one of the fathers of the fair city i command thee to forego all evil will and maltalent you may have against master pottingar dwining  he is too poor a creature bailie said henry gow for me to harbour feud withi that could destroy him and his booth with one blow of my forehammer  peace then and hear me said the official we all are as much believers in the honour of the fair maiden of perth as in that of our blessed lady here he crossed himself devoutly but touching our appeal to our provost are you agreed neighbours to put matter like this into our provosts hand being against a powerful noble as is to be feared  the provost being himself a nobleman squeaked the pottingar in some measure released from his terror by the intervention of the bailie god knows i speak not to the disparagement of an honourable gentleman whose forebears have held the office he now holds for many years  by free choice of the citizens of perth said the smith interrupting the speaker with the tones of his deep and decisive voice  ay surely said the disconcerted orator by the voice of the citizens how else i pray you friend smith interrupt me not i speak to our worthy and eldest bailie craigdallie according to my poor mind i say that come amongst us how he will still this sir patrick charteris is a nobleman and hawks will not pick hawks eyes out he may well bear us out in a feud with the highlandmen and do the part of our provost and leader against them but whether he that himself wears silk will take our part against broidered cloak and cloth of gold though he may do so against tartan and irish frieze is something to be questioned take a fools advice we have saved our maiden of whom i never meant to speak harm as truly i knew none they have lost one mans hand at least thanks to harry smith  and to me added the little important bonnet maker  and to oliver proudfute as he tells us continued the pottingar who contested no mans claim to glory provided he was not himself compelled to tread the perilous paths which lead to it i say neighbours since they have left a hand as a pledge they will never come in couvrefew street again why in my simple mind we were best to thank our stout townsman and the town having the honour and these rakehells the loss that we should hush the matter up and say no more about it  these pacific counsels had their effect with some of the citizens who began to nod and look exceedingly wise upon the advocate of acquiescence with whom notwithstanding the offence so lately given simon glover seemed also to agree in opinion but not so henry smith who seeing the consultation at a stand took up the speech in his usual downright manner  i am neither the oldest nor the richest among you neighbours and i am not sorry for it years will come if one lives to see them and i can win and spend my penny like another by the blaze of the furnace and the wind of the bellows but no man ever saw me sit down with wrong done in word or deed to our fair town if mans tongue and mans hand could right it neither will i sit down with this outrage if i can help it i will go to the provost myself if no one will go with me he is a knight it is true and a gentleman of free and true born blood as we all know since wallaces time who settled his great grandsire amongst us but if he were the proudest nobleman in the land he is the provost of perth and for his own honour must see the freedoms and immunities of the burgh preserveday and i know he will i have made a steel doublet for him and have a good guess at the kind of heart that it was meant to cover  surely said bailie craigdallie it would be to no purpose to stir at court without sir patrick charteriss countenance the ready answer would be go to your provost you borrel loons so neighbours and townsmen if you will stand by my side i and our pottingar dwining will repair presently to kinfauns with sim glover the jolly smith and gallant oliver proudfute for witnesses to the onslaught and speak with sir patrick charteris in name of the fair town  nay said the peaceful man of medicine leave me behind i pray you i lack audacity to speak before a belted knight  never regard that neighbour you must go said bailie craigdallie the town hold me a hot headed carle for a man of threescore sim glover is the offended party we all know that harry gow spoils more harness with his sword than he makes with his hammer and our neighbour proudfute who take his own word is at the beginning and end of every fray in perth is of course a man of action we must have at least one advocate amongst us for peace and quietness and thou pottingar must be the man away with you sirs get your boots and your beastshorse and hattock i say and let us meet at the east port that is if it is your pleasure neighbours to trust us with the matter  there can be no better rede and we will all avouch it said the citizens if the provost take our part as the fair town hath a right to expect we may bell the cat with the best of them  it is well then neighbours answered the bailie so said so shall be done meanwhile i have called the whole town council together about this hour and i have little doubt looking around the company that as so many of them who are in this place have resolved to consult with our provost the rest will be compliant to the same resolution and therefore neighbours and good burghers of the fair city of perth horse and hattock as i said before and meet me at the east port  a general acclamation concluded the sitting of this species of privy council or lords of the articles and they dispersed the deputation to prepare for the journey and the rest to tell their impatient wives and daughters of the measures they had taken to render their chambers safe in future against the intrusion of gallants at unseasonable hours  while nags are saddling and the town council debating or rather putting in form what the leading members of their body had already adopted it may be necessary for the information of some readers to state in distinct terms what is more circuitously intimated in the course of the former discussion  it was the custom at this period when the strength of the feudal aristocracy controlled the rights and frequently insulted the privileges of the royal burghs of scotland that the latter where it was practicable often chose their provost or chief magistrate not out of the order of the merchants shopkeepers and citizens who inhabited the town itself and filled up the roll of the ordinary magistracy but elected to that preeminent state some powerful nobleman or baron in the neighbourhood of the burgh who was expected to stand their friend at court in such matters as concerned their common weal and to lead their civil militia to fight whether in general battle or in private feud reinforcing them with his own feudal retainers this protection was not always gratuitous the provosts sometimes availed themselves of their situation to an unjustifiable degree and obtained grants of lands and tenements belonging to the common good or public property of the burgh and thus made the citizens pay dear for the countenance which they afforded others were satisfied to receive the powerful aid of the townsmen in their own feudal quarrels with such other marks of respect and benevolence as the burgh over which they presided were willing to gratify them with in order to secure their active services in case of necessity the baron who was the regular protector of a royal burgh accepted such freewill offerings without scruple and repaid them by defending the rights of the town by arguments in the council and by bold deeds in the field  the citizens of the town or as they loved better to call it the fair city of perth had for several generations found a protector and provost of this kind in the knightly family of charteris lords of kinfauns in the neighbourhood of the burgh it was scarce a century in the time of robert iii since the first of this distinguished family had settled in the strong castle which now belonged to them with the picturesque and fertile scenes adjoining to it but the history of the first settler chivalrous and romantic in itself was calculated to facilitate the settlement of an alien in the land in which his lot was cast we relate it as it is given by an ancient and uniform tradition which carries in it great indications of truth and is warrant enough perhaps for it insertion in graver histories than the present  during the brief career of the celebrated patriot sir william wallace and when his arms had for a time expelled the english invaders from his native country he is said to have undertaken a voyage to france with a small band of trusty friends to try what his presence for he was respected through all countries for his prowess might do to induce the french monarch to send to scotland a body of auxiliary forces or other assistance to aid the scots in regaining their independence  the scottish champion was on board a small vessel and steering for the port of dieppe when a sail appeared in the distance which the mariners regarded first with doubt and apprehension and at last with confusion and dismay wallace demanded to know what was the cause of their alarm the captain of the ship informed him that the tall vessel which was bearing down with the purpose of boarding that which he commanded was the ship of a celebrated rover equally famed for his courage strength of body and successful piracies it was commanded by a gentleman named thomas de longueville a frenchman by birth but by practice one of those pirates who called themselves friends to the sea and enemies to all who sailed upon that element he attacked and plundered vessels of all nations like one of the ancient norse sea kings as they were termed whose dominion was upon the mountain waves the master added that no vessel could escape the rover by flight so speedy was the bark he commanded and that no crew however hardy could hope to resist him when as was his usual mode of combat he threw himself on board at the head of his followers  wallace smiled sternly while the master of the ship with alarm in his countenance and tears in his eyes described to him the certainty of their being captured by the red rover a name given to de longueville because he usually displayed the blood red flag which he had now hoisted  i will clear the narrow seas of this rover said wallace  then calling together some ten or twelve of his own followers boyd kerlie seton and others to whom the dust of the most desperate battle was like the breath of life he commanded them to arm themselves and lie flat upon the deck so as to be out of sight he ordered the mariners below excepting such as were absolutely necessary to manage the vessel and he gave the master instructions upon pain of death so to steer as that while the vessel had an appearance of attempting to fly he should in fact permit the red rover to come up with them and do his worst wallace himself then lay down on the deck that nothing might be seen which could intimate any purpose of resistance in a quarter of an hour de longuevilles vessel ran on board that of the champion and the red rover casting out grappling irons to make sure of his prize jumped on the deck in complete armour followed by his men who gave a terrible shout as if victory had been already secured but the armed scots started up at once and the rover found himself unexpectedly engaged with men accustomed to consider victory as secure when they were only opposed as one to two or three wallace himself rushed on the pirate captain and a dreadful strife began betwixt them with such fury that the others suspended their own battle to look on and seemed by common consent to refer the issue of the strife to the fate of the combat between the two chiefs the pirate fought as well as man could do but wallaces strength was beyond that of ordinary mortals he dashed the sword from the rovers hand and placed him in such peril that to avoid being cut down he was fain to close with the scottish champion in hopes of overpowering him in the grapple in this also he was foiled they fell on the deck locked in each others arms but the frenchman fell undermost and wallace fixing his grasp upon his gorget compressed it so closely notwithstanding it was made of the finest steel that the blood gushed from his eyes nose and month and he was only able to ask for quarter by signs his men threw down their weapons and begged for mercy when they saw their leader thus severely handled the victor granted them all their lives but took possession of their vessel and detained them prisoners  when he came in sight of the french harbour wallace alarmed the place by displaying the rovers colours as if de longueville was coming to pillage the town the bells were rung backward horns were blown and the citizens were hurrying to arms when the scene changed the scottish lion on his shield of gold was raised above the piratical flag and announced that the champion of scotland was approaching like a falcon with his prey in his clutch he landed with his prisoner and carried him to the court of france where at wallaces request the robberies which the pirate had committed were forgiven and the king even conferred the honour of knighthood on sir thomas de longueville and offered to take him into his service but the rover had contracted such a friendship for his generous victor that he insisted on uniting his fortunes with those of wallace with whom he returned to scotland and fought by his side in many a bloody battle where the prowess of sir thomas de longueville was remarked as inferior to that of none save of his heroic conqueror his fate also was more fortunate than that of his patron being distinguished by the beauty as well as strength of his person he rendered himself so acceptable to a young lady heiress of the ancient family of charteris that she chose him for her husband bestowing on him with her hand the fair baronial castle of kinfauns and the domains annexed to it their descendants took the name of charteris as connecting themselves with their maternal ancestors the ancient proprietors of the property though the name of thomas de longueville was equally honoured amongst them and the large two handed sword with which he mowed the ranks of war was and is still preserved among the family muniments another account is that the family name of de longueville himself was charteris the estate afterwards passed to a family of blairs and is now the property of lord gray  these barons of kinfauns from father to son held for several generations the office of provost of perth the vicinity of the castle and town rendering it a very convenient arrangement for mutual support the sir patrick of this history had more than once led out the men of perth to battles and skirmishes with the restless highland depredators and with other enemies foreign and domestic true it is he used sometimes to be weary of the slight and frivolous complaints unnecessarily brought before him and in which he was requested to interest himself hence he had sometimes incurred the charge of being too proud as a nobleman or too indolent as a man of wealth and one who was too much addicted to the pleasures of the field and the exercise of feudal hospitality to bestir himself upon all and every occasion when the fair town would have desired his active interference but notwithstanding that this occasioned some slight murmuring the citizens upon any serious cause of alarm were wont to rally around their provost and were warmly supported by him both in council and action    chapter viii       within the bounds of annandale      the gentle johnstones ride      they have been there a thousand years      a thousand more theyll bide       old ballad   the character and quality of sir patrick charteris the provost of perth being such as we have sketched in the last chapter let us now return to the deputation which was in the act of rendezvousing at the east port in order to wait upon that dignitary with their complaints at kinfauns  and first appeared simon glover on a pacing palfrey which had sometimes enjoyed the honour of bearing the fairer person as well as the lighter weight of his beautiful daughter his cloak was muffled round the lower part of his face as a sign to his friends not to interrupt him by any questions while he passed through the streets and partly perhaps on account of the coldness of the weather the deepest anxiety was seated on his brow as if the more he meditated on the matter he was engaged in the more difficult and perilous it appeared he only greeted by silent gestures his friends as they came to the rendezvous  a strong black horse of the old galloway breed of an under size and not exceeding fourteen hands but high shouldered strong limbed well coupled and round barrelled bore to the east port the gallant smith a judge of the animal might see in his eye a spark of that vicious temper which is frequently the accompaniment of the form that is most vigorous and enduring but the weight the hand and the seat of the rider added to the late regular exercise of a long journey had subdued his stubbornness for the present he was accompanied by the honest bonnet maker who being as the reader is aware a little round man and what is vulgarly called duck legged had planted himself like a red pincushion for he was wrapped in a scarlet cloak over which he had slung a hawking pouch on the top of a great saddle which he might be said rather to be perched upon than to bestride the saddle and the man were girthed on the ridge bone of a great trampling flemish mare with a nose turned up in the air like a camel a huge fleece of hair at each foot and every hoof full as large in circumference as a frying pan the contrast between the beast and the rider was so extremely extraordinary that whilst chance passengers contented themselves with wondering how he got up his friends were anticipating with sorrow the perils which must attend his coming down again for the high seated horsemans feet did not by any means come beneath the laps of the saddle he had associated himself to the smith whose motions he had watched for the purpose of joining him for it was oliver proudfutes opinion that men of action showed to most advantage when beside each other and he was delighted when some wag of the lower class had gravity enough to cry out without laughing outright there goes the pride of perththere go the slashing craftsmen the jolly smith of the wynd and the bold bonnet maker  it is true the fellow who gave this all hail thrust his tongue in his cheek to some scapegraces like himself but as the bonnet maker did not see this byplay he generously threw him a silver penny to encourage his respect for martialists this munificence occasioned their being followed by a crowd of boys laughing and hallooing until henry smith turning back threatened to switch the foremost of thema resolution which they did not wait to see put in execution  here are we the witnesses said the little man on the large horse as they joined simon glover at the east port but where are they that should back us ah brother henry authority is a load for an ass rather than a spirited horse it would but clog the motions of such young fellows as you and me  i could well wish to see you bear ever so little of that same weight worthy master proudfute replied henry gow were it but to keep you firm in the saddle for you bounce aloft as if you were dancing a jig on your seat without any help from your legs  ayay i raise myself in my stirrups to avoid the jolting she is cruelly hard set this mare of mine but she has carried me in field and forest and through some passages that were something perilous so jezabel and i part not i call her jezabel after the princess of castile  isabel i suppose you mean answered the smith  ayisabel or jezabelall the same you know but here comes bailie craigdallie at last with that poor creeping cowardly creature the pottingar they have brought two town officers with their partizans to guard their fair persons i suppose if there is one thing i hate more than another it is such a sneaking varlet as that dwining  have a care he does not hear you say so said the smith i tell thee bonnet maker that there is more danger in yonder slight wasted anatomy than in twenty stout fellows like yourself  pshaw bully smith you are but jesting with me said oliver softening his voice however and looking towards the pottingar as if to discover in what limb or lineament of his wasted face and form lay any appearance of the menaced danger and his examination reassuring him he answered boldly blades and bucklers man i would stand the feud of a dozen such as dwining what could he do to any man with blood in his veins  he could give him a dose of physic answered the smith drily  they had no time for further colloquy for bailie craigdallie called to them to take the road to kinfauns and himself showed the example as they advanced at a leisurely pace the discourse turned on the reception which they were to expect from their provost and the interest which he was likely to take in the aggression which they complained of the glover seemed particularly desponding and talked more than once in a manner which implied a wish that they would yet consent to let the matter rest he did not speak out very plainly however fearful perhaps of the malignant interpretation which might be derived from any appearance of his flinching from the assertion of his daughters reputation dwining seemed to agree with him in opinion but spoke more cautiously than in the morning  after all said the bailie when i think of all the propines and good gifts which have passed from the good town to my lord provosts i cannot think he will be backward to show himself more than one lusty boat laden with bordeaux wine has left the south shore to discharge its burden under the castle of kinfauns i have some right to speak of that who was the merchant importer  and said dwining with his squeaking voice i could speak of delicate confections curious comfits loaves of wastel bread and even cakes of that rare and delicious condiment which men call sugar that have gone thither to help out a bridal banquet or a kirstening feast or suchlike but alack bailie craigdallie wine is drunk comfits are eaten and the gift is forgotten when the flavour is past away alas neighbour the banquet of last christmas is gone like the last years snow  but there have been gloves full of gold pieces said the magistrate  i should know that who wrought them said simon whose professional recollections still mingled with whatever else might occupy his mind one was a hawking glove for my lady i made it something wide her ladyship found no fault in consideration of the intended lining  well go to said bailie craigdallie the less i lie and if these are not to the fore it is the provosts fault and not the towns they could neither be eat nor drunk in the shape in which he got them  i could speak of a brave armour too said the smith but cogan na schie peace or war i care not as john highlandman saysi think the knight of kinfauns will do his devoir by the burgh in peace or war and it is needless to be reckoning the towns good deeds till we see him thankless for them  so say i cried our friend proudfute from the top of his mare we roystering blades never bear so base a mind as to count for wine and walnuts with a friend like sir patrick charteris nay trust me a good woodsman like sir patrick will prize the right of hunting and sporting over the lands of the burgh as an high privilege and one which his majesty the kings grace excepted is neither granted to lord nor loon save to our provost alone  as the bonnet maker spoke there was heard on the left hand the cry of so sowaw wawhaw being the shout of a falconer to his hawk  methinks yonder is a fellow using the privilege you mention who from his appearance is neither king nor provost said the smith  ay marry i see him said the bonnet maker who imagined the occasion presented a prime opportunity to win honour thou and i jolly smith will prick towards him and put him to the question  have with you then cried the smith and his companion spurred his mare and went off never doubting that gow was at his heels  but craigdallie caught henrys horse by the reins stand fast by the standard he said let us see the luck of our light horseman if he procures himself a broken pate he will be quieter for the rest of the day  from what i already see said the smith he may easily come by such a boon yonder fellow who stops so impudently to look at us as if he were engaged in the most lawful sport in the worldi guess him by his trotting hobbler his rusty head piece with the cocks feather and long two handed sword to be the follower of some of the southland lordsmen who live so near the southron that the black jack is never off their backs and who are as free of their blows as they are light in their fingers  whilst they were thus speculating on the issue of the rencounter the valiant bonnet maker began to pull up jezabel in order that the smith who he still concluded was close behind might overtake him and either advance first or at least abreast of himself but when he saw him at a hundred yards distance standing composedly with the rest of the group the flesh of the champion like that of the old spanish general began to tremble in anticipation of the dangers into which his own venturous spirit was about to involve it yet the consciousness of being countenanced by the neighbourhood of so many friends the hopes that the appearance of such odds must intimidate the single intruder and the shame of abandoning an enterprise in which he had volunteered and when so many persons must witness his disgrace surmounted the strong inclination which prompted him to wheel jezabel to the right about and return to the friends whose protection he had quitted as fast as her legs could carry them he accordingly continued his direction towards the stranger who increased his alarm considerably by putting his little nag in motion and riding to meet him at a brisk trot on observing this apparently offensive movement our hero looked over his left shoulder more than once as if reconnoitring the ground for a retreat and in the mean while came to a decided halt but the philistine was upon him ere the bonnet maker could decide whether to fight or fly and a very ominous looking philistine he was his figure was gaunt and lathy his visage marked by two or three ill favoured scars and the whole man had much the air of one accustomed to say stand and deliver to a true man  this individual began the discourse by exclaiming in tones as sinister as his looks the devil catch you for a cuckoo why do you ride across the moor to spoil my sport  worthy stranger said our friend in the tone of pacific remonstrance i am oliver proudfute a burgess of perth and a man of substance and yonder is the worshipful adam craigdallie the oldest bailie of the burgh with the fighting smith of the wynd and three or four armed men more who desire to know your name and how you come to take your pleasure over these lands belonging to the burgh of perth although natheless i will answer for them it is not their wish to quarrel with a gentleman or stranger for any accidental trespass only it is their use and wont not to grant such leave unless it is duly asked andandtherefore i desire to know your name worthy sir  the grim and loathly aspect with which the falconer had regarded oliver proudfute during his harangue had greatly disconcerted him and altogether altered the character of the inquiry which with henry gow to back him he would probably have thought most fitting for the occasion  the stranger replied to it modified as it was with a most inauspicious grin which the scars of his visage made appear still more repulsive you want to know my name my name is the devils dick of hellgarth well known in annandale for a gentle johnstone i follow the stout laird of wamphray who rides with his kinsman the redoubted lord of johnstone who is banded with the doughty earl of douglas and the earl and the lord and the laird and i the esquire fly our hawks where we find our game and ask no man whose ground we ride over  i will do your message sir replied oliver proudfute meekly enough for he began to be very desirous to get free of the embassy which he had so rashly undertaken and was in the act of turning his horses head when the annandale man added  and take you this to boot to keep you in mind that you met the devils dick and to teach you another time to beware how you spoil the sport of any one who wears the flying spur on his shoulder  with these words he applied two or three smart blows of his riding rod upon the luckless bonnet makers head and person some of them lighted upon jezabel who turning sharply round laid her rider upon the moor and galloped back towards the party of citizens  proudfute thus overthrown began to cry for assistance in no very manly voice and almost in the same breath to whimper for mercy for his antagonist dismounting almost as soon as he fell offered a whinger or large wood knife to his throat while he rifled the pockets of the unlucky citizen and even examined his hawking bag swearing two or three grisly oaths that he would have what it contained since the wearer had interrupted his sport he pulled the belt rudely off terrifying the prostrate bonnet maker still more by the regardless violence which he used as instead of taking the pains to unbuckle the strap he drew till the fastening gave way but apparently it contained nothing to his mind he threw it carelessly from him and at the same time suffered the dismounted cavalier to rise while he himself remounted his hobbler and looked towards the rest of olivers party who were now advancing  when they had seen their delegate overthrown there was some laughter so much had the vaunting humor of the bonnet maker prepared his friends to rejoice when as henry smith termed it they saw the oliver meet with a rowland but when the bonnet makers adversary was seen to bestride him and handle him in the manner described the armourer could hold out no longer  please you good master bailie i cannot endure to see our townsman beaten and rifled and like to be murdered before us all it reflects upon the fair town and if it is neighbour proudfutes misfortune it is our shame i must to his rescue  we will all go to his rescue answered bailie craigdallie but let no man strike without order from me we have more feuds on our hands it is to be feared than we have strength to bring to good end and therefore i charge you all more especially you henry of the wynd in the name of the fair city that you make no stroke but in self defence  they all advanced therefore in a body and the appearance of such a number drove the plunderer from his booty he stood at gaze however at some distance like the wolf which though it retreats before the dogs cannot be brought to absolute flight  henry seeing this state of things spurred his horse and advanced far before the rest of the party up towards the scene of oliver proudfutes misfortune his first task was to catch jezabel by the flowing rein and his next to lead her to meet her discomfited master who was crippling towards him his clothes much soiled with his fall his eyes streaming with tears from pain as well as mortification and altogether exhibiting an aspect so unlike the spruce and dapper importance of his ordinary appearance that the honest smith felt compassion for the little man and some remorse at having left him exposed to such disgrace all men i believe enjoy an ill natured joke the difference is that an ill natured person can drink out to the very dregs the amusement which it affords while the better moulded mind soon loses the sense of the ridiculous in sympathy for the pain of the sufferer  let me pitch you up to your saddle again neighbour said the smith dismounting at the same time and assisting oliver to scramble into his war saddle as a monkey might have done  may god forgive you neighbour smith for not backing of me i would not have believed in it though fifty credible witnesses had sworn it of you  such were the first words spoken in sorrow more than anger by which the dismayed oliver vented his feelings  the bailie kept hold of my horse by the bridle and besides henry continued with a smile which even his compassion could not suppress i thought you would have accused me of diminishing your honour if i brought you aid against a single man but cheer up the villain took foul odds of you your horse not being well at command  that is truethat is true said oliver eagerly catching at the apology  and yonder stands the faitour rejoicing at the mischief he has done and triumphing in your overthrow like the king in the romance who played upon the fiddle whilst a city was burning come thou with me and thou shalt see how we will handle him nay fear not that i will desert thee this time  so saying he caught jezabel by the rein and galloping alongside of her without giving oliver time to express a negative he rushed towards the devils dick who had halted on the top of a rising ground at some distance the gentle johnstone however either that he thought the contest unequal or that he had fought enough for the day snapping his fingers and throwing his hand out with an air of defiance spurred his horse into a neighbouring bog through which he seemed to flutter like a wild duck swinging his lure round his head and whistling to his hawk all the while though any other horse and rider must have been instantly bogged up to the saddle girths  there goes a thoroughbred moss trooper said the smith that fellow will fight or flee as suits his humor and there is no use to pursue him any more than to hunt a wild goose he has got your purse i doubt me for they seldom leave off till they are full handed  yeyeyes said proudfute in a melancholy tone he has got my purse but there is less matter since he hath left the hawking bag  nay the hawking bag had been an emblem of personal victory to be surea trophy as the minstrels call it  there is more in it than that friend said oliver significantly  why that is well neighbour i love to hear you speak in your own scholarly tone again cheer up you have seen the villains back and regained the trophies you had lost when taken at advantage  ah henry gowhenry gow said the bonnet maker and stopped short with a deep sigh nearly amounting to a groan  what is the matter asked his friendwhat is it you vex yourself about now  i have some suspicion my dearest friend henry smith that the villain fled for fear of you not of me  do not think so replied the armourer he saw two men and fled and who can tell whether he fled for one or the other besides he knows by experience your strength and activity we all saw how you kicked and struggled when you were on the ground  did i said poor proudfute i do not remember it but i know it is my best point i am a strong dog in the loins but did they all see it  all as much as i said the smith smothering an inclination to laughter  but thou wilt remind them of it  be assured i will answered henry and of thy desperate rally even now mark what i say to bailie craigdallie and make the best of it  it is not that i require any evidence in thy favour for i am as brave by nature as most men in perth but only here the man of valour paused  but only what inquired the stout armourer  but only i am afraid of being killed to leave my pretty wife and my young family you know would be a sad change smith you will know this when it is your own case and will feel abated in courage  it is like that i may said the armourer musing  then i am so accustomed to the use of arms and so well breathed that few men can match me its all here said the little man expanding his breast like a trussed fowl and patting himself with his handshere is room for all the wind machinery  i dare say you are long breathedlong winded at least your speech bewrays  my speech you are a wagbut i have got the stern post of a dromond brought up the river from dundee  the stern post of a drummond exclaimed the armourer conscience man it will put you in feud with the whole clannot the least wrathful in the country as i take it  st andrew man you put me out i mean a dromondthat is a large ship i have fixed this post in my yard and had it painted and carved something like a soldan or saracen and with him i breathe myself and will wield my two handed sword against him thrust or point for an hour together  that must make you familiar with the use of your weapon said the smith  ay marry does it and sometimes i will place you a bonnetan old one most likelyon my soldans head and cleave it with such a downright blow that in troth the infidel has but little of his skull remaining to hit at  that is unlucky for you will lose your practice said henry but how say you bonnet maker i will put on my head piece and corselet one day and you shall hew at me allowing me my broadsword to parry and pay back eh what say you  by no manner of means my dear friend i should do you too much evil besides to tell you the truth i strike far more freely at a helmet or bonnet when it is set on my wooden soldan then i am sure to fetch it down but when there is a plume of feathers in it that nod and two eyes gleaming fiercely from under the shadow of the visor and when the whole is dancing about here and there i acknowledge it puts out my hand of fence  so if men would but stand stock still like your soldan you would play the tyrant with them master proudfute  in time and with practice i conclude i might answered oliver but here we come up with the rest of them bailie craigdallie looks angry but it is not his kind of anger that frightens me  you are to recollect gentle reader that as soon as the bailie and those who attended him saw that the smith had come up to the forlorn bonnet maker and that the stranger had retreated they gave themselves no trouble about advancing further to his assistance which they regarded as quite ensured by the presence of the redoubted henry gow they had resumed their straight road to kinfauns desirous that nothing should delay the execution of their mission as some time had elapsed ere the bonnet maker and the smith rejoined the party bailie craigdallie asked them and henry smith in particular what they meant by dallying away precious time by riding uphill after the falconer  by the mass it was not my fault master bailie replied the smith if ye will couple up an ordinary low country greyhound with a highland wolf dog you must not blame the first of them for taking the direction in which it pleases the last to drag him on it was so and not otherwise with my neighbour oliver proudfute he no sooner got up from the ground but he mounted his mare like a flash of lightning and enraged at the unknightly advantage which yonder rascal had taken of his stumbling horse he flew after him like a dromedary i could not but follow both to prevent a second stumble and secure our over bold friend and champion from the chance of some ambush at the top of the hill but the villain who is a follower of some lord of the marches and wears a winged spur for his cognizance fled from our neighbour like fire from flint  the senior bailie of perth listened with surprise to the legend which it had pleased gow to circulate for though not much caring for the matter he had always doubted the bonnet makers romancing account of his own exploits which hereafter he must hold as in some degree orthodox  the shrewd old glover looked closer into the matter you will drive the poor bonnet maker mad he whispered to henry and set him aringing his clapper as if he were a town bell on a rejoicing day when for order and decency it were better he were silent  oh by our lady father replied the smith i love the poor little braggadocio and could not think of his sitting rueful and silent in the provosts hall while all the rest of them and in especial that venomous pottingar were telling their mind  thou art even too good natured a fellow henry answered simon but mark the difference betwixt these two men the harmless little bonnet maker assumes the airs of a dragon to disguise his natural cowardice while the pottingar wilfully desires to show himself timid poor spirited and humble to conceal the danger of his temper the adder is not the less deadly that he creeps under a stone i tell thee son henry that for all his sneaking looks and timorous talking this wretched anatomy loves mischief more than he fears danger but here we stand in front of the provosts castle and a lordly place is kinfauns and a credit to the city it is to have the owner of such a gallant castle for its chief magistrate  a goodly fortalice indeed said the smith looking at the broad winding tay as it swept under the bank on which the castle stood like its modern successor and seemed the queen of the valley although on the opposite side of the river the strong walls of elcho appeared to dispute the preeminence elcho however was in that age a peaceful nunnery and the walls with which it was surrounded were the barriers of secluded vestals not the bulwarks of an armed garrison  tis a brave castle said the armourer again looking at the towers of kinfauns and the breastplate and target of the bonny course of the tay it were worth lipping a good blade before wrong were offered to it  the porter of kinfauns who knew from a distance the persons and characters of the party had already opened the courtyard gate for their entrance and sent notice to sir patrick charteris that the eldest bailie of perth with some other good citizens were approaching the castle the good knight who was getting ready for a hawking party heard the intimation with pretty much the same feelings that the modern representative of a burgh hears of the menaced visitation of a party of his worthy electors at a time rather unseasonable for their reception that is he internally devoted the intruders to mahound and termagaunt and outwardly gave orders to receive them with all decorum and civility commanded the sewers to bring hot venison steaks and cold baked meats into the knightly hall with all despatch and the butler to broach his casks and do his duty for if the fair city of perth sometimes filled his cellar her citizens were always equally ready to assist at emptying his flagons  the good burghers were reverently marshalled into the hall where the knight who was in a riding habit and booted up to the middle of his thighs received them with a mixture of courtesy and patronising condescension wishing them all the while at the bottom of the tay on account of the interruption their arrival gave to his proposed amusement of the morning he met them in the midst of the hall with bare head and bonnet in hand and some such salutation as the following  ha my master eldest bailie and you worthy simon glover fathers of the fair city and you my learned pottingar and you stout smith and my slashing bonnet maker too who cracks more skulls than he covers how come i to have the pleasure of seeing so many friends so early i was thinking to see my hawks fly and your company will make the sport more pleasantaside i trust in our lady they may break their necksthat is always unless the city have any commands to lay on me butler gilbert despatch thou knave but i hope you have no more grave errand than to try if the malvoisie holds its flavour  the city delegates answered to their provosts civilities by inclinations and congees more or less characteristic of which the pottingars bow was the lowest and the smiths the least ceremonious probably he knew his own value as a fighting man upon occasion to the general compliment the elder bailie replied  sir patrick charteris and our noble lord provost said craigdallie gravely had our errand been to enjoy the hospitality with which we have been often regaled here our manners would have taught us to tarry till your lordship had invited us as on other occasions and as to hawking we have had enough ont for one morning since a wild fellow who was flying a falcon hard by on the moor unhorsed and cudgelled our worthy friend oliver bonnet maker or proudfute as some men call him merely because he questioned him in your honours name and the town of perths who or what he was that took so much upon him  and what account gave he of himself said the provost by st john i will teach him to forestall my sport  so please your lordship said the bonnet maker he did take me at disadvantage but i got on horseback again afterwards and pricked after him gallantly he calls himself richard the devil  how man he that the rhymes and romances are made on said the provost i thought that smaiks name had been robert  i trow they be different my lord i only graced this fellow with the full title for indeed he called himself the devils dick and said he was a johnstone and a follower of the lord of that name but i put him back into the bog and recovered my hawking bag which he had taken when i was at disadvantage  sir patrick paused for an instant we have heard said he of the lord of johnstone and of his followers little is to be had by meddling with them smith tell me did you endure this  ay faith did i sir patrick having command from my betters not to help  well if thou satst down with it said the provost i see not why we should rise up especially as master oliver proudfute though taken at advantage at first has as he has told us recovered his reputation and that of the burgh but here comes the wine at length fill round to my good friends and guests till the wine leap over the cup prosperity to st johnston and a merry welcome to you all my honest friends and now sit you to eat a morsel for the sun is high up and it must be long since you thrifty men have broken your fast  before we eat my lord provost said the bailie let us tell you the pressing cause of our coming which as yet we have not touched upon  nay prithee bailie said the provost put it off till thou hast eaten some complaint against the rascally jackmen and retainers of the nobles for playing at football on the streets of the burgh or some such goodly matter  no my lord said craigdallie stoutly and firmly it is the jackmens masters of whom we complain for playing at football with the honour of our families and using as little ceremony with our daughters sleeping chambers as if they were in a bordel at paris a party of reiving night walkerscourtiers and men of rank as there is but too much reason to believeattempted to scale the windows of simon glovers house last night they stood in their defence with drawn weapons when they were interrupted by henry smith and fought till they were driven off by the rising of the citizens  how said sir patrick setting down the cup which he was about to raise to his head cocks body make that manifest to me and by the soul of thomas of longueville i will see you righted with my best power were it to cost me life and land who attests this simon glover you are held an honest and a cautious mando you take the truth of this charge upon your conscience  my lord said simon understand i am no willing complainer in this weighty matter no damage has arisen save to the breakers of the peace themselves i fear only great power could have encouraged such lawless audacity and i were unwilling to put feud between my native town and some powerful nobleman on my account but it has been said that if i hang back in prosecuting this complaint it will be as much as admitting that my daughter expected such a visit which is a direct falsehood therefore my lord i will tell your lordship what happened so far as i know and leave further proceeding to your wisdom  he then told from point to point all that he had seen of the attack  sir patrick charteris listening with much attention seemed particularly struck with the escape of the man who had been made prisoner  strange he said that you did not secure him when you had him did you not look at him so as to know him again  i had but the light of a lantern my lord provost and as to suffering him to escape i was alone said the glover and old but yet i might have kept him had i not heard my daughter shriek in the upper room and ere i had returned from her chamber the man had escaped through the garden  now armourer as a true man and a good soldier said sir patrick tell me what you know of this matter  henry gow in his own decided style gave a brief but clear narrative of the whole affair  honest proudfute being next called upon began his statement with an air of more importance touching this awful and astounding tumult within the burgh i cannot altogether it is true say with henry gow that i saw the very beginning but it will not be denied that i beheld a great part of the latter end and especially that i procured the evidence most effectual to convict the knaves  and what is it man said sir patrick charteris never lose time fumbling and prating about it what is it  i have brought your lordship in this pouch what one of the rogues left behind him said the little man it is a trophy which in good faith and honest truth i do confess i won not by the blade but i claim the credit of securing it with that presence of mind which few men possess amidst flashing torches and clashing weapons i secured it my lord and here it is  so saying he produced from the hawking pouch already mentioned the stiffened hand which had been found on the scene of the skirmish  nay bonnet maker said the provost ill warrant thee man enough to secure a rogues hand after it is cut from the body what do you look so busily for in your bag  there should have beenthere wasa ring my lord which was on the knaves finger i fear i have been forgetful and left it at home for i took it off to show to my wife as she cared not to look upon the dead hand as women love not such sights but yet i thought i had put it on the finger again nevertheless it must i bethink me be at home i will ride back for it and henry smith will trot along with me  we will all trot with thee said sir patrick charteris since i am for perth myself look you honest burghers and good neighbours of perth you may have thought me unapt to be moved by light complaints and trivial breaches of your privileges such as small trespasses on your game the barons followers playing football in the street and suchlike but by the soul of thomas of longueville you shall not find patrick charteris slothful in a matter of this importance this hand he continued holding up the severed joint belongs to one who hath worked no drudgery we will put it in a way to be known and claimed of the owner if his comrades of the revel have but one spark of honour in them hark you gerard get me some half score of good men instantly to horse and let them take jack and spear meanwhile neighbours if feud arise out of this as is most likely we must come to each others support if my poor house be attacked how many men will you bring to my support  the burghers looked at henry gow to whom they instinctively turned when such matters were discussed  i will answer said he for fifty good fellows to be assembled ere the common bell has rung ten minutes for a thousand in the space of an hour  it is well answered the gallant provost and in the case of need i will come to aid the fair city with such men as i can make and now good friends let us to horse    chapter ix       if i know how to manage these affairs      thus thrust disorderly upon my hands      never believe me       richard ii   it was early in the afternoon of st valentines day that the prior of the dominicans was engaged in discharge of his duties as confessor to a penitent of no small importance this was an elderly man of a goodly presence a florid and healthful cheek the under part of which was shaded by a venerable white beard which descended over his bosom the large and clear blue eyes with the broad expanse of brow expressed dignity but it was of a character which seemed more accustomed to receive honours voluntarily paid than to enforce them when they were refused the good nature of the expression was so great as to approach to defenceless simplicity or weakness of character unfit it might be inferred to repel intrusion or subdue resistance amongst the grey locks of this personage was placed a small circlet or coronet of gold upon a blue fillet his beads which were large and conspicuous were of native gold rudely enough wrought but ornamented with scottish pearls of rare size and beauty these were his only ornaments and a long crimson robe of silk tied by a sash of the same colour formed his attire his shrift being finished he arose heavily from the embroidered cushion upon which he kneeled during his confession and by the assistance of a crutch headed staff of ebony moved lame and ungracefully and with apparent pain to a chair of state which surmounted by a canopy was placed for his accommodation by the chimney of the lofty and large apartment  this was robert third of that name and the second of the ill fated family of stuart who filled the throne of scotland he had many virtues and was not without talent but it was his great misfortune that like others of his devoted line his merits were not of a kind suited to the part which he was called upon to perform in life the king of so fierce a people as the scots then were ought to have been warlike prompt and active liberal in rewarding services strict in punishing crimes one whose conduct should make him feared as well as beloved the qualities of robert the third were the reverse of all these in youth he had indeed seen battles but without incurring disgrace he had never manifested the chivalrous love of war and peril or the eager desire to distinguish himself by dangerous achievements which that age expected from all who were of noble birth and had claims to authority  besides his military career was very short amidst the tumult of a tournament the young earl of carrick such was then his title received a kick from the horse of sir james douglas of dalkeith in consequence of which he was lame for the rest of his life and absolutely disabled from taking share either in warfare or in the military sports and tournaments which were its image as robert had never testified much predilection for violent exertion he did not probably much regret the incapacities which exempted him from these active scenes but his misfortune or rather its consequences lowered him in the eyes of a fierce nobility and warlike people he was obliged to repose the principal charge of his affairs now in one member now in another of his family sometimes with the actual rank and always with the power of lieutenant general of the kingdom his paternal affection would have induced him to use the assistance of his eldest son a young man of spirit and talent whom in fondness he had created duke of rothsay in order to give him the present possession of a dignity next to that of the throne but the young princes head was too giddy and his hand too feeble to wield with dignity the delegated sceptre however fond of power pleasure was the princes favourite pursuit and the court was disturbed and the country scandalised by the number of fugitive amours and extravagant revels practised by him who should have set an example of order and regularity to the youth of the kingdom  the license and impropriety of the duke of rothsays conduct was the more reprehensible in the public view that he was a married person although some over whom his youth gaiety grace and good temper had obtained influence were of opinion that an excuse for his libertinism might be found in the circumstances of the marriage itself they reminded each other that his nuptials were entirely conducted by his uncle the duke of albany by whose counsels the infirm and timid king was much governed at the time and who had the character of managing the temper of his brother and sovereign so as might be most injurious to the interests and prospects of the young heir by albanys machinations the hand of the heir apparent was in a manner put up to sale as it was understood publicly that the nobleman in scotland who should give the largest dower to his daughter might aspire to raise her to the bed of the duke of rothsay  in the contest for preference which ensued george earl of dunbar and march who possessed by himself or his vassals a great part of the eastern frontier was preferred to other competitors and his daughter was with the mutual goodwill of the young couple actually contracted to the duke of rothsay  but there remained a third party to be consulted and that was no other than the tremendous archibald earl of douglas terrible alike from the extent of his lands from the numerous offices and jurisdictions with which he was invested and from his personal qualities of wisdom and valour mingled with indomitable pride and more than the feudal love of vengeance the earl was also nearly related to the throne having married the eldest daughter of the reigning monarch  after the espousals of the duke of rothsay with the earl of marchs daughter douglas as if he had postponed his share in the negotiation to show that it could not be concluded with any one but himself entered the lists to break off the contract he tendered a larger dower with his daughter marjory than the earl of march had proffered and secured by his own cupidity and fear of the douglas albany exerted his influence with the timid monarch till he was prevailed upon to break the contract with the earl of march and wed his son to marjory douglas a woman whom rothsay could not love no apology was offered to the earl of march excepting that the espousals betwixt the prince and elizabeth of dunbar had not been approved by the states of parliament and that till such ratification the contract was liable to be broken off the earl deeply resented the wrong done to himself and his daughter and was generally understood to study revenge which his great influence on the english frontier was likely to place within his power  in the mean time the duke of rothsay incensed at the sacrifice of his hand and his inclinations to this state intrigue took his own mode of venting his displeasure by neglecting his wife contemning his formidable and dangerous father in law and showing little respect to the authority of the king himself and none whatever to the remonstrances of albany his uncle whom he looked upon as his confirmed enemy  amid these internal dissensions of his family which extended themselves through his councils and administration introducing everywhere the baneful effects of uncertainty and disunion the feeble monarch had for some time been supported by the counsels of his queen annabella a daughter of the noble house of drummond gifted with a depth of sagacity and firmness of mind which exercised some restraint over the levities of a son who respected her and sustained on many occasions the wavering resolution of her royal husband but after her death the imbecile sovereign resembled nothing so much as a vessel drifted from her anchors and tossed about amidst contending currents abstractedly considered robert might be said to doat upon his son to entertain respect and awe for the character of his brother albany so much more decisive than his own to fear the douglas with a terror which was almost instinctive and to suspect the constancy of the bold but fickle earl of march but his feelings towards these various characters were so mixed and complicated that from time to time they showed entirely different from what they really were and according to the interest which had been last exerted over his flexible mind the king would change from an indulgent to a strict and even cruel father from a confiding to a jealous brother or from a benignant and bountiful to a grasping and encroaching sovereign like the chameleon his feeble mind reflected the colour of that firmer character upon which at the time he reposed for counsel and assistance and when he disused the advice of one of his family and employed the counsel of another it was no unwonted thing to see a total change of measures equally disrespectable to the character of the king and dangerous to the safety of the state  it followed as a matter of course that the clergy of the catholic church acquired influence over a man whose intentions were so excellent but whose resolutions were so infirm robert was haunted not only with a due sense of the errors he had really committed but with the tormenting apprehensions of those peccadilloes which beset a superstitious and timid mind it is scarce necessary therefore to add that the churchmen of various descriptions had no small influence over this easy tempered prince though indeed theirs was at that period an influence from which few or none escaped however resolute and firm of purpose in affairs of a temporal character we now return from this long digression without which what we have to relate could not perhaps have been well understood  the king had moved with ungraceful difficulty to the cushioned chair which under a state or canopy stood prepared for his accommodation and upon which he sank down with enjoyment like an indolent man who had been for some time confined to a constrained position when seated the gentle and venerable looks of the good old man showed benevolence the prior who now remained standing opposite to the royal seat with an air of deep deference which cloaked the natural haughtiness of his carriage was a man betwixt forty and fifty years of age but every one of whose hairs still retained their natural dark colour acute features and a penetrating look attested the talents by which the venerable father had acquired his high station in the community over which he presided and we may add in the councils of the kingdom in whose service they were often exercised the chief objects which his education and habits taught him to keep in view were the extension of the dominion and the wealth of the church and the suppression of heresy both of which he endeavoured to accomplish by all the means which his situation afforded him but he honoured his religion by the sincerity of his own belief and by the morality which guided his conduct in all ordinary situations the faults of the prior anselm though they led him into grievous error and even cruelty were perhaps rather those of his age and profession his virtues were his own  these things done said the king and the lands i have mentioned secured by my gift to this monastery you are of opinion father that i stand as much in the good graces of our holy mother church as to term myself her dutiful son  surely my liege said the prior would to god that all her children brought to the efficacious sacrament of confession as deep a sense of their errors and as much will to make amends for them but i speak these comforting words my liege not to robert king of scotland but only to my humble and devout penitent robert stuart of carrick  you surprise me father answered the king i have little check on my conscience for aught that i have done in my kingly office seeing that i use therein less mine own opinion than the advice of the most wise counsellors  even therein lieth the danger my liege replied the prior the holy father recognises in your grace in every thought word and action an obedient vassal of the holy church but there are perverse counsellors who obey the instinct of their wicked hearts while they abuse the good nature and ductility of their monarch and under colour of serving his temporal interests take steps which are prejudicial to those that last to eternity  king robert raised himself upright in his chair and assumed an air of authority which though it well became him he did not usually display  prior anselm he said if you have discovered anything in my conduct whether as a king or a private individual which may call down such censures as your words intimate it is your duty to speak plainly and i command you to do so  my liege you shall be obeyed answered the prior with an inclination of the body then raising himself up and assuming the dignity of his rank in the church he said hear from me the words of our holy father the pope the successor of st peter to whom have descended the keys both to bind and to unloose wherefore o robert of scotland hast thou not received into the see of st andrews henry of wardlaw whom the pontiff hath recommended to fill that see why dost thou make profession with thy lips of dutiful service to the church when thy actions proclaim the depravity and disobedience of thy inward soul obedience is better than sacrifice  sir prior said the monarch bearing himself in a manner not unbecoming his lofty rank we may well dispense with answering you upon this subject being a matter which concerns us and the estates of our kingdom but does not affect our private conscience  alas said the prior and whose conscience will it concern at the last day which of your belted lords or wealthy burgesses will then step between their king and the penalty which he has incurred by following of their secular policy in matters ecclesiastical know mighty king that were all the chivalry of thy realm drawn up to shield thee from the red levin bolt they would be consumed like scorched parchment before the blaze of a furnace  good father prior said the king on whose timorous conscience this kind of language seldom failed to make an impression you surely argue over rigidly in this matter it was during my last indisposition while the earl of douglas held as lieutenant general the regal authority in scotland that the obstruction to the reception of the primate unhappily arose do not therefore tax me with what happened when i was unable to conduct the affairs of the kingdom and compelled to delegate my power to another  to your subject sire you have said enough replied the prior but if the impediment arose during the lieutenancy of the earl of douglas the legate of his holiness will demand wherefore it has not been instantly removed when the king resumed in his royal hands the reins of authority the black douglas can do muchmore perhaps than a subject should have power to do in the kingdom of his sovereign but he cannot stand betwixt your grace and your own conscience or release you from the duties to the holy church which your situation as a king imposes upon you  father said robert somewhat impatiently you are over peremptory in this matter and ought at least to wait a reasonable season until we have time to consider of some remedy such disputes have happened repeatedly in the reigns of our predecessors and our royal and blessed ancestor st david did not resign his privileges as a monarch without making a stand in their defence even though he was involved in arguments with the holy father himself  and therein was that great and good king neither holy nor saintly said the prior and therefore was he given to be a rout and a spoil to his enemies when he raised his sword against the banners of st peter and st paul and st john of beverley in the war as it is still called of the standard well was it for him that like his namesake the son of jesse his sin was punished upon earth and not entered against him at the long and dire day of accounting  well good priorwellenough of this for the present the holy see shall god willing have no reason to complain of me i take our lady to witness i would not for the crown i wear take the burden of wronging our mother church we have ever feared that the earl of douglas kept his eyes too much fixed on the fame and the temporalities of this frail and passing life to feel altogether as he ought the claims that refer to a future world  it is but lately said the prior that he hath taken up forcible quarters in the monastery of aberbrothock with his retinue of a thousand followers and the abbot is compelled to furnish him with all he needs for horse and man which the earl calls exercising the hospitality which he hath a right to expect from the foundation to which his ancestors were contributors certain it were better to return to the douglas his lands than to submit to such exaction which more resembles the masterful license of highland thiggers and sorners sturdy beggars than the demeanour of a christian baron  the black douglasses said the king with a sigh are a race which will not be said nay but father prior i am myself it may be an intruder of this kind for my sojourning hath been long among you and my retinue though far fewer than the douglass are nevertheless enough to cumber you for their daily maintenance and though our order is to send out purveyors to lessen your charge as much as may be yet if there be inconvenience it were fitting we should remove in time  now our lady forbid said the prior who if desirous of power had nothing meanly covetous in his temper but was even magnificent in his generous kindness certainly the dominican convent can afford to her sovereign the hospitality which the house offers to every wanderer of whatever condition who will receive it at the hands of the poor servants of our patron no my royal liege come with ten times your present train they shall neither want a grain of oats a pile of straw a morsel of bread nor an ounce of food which our convent can supply them it is one thing to employ the revenues of the church which are so much larger than monks ought to need or wish for in the suitable and dutiful reception of your royal majesty and another to have it wrenched from us by the hands of rude and violent men whose love of rapine is only limited by the extent of their power  it is well good prior said the king and now to turn our thoughts for an instant from state affairs can thy reverence inform us how the good citizens of perth have begun their valentines day gallantly and merrily and peacefully i hope  for gallantly my liege i know little of such qualities for peacefully there were three or four men two cruelly wounded came this morning before daylight to ask the privilege of girth and sanctuary pursued by a hue and cry of citizens in their shirts with clubs bills lochaber axes and two handed swords crying kill and slay each louder than another nay they were not satisfied when our porter and watch told them that those they pursued had taken refuge in the galilee of the church but continued for some minutes clamouring and striking upon the postern door demanding that the men who had offended should be delivered up to them i was afraid their rude noise might have broken your majestys rest and raised some surprise  my rest might have been broken said the monarch but that sounds of violence should have occasioned surprisealas reverend father there is in scotland only one place where the shriek of the victim and threats of the oppressor are not heard and that father isthe grave  the prior stood in respectful silence sympathising with the feelings of a monarch whose tenderness of heart suited so ill with the condition and manners of his people  and what became of the fugitives asked robert after a minutes pause  surely sire said the prior they were dismissed as they desired to be before daylight and after we had sent out to be assured that no ambush of their enemies watched them in the vicinity they went their way in peace  you know nothing inquired the king who the men were or the cause of their taking refuge with you  the cause said the prior was a riot with the townsmen but how arising is not known to us the custom of our house is to afford twentyfour hours of uninterrupted refuge in the sanctuary of st dominic without asking any question at the poor unfortunates who have sought relief there if they desire to remain for a longer space the cause of their resorting to sanctuary must be put upon the register of the convent and praised be our holy saint many persons escape the weight of the law by this temporary protection whom did we know the character of their crimes we might have found ourselves obliged to render up to their pursuers and persecutors  as the prior spoke a dim idea occurred to the monarch that the privilege of sanctuary thus peremptorily executed must prove a severe interruption to the course of justice through his realm but he repelled the feeling as if it had been a suggestion of satan and took care that not a single word should escape to betray to the churchman that such a profane thought had ever occupied his bosom on the contrary he hasted to change the subject  the sun he said moves slowly on the index after the painful information you have given me i expected the lords of my council ere now to take order with the ravelled affairs of this unhappy riot evil was the fortune which gave me rule over a people among whom it seems to me i am in my own person the only man who desires rest and tranquillity  the church always desires peace and tranquillity added the prior not suffering even so general a proposition to escape the poor kings oppressed mind without insisting on a saving clause for the churchs honour  we meant nothing else said robert but father prior you will allow that the church in quelling strife as is doubtless her purpose resembles the busy housewife who puts in motion the dust which she means to sweep away  to this remark the prior would have made some reply but the door of the apartment was opened and a gentleman usher announced the duke of albany    chapter x       gentle friend      chide not her mirth who was sad yesterday      and may be so tomorrow       joanna baillie   the duke of albany was like his royal brother named robert the christian name of the latter had been john until he was called to the throne when the superstition of the times observed that the name had been connected with misfortune in the lives and reigns of john of england john of france and john baliol of scotland it was therefore agreed that to elude the bad omen the new king should assume the name of robert rendered dear to scotland by the recollections of robert bruce we mention this to account for the existence of two brothers of the same christian name in one family which was not certainly an usual occurrence more than at the present day  albany also an aged man was not supposed to be much more disposed for warlike enterprise than the king himself but if he had not courage he had wisdom to conceal and cloak over his want of that quality which once suspected would have ruined all the plans which his ambition had formed he had also pride enough to supply in extremity the want of real valour and command enough over his nerves to conceal their agitation in other respects he was experienced in the ways of courts calm cool and crafty fixing upon the points which he desired to attain while they were yet far removed and never losing sight of them though the winding paths in which he trode might occasionally seem to point to a different direction in his person he resembled the king for he was noble and majestic both in stature and countenance but he had the advantage of his elder brother in being unencumbered with any infirmity and in every respect lighter and more active his dress was rich and grave as became his age and rank and like his royal brother he wore no arms of any kind a case of small knives supplying at his girdle the place usually occupied by a dagger in absence of a sword  at the dukes entrance the prior after making an obeisance respectfully withdrew to a recess in the apartment at some distance from the royal seat in order to leave the conversation of the brothers uncontrolled by the presence of a third person it is necessary to mention that the recess was formed by a window placed in the inner front of the monastic buildings called the palace from its being the frequent residence of the kings of scotland but which was unless on such occasions the residence of the prior or abbot the window was placed over the principal entrance to the royal apartments and commanded a view of the internal quadrangle of the convent formed on the right hand by the length of the magnificent church on the left by a building containing the range of cellars with the refectory chapter house and other conventual apartments rising above them for such existed altogether independent of the space occupied by king robert and his attendants while a fourth row of buildings showing a noble outward front to the rising sun consisted of a large hospitium for the reception of strangers and pilgrims and many subordinate offices warehouses and places of accommodation for the ample stores which supplied the magnificent hospitality of the dominican fathers a lofty vaulted entrance led through this eastern front into the quadrangle and was precisely opposite to the window at which prior anselm stood so that he could see underneath the dark arch and observe the light which gleamed beneath it from the eastern and open portal but owing to the height to which he was raised and the depth of the vaulted archway his eye could but indistinctly reach the opposite and extended portal it is necessary to notice these localities  we return to the conversation between the princely relatives  my dear brother said the king raising the duke of albany as he stooped to kiss his handmy dear dear brother wherefore this ceremonial are we not both sons of the same stuart of scotland and of the same elizabeth more  i have not forgot that it is so said albany arising but i must not omit in the familiarity of the brother the respect that is due to the king  oh truemost true robin answered the king the throne is like a lofty and barren rock upon which flower or shrub can never take root all kindly feelings all tender affections are denied to a monarch a king must not fold a brother to his hearthe dare not give way to fondness for a son  such in some respects is the doom of greatness sire answered albany but heaven who removed to some distance from your majestys sphere the members of your own family has given you a whole people to be your children  alas robert answered the monarch your heart is better framed for the duties of a sovereign than mine i see from the height at which fate has placed me that multitude whom you call my children i love them i wish them well but they are many and they are distant from me alas even the meanest of them has some beloved being whom he can clasp to his heart and upon whom he can lavish the fondness of a father but all that a king can give to a people is a smile such as the sun bestows on the snowy peaks of the grampian mountains as distant and as ineffectual alas robin our father used to caress us and if he chid us it was with a tone of kindness yet he was a monarch as well as i and wherefore should not i be permitted like him to reclaim my poor prodigal by affection as well as severity  had affection never been tried my liege replied albany in the tone of one who delivers sentiments which he grieves to utter means of gentleness ought assuredly to be first made use of your grace is best judge whether they have been long enough persevered in and whether those of discouragement and restraint may not prove a more effectual corrective it is exclusively in your royal power to take what measures with the duke of rothsay you think will be most available to his ultimate benefit and that of the kingdom  this is unkind brother said the king you indicate the painful path which you would have me pursue yet you offer me not your support in treading it  my support your grace may ever command replied albany but would it become me of all men on earth to prompt to your grace severe measures against your son and heir me on whom in case of failurewhich heaven forefendof your graces family this fatal crown might descend would it not be thought and said by the fiery march and the haughty douglas that albany had sown dissension between his royal brother and the heir to the scottish throne perhaps to clear the way for the succession of his own family no my liege i can sacrifice my life to your service but i must not place my honour in danger  you say true robinyou say very true replied the king hastening to put his own interpretation upon his brothers words we must not suffer these powerful and dangerous lords to perceive that there is aught like discord in the royal family that must be avoided of all things and therefore we will still try indulgent measures in hopes of correcting the follies of rothsay i behold sparks of hope in him robin from time to time that are well worth cherishing he is youngvery younga prince and in the heyday of his blood we will have patience with him like a good rider with a hot tempered horse let him exhaust this idle humor and no one will be better pleased with him than yourself you have censured me in your kindness for being too gentle too retired rothsay has no such defects  i will pawn my life he has not replied albany drily  and he wants not reflection as well as spirit continued the poor king pleading the cause of his son to his brother i have sent for him to attend council today and we shall see how he acquits himself of his devoir you yourself allow robin that the prince wants neither shrewdness nor capacity for affairs when he is in the humor to consider them  doubtless he wants neither my liege replied albany when he is in the humor to consider them  i say so answered the king and am heartily glad that you agree with me robin in giving this poor hapless young man another trial he has no mother now to plead his cause with an incensed father that must be remembered albany  i trust said albany the course which is most agreeable to your graces feelings will also prove the wisest and the best  the duke well saw the simple stratagem by which the king was endeavouring to escape from the conclusions of his reasoning and to adopt under pretence of his sanction a course of proceeding the reverse of what it best suited him to recommend but though he saw he could not guide his brother to the line of conduct he desired he would not abandon the reins but resolved to watch for a fitter opportunity of obtaining the sinister advantages to which new quarrels betwixt the king and prince were soon he thought likely to give rise  in the mean time king robert afraid lest his brother should resume the painful subject from which he had just escaped called aloud to the prior of the dominicans i hear the trampling of horse your station commands the courtyard reverend father look from the window and tell us who alights rothsay is it not  the noble earl of march with his followers said the prior  is he strongly accompanied said the king do his people enter the inner gate  at the same moment albany whispered the king fear nothing the brandanes of your household are under arms  the king nodded thanks while the prior from the window answered the question he had put the earl is attended by two pages two gentlemen and four grooms one page follows him up the main staircase bearing his lordships sword the others halt in the court andbenedicite how is this here is a strolling glee woman with her viol preparing to sing beneath the royal windows and in the cloister of the dominicans as she might in the yard of an hostelrie i will have her presently thrust forth  not so father said the king let me implore grace for the poor wanderer the joyous science as they call it which they profess mingles sadly with the distresses to which want and calamity condemn a strolling race and in that they resemble a king to whom all men cry all hail while he lacks the homage and obedient affection which the poorest yeoman receives from his family let the wanderer remain undisturbed father and let her sing if she will to the yeomen and troopers in the court it will keep them from quarrelling with each other belonging as they do to such unruly and hostile masters  so spoke the well meaning and feeble minded prince and the prior bowed in acquiescence as he spoke the earl of march entered the hall of audience dressed in the ordinary riding garb of the time and wearing his poniard he had left in the anteroom the page of honour who carried his sword the earl was a well built handsome man fair complexioned with a considerable profusion of light coloured hair and bright blue eyes which gleamed like those of a falcon he exhibited in his countenance otherwise pleasing the marks of a hasty and irritable temper which his situation as a high and powerful feudal lord had given him but too many opportunities of indulging  i am glad to see you my lord of march said the king with a gracious inclination of his person you have been long absent from our councils  my liege answered march with a deep reverence to the king and a haughty and formal inclination to the duke of albany if i have been absent from your graces councils it is because my place has been supplied by more acceptable and i doubt not abler counsellors and now i come but to say to your highness that the news from the english frontier make it necessary that i should return without delay to my own estates your grace has your wise and politic brother my lord of albany with whom to consult and the mighty and warlike earl of douglas to carry your counsels into effect i am of no use save in my own country and thither with your highnesss permission i am purposed instantly to return to attend my charge as warden of the eastern marches  you will not deal so unkindly with us cousin replied the gentle monarch here are evil tidings on the wind these unhappy highland clans are again breaking into general commotion and the tranquillity even of our own court requires the wisest of our council to advise and the bravest of our barons to execute what may be resolved upon the descendant of thomas randolph will not surely abandon the grandson of robert bruce at such a period as this  i leave with him the descendant of the far famed james of douglas answered march it is his lordships boast that he never puts foot in stirrup but a thousand horse mount with him as his daily lifeguard and i believe the monks of aberbrothock will swear to the fact surely with all the douglass chivalry they are fitter to restrain a disorderly swarm of highland kerne than i can be to withstand the archery of england and power of henry hotspur and then here is his grace of albany so jealous in his care of your highnesss person that he calls your brandanes to take arms when a dutiful subject like myself approaches the court with a poor half score of horse the retinue of the meanest of the petty barons who own a tower and a thousand acres of barren heath when such precautions are taken where there is not the slightest chance of perilsince i trust none was to be apprehended from meyour royal person will surely be suitably guarded in real danger  my lord of march said the duke of albany the meanest of the barons of whom you speak put their followers in arms even when they receive their dearest and nearest friends within the iron gate of their castle and if it please our lady i will not care less for the kings person than they do for their own the brandanes are the kings immediate retainers and household servants and an hundred of them is but a small guard round his grace when yourself my lord as well as the earl of douglas often ride with ten times the number  my lord duke replied march when the service of the king requires it i can ride with ten times as many horse as your grace has named but i have never done so either traitorously to entrap the king nor boastfully to overawe other nobles  brother robert said the king ever anxious to be a peacemaker you do wrong even to intimate a suspicion of my lord of march and you cousin of march misconstrue my brothers caution but harkto divert this angry parleyi hear no unpleasing touch of minstrelsy you know the gay science my lord of march and love it well step to yonder window beside the holy prior at whom we make no question touching secular pleasures and you will tell us if the music and play be worth listening to the notes are of france i think my brother of albanys judgment is not worth a cockle shell in such matters so you cousin must report your opinion whether the poor glee maiden deserves recompense our son and the douglas will presently be here and then when our council is assembled we will treat of graver matters  with something like a smile on his proud brow march withdrew into the recess of the window and stood there in silence beside the prior like one who while he obeyed the kings command saw through and despised the timid precaution which it implied as an attempt to prevent the dispute betwixt albany and himself the tune which was played upon a viol was gay and sprightly in the commencement with a touch of the wildness of the troubadour music but as it proceeded the faltering tones of the instrument and of the female voice which accompanied it became plaintive and interrupted as if choked by the painful feelings of the minstrel  the offended earl whatever might be his judgment in such matters on which the king had complimented him paid it may be supposed little attention to the music of the female minstrel his proud heart was struggling between the allegiance he owed his sovereign as well as the love he still found lurking in his bosom for the person of his well natured king and a desire of vengeance arising out of his disappointed ambition and the disgrace done to him by the substitution of marjory douglas to be bride of the heir apparent instead of his betrothed daughter march had the vices and virtues of a hasty and uncertain character and even now when he came to bid the king adieu with the purpose of renouncing his allegiance as soon as he reached his own feudal territories he felt unwilling and almost unable to resolve upon a step so criminal and so full of peril it was with such dangerous cogitations that he was occupied during the beginning of the glee maidens lay but objects which called his attention powerfully as the songstress proceeded affected the current of his thoughts and riveted them on what was passing in the courtyard of the monastery the song was in the provencal dialect well understood as the language of poetry in all the courts of europe and particularly in scotland it was more simply turned however than was the general cast of the sirventes and rather resembled the lai of a norman minstrel it may be translated thus       the lay of poor louise       ah poor louise  the livelong day      she roams from cot to castle gay      and still her voice and viol say      ah maids beware the woodland way      think on louise       ah poor louise  the sun was high      it smirchd her cheek it dimmd her eye      the woodland walk was cool and nigh      where birds with chiming streamlets vie      to cheer louise       ah poor louise  the savage bear      made neer that lovely grove his lair      the wolves molest not paths so fair      but better far had such been there      for poor louise       ah poor louise  in woody wold      she met a huntsman fair and bold      his baldrick was of silk and gold      and many a witching tale he told      to poor louise       ah poor louise  small cause to pine      hadst thou for treasures of the mine      for peace of mind that gift divine      and spotless innocence were thine      ah poor louise       ah poor louise  thy treasures reft      i know not if by force or theft      or part by violence part by gift      but misery is all thats left      to poor louise       let poor louise some succour have      she will not long your bounty crave      or tire the gay with warning stave      for heaven has grace and earth a grave      for poor louise  the song was no sooner finished than anxious lest the dispute should be revived betwixt his brother and the earl of march king robert called to the latter what think you of the minstrelsy my lord methinks as i heard it even at this distance it was a wild and pleasing lay  my judgment is not deep my lord but the singer may dispense with my approbation since she seems to have received that of his grace of rothsay the best judge in scotland  how said the king in alarm is my son below  he is sitting on horseback by the glee maiden said march with a malicious smile on his cheek apparently as much interested by her conversation as her music  how is this father prior said the king  but the prior drew back from the lattice i have no will to see my lord things which it would pain me to repeat  how is all this said the king who coloured deeply and seemed about to rise from his chair but changed his mind as if unwilling perhaps to look upon some unbecoming prank of the wild young prince which he might not have had heart to punish with necessary severity the earl of march seemed to have a pleasure in informing him of that of which doubtless he desired to remain ignorant  my liege he cried this is better and better the glee maiden has not only engaged the ear of the prince of scotland as well as of every groom and trooper in the courtyard but she has riveted the attention of the black douglas whom we have not known as a passionate admirer of the gay science but truly i do not wonder at his astonishment for the prince has honoured the fair professor of song and viol with a kiss of approbation  how cried the king is david of rothsay trifling with a glee maiden and his wifes father in presence go my good father abbot call the prince here instantly go my dearest brother and when they had both left the room the king continued go good cousin of march there will be mischief i am assured of it i pray you go cousin and second my lord priors prayers with my commands  you forget my liege said march with the voice of a deeply offended person the father of elizabeth of dunbar were but an unfit intercessor between the douglas and his royal son in law  i crave your pardon cousin said the gentle old man i own you have had some wrong but my rothsay will be murderedi must go myself  but as he arose precipitately from his chair the poor king missed a footstep stumbled and fell heavily to the ground in such a manner that his head striking the corner of the seat from which he had risen he became for a minute insensible the sight of the accident at once overcame marchs resentment and melted his heart he ran to the fallen monarch and replaced him in his seat using in the tenderest and most respectful manner such means as seemed most fit to recall animation  robert opened his eyes and gazed around with uncertainty what has happenedare we alonewho is with us  your dutiful subject march replied the earl  alone with the earl of march repeated the king his still disturbed intellect receiving some alarm from the name of a powerful chief whom he had reason to believe he had mortally offended  yes my gracious liege with poor george of dunbar of whom many have wished your majesty to think ill though he will be found truer to your royal person at the last than they will  indeed cousin you have had too much wrong and believe me we shall strive to redress  if your grace thinks so it may yet be righted interrupted the earl catching at the hopes which his ambition suggested the prince and marjory douglas are nearly relatedthe dispensation from rome was informally grantedtheir marriage cannot be lawfulthe pope who will do much for so godly a prince can set aside this unchristian union in respect of the precontract bethink you well my liege continued the earl kindling with a new train of ambitious thoughts to which the unexpected opportunity of pleading his cause personally had given risebethink you how you choose betwixt the douglas and me he is powerful and mighty i grant but george of dunbar wears the keys of scotland at his belt and could bring an english army to the gates of edinburgh ere douglas could leave the skirts of carintable to oppose them your royal son loves my poor deserted girl and hates the haughty marjory of douglas your grace may judge the small account in which he holds her by his toying with a common glee maiden even in the presence of her father  the king had hitherto listened to the earls argument with the bewildered feelings of a timid horseman borne away by an impetuous steed whose course he can neither arrest nor direct but the last words awakened in his recollection the sense of his sons immediate danger  oh ay most truemy sonthe douglas oh my dear cousin prevent blood and all shall be as you will hark there is a tumultthat was the clash of arms  by my coronet by my knightly faith it is true said the earl looking from the window upon the inner square of the convent now filled with armed men and brandished weapons and resounding with the clash of armour the deep vaulted entrance was crowded with warriors at its farthest extremity and blows seemed to be in the act of being exchanged betwixt some who were endeavouring to shut the gate and others who contended to press in  i will go instantly said the earl of march and soon quell this sudden broil humbly i pray your majesty to think on what i have had the boldness to propose  i willi will fair cousin said the king scarce knowing to what he pledged himself do but prevent tumult and bloodshed    chapter xi       fair is the damsel passing fair      sunny at distance gleams her smile      approachthe cloud of woful care      hangs trembling in her eye the while       lucinda a ballad   we must here trace a little more correctly the events which had been indistinctly seen from the window of the royal apartments and yet more indistinctly reported by those who witnessed them the glee maiden already mentioned had planted herself where a rise of two large broad steps giving access to the main gateway of the royal apartments gained her an advantage of a foot and a half in height over those in the court of whom she hoped to form an audience she wore the dress of her calling which was more gaudy than rich and showed the person more than did the garb of other females she had laid aside an upper mantle and a small basket which contained her slender stock of necessaries and a little french spaniel dog sat beside them as their protector an azure blue jacket embroidered with silver and sitting close to the person was open in front and showed several waistcoats of different coloured silks calculated to set off the symmetry of the shoulders and bosom and remaining open at the throat a small silver chain worn around her neck involved itself amongst these brilliant coloured waistcoats and was again produced from them to display a medal of the same metal which intimated in the name of some court or guild of minstrels the degree she had taken in the gay or joyous science a small scrip suspended over her shoulders by a blue silk riband hung on her left side  her sunny complexion snow white teeth brilliant black eyes and raven locks marked her country lying far in the south of france and the arch smile and dimpled chin bore the same character her luxuriant raven locks twisted around a small gold bodkin were kept in their position by a net of silk and gold short petticoats deep laced with silver to correspond with the jacket red stockings which were visible so high as near the calf of the leg and buskins of spanish leather completed her adjustment which though far from new had been saved as an untarnished holiday suit which much care had kept in good order she seemed about twentyfive years old but perhaps fatigue and wandering had anticipated the touch of time in obliterating the freshness of early youth  we have said the glee maidens manner was lively and we may add that her smile and repartee were ready but her gaiety was assumed as a quality essentially necessary to her trade of which it was one of the miseries that the professors were obliged frequently to cover an aching heart with a compelled smile this seemed to be the case with louise who whether she was actually the heroine of her own song or whatever other cause she might have for sadness showed at times a strain of deep melancholy thought which interfered with and controlled the natural flow of lively spirits which the practice of the joyous science especially required she lacked also even in her gayest sallies the decided boldness and effrontery of her sisterhood who were seldom at a loss to retort a saucy jest or turn the laugh against any who interrupted or interfered with them  it may be here remarked that it was impossible that this class of women very numerous in that age could bear a character generally respectable they were however protected by the manners of the time and such were the immunities they possessed by the rights of chivalry that nothing was more rare than to hear of such errant damsels sustaining injury or wrong and they passed and repassed safely where armed travellers would probably have encountered a bloody opposition but though licensed and protected in honour of their tuneful art the wandering minstrels male or female like similar ministers to the public amusement the itinerant musicians for instance and strolling comedians of our own day led a life too irregular and precarious to be accounted a creditable part of society indeed among the stricter catholics the profession was considered as unlawful  such was the damsel who with viol in hand and stationed on the slight elevation we have mentioned stepped forward to the bystanders and announced herself as a mistress of the gay science duly qualified by a brief from a court of love and music held at aix in provence under the countenance of the flower of chivalry the gallant count aymer who now prayed that the cavaliers of merry scotland who were known over the wide world for bravery and courtesy would permit a poor stranger to try whether she could afford them any amusement by her art the love of song was like the love of fight a common passion of the age which all at least affected whether they were actually possessed by it or no therefore the acquiescence in louises proposal was universal at the same time an aged dark browed monk who was among the bystanders thought it necessary to remind the glee maiden that since she was tolerated within these precincts which was an unusual grace he trusted nothing would be sung or said inconsistent with the holy character of the place  the glee maiden bent her head low shook her sable locks and crossed herself reverentially as if she disclaimed the possibility of such a transgression and then began the song of poor louise which we gave at length in the last chapter  just as she commenced she was stopped by a cry of roomroomplace for the duke of rothsay  nay hurry no man on my score said a gallant young cavalier who entered on a noble arabian horse which he managed with exquisite grace though by such slight handling of the reins such imperceptible pressure of the limbs and sway of the body that to any eye save that of an experienced horseman the animal seemed to be putting forth his paces for his own amusement and thus gracefully bearing forward a rider who was too indolent to give himself any trouble about the matter  the princes apparel which was very rich was put on with slovenly carelessness his form though his stature was low and his limbs extremely slight was elegant in the extreme and his features no less handsome but there was on his brow a haggard paleness which seemed the effect of care or of dissipation or of both these wasting causes combined his eyes were sunk and dim as from late indulgence in revelry on the preceding evening while his cheek was inflamed with unnatural red as if either the effect of the bacchanalian orgies had not passed away from the constitution or a morning draught had been resorted to in order to remove the effects of the nights debauchery  such was the duke of rothsay and heir of the scottish crown a sight at once of interest and compassion all unbonneted and made way for him while he kept repeating carelessly no hasteno haste i shall arrive soon enough at the place i am bound for hows thisa damsel of the joyous science ay by st giles and a comely wench to boot stand still my merry men never was minstrelsy marred for me a good voice by the mass begin me that lay again sweetheart  louise did not know the person who addressed her but the general respect paid by all around and the easy and indifferent manner in which it was received showed her she was addressed by a man of the highest quality she recommenced her lay and sung her best accordingly while the young duke seemed thoughtful and rather affected towards the close of the ditty but it was not his habit to cherish such melancholy affections  this is a plaintive ditty my nut brown maid said he chucking the retreating glee maiden under the chin and detaining her by the collar of her dress which was not difficult as he sat on horseback so close to the steps on which she stood but i warrant me you have livelier notes at will ma bella tenebrosa ay and canst sing in bower as well as wold and by night as well as day  i am no nightingale my lord said louise endeavouring to escape a species of gallantry which ill suited the place and circumstancesa discrepancy to which he who addressed it to her seemed contemptuously indifferent  what hast thou there darling he added removing his hold from her collar to the scrip which she carried  glad was louise to escape his grasp by slipping the knot of the riband and leaving the little bag in the princes hand as retiring back beyond his reach she answered nuts my lord of the last season  the prince pulled out a handful of nuts accordingly nuts child they will break thine ivory teeth hurt thy pretty voice said rothsay cracking one with his teeth like a village schoolboy  they are not the walnuts of my own sunny clime my lord said louise but they hang low and are within the reach of the poor  you shall have something to afford you better fare poor wandering ape said the duke in a tone in which feeling predominated more than in the affected and contemptuous gallantry of his first address to the glee maiden  at this moment as he turned to ask an attendant for his purse the prince encountered the stern and piercing look of a tall black man seated on a powerful iron grey horse who had entered the court with attendants while the duke of rothsay was engaged with louise and now remained stupefied and almost turned to stone by his surprise and anger at this unseemly spectacle even one who had never seen archibald earl of douglas called the grim must have known him by his swart complexion his gigantic frame his buff coat of bulls hide and his air of courage firmness and sagacity mixed with indomitable pride the loss of an eye in battle though not perceptible at first sight as the ball of the injured organ remained similar to the other gave yet a stern immovable glare to the whole aspect  the meeting of the royal son in law with his terrible stepfather father in law was in circumstances which arrested the attention of all present and the bystanders waited the issue with silence and suppressed breath lest they should lose any part of what was to ensue  when the duke of rothsay saw the expression which occupied the stern features of douglas and remarked that the earl did not make the least motion towards respectful or even civil salutation he seemed determined to show him how little respect he was disposed to pay to his displeased looks he took his purse from his chamberlain  here pretty one he said i give thee one gold piece for the song thou hast sung me another for the nuts i have stolen from thee and a third for the kiss thou art about to give me for know my pretty one that when fair lips and thine for fault of better may be called so make sweet music for my pleasure i am sworn to st valentine to press them to mine  my song is recompensed nobly said louise shrinking back my nuts are sold to a good market farther traffic my lord were neither befitting you nor beseeming me  what you coy it my nymph of the highway said the prince contemptuously know damsel that one asks you a grace who is unused to denial  it is the prince of scotlandthe duke of rothsay said the courtiers around to the terrified louise pressing forward the trembling young woman you must not thwart his humor  but i cannot reach your lordship she said timidly you sit so high on horseback  if i must alight said rothsay there shall be the heavier penalty what does the wench tremble for place thy foot on the toe of my boot give me hold of thy hand gallantly done he kissed her as she stood thus suspended in the air perched upon his foot and supported by his hand saying there is thy kiss and there is my purse to pay it and to grace thee farther rothsay will wear thy scrip for the day  he suffered the frightened girl to spring to the ground and turned his looks from her to bend them contemptuously on the earl of douglas as if he had said all this i do in despite of you and of your daughters claims  by st bride of douglas said the earl pressing towards the prince this is too much unmannered boy as void of sense as honour you know what considerations restrain the hand of douglas else had you never dared  can you play at spang cockle my lord said the prince placing a nut on the second joint of his forefinger and spinning it off by a smart application of the thumb the nut struck on douglass broad breast who burst out into a dreadful exclamation of wrath inarticulate but resembling the growl of a lion in depth and sternness of expression  i cry your pardon most mighty lord said the duke of rothsay scornfully while all around trembled i did not conceive my pellet could have wounded you seeing you wear a buff coat surely i trust it did not hit your eye  the prior despatched by the king as we have seen in the last chapter had by this time made way through the crowd and laying hold on douglass rein in a manner that made it impossible for him to advance reminded him that the prince was the son of his sovereign and the husband of his daughter  fear not sir prior said douglas i despise the childish boy too much to raise a finger against him but i will return insult for insult here any of you who love the douglas spurn me this quean from the monastery gates and let her be so scourged that she may bitterly remember to the last day of her life how she gave means to an unrespective boy to affront the douglas  four or five retainers instantly stepped forth to execute commands which were seldom uttered in vain and heavily would louise have atoned for an offence of which she was alike the innocent unconscious and unwilling instrument had not the duke of rothsay interfered  spurn the poor glee woman he said in high indignation scourge her for obeying my commands spurn thine own oppressed vassals rude earlscourge thine own faulty hounds but beware how you touch so much as a dog that rothsay hath patted on the head far less a female whose lips he hath kissed  before douglas could give an answer which would certainly have been in defiance there arose that great tumult at the outward gate of the monastery already noticed and men both on horseback and on foot began to rush headlong in not actually fighting with each other but certainly in no peaceable manner  one of the contending parties seemingly were partizans of douglas known by the cognizance of the bloody heart the other were composed of citizens of the town of perth it appeared they had been skirmishing in earnest when without the gates but out of respect to the sanctified ground they lowered their weapons when they entered and confined their strife to a war of words and mutual abuse  the tumult had this good effect that it forced asunder by the weight and press of numbers the prince and douglas at a moment when the levity of the former and the pride of the latter were urging both to the utmost extremity but now peacemakers interfered on all sides the prior and the monks threw themselves among the multitude and commanded peace in the name of heaven and reverence to their sacred walls under penalty of excommunication and their expostulations began to be listened to albany who was despatched by his royal brother at the beginning of the fray had not arrived till now on the scene of action he instantly applied himself to douglas and in his ear conjured him to temper his passion  by st bride of douglas i will be avenged said the earl no man shall brook life after he has passed an affront on douglas  why so you may be avenged in fitting time said albany but let it not be said that like a peevish woman the great douglas could choose neither time nor place for his vengeance bethink you all that we have laboured at is like to be upset by an accident george of dunbar hath had the advantage of an audience with the old man and though it lasted but five minutes i fear it may endanger the dissolution of your family match which we brought about with so much difficulty the authority from rome has not yet been obtained  a toy answered douglas haughtily they dare not dissolve it  not while douglas is at large and in possession of his power answered albany but noble earl come with me and i will show you at what disadvantage you stand  douglas dismounted and followed his wily accomplice in silence in a lower hall they saw the ranks of the brandanes drawn up well armed in caps of steel and shirts of mail their captain making an obeisance to albany seemed to desire to address him  what now maclouis said the duke  we are informed the duke of rothsay has been insulted and i can scarce keep the brandanes within door  gallant maclouis said albany and you my trusty brandanes the duke of rothsay my princely nephew is as well as a hopeful gentleman can be some scuffle there has been but all is appeased  he continued to draw the earl of douglas forward you see my lord he said in his ear that if the word arrest was to be once spoken it would be soon obeyed and you are aware your attendants are few for resistance  douglas seemed to acquiesce in the necessity of patience for the time if my teeth he said should bite through my lips i will be silent till it is the hour to speak out  george of march in the meanwhile had a more easy task of pacifying the prince my lord of rothsay he said approaching him with grave ceremony i need not tell you that you owe me something for reparation of honour though i blame not you personally for the breach of contract which has destroyed the peace of my family let me conjure you by what observance your highness may owe an injured man to forego for the present this scandalous dispute  my lord i owe you much replied rothsay but this haughty and all controlling lord has wounded mine honour  my lord i can but add your royal father is illhath swooned with terror for your highnesss safety  ill replied the princethe kind good old man swooned said you my lord of march i am with him in an instant  the duke of rothsay sprung from his saddle to the ground and was dashing into the palace like a greyhound when a feeble grasp was laid on his cloak and the faint voice of a kneeling female exclaimed protection my noble princeprotection for a helpless stranger  hands off stroller said the earl of march thrusting the suppliant glee maiden aside  but the gentler prince paused it is true he said i have brought the vengeance of an unforgiving devil upon this helpless creature o heaven what a life is mine so fatal to all who approach me what to do in the hurry she must not go to my apartments and all my men are such born reprobates ha thou at mine elbow honest harry smith what dost thou here  there has been something of a fight my lord answered our acquaintance the smith between the townsmen and the southland loons who ride with the douglas and we have swinged them as far as the abbey gate  i am glad of iti am glad of it and you beat the knaves fairly  fairly does your highness ask said henry why ay we were stronger in numbers to be sure but no men ride better armed than those who follow the bloody heart and so in a sense we beat them fairly for as your highness knows it is the smith who makes the man at arms and men with good weapons are a match for great odds  while they thus talked the earl of march who had spoken with some one near the palace gate returned in anxious haste my lord dukemy lord duke your father is recovered and if you haste not speedily my lord of albany and the douglas will have possession of his royal ear  and if my royal father is recovered said the thoughtless prince and is holding or about to hold counsel with my gracious uncle and the earl of douglas it befits neither your lordship nor me to intrude till we are summoned so there is time for me to speak of my little business with mine honest armourer here  does your highness take it so said the earl whose sanguine hopes of a change of favour at court had been too hastily excited and were as speedily checked then so let it be for george of dunbar  he glided away with a gloomy and displeased aspect and thus out of the two most powerful noblemen in scotland at a time when the aristocracy so closely controlled the throne the reckless heir apparent had made two enemiesthe one by scornful defiance and the other by careless neglect he heeded not the earl of marchs departure however or rather he felt relieved from his importunity  the prince went on in indolent conversation with our armourer whose skill in his art had made him personally known to many of the great lords about the court  i had something to say to thee smith canst thou take up a fallen link in my milan hauberk  as well please your highness as my mother could take up a stitch in the nets she wove the milaner shall not know my work from his own  well but that was not what i wished of thee just now said the prince recollecting himself this poor glee woman good smith she must be placed in safety thou art man enough to be any womans champion and thou must conduct her to some place of safety  henry smith was as we have seen sufficiently rash and daring when weapons were in question but he had also the pride of a decent burgher and was unwilling to place himself in what might be thought equivocal circumstances by the sober part of his fellow citizens  may it please your highness he said i am but a poor craftsman but though my arm and sword are at the kings service and your highnesss i am with reverence no squire of dames your highness will find among your own retinue knights and lords willing enough to play sir pandarus of troy it is too knightly a part for poor hal of the wynd  umphhah said the prince my purse edgar his attendant whispered him truetrue i gave it to the poor wench i know enough of your craft sir smith and of craftsmen in general to be aware that men lure not hawks with empty hands but i suppose my word may pass for the price of a good armour and i will pay it thee with thanks to boot for this slight service  your highness may know other craftsmen said the smith but with reverence you know not henry gow he will obey you in making a weapon or in wielding one but he knows nothing of this petticoat service  hark thee thou perthshire mule said the prince yet smiling while he spoke at the sturdy punctilio of the honest burgher the wench is as little to me as she is to thee but in an idle moment as you may learn from those about thee if thou sawest it not thyself i did her a passing grace which is likely to cost the poor wretch her life there is no one here whom i can trust to protect her against the discipline of belt and bowstring with which the border brutes who follow douglas will beat her to death since such is his pleasure  if such be the case my liege she has a right to every honest mans protection and since she wears a petticoatthough i would it were longer and of a less fanciful fashioni will answer for her protection as well as a single man may but where am i to bestow her  good faith i cannot tell said the prince take her to sir john ramornys lodging but nonohe is ill at ease and besides there are reasons take her to the devil if thou wilt but place her in safety and oblige david of rothsay  my noble prince said the smith i think always with reverence that i would rather give a defenceless woman to the care of the devil than of sir john ramorny but though the devil be a worker in fire like myself yet i know not his haunts and with aid of holy church hope to keep him on terms of defiance and moreover how i am to convey her out of this crowd or through the streets in such a mumming habit may be well made a question  for the leaving the convent said the prince this good monk seizing upon the nearest by his cowlfather nicholas or boniface  poor brother cyprian at your highnesss command said the father  ayay brother cyprian continued the princeyes brother cyprian shall let you out at some secret passage which he knows of and i will see him again to pay a princes thanks for it  the churchman bowed in acquiescence and poor louise who during this debate had looked from the one speaker to the other hastily said i will not scandalise this good man with my foolish garb i have a mantle for ordinary wear  why there smith thou hast a friars hood and a womans mantle to shroud thee under i would all my frailties were as well shrouded farewell honest fellow i will thank thee hereafter  then as if afraid of farther objection on the smiths part he hastened into the palace  henry gow remained stupefied at what had passed and at finding himself involved in a charge at once inferring much danger and an equal risk of scandal both which joined to a principal share which he had taken with his usual forwardness in the fray might he saw do him no small injury in the suit he pursued most anxiously at the same time to leave a defenceless creature to the ill usage of the barbarous galwegians and licentious followers of the douglas was a thought which his manly heart could not brook for an instant  he was roused from his reverie by the voice of the monk who sliding out his words with the indifference which the holy fathers entertained or affected towards all temporal matters desired them to follow him the smith put himself in motion with a sigh much resembling a groan and without appearing exactly connected with the monks motions he followed him into a cloister and through a postern door which after looking once behind him the priest left ajar behind them followed louise who had hastily assumed her small bundle and calling her little four legged companion had eagerly followed in the path which opened an escape from what had shortly before seemed a great and inevitable danger    chapter xii       then up and spak the auld gudewife      and wow but she was grim      had eer your father done the like      it had been ill for him       lucky trumbull   the party were now by a secret passage admitted within the church the outward doors of which usually left open had been closed against every one in consequence of the recent tumult when the rioters of both parties had endeavoured to rush into it for other purposes than those of devotion they traversed the gloomy aisles whose arched roof resounded to the heavy tread of the armourer but was silent under the sandalled foot of the monk and the light step of poor louise who trembled excessively as much from fear as cold she saw that neither her spiritual nor temporal conductor looked kindly upon her the former was an austere man whose aspect seemed to hold the luckless wanderer in some degree of horror as well as contempt while the latter though as we have seen one of the best natured men living was at present grave to the pitch of sternness and not a little displeased with having the part he was playing forced upon him without as he was constrained to feel a possibility of his declining it  his dislike at his task extended itself to the innocent object of his protection and he internally said to himself as he surveyed her scornfully a proper queen of beggars to walk the streets of perth with and i a decent burgher this tawdry minion must have as ragged a reputation as the rest of her sisterhood and i am finely sped if my chivalry in her behalf comes to catharines ears i had better have slain a man were he the best in perth and by hammer and nails i would have done it on provocation rather than convoy this baggage through the city  perhaps louise suspected the cause of her conductors anxiety for she said timidly and with hesitation worthy sir were it not better i should stop one instant in that chapel and don my mantle  umph sweetheart well proposed said the armourer but the monk interfered raising at the same time the finger of interdiction  the chapel of holy st madox is no tiring room for jugglers and strollers to shift their trappings in i will presently show thee a vestiary more suited to thy condition  the poor young woman hung down her humbled head and turned from the chapel door which she had approached with the deep sense of self abasement her little spaniel seemed to gather from his mistresss looks and manner that they were unauthorised intruders on the holy ground which they trode and hung his ears and swept the pavement with his tail as he trotted slowly and close to louises heels  the monk moved on without a pause they descended a broad flight of steps and proceeded through a labyrinth of subterranean passages dimly lighted as they passed a low arched door the monk turned and said to louise with the same stern voice as before there daughter of follythere is a robing room where many before you have deposited their vestments  obeying the least signal with ready and timorous acquiescence she pushed the door open but instantly recoiled with terror it was a charnel house half filled with dry skulls and bones  i fear to change my dress there and alone but if you father command it be it as you will  why thou child of vanity the remains on which thou lookest are but the earthly attire of those who in their day led or followed in the pursuit of worldly pleasure and such shalt thou be for all thy mincing and ambling thy piping and thy harpingthou and all such ministers of frivolous and worldly pleasure must become like these poor bones whom thy idle nicety fears and loathes to look upon  say not with idle nicety reverend father answered the glee maiden for heaven knows i covet the repose of these poor bleached relics and if by stretching my body upon them i could without sin bring my state to theirs i would choose that charnel heap for my place of rest beyond the fairest and softest couch in scotland  be patient and come on said the monk in a milder tone the reaper must not leave the harvest work till sunset gives the signal that the days toil is over  they walked forward brother cyprian at the end of a long gallery opened the door of a small apartment or perhaps a chapel for it was decorated with a crucifix before which burned four lamps all bent and crossed themselves and the priest said to the minstrel maiden pointing to the crucifix what says that emblem  that he invites the sinner as well as the righteous to approach  ay if the sinner put from him his sin said the monk whose tone of voice was evidently milder prepare thyself here for thy journey  louise remained an instant or two in the chapel and presently reappeared in a mantle of coarse grey cloth in which she had closely muffled herself having put such of her more gaudy habiliments as she had time to take off in the little basket which had before held her ordinary attire  the monk presently afterwards unlocked a door which led to the open air they found themselves in the garden which surrounded the monastery of the dominicans  the southern gate is on the latch and through it you can pass unnoticed said the monk bless thee my son and bless thee too unhappy child remembering where you put off your idle trinkets may you take care how you again resume them  alas father said louise if the poor foreigner could supply the mere wants of life by any more creditable occupation she has small wish to profess her idle art but  but the monk had vanished nay the very door though which she had just passed appeared to have vanished also so curiously was it concealed beneath a flying buttress and among the profuse ornaments of gothic architecture  here is a woman let out by this private postern sure enough was henrys reflection pray heaven the good fathers never let any in the place seems convenient for such games at bo peep but benedicite what is to be done next i must get rid of this quean as fast as i can and i must see her safe for let her be at heart what she may she looks too modest now she is in decent dress to deserve the usage which the wild scot of galloway or the devils legion from the liddel are like to afford her  louise stood as if she waited his pleasure which way to go her little dog relieved by the exchange of the dark subterranean vault for the open air sprung in wild gambols through the walks and jumped upon its mistress and even though more timidly circled close round the smiths feet to express its satisfaction to him also and conciliate his favour  down charlotdown said the glee maiden you are glad to get into the blessed sunshine but where shall we rest at night my poor charlot  and now mistress said the smith not churlishly for it was not in his nature but bluntly as one who is desirous to finish a disagreeable employment which way lies your road  louise looked on the ground and was silent on being again urged to say which way she desired to be conducted she again looked down and said she could not tell  comecome said henry i understand all that i have been a galliarda reveller in my day but its best to be plain as matters are with me now i am an altered man for these many many months and so my quean you and i must part sooner than perhaps a light o love such as you expected to part witha likely young fellow  louise wept silently with her eyes still cast on the ground as one who felt an insult which she had not a right to complain of at length perceiving that her conductor was grown impatient she faltered out noble sir  sir is for a knight said the impatient burgher and noble is for a baron i am harry of the wynd an honest mechanic and free of my guild  good craftsman then said the minstrel woman you judge me harshly but not without seeming cause i would relieve you immediately of my company which it may be brings little credit to good men did i but know which way to go  to the next wake or fair to be sure said henry roughly having no doubt that this distress was affected for the purpose of palming herself upon him and perhaps dreading to throw himself into the way of temptation and that is the feast of st madox at auchterarder i warrant thou wilt find the way thither well enough  aftrauchter repeated the glee maiden her southern tongue in vain attempting the celtic accentuation i am told my poor plays will not be understood if i go nearer to yon dreadful range of mountains  will you abide then in perth  but where to lodge said the wanderer  why where lodged you last night replied the smith you know where you came from surely though you seem doubtful where you are going  i slept in the hospital of the convent but i was only admitted upon great importunity and i was commanded not to return  nay they will never take you in with the ban of the douglas upon you that is even too true but the prince mentioned sir john ramornys i can take you to his lodgings through bye streets though it is short of an honest burghers office and my time presses  i will go anywhere i know i am a scandal and incumbrance there was a time when it was otherwise but this ramorny who is he  a courtly knight who lives a jolly bachelors life and is master of the horse and privado as they say to the young prince  what to the wild scornful young man who gave occasion to yonder scandal oh take me not thither good friend is there no christian woman who would give a poor creature rest in her cowhouse or barn for one night i will be gone with early daybreak i will repay her richly i have gold and i will repay you too if you will take me where i may be safe from that wild reveller and from the followers of that dark baron in whose eye was death  keep your gold for those who lack it mistress said henry and do not offer to honest hands the money that is won by violing and tabouring and toe tripping and perhaps worse pastimes i tell you plainly mistress i am not to be fooled i am ready to take you to any place of safety you can name for my promise is as strong as an iron shackle but you cannot persuade me that you do not know what earth to make for you are not so young in your trade as not to know there are hostelries in every town much more in a city like perth where such as you may be harboured for your money if you cannot find some gulls more or fewer to pay your lawing if you have money mistress my care about you need be the less and truly i see little but pretence in all that excessive grief and fear of being left alone in one of your occupation  having thus as he conceived signified that he was not to be deceived by the ordinary arts of a glee maiden henry walked a few paces sturdily endeavouring to think he was doing the wisest and most prudent thing in the world yet he could not help looking back to see how louise bore his departure and was shocked to observe that she had sunk upon a bank with her arms resting on her knees and her head on her arms in a situation expressive of the utmost desolation  the smith tried to harden his heart it is all a sham he said the gouge knows her trade ill be sworn by st ringan  at the instant something pulled the skirts of his cloak and looking round he saw the little spaniel who immediately as if to plead his mistresss cause got on his hind legs and began to dance whimpering at the same time and looking back to louise as if to solicit compassion for his forsaken owner  poor thing said the smith there may be a trick in this too for thou dost but as thou art taught yet as i promised to protect this poor creature i must not leave her in a swoon if it be one were it but for manhoods sake  returning and approaching his troublesome charge he was at once assured from the change of her complexion either that she was actually in the deepest distress or had a power of dissimulation beyond the comprehension of manor woman either  young woman he said with more of kindness than he had hitherto been able even to assume i will tell you frankly how i am placed this is st valentines day and by custom i was to spend it with my fair valentine but blows and quarrels have occupied all the morning save one poor half hour now you may well understand where my heart and my thoughts are and where were it only in mere courtesy my body ought to be  the glee maiden listened and appeared to comprehend him  if you are a true lover and have to wait upon a chaste valentine god forbid that one like me should make a disturbance between you think about me no more i will ask of that great river to be my guide to where it meets the ocean where i think they said there was a seaport i will sail from thence to la belle france and will find myself once more in a country in which the roughest peasant would not wrong the poorest female  you cannot go to dundee today said the smith the douglas people are in motion on both sides of the river for the alarm of the morning has reached them ere now and all this day and the next and the whole night which is between they will gather to their leaders standard like highlandmen at the fiery cross do you see yonder five or six men who are riding so wildly on the other side of the river these are annandale men i know them by the length of their lances and by the way they hold them an annandale man never slopes his spear backwards but always keeps the point upright or pointed forward  and what of them said the glee maiden they are men at arms and soldiers they would respect me for my viol and my helplessness  i will say them no scandal answered the smith if you were in their own glens they would use you hospitably and you would have nothing to fear but they are now on an expedition all is fish that comes to their net there are amongst them who would take your life for the value of your gold earrings their whole soul is settled in their eyes to see prey and in their hands to grasp it they have no ears either to hear lays of music or listen to prayers for mercy besides their leaders order is gone forth concerning you and it is of a kind sure to be obeyed ay great lords are sooner listened to if they say burn a church than if they say build one  then said the glee woman i were best sit down and die  do not say so replied the smith if i could but get you a lodging for the night i would carry you the next morning to our ladys stairs from whence the vessels go down the river for dundee and would put you on board with some one bound that way who should see you safely lodged where you would have fair entertainment and kind usage  goodexcellentgenerous man said the glee maiden do this and if the prayers and blessings of a poor unfortunate should ever reach heaven they will rise thither in thy behalf we will meet at yonder postern door at whatever time the boats take their departure  that is at six in the morning when the day is but young  away with you then to your valentine and if she loves you oh deceive her not  alas poor damsel i fear it is deceit hath brought thee to this pass but i must not leave you thus unprovided i must know where you are to pass the night  care not for that replied louise the heavens are clearthere are bushes and boskets enough by the river sidecharlot and i can well make a sleeping room of a green arbour for one night and tomorrow will with your promised aid see me out of reach of injury and wrong oh the night soon passes away when there is hope for tomorrow do you still linger with your valentine waiting for you nay i shall hold you but a loitering lover and you know what belongs to a minstrels reproaches  i cannot leave you damsel answered the armourer now completely melted it were mere murder to suffer you to pass the night exposed to the keenness of a scottish blast in february nono my word would be ill kept in this manner and if i should incur some risk of blame it is but just penance for thinking of thee and using thee more according to my own prejudices as i now well believe than thy merits come with me damsel thou shalt have a sure and honest lodging for the night whatsoever may be the consequence it would be an evil compliment to my catharine were i to leave a poor creature to be starved to death that i might enjoy her company an hour sooner  so saying and hardening himself against all anticipations of the ill consequences or scandal which might arise from such a measure the manly hearted smith resolved to set evil report at defiance and give the wanderer a nights refuge in his own house it must be added that he did this with extreme reluctance and in a sort of enthusiasm of benevolence  ere our stout son of vulcan had fixed his worship on the fair maid of perth a certain natural wildness of disposition had placed him under the influence of venus as well as that of mars and it was only the effect of a sincere attachment which had withdrawn him entirely from such licentious pleasures he was therefore justly jealous of his newly acquired reputation for constancy which his conduct to this poor wanderer must expose to suspicion a little doubtful perhaps of exposing himself too venturously to temptation and moreover in despair to lose so much of st valentines day which custom not only permitted but enjoined him to pass beside his mate for the season the journey to kinfauns and the various transactions which followed had consumed the day and it was now nearly evensong time  as if to make up by a speedy pace for the time he was compelled to waste upon a subject so foreign to that which he had most at heart he strode on through the dominicans gardens entered the town and casting his cloak around the lower part of his face and pulling down his bonnet to conceal the upper he continued the same celerity of movement through bye streets and lanes hoping to reach his own house in the wynd without being observed but when he had continued his rate of walking for ten minutes he began to be sensible it might be too rapid for the young woman to keep up with him he accordingly looked behind him with a degree of angry impatience which soon turned into compunction when he saw that she was almost utterly exhausted by the speed which she had exerted  now marry hang me up for a brute said henry to himself was my own haste ever so great could it give that poor creature wings and she loaded with baggage too i am an ill nurtured beast that is certain wherever women are in question and always sure to do wrong when i have the best will to act right  hark thee damsel let me carry these things for thee we shall make better speed that i do so  poor louise would have objected but her breath was too much exhausted to express herself and she permitted her good natured guardian to take her little basket which when the dog beheld he came straight before henry stood up and shook his fore paws whining gently as if he too wanted to be carried  nay then i must needs lend thee a lift too said the smith who saw the creature was tired  fie charlot said louise thou knowest i will carry thee myself  she endeavoured to take up the little spaniel but it escaped from her and going to the other side of the smith renewed its supplication that he would take it up  charlots right said the smith he knows best who is ablest to bear him this lets me know my pretty one that you have not been always the bearer of your own mail charlot can tell tales  so deadly a hue came across the poor glee maidens countenance as henry spoke that he was obliged to support her lest she should have dropped to the ground she recovered again however in an instant or two and with a feeble voice requested her guide would go on  naynay said henry as they began to move keep hold of my cloak or my arm if it helps you forward better a fair sight we are and had i but a rebeck or a guitar at my back and a jackanapes on my shoulder we should seem as joyous a brace of strollers as ever touched string at a castle gate  snails he ejaculated internally were any neighbour to meet me with this little harlotrys basket at my back her dog under my arm and herself hanging on my cloak what could they think but that i had turned mumper in good earnest i would not for the best harness i ever laid hammer on that any of our long tongued neighbours met me in this guise it were a jest would last from st valentines day to next candlemas  stirred by these thoughts the smith although at the risk of making much longer a route which he wished to traverse as swiftly as possible took the most indirect and private course which he could find in order to avoid the main streets still crowded with people owing to the late scene of tumult and agitation but unhappily his policy availed him nothing for in turning into an alley he met a man with his cloak muffled around his face from a desire like his own to pass unobserved though the slight insignificant figure the spindle shanks which showed themselves beneath the mantle and the small dull eye that blinked over its upper folds announced the pottingar as distinctly as if he had carried his sign in front of his bonnet his unexpected and most unwelcome presence overwhelmed the smith with confusion ready evasion was not the property of his bold blunt temper and knowing this man to be a curious observer a malignant tale bearer and by no means well disposed to himself in particular no better hope occurred to him than that the worshipful apothecary would give him some pretext to silence his testimony and secure his discretion by twisting his neck round  but far from doing or saying anything which could warrant such extremities the pottingar seeing himself so close upon his stalwart townsman that recognition was inevitable seemed determined it should be as slight as possible and without appearing to notice anything particular in the company or circumstances in which they met he barely slid out these words as he passed him without even a glance towards his companion after the first instant of their meeting a merry holiday to you once more stout smith what thou art bringing thy cousin pretty mistress joan letham with her mail from the watersidefresh from dundee i warrant i heard she was expected at the old cordwainers  as he spoke thus he looked neither right nor left and exchanging a save you with a salute of the same kind which the smith rather muttered than uttered distinctly he glided forward on his way like a shadow  the foul fiend catch me if i can swallow that pill said henry smith how well soever it may be gilded the knave has a shrewd eye for a kirtle and knows a wild duck from a tame as well as eer a man in perth he were the last in the fair city to take sour plums for pears or my roundabout cousin joan for this piece of fantastic vanity i fancy his bearing was as much as to say i will not see what you might wish me blind to and he is right to do so as he might easily purchase himself a broken pate by meddling with my matters and so he will be silent for his own sake but whom have we next by st dunstan the chattering bragging cowardly knave oliver proudfute  it was indeed the bold bonnet maker whom they next encountered who with his cap on one side and trolling the ditty of       thou art over long at the pot tom tom gave plain intimation that he had made no dry meal  ha my jolly smith he said have i caught thee in the manner what can the true steel bend can vulcan as the minstrel says pay venus back in her own coin faith thou wilt be a gay valentine before the years out that begins with the holiday so jollily  hark ye oliver said the displeased smith shut your eyes and pass on crony and hark ye again stir not your tongue about what concerns you not as you value having an entire tooth in your head  i betray counsel i bear tales and that against my brother martialist i would not tell it even to my timber soldan why i can be a wild galliard in a corner as well as thou man and now i think ont i will go with thee somewhere and we will have a rouse together and thy dalilah shall give us a song ha said i not well  excellently said henry longing the whole time to knock his brother martialist down but wisely taking a more peaceful way to rid himself of the incumbrance of his presenceexcellently well i may want thy help too for here are five or six of the douglasses before us they will not fail to try to take the wench from a poor burgher like myself so i will be glad of the assistance of a tearer such as thou art  i thank yei thank ye answered the bonnet maker but were i not better run and cause ring the common bell and get my great sword  ay ay run home as fast as you can and say nothing of what you have seen  who i nay fear me not pah i scorn a tale bearer  away with you then i hear the clash of armour  this put life and mettle into the heels of the bonnet maker who turning his back on the supposed danger set off at a pace which the smith never doubted would speedily bring him to his own house  here is another chattering jay to deal with thought the smith but i have a hank over him too the minstrels have a fabliau of a daw with borrowed featherswhy this oliver is the very bird and by st dunstan if he lets his chattering tongue run on at my expense i will so pluck him as never hawk plumed a partridge and this he knows  as these reflections thronged on his mind he had nearly reached the end of his journey and with the glee maiden still hanging on his cloak exhausted partly with fear partly with fatigue he at length arrived at the middle of the wynd which was honoured with his own habitation and from which in the uncertainty that then attended the application of surnames he derived one of his own appellatives here on ordinary days his furnace was seen to blaze and four half stripped knaves stunned the neighbourhood with the clang of hammer and stithy but st valentines holiday was an excuse for these men of steel having shut the shop and for the present being absent on their own errands of devotion or pleasure the house which adjoined to the smithy called henry its owner and though it was small and situated in a narrow street yet as there was a large garden with fruit trees behind it it constituted upon the whole a pleasant dwelling the smith instead of knocking or calling which would have drawn neighbours to doors and windows drew out a pass key of his own fabrication then a great and envied curiosity and opening the door of his house introduced his companion into his habitation  the apartment which received henry and the glee maiden was the kitchen which served amongst those of the smiths station for the family sitting room although one or two individuals like simon glover had an eating room apart from that in which their victuals were prepared in the corner of this apartment which was arranged with an unusual attention to cleanliness sat an old woman whose neatness of attire and the precision with which her scarlet plaid was drawn over her head so as to descend to her shoulders on each side might have indicated a higher rank than that of luckie shoolbred the smiths housekeeper yet such and no other was her designation and not having attended mass in the morning she was quietly reposing herself by the side of the fire her beads half told hanging over her left arm her prayers half said loitering upon her tongue her eyes half closed resigning themselves to slumber while she expected the return of her foster son without being able to guess at what hour it was likely to happen she started up at the sound of his entrance and bent her eye upon his companion at first with a look of the utmost surprise which gradually was exchanged for one expressive of great displeasure  now the saints bless mine eyesight henry smith she exclaimed very devoutly  amen with all my heart get some food ready presently good nurse for i fear me this traveller hath dined but lightly  and again i pray that our lady would preserve my eyesight from the wicked delusions of satan  so be it i tell you good woman but what is the use of all this pattering and prayering do you not hear me or will you not do as i bid you  it must be himself then whatever is of it but oh it is more like the foul fiend in his likeness to have such a baggage hanging upon his cloak oh harry smith men called you a wild lad for less things but who would ever have thought that harry would have brought a light leman under the roof that sheltered his worthy mother and where his own nurse has dwelt for thirty years  hold your peace old woman and be reasonable said the smith this glee woman is no leman of mine nor of any other person that i know of but she is going off for dundee tomorrow by the boats and we must give her quarters till then  quarters said the old woman you may give quarters to such cattle if you like it yourself harry wynd but the same house shall not quarter that trumpery quean and me and of that you may assure yourself  your mother is angry with me said louise misconstruing the connexion of the parties i will not remain to give her any offence if there is a stable or a cowhouse an empty stall will be bed enough for charlot and me  ayay i am thinking it is the quarters you are best used to said dame shoolbred  harkye nurse shoolbred said the smith you know i love you for your own sake and for my mothers but by st dunstan who was a saint of my own craft i will have the command of my own house and if you leave me without any better reason but your own nonsensical suspicions you must think how you will have the door open to you when you return for you shall have no help of mine i promise you  aweel my bairn and that will never make me risk the honest name i have kept for sixty years it was never your mothers custom and it shall never be mine to take up with ranters and jugglers and singing women and i am not so far to seek for a dwelling that the same roof should cover me and a tramping princess like that  with this the refractory gouvernante began in great hurry to adjust her tartan mantle for going abroad by pulling it so forwards as to conceal the white linen cap the edges of which bordered her shrivelled but still fresh and healthful countenance this done she seized upon a staff the trusty companion of her journeys and was fairly trudging towards the door when the smith stepped between her and the passage  wait at least old woman till we have cleared scores i owe you for fee and bountith  an thats een a dream of your own fools head what fee or bountith am i to take from the son of your mother that fed clad and bielded me as if i had been a sister  and well you repay it nurse leaving her only child at his utmost need  this seemed to strike the obstinate old woman with compunction she stopped and looked at her master and the minstrel alternately then shook her head and seemed about to resume her motion towards the door  i only receive this poor wanderer under my roof urged the smith to save her from the prison and the scourge  and why should you save her said the inexorable dame shoolbred i dare say she has deserved them both as well as ever thief deserved a hempen collar  for aught i know she may or she may not but she cannot deserve to be scourged to death or imprisoned till she is starved to death and that is the lot of them that the black douglas bears maltalent against  and you are going to thraw the black douglas for the cake of a glee woman this will be the worst of your feuds yet oh henry gow there is as much iron in your head as in your anvil  i have sometimes thought this myself mistress shoolbred but if i do get a cut or two on this new argument i wonder who is to cure them if you run away from me like a scared wild goose ay and moreover who is to receive my bonny bride that i hope to bring up the wynd one of these days  ah harryharry said the old woman shaking her head this is not the way to prepare an honest mans house for a young bride you should be guided by modesty and discretion and not by chambering and wantonness  i tell you again this poor creature is nothing to me i wish her only to be safely taken care of and i think the boldest borderman in perth will respect the bar of my door as much as the gate of carlisle castle i am going down to sim glovers i may stay there all night for the highland cub is run back to the hills like a wolf whelp as he is and so there is a bed to spare and father simon will make me welcome to the use of it you will remain with this poor creature feed her and protect her during the night and i will call on her before day and thou mayst go with her to the boat thyself an thou wilt and so thou wilt set the last eyes on her at the same time i shall  there is some reason in that said dame shoolbred though why you should put your reputation in risk for a creature that would find a lodging for a silver twopence and less matter is a mystery to me  trust me with that old woman and be kind to the girl  kinder than she deserves i warrant you and truly though i little like the company of such cattle yet i think i am less like to take harm from her than youunless she be a witch indeed which may well come to be the case as the devil is very powerful with all this wayfaring clanjamfray  no more a witch than i am a warlock said the honest smith a poor broken hearted thing that if she hath done evil has dreed a sore weird for it be kind to her and you my musical damsel i will call on you tomorrow morning and carry you to the waterside this old woman will treat you kindly if you say nothing to her but what becomes honest ears  the poor minstrel had listened to this dialogue without understanding more than its general tendency for though she spoke english well she had acquired the language in england itself and the northern dialect was then as now of a broader and harsher character she saw however that she was to remain with the old lady and meekly folding her arms on her bosom bent her head with humility she next looked towards the smith with a strong expression of thankfulness then raising her eyes to heaven took his passive hand and seemed about to kiss the sinewy fingers in token of deep and affectionate gratitude  but dame shoolbred did not give license to the strangers mode of expressing her feelings she thrust in between them and pushing poor louise aside said nono ill have none of that work go into the chimney nook mistress and when harry smiths gone if you must have hands to kiss you shall kiss mine as long as you like and you harry away down to sim glovers for if pretty mistress catharine hears of the company you have brought home she may chance to like them as little as i do whats the matter now is the man demented are you going out without your buckler and the whole town in misrule  you are right dame said the armourer and throwing the buckler over his broad shoulders he departed from his house without abiding farther question    chapter xiii       how in the noon of night that pibroch thrills      savage and shrill but with the breath which fills      their mountain pipe so fill the mountaineers      with the fierce native daring which instils      the stirring memory of a thousand years       byron   we must now leave the lower parties in our historical drama to attend to the incidents which took place among those of a higher rank and greater importance  we pass from the hut of an armourer to the council room of a monarch and resume our story just when the tumult beneath being settled the angry chieftains were summoned to the royal presence they entered displeased with and lowering upon each other each so exclusively filled with his own fancied injuries as to be equally unwilling and unable to attend to reason or argument albany alone calm and crafty seemed prepared to use their dissatisfaction for his own purposes and turn each incident as it should occur to the furtherance of his own indirect ends  the kings irresolution although it amounted even to timidity did not prevent his assuming the exterior bearing becoming his situation it was only when hard pressed as in the preceding scene that he lost his apparent composure in general he might be driven from his purpose but seldom from his dignity of manner he received albany douglas march and the prior those ill assorted members of his motley council with a mixture of courtesy and loftiness which reminded each haughty peer that he stood in the presence of his sovereign and compelled him to do the beseeming reverence  having received their salutations the king motioned them to be seated and they were obeying his commands when rothsay entered he walked gracefully up to his father and kneeling at his footstool requested his blessing robert with an aspect in which fondness and sorrow were ill disguised made an attempt to assume a look of reproof as he laid his hand on the youths head and said with a sigh god bless thee my thoughtless boy and make thee a wiser man in thy future years  amen my dearest father said rothsay in a tone of feeling such as his happier moments often evinced he then kissed the royal hand with the reverence of a son and a subject and instead of taking a place at the council board remained standing behind the kings chair in such a position that he might when he chose whisper into his fathers ear  the king next made a sign to the prior of st dominic to take his place at the table on which there were writing materials which of all the subjects present albany excepted the churchman was alone able to use the king then opened the purpose of their meeting by saying with much dignity  our business my lords respected these unhappy dissensions in the highlands which we learn by our latest messengers are about to occasion the waste and destruction of the country even within a few miles of this our own court but near as this trouble is our ill fate and the instigations of wicked men have raised up one yet nearer by throwing strife and contention among the citizens of perth and those attendants who follow your lordships and others our knights and nobles i must first therefore apply to yourselves my lords to know why our court is disturbed by such unseemly contendings and by what means they ought to be repressed brother of albany do you tell us first your sentiments on this matter  sir our royal sovereign and brother said the duke being in attendance on your graces person when the fray began i am not acquainted with its origin  and for me said the prince i heard no worse war cry than a minstrel wenchs ballad and saw no more dangerous bolts flying than hazel nuts  and i said the earl of march could only perceive that the stout citizens of perth had in chase some knaves who had assumed the bloody heart on their shoulders they ran too fast to be actually the men of the earl of douglas  douglas understood the sneer but only replied to it by one of those withering looks with which he was accustomed to intimate his mortal resentment he spoke however with haughty composure  my liege he said must of course know it is douglas who must answer to this heavy charge for when was there strife or bloodshed in scotland but there were foul tongues to asperse a douglas or a douglass man as having given cause to them we have here goodly witnesses i speak not of my lord of albany who has only said that he was as well becomes him by your graces side and i say nothing of my lord of rothsay who as befits his rank years and understanding was cracking nuts with a strolling musician he smiles here he may say his pleasure i shall not forget a tie which he seems to have forgotten but here is my lord of march who saw my followers flying before the clowns of perth i can tell that earl that the followers of the bloody heart advance or retreat when their chieftain commands and the good of scotland requires  and i can answer exclaimed the equally proud earl of march his blood rushing into his face when the king interrupted him  peace angry lords said the king and remember in whose presence you stand and you my lord of douglas tell us if you can the cause of this mutiny and why your followers whose general good services we are most willing to acknowledge were thus active in private brawl  i obey my lord said douglas slightly stooping a head that seldom bent i was passing from my lodgings in the carthusian convent through the high street of perth with a few of my ordinary retinue when i beheld some of the baser sort of citizens crowding around the cross against which there was nailed this placard and that which accompanies it  he took from a pocket in the bosom of his buff coat a human hand and a piece of parchment the king was shocked and agitated  read he said good father prior and let that ghastly spectacle be removed  the prior read a placard to the following purpose  inasmuch as the house of a citizen of perth was assaulted last night being st valentines eve by a sort of disorderly night walkers belonging to some company of the strangers now resident in the fair city and whereas this hand was struck from one of the lawless limmers in the fray that ensued the provost and magistrates have directed that it should be nailed to the cross in scorn and contempt of those by whom such brawl was occasioned and if any one of knightly degree shall say that this our act is wrongfully done i patrick charteris of kinfauns knight will justify this cartel in knightly weapons within the barrace or if any one of meaner birth shall deny what is here said he shall be met with by a citizen of the fair city of perth according to his degree and so god and st john protect the fair city  you will not wonder my lord resumed douglas that when my almoner had read to me the contents of so insolent a scroll i caused one of my squires to pluck down a trophy so disgraceful to the chivalry and nobility of scotland where upon it seems some of these saucy burghers took license to hoot and insult the hindmost of my train who wheeled their horses on them and would soon have settled the feud but for my positive command that they should follow me in as much peace as the rascally vulgar would permit and thus they arrived here in the guise of flying men when with my command to repel force by force they might have set fire to the four corners of this wretched borough and stifled the insolent churls like malicious fox cubs in a burning brake of furze  there was a silence when douglas had done speaking until the duke of rothsay answered addressing his father  since the earl of douglas possesses the power of burning the town where your grace holds your court so soon as the provost and he differ about a night riot or the terms of a cartel i am sure we ought all to be thankful that he has not the will to do so  the duke of rothsay said douglas who seemed resolved to maintain command of his temper may have reason to thank heaven in a more serious tone than he now uses that the douglas is as true as he is powerful this is a time when the subjects in all countries rise against the law we have heard of the insurgents of the jacquerie in france and of jack straw and hob miller and parson ball among the southron and we may be sure there is fuel enough to catch such a flame were it spreading to our frontiers when i see peasants challenging noblemen and nailing the hands of the gentry to their city cross i will not say i fear mutinyfor that would be falsebut i foresee and will stand well prepared for it  and why does my lord douglas say answered the earl of march that this cartel has been done by churls i see sir patrick charteriss name there and he i ween is of no churls blood the douglas himself since he takes the matter so warmly might lift sir patricks gauntlet without soiling of his honour  my lord of march replied douglas should speak but of what he understands i do no injustice to the descendant of the red rover when i say he is too slight to be weighed with the douglas the heir of thomas randolph might have a better claim to his answer  and by my honour it shall not miss for want of my asking the grace said the earl of march pulling his glove off  stay my lord said the king do us not so gross an injury as to bring your feud to mortal defiance here but rather offer your ungloved hand in kindness to the noble earl and embrace in token of your mutual fealty to the crown of scotland  not so my liege answered march your majesty may command me to return my gauntlet for that and all the armour it belongs to are at your command while i continue to hold my earldom of the crown of scotland but when i clasp douglas it must be with a mailed hand farewell my liege my counsels here avail not nay are so unfavourably received that perhaps farther stay were unwholesome for my safety may god keep your highness from open enemies and treacherous friends i am for my castle of dunbar from whence i think you will soon hear news farewell to you my lords of albany and douglas you are playing a high game look you play it fairly farewell poor thoughtless prince who art sporting like a fawn within spring of a tiger farewell allgeorge of dunbar sees the evil he cannot remedy adieu all  the king would have spoken but the accents died on his tongue as he received from albany a look cautioning him to forbear the earl of march left the apartment receiving the mute salutations of the members of the council whom he had severally addressed excepting from douglas alone who returned to his farewell speech a glance of contemptuous defiance  the recreant goes to betray us to the southron he said his pride rests on his possessing that sea worn hold which can admit the english into lothian the castle of dunbar nay look not alarmed my liege i will hold good what i say nevertheless it is yet time speak but the word my liegesay but arrest him and march shall not yet cross the earn on his traitorous journey  nay gallant earl said albany who wished rather that the two powerful lords should counterbalance each other than that one should obtain a decisive superiority that were too hasty counsel the earl of march came hither on the kings warrant of safe conduct and it may not consist with my royal brothers honour to break it yet if your lordship can bring any detailed proof  here they were interrupted by a flourish of trumpets  his grace of albany is unwontedly scrupulous today said douglas but it skills not wasting wordsthe time is pastthese are marchs trumpets and i warrant me he rides at flight speed so soon as he passes the south port we shall hear of him in time and if it be as i have conjectured he shall be met with though all england backed his treachery  nay let us hope better of the noble earl said the king no way displeased that the quarrel betwixt march and douglas had seemed to obliterate the traces of the disagreement betwixt rothsay and his father in law he hath a fiery but not a sullen temper in some things he has beeni will not say wronged but disappointedand something is to be allowed to the resentment of high blood armed with great power but thank heaven all of us who remain are of one sentiment and i may say of one house so that at least our councils cannot now be thwarted with disunion father prior i pray you take your writing materials for you must as usual be our clerk of council and now to business my lords and our first object of consideration must be this highland cumber  between the clan chattan and the clan quhele said the prior which as our last advices from our brethren at dunkeld inform us is ready to break out into a more formidable warfare than has yet taken place between these sons of belial who speak of nothing else than of utterly destroying one another their forces are assembling on each side and not a man claiming in the tenth degree of kindred but must repair to the brattach of his tribe or stand to the punishment of fire and sword the fiery cross hath flitted about like a meteor in every direction and awakened strange and unknown tribes beyond the distant moray firthmay heaven and st dominic be our protection but if your lordships cannot find remedy for evil it will spread broad and wide and the patrimony of the church must in every direction be exposed to the fury of these amalekites with whom there is as little devotion to heaven as there is pity or love to their neighbourmay our lady be our guard we hear some of them are yet utter heathens and worship mahound and termagaunt  my lords and kinsmen said robert ye have heard the urgency of this case and may desire to know my sentiments before you deliver what your own wisdom shall suggest and in sooth no better remedy occurs to me than to send two commissioners with full power from us to settle such debates as be among them and at the same time to charge them as they shall be answerable to the law to lay down their arms and forbear all practices of violence against each other  i approve of your graces proposal said rothsay and i trust the good prior will not refuse the venerable station of envoy upon this peacemaking errand and his reverend brother the abbot of the carthusian convent must contend for an honour which will certainly add two most eminent recruits to the large army of martyrs since the highlanders little regard the distinction betwixt clerk and layman in the ambassadors whom you send to them  my royal lord of rothsay said the prior if i am destined to the blessed crown of martyrdom i shall be doubtless directed to the path by which i am to attain it meantime if you speak in jest may heaven pardon you and give you light to perceive that it were better buckle on your arms to guard the possessions of the church so perilously endangered than to employ your wit in taunting her ministers and servants  i taunt no one father prior said the youth yawning nor have i much objection to taking arms excepting that they are a somewhat cumbrous garb and in february a furred mantle is more suiting to the weather than a steel corselet and it irks me the more to put on cold harness in this nipping weather that would but the church send a detachment of their saintsand they have some highland ones well known in this district and doubtless used to the climatethey might fight their own battles like merry st george of england but i know not how it is we hear of their miracles when they are propitiated and of their vengeance if any one trespasses on their patrimonies and these are urged as reasons for extending their lands by large largesses and yet if there come down but a band of twenty highlanders bell book and candle make no speed and the belted baron must be fain to maintain the church in possession of the lands which he has given to her as much as if he himself still enjoyed the fruits of them  son david said the king you give an undue license to your tongue  nay sir i am mute replied the prince i had no purpose to disturb your highness or displease the father prior who with so many miracles at his disposal will not face as it seems a handful of highland caterans  we know said the prior with suppressed indignation from what source these vile doctrines are derived which we hear with horror from the tongue that now utters them when princes converse with heretics their minds and manners are alike corrupted they show themselves in the streets as the companions of maskers and harlots and in the council as the scorners of the church and of holy things  peace good father said the king rothsay shall make amends for what he has idly spoken alas let us take counsel in friendly fashion rather than resemble a mutinous crew of mariners in a sinking vessel when each is more intent on quarrelling with his neighbours than in assisting the exertions of the forlorn master for the safety of the ship my lord of douglas your house has been seldom to lack when the crown of scotland desired either wise counsel or manly achievement i trust you will help us in this strait  i can only wonder that the strait should exist my lord answered the haughty douglas when i was entrusted with the lieutenancy of the kingdom there were some of these wild clans came down from the grampians i troubled not the council about the matter but made the sheriff lord ruthven get to horse with the forces of the carsethe hays the lindsays the ogilvies and other gentlemen by st bride when it was steel coat to frieze mantle the thieves knew what lances were good for and whether swords had edges or no there were some three hundred of their best bonnets besides that of their chief donald cormac left on the moor of thorn and in rochinroy wood and as many were gibbeted at houghmanstares which has still the name from the hangman work that was done there this is the way men deal with thieves in my country and if gentler methods will succeed better with these earish knaves do not blame douglas for speaking his mind you smile my lord of rothsay may i ask how i have a second time become your jest before i have replied to the first which you passed on me  nay be not wrathful my good lord of douglas answered the prince i did but smile to think how your princely retinue would dwindle if every thief were dealt with as the poor highlanders at houghmanstares  the king again interfered to prevent the earl from giving an angry reply  your lordship said he to douglas advises wisely that we should trust to arms when these men come out against our subjects on the fair and level plan but the difficulty is to put a stop to their disorders while they continue to lurk within their mountains i need not tell you that the clan chattan and the clan quhele are great confederacies consisting each of various tribes who are banded together each to support their own separate league and who of late have had dissensions which have drawn blood wherever they have met whether individually or in bands the whole country is torn to pieces by their restless feuds  i cannot see the evil of this said the douglas the ruffians will destroy each other and the deer of the highlands will increase as the men diminish we shall gain as hunters the exercise we lose as warriors  rather say that the wolves will increase as the men diminish replied the king  i am content said douglas better wild wolves than wild caterans let there be strong forces maintained along the earish frontier to separate the quiet from the disturbed country confine the fire of civil war within the highlands let it spend its uncontrolled fury and it will be soon burnt out for want of fuel the survivors will be humbled and will be more obedient to a whisper of your graces pleasure than their fathers or the knaves that now exist have been to your strictest commands  this is wise but ungodly counsel said the prior shaking his head i cannot take it upon my conscience to recommend it it is wisdom but it is the wisdom of achitophel crafty at once and cruel  my heart tells me so said the king laying his hand on his breastmy heart tells me that it will be asked of me at the awful day robert stuart where are the subjects i have given thee it tells me that i must account for them all saxon and gael lowland highland and border man that i will not be required to answer for those alone who have wealth and knowledge but for those also who were robbers because they were poor and rebels because they were ignorant  your highness speaks like a christian king said the prior but you bear the sword as well as the sceptre and this present evil is of a kind which the sword must cure  hark ye my lords said the prince looking up as if a gay thought had suddenly struck him suppose we teach these savage mountaineers a strain of chivalry it were no hard matter to bring these two great commanders the captain of the clan chattan and the chief of the no less doughty race of the clan quhele to defy each other to mortal combat they might fight here in perthwe would lend them horse and armour thus their feud would be stanched by the death of one or probably both of the villains for i think both would break their necks in the first charge my fathers godly desire of saving blood would be attained and we should have the pleasure of seeing such a combat between two savage knights for the first time in their lives wearing breeches and mounted on horses as has not been heard of since the days of king arthur  shame upon you david said the king do you make the distress of your native country and the perplexity of our councils a subject for buffoonery  if you will pardon me royal brother said albany i think that though my princely nephew hath started this thought in a jocular manner there may be something wrought out of it which might greatly remedy this pressing evil  good brother replied the king it is unkind to expose rothsays folly by pressing further his ill timed jest we know the highland clans have not our customs of chivalry nor the habit or mode of doing battle which these require  true your grace answered albany yet i speak not in scorn but in serious earnest true the mountaineers have not our forms and mode of doing battle in the lists but they have those which are as effectual to the destruction of human life and so that the mortal game is played and the stake won and lost what signifies it whether these gael fight with sword and lance as becomes belted knights or with sandbags like the crestless churls of england or butcher each other with knives and skenes in their own barbarous fashion their habits like our own refer all disputed rights and claims to the decision of battle they are as vain too as they are fierce and the idea that these two clans would be admitted to combat in presence of your grace and of your court will readily induce them to refer their difference to the fate of battle even were such rough arbitrement less familiar to their customs and that in any such numbers as shall be thought most convenient we must take care that they approach not the court save in such a fashion and number that they shall not be able to surprise us and that point being provided against the more that shall be admitted to combat upon either side the greater will be the slaughter among their bravest and most stirring men and the more the chance of the highlands being quiet for some time to come  this were a bloody policy brother said the king and again i say that i cannot bring my conscience to countenance the slaughter of these rude men that are so little better than so many benighted heathens  and are their lives more precious asked albany than those of nobles and gentlemen who by your graces license are so frequently admitted to fight in barrace either for the satisfying of disputes at law or simply to acquire honour  the king thus hard pressed had little to say against a custom so engrafted upon the laws of the realm and the usages of chivalry as the trial by combat and he only replied god knows i have never granted such license as you urge me with unless with the greatest repugnance and that i never saw men have strife together to the effusion of blood but i could have wished to appease it with the shedding of my own  but my gracious lord said the prior it seems that if we follow not some such policy as this of my lord of albany we must have recourse to that of the douglas and at the risk of the dubious event of battle and with the certainty of losing many excellent subjects do by means of the lowland swords that which these wild mountaineers will otherwise perform with their own hand what says my lord of douglas to the policy of his grace of albany  douglas said the haughty lord never counselled that to be done by policy which might be attained by open force he remains by his opinion and is willing to march at the head of his own followers with those of the barons of perth shire and the carse and either bring these highlanders to reason or subjection or leave the body of a douglas among their savage wildernesses  it is nobly spoken my lord of douglas said albany and well might the king rely upon thy undaunted heart and the courage of thy resolute followers but see you not how soon you may be called elsewhere where your presence and services are altogether indispensable to scotland and her monarch marked you not the gloomy tone in which the fiery march limited his allegiance and faith to our sovereign here present to that space for which he was to remain king roberts vassal and did not you yourself suspect that he was plotting a transference of his allegiance to england other chiefs of subordinate power and inferior fame may do battle with the highlanders but if dunbar admit the percies and their englishmen into our frontiers who will drive them back if the douglas be elsewhere  my sword answered douglas is equally at the service of his majesty on the frontier or in the deepest recesses of the highlands i have seen the backs of the proud percy and george of dunbar ere now and i may see them again and if it is the kings pleasure i should take measures against this probable conjunction of stranger and traitor i admit that rather than trust to an inferior or feebler hand the important task of settling the highlands i would be disposed to give my opinion in favour of the policy of my lord of albany and suffer those savages to carve each others limbs without giving barons and knights the trouble of hunting them down  my lord of douglas said the prince who seemed determined to omit no opportunity to gall his haughty father in law does not choose to leave to us lowlanders even the poor crumbs of honour which might be gathered at the expense of the highland kerne while he with his border chivalry reaps the full harvest of victory over the english but percy hath seen mens backs as well as douglas and i have known as great wonders as that he who goes forth to seek such wool should come back shorn  a phrase said douglas well becoming a prince who speaks of honour with a wandering harlots scrip in his bonnet by way of favor  excuse it my lord said rothsay men who have matched unfittingly become careless in the choice of those whom they love par amours the chained dog must snatch at the nearest bone  rothsay my unhappy son exclaimed the king art thou mad or wouldst thou draw down on thee the full storm of a king and fathers displeasure  i am dumb returned the prince at your graces command  well then my lord of albany said the king since such is your advice and since scottish blood must flow how i pray you are we to prevail on these fierce men to refer their quarrel to such a combat as you propose  that my liege said albany must be the result of more mature deliberation but the task will not be difficult gold will be needful to bribe some of the bards and principal counsellors and spokesmen the chiefs moreover of both these leagues must be made to understand that unless they agree to this amicable settlement  amicable brother said the king with emphasis  ay amicable my liege replied his brother since it is better the country were placed in peace at the expense of losing a score or two of highland kernes than remain at war till as many thousands are destroyed by sword fire famine and all the extremities of mountain battle to return to the purpose i think that the first party to whom the accommodation is proposed will snatch at it eagerly that the other will be ashamed to reject an offer to rest the cause on the swords of their bravest men that the national vanity and factious hate to each other will prevent them from seeing our purpose in adopting such a rule of decision and that they will be more eager to cut each other to pieces than we can be to halloo them on and now as our counsels are finished so far as i can aid i will withdraw  stay yet a moment said the prior for i also have a grief to disclose of a nature so black and horrible that your graces pious heart will hardly credit its existence and i state it mournfully because as certain as that i am an unworthy servant of st dominic it is the cause of the displeasure of heaven against this poor country by which our victories are turned into defeat our gladness into mourning our councils distracted with disunion and our country devoured by civil war  speak reverend prior said the king assuredly if the cause of such evils be in me or in my house i will take instant care to their removal  he uttered these words with a faltering voice and eagerly waited for the priors reply in the dread no doubt that it might implicate rothsay in some new charge of folly or vice his apprehensions perhaps deceived him when he thought he saw the churchmans eye rest for a moment on the prince before he said in a solemn tone heresy my noble and gracious liegeheresy is among us she snatches soul after soul from the congregation as wolves steal lambs from the sheep fold  there are enough of shepherds to watch the fold answered the duke of rothsay here are four convents of regular monks alone around this poor hamlet of perth and all the secular clergy besides methinks a town so well garrisoned should be fit to keep out an enemy  one traitor in a garrison my lord answered the prior can do much to destroy the security of a city which is guarded by legions and if that one traitor is either from levity or love of novelty or whatever other motive protected and fostered by those who should be most eager to expel him from the fortress his opportunities of working mischief will be incalculably increased  your words seem to aim at some one in this presence father prior said the douglas if at me they do me foul wrong i am well aware that the abbot of aberbrothock hath made some ill advised complaints that i suffered not his beeves to become too many for his pastures or his stock of grain to burst the girnels of the monastery while my followers lacked beef and their horses corn but bethink you the pastures and cornfields which produced that plenty were bestowed by my ancestors on the house of aberbrothock surely not with the purpose that their descendant should starve in the midst of it and neither will he by st bride but for heresy and false doctrine he added striking his large hand heavily on the council table who is it that dare tax the douglas i would not have poor men burned for silly thoughts but my hand and sword are ever ready to maintain the christian faith  my lord i doubt it not said the prior so hath it ever been with your most noble house for the abbots complaints they may pass to a second day but what we now desire is a commission to some noble lord of state joined to others of holy church to support by strength of hand if necessary the inquiries which the reverend official of the bounds and other grave prelates my unworthy self being one are about to make into the cause of the new doctrines which are now deluding the simple and depraving the pure and precious faith approved by the holy father and his reverend predecessors  let the earl of douglas have a royal commission to this effect said albany and let there be no exception whatever from his jurisdiction saving the royal person for my own part although conscious that i have neither in act nor thought received or encouraged a doctrine which holy church hath not sanctioned yet i should blush to claim an immunity under the blood royal of scotland lest i should seem to be seeking refuge against a crime so horrible  i will have nought to do with it said douglas to march against the english and the southron traitor march is task enough for me moreover i am a true scotsman and will not give way to aught that may put the church of scotlands head farther into the roman yoke or make the barons coronet stoop to the mitre and cowl do you therefore most noble duke of albany place your own name in the commission and i pray your grace so to mitigate the zeal of the men of holy church who may be associated with you that there be no over zealous dealings for the smell of a fagot on the tay would bring back the douglas from the walls of york  the duke hastened to give the earl assurance that the commission should be exercised with lenity and moderation  without a question said king robert the commission must be ample and did it consist with the dignity of our crown we would not ourselves decline its jurisdiction but we trust that while the thunders of the church are directed against the vile authors of these detestable heresies there shall be measures of mildness and compassion taken with the unfortunate victims of their delusions  such is ever the course of holy church my lord said the prior of st dominics  why then let the commission be expedited with due care in name of our brother albany and such others as shall be deemed convenient said the king and now once again let us break up our council and rothsay come thou with me and lend me thine arm i have matter for thy private ear  ho la here exclaimed the prince in the tone in which he would have addressed a managed horse  what means this rudeness boy said the king wilt thou never learn reason and courtesy  let me not be thought to offend my liege said the prince but we are parting without learning what is to be done in the passing strange adventure of the dead hand which the douglas hath so gallantly taken up we shall sit but uncomfortably here at perth if we are at variance with the citizens  leave that to me said albany with some little grant of lands and money and plenty of fair words the burghers may be satisfied for this time but it were well that the barons and their followers who are in attendance on the court were warned to respect the peace within burgh  surely we would have it so said the king let strict orders be given accordingly  it is doing the churls but too much grace said the douglas but be it at your highnesss pleasure i take leave to retire  not before you taste a flagon of gascon wine my lord said the king  pardon replied the earl i am not athirst and i drink not for fashion but either for need or for friendship so saying he departed  the king as if relieved by his absence turned to albany and said and now my lord we should chide this truant rothsay of ours yet he hath served us so well at council that we must receive his merits as some atonement for his follies  i am happy to hear it answered albany with a countenance of pity and incredulity as if he knew nothing of the supposed services  nay brother you are dull said the king for i will not think you envious did you not note that rothsay was the first to suggest the mode of settling the highlands which your experience brought indeed into better shape and which was generally approved of and even now we had broken up leaving a main matter unconsidered but that he put us in mind of the affray with the citizens  i nothing doubt my liege said the duke of albany with the acquiescence which he saw was expected that my royal nephew will soon emulate his fathers wisdom  or said the duke of rothsay i may find it easier to borrow from another member of my family that happy and comfortable cloak of hypocrisy which covers all vices and then it signifies little whether they exist or not  my lord prior said the duke addressing the dominican we will for a moment pray your reverences absence the king and i have that to say to the prince which must have no further audience not even yours  the dominican bowed and withdrew  when the two royal brothers and the prince were left together the king seemed in the highest degree embarrassed and distressed albany sullen and thoughtful while rothsay himself endeavoured to cover some anxiety under his usual appearance of levity there was a silence of a minute at length albany spoke  royal brother he said my princely nephew entertains with so much suspicion any admonition coming from my mouth that i must pray your grace yourself to take the trouble of telling him what it is most fitting he should know  it must be some unpleasing communication indeed which my lord of albany cannot wrap up in honied words said the prince  peace with thine effrontery boy answered the king passionately you asked but now of the quarrel with the citizens who caused that quarrel david what men were those who scaled the window of a peaceful citizen and liege man alarmed the night with torch and outcry and subjected our subjects to danger and affright  more fear than danger i fancy answered the prince but how can i of all men tell who made this nocturnal disturbance  there was a follower of thine own there continued the kinga man of belial whom i will have brought to condign punishment  i have no follower to my knowledge capable of deserving your highnesss displeasure answered the prince  i will have no evasions boy where wert thou on st valentines eve  it is to be hoped that i was serving the good saint as a man of mould might answered the young man carelessly  will my royal nephew tell us how his master of the horse was employed upon that holy eve said the duke of albany  speak david i command thee to speak said the king  ramorny was employed in my service i think that answer may satisfy my uncle  but it will not satisfy me said the angry father god knows i never coveted mans blood but that ramornys head i will have if law can give it he has been the encourager and partaker of all thy numerous vices and follies i will take care he shall be so no more call maclouis with a guard  do not injure an innocent man interposed the prince desirous at every sacrifice to preserve his favourite from the menaced danger i pledge my word that ramorny was employed in business of mine therefore could not be engaged in this brawl  false equivocator that thou art said the king presenting to the prince a ring behold the signet of ramorny lost in the infamous affray it fell into the hands of a follower of the douglas and was given by the earl to my brother speak not for ramorny for he dies and go thou from my presence and repent the flagitious counsels which could make thee stand before me with a falsehood in thy mouth oh shame davidshame as a son thou hast lied to thy father as a knight to the head of thy order  the prince stood mute conscience struck and self convicted he then gave way to the honourable feelings which at bottom he really possessed and threw himself at his fathers feet  the false knight he said deserves degradation the disloyal subject death but oh let the son crave from the father pardon for the servant who did not lead him into guilt but who reluctantly plunged himself into it at his command let me bear the weight of my own folly but spare those who have been my tools rather than my accomplices remember ramorny was preferred to my service by my sainted mother  name her not david i charge thee said the king she is happy that she never saw the child of her love stand before her doubly dishonoured by guilt and by falsehood  i am indeed unworthy to name her said the prince and yet my dear father in her name i must petition for ramornys life  if i might offer my counsel said the duke of albany who saw that a reconciliation would soon take place betwixt the father and son i would advise that ramorny be dismissed from the princes household and society with such further penalty as his imprudence may seem to merit the public will be contented with his disgrace and the matter will be easily accommodated or stifled so that his highness do not attempt to screen his servant  wilt thou for my sake david said the king with a faltering voice and the tear in his eye dismiss this dangerous manfor my sake who could not refuse thee the heart out of my bosom  it shall be done my fatherdone instantly the prince replied and seizing the pen he wrote a hasty dismissal of ramorny from his service and put it into albanys hands i would i could fulfil all your wishes as easily my royal father he added again throwing himself at the kings feet who raised him up and fondly folded him in his arms  albany scowled but was silent and it was not till after the space of a minute or two that he said this matter being so happily accommodated let me ask if your majesty is pleased to attend the evensong service in the chapel  surely said the king have i not thanks to pay to god who has restored union to my family you will go with us brother  so please your grace to give me leave of absenceno said the duke i must concert with the douglas and others the manner in which we may bring these highland vultures to our lure  albany retired to think over his ambitious projects while the father and son attended divine service to thank god for their happy reconciliation    chapter xiv       will you go to the hielands lizzy lyndesay      will you go the hielands wi me      will you go to the hielands lizzy lyndesay      my bride and my darling to be       old ballad   a former chapter opened in the royal confessional we are now to introduce our readers to a situation somewhat similar though the scene and persons were very different instead of a gothic and darkened apartment in a monastery one of the most beautiful prospects in scotland lay extended beneath the hill of kinnoul and at the foot of a rock which commanded the view in every direction sat the fair maid of perth listening in an attitude of devout attention to the instructions of a carthusian monk in his white gown and scapular who concluded his discourse with prayer in which his proselyte devoutly joined  when they had finished their devotions the priest sat for some time with his eyes fixed on the glorious prospect of which even the early and chilly season could not conceal the beauties and it was some time ere he addressed his attentive companion  when i behold he said at length this rich and varied land with its castles churches convents stately palaces and fertile fields these extensive woods and that noble river i know not my daughter whether most to admire the bounty of god or the ingratitude of man he hath given us the beauty and fertility of the earth and we have made the scene of his bounty a charnel house and a battlefield he hath given us power over the elements and skill to erect houses for comfort and defence and we have converted them into dens for robbers and ruffians  yet surely my father there is room for comfort replied catharine even in the very prospect we look upon yonder four goodly convents with their churches and their towers which tell the citizens with brazen voice that they should think on their religious duties their inhabitants who have separated themselves from the world its pursuits and its pleasures to dedicate themselves to the service of heavenall bear witness that if scotland be a bloody and a sinful land she is yet alive and sensible to the claims which religion demands of the human race  verily daughter answered the priest what you say seems truth and yet nearly viewed too much of the comfort you describe will be found delusive it is true there was a period in the christian world when good men maintaining themselves by the work of their hands assembled together not that they might live easily or sleep softly but that they might strengthen each other in the christian faith and qualify themselves to be teachers of the word to the people doubtless there are still such to be found in the holy edifices on which we now look but it is to be feared that the love of many has waxed cold our churchmen have become wealthy as well by the gifts of pious persons as by the bribes which wicked men have given in their ignorance imagining that they can purchase that pardon by endowments to the church which heaven has only offered to sincere penitents and thus as the church waxeth rich her doctrines have unhappily become dim and obscure as a light is less seen if placed in a lamp of chased gold than beheld through a screen of glass god knows if i see these things and mark them it is from no wish of singularity or desire to make myself a teacher in israel but because the fire burns in my bosom and will not permit me to be silent i obey the rules of my order and withdraw not myself from its austerities be they essential to our salvation or be they mere formalities adopted to supply the want of real penitence and sincere devotion i have promised nay vowed to observe them and they shall be respected by me the more that otherwise i might be charged with regarding my bodily ease when heaven is my witness how lightly i value what i may be called on to act or suffer if the purity of the church could be restored or the discipline of the priesthood replaced in its primitive simplicity  but my father said catharine even for these opinions men term you a lollard and a wickliffite and say it is your desire to destroy churches and cloisters and restore the religion of heathenesse  even so my daughter am i driven to seek refuge in hills and rocks and must be presently contented to take my flight amongst the rude highlanders who are thus far in a more gracious state than those i leave behind me that theirs are crimes of ignorance not of presumption i will not omit to take such means of safety and escape from their cruelty as heaven may open to me for while such appear i shall account it a sign that i have still a service to accomplish but when it is my masters pleasure he knows how willingly clement blair will lay down a vilified life upon earth in humble hope of a blessed exchange hereafter but wherefore dost thou look northward so anxiously my child thy young eyes are quicker than minedost thou see any one coming  i look father for the highland youth conachar who will be thy guide to the hills where his father can afford thee a safe if a rude retreat this he has often promised when we spoke of you and of your lessons i fear he is now in company where he will soon forget them  the youth hath sparkles of grace in him said father clement although those of his race are usually too much devoted to their own fierce and savage customs to endure with patience either the restraints of religion or those of the social law thou hast never told me daughter how contrary to all the usages either of the burgh or of the mountains this youth came to reside in thy fathers house  all i know touching that matter said catharine is that his father is a man of consequence among those hill men and that he desired as a favour of my father who hath had dealings with them in the way of his merchandise to keep this youth for a certain time and that it is only two days since they parted as conachar was to return home to his own mountains  and why has my daughter demanded the priest maintained such a correspondence with this highland youth that she should know how to send for him when she desired to use his services in my behalf surely this is much influence for a maiden to possess over such a wild colt as this youthful mountaineer  catharine blushed and answered with hesitation if i have had any influence with conachar heaven be my witness i have only exerted it to enforce upon his fiery temper compliance with the rules of civil life it is true i have long expected that you my father would be obliged to take to flight and i therefore had agreed with him that he should meet me at this place as soon as he should receive a message from me with a token which i yesterday despatched the messenger was a lightfooted boy of his own clan whom he used sometimes to send on errands into the highlands  and am i then to understand daughter that this youth so fair to the eye was nothing more dear to you than as you desired to enlighten his mind and reform his manners  it is so my father and no otherwise answered catharine and perhaps i did not do well to hold intimacy with him even for his instruction and improvement but my discourse never led farther  then have i been mistaken my daughter for i thought i had seen in thee of late some change of purpose and some wishful regards looking back to this world of which you were at one time resolved to take leave  catharine hung down her head and blushed more deeply than ever as she said yourself father were used to remonstrate against my taking the veil  nor do i now approve of it my child said the priest marriage is an honourable state appointed by heaven as the regular means of continuing the race of man and i read not in the scriptures what human inventions have since affirmed concerning the superior excellence of a state of celibacy but i am jealous of thee my child as a father is of his only daughter lest thou shouldst throw thyself away upon some one unworthy of thee thy parent i know less nice in thy behalf than i am countenances the addresses of that fierce and riotous reveller whom they call henry of the wynd he is rich it may be but a haunter of idle and debauched companya common prizefighter who has shed human blood like water can such a one be a fit mate for catharine glover and yet report says they are soon to be united  the fair maid of perths complexion changed from red to pale and from pale to red as she hastily replied i think not of him though it is true some courtesies have passed betwixt us of late both as he is my fathers friend and as being according to the custom of the time my valentine  your valentine my child said father clement and can your modesty and prudence have trifled so much with the delicacy of your sex as to place yourself in such a relation to such a man as this artificer think you that this valentine a godly saint and christian bishop as he is said to have been ever countenanced a silly and unseemly custom more likely to have originated in the heathen worship of flora or venus when mortals gave the names of deities to their passions and studied to excite instead of restraining them  father said catharine in a tone of more displeasure than she had ever before assumed to the carthusian i know not upon what ground you tax me thus severely for complying with a general practice authorised by universal custom and sanctioned by my fathers authority i cannot feel it kind that you put such misconstruction upon me  forgive me daughter answered the priest mildly if i have given you offence but this henry gow or smith is a forward licentious man to whom you cannot allow any uncommon degree of intimacy and encouragement without exposing yourself to worse misconstructionunless indeed it be your purpose to wed him and that very shortly  say no more of it my father said catharine you give me more pain than you would desire to do and i may be provoked to answer otherwise than as becomes me perhaps i have already had cause enough to make me repent my compliance with an idle custom at any rate believe that henry smith is nothing to me and that even the idle intercourse arising from st valentines day is utterly broken off  i am rejoiced to hear it my daughter replied the carthusian and must now prove you on another subject which renders me most anxious on your behalf you cannot your self be ignorant of it although i could wish it were not necessary to speak of a thing so dangerous even before these surrounding rocks cliffs and stones but it must be said catharine you have a lover in the highest rank of scotlands sons of honour  i know it father answered catharine composedly i would it were not so  so would i also said the priest did i see in my daughter only the child of folly which most young women are at her age especially if possessed of the fatal gift of beauty but as thy charms to speak the language of an idle world have attached to thee a lover of such high rank so i know that thy virtue and wisdom will maintain the influence over the princes mind which thy beauty hath acquired  father replied catharine the prince is a licentious gallant whose notice of me tends only to my disgrace and ruin can you who seemed but now afraid that i acted imprudently in entering into an ordinary exchange of courtesies with one of my own rank speak with patience of the sort of correspondence which the heir of scotland dares to fix upon me know that it is but two nights since he with a party of his debauched followers would have carried me by force from my fathers house had i not been rescued by that same rash spirited henry smith who if he be too hasty in venturing on danger on slight occasion is always ready to venture his life in behalf of innocence or in resistance of oppression it is well my part to do him that justice  i should know something of that matter said the monk since it was my voice that sent him to your assistance i had seen the party as i passed your door and was hastening to the civil power in order to raise assistance when i perceived a mans figure coming slowly towards me apprehensive it might be one of the ambuscade i stepped behind the buttresses of the chapel of st john and seeing from a nearer view that it was henry smith i guessed which way he was bound and raised my voice in an exhortation which made him double his speed  i am beholden to you father said catharine but all this and the duke of rothsays own language to me only show that the prince is a profligate young man who will scruple no extremities which may promise to gratify an idle passion at whatever expense to its object his emissary ramorny has even had the insolence to tell me that my father shall suffer for it if i dare to prefer being the wife of an honest man to becoming the loose paramour of a married prince so i see no other remedy than to take the veil or run the risk of my own ruin and my poor fathers were there no other reason the terror of these threats from a man so notoriously capable of keeping his word ought as much to prevent my becoming the bride of any worthy man as it should prohibit me from unlatching his door to admit murderers oh good father what a lot is mine and how fatal am i likely to prove to my affectionate parent and to any one with whom i might ally my unhappy fortunes  be yet of good cheer my daughter said the monk there is comfort for thee even in this extremity of apparent distress ramorny is a villain and abuses the ear of his patron the prince is unhappily a dissipated and idle youth but unless my grey hairs have been strangely imposed on his character is beginning to alter he hath been awakened to ramornys baseness and deeply regrets having followed his evil advice i believe nay i am well convinced that his passion for you has assumed a nobler and purer character and that the lessons he has heard from me on the corruptions of the church and of the times will if enforced from your lips sink deeply into his heart and perhaps produce fruits for the world to wonder as well as rejoice at old prophecies have said that rome shall fall by the speech of a woman  these are dreams father said catharinethe visions of one whose thoughts are too much on better things to admit his thinking justly upon the ordinary affairs of perth when we have looked long at the sun everything else can only be seen indistinctly  thou art over hasty my daughter said clement and thou shalt be convinced of it the prospects which i am to open to thee were unfit to be exposed to one of a less firm sense of virtue or a more ambitious temper perhaps it is not fit that even to you i should display them but my confidence is strong in thy wisdom and thy principles know then that there is much chance that the church of rome will dissolve the union which she has herself formed and release the duke of rothsay from his marriage with marjory douglas  here he paused  and if the church hath power and will to do this replied the maiden what influence can the divorce of the duke from his wife produce on the fortunes of catharine glover  she looked at the priest anxiously as she spoke and he had some apparent difficulty in framing his reply for he looked on the ground while he answered her  what did beauty do for catharine logie unless our fathers have told us falsely it raised her to share the throne of david bruce  did she live happy or die regretted good father asked catharine in the same calm and steady tone  she formed her alliance from temporal and perhaps criminal ambition replied father clement and she found her reward in vanity and vexation of spirit but had she wedded with the purpose that the believing wife should convert the unbelieving or confirm the doubting husband what then had been her reward love and honour upon earth and an inheritance in heaven with queen margaret and those heroines who have been the nursing mothers of the church  hitherto catharine had sat upon a stone beside the priests feet and looked up to him as she spoke or listened but now as if animated by calm yet settled feelings of disapprobation she rose up and extending her hand towards the monk as she spoke addressed him with a countenance and voice which might have become a cherub pitying and even as much as possible sparing the feelings of the mortal whose errors he is commissioned to rebuke  and is it even so she said and can so much of the wishes hopes and prejudices of this vile world affect him who may be called tomorrow to lay down his life for opposing the corruptions of a wicked age and backsliding priesthood can it be the severely virtuous father clement who advises his child to aim at or even to think of the possession of a throne and a bed which cannot become vacant but by an act of crying injustice to the present possessor can it be the wise reformer of the church who wishes to rest a scheme in itself so unjust upon a foundation so precarious since when is it good father that the principal libertine has altered his morals so much to be likely to court in honourable fashion the daughter of a perth artisan two days must have wrought this change for only that space has passed since he was breaking into my fathers house at midnight with worse mischief in his mind than that of a common robber and think you that if rothsays heart could dictate so mean a match he could achieve such a purpose without endangering both his succession and his life assailed by the douglas and march at the same time for what they must receive as an act of injury and insult to both their houses oh father clement where was your principle where your prudence when they suffered you to be bewildered by so strange a dream and placed the meanest of your disciples in the right thus to reproach you  the old mans eyes filled with tears as catharine visibly and painfully affected by what she had said became at length silent  by the mouths of babes and sucklings he said hath he rebuked those who would seem wise in their generation i thank heaven that hath taught me better thoughts than my own vanity suggested through the medium of so kind a monitress yes catharine i must not hereafter wonder or exclaim when i see those whom i have hitherto judged too harshly struggling for temporal power and holding all the while the language of religious zeal i thank thee daughter for thy salutary admonition and i thank heaven that sent it by thy lips rather than those of a stern reprover  catharine had raised her head to reply and bid the old man whose humiliation gave her pain be comforted when her eyes were arrested by an object close at hand among the crags and cliffs which surrounded this place of seclusion there were two which stood in such close contiguity that they seemed to have been portions of the same rock which rendered by lightning or by an earthquake now exhibited a chasm of about four feet in breadth betwixt the masses of stone into this chasm an oak tree had thrust itself in one of the fantastic frolics which vegetation often exhibits in such situations the tree stunted and ill fed had sent its roots along the face of the rock in all directions to seek for supplies and they lay like military lines of communication contorted twisted and knotted like the immense snakes of the indian archipelago as catharines look fell upon the curious complication of knotty branches and twisted roots she was suddenly sensible that two large eyes were visible among them fixed and glaring at her like those of a wild animal in ambush she started and without speaking pointed out the object to her companion and looking herself with more strict attention could at length trace out the bushy red hair and shaggy beard which had hitherto been concealed by the drooping branches and twisted roots of the tree  when he saw himself discovered the highlander for such he proved stepped forth from his lurking place and stalking forward displayed a colossal person clothed in a purple red and green checked plaid under which he wore a jacket of bulls hide his bow and arrows were at his back his head was bare and a large quantity of tangled locks like the glibbs of the irish served to cover the head and supplied all the purposes of a bonnet his belt bore a sword and dagger and he had in his hand a danish pole axe more recently called a lochaber axe through the same rude portal advanced one by one four men more of similar size and dressed and armed in the same manner  catharine was too much accustomed to the appearance of the inhabitants of the mountains so near to perth to permit herself to be alarmed as another lowland maiden might have been on the same occasion she saw with tolerable composure these gigantic forms arrange themselves in a semicircle around and in front of the monk and herself all bending upon them in silence their large fixed eyes expressing as far as she could judge a wild admiration of her beauty she inclined her head to them and uttered imperfectly the usual words of a highland salutation the elder and leader of the party returned the greeting and then again remained silent and motionless the monk told his beads and even catharine began to have strange fears for her personal safety and anxiety to know whether they were to consider themselves at personal freedom she resolved to make the experiment and moved forward as if to descend the hill but when she attempted to pass the line of highlanders they extended their poleaxes betwixt each other so as effectually to occupy each opening through which she could have passed  somewhat disconcerted yet not dismayed for she could not conceive that any evil was intended she sat down upon one of the scattered fragments of rock and bade the monk standing by her side be of good courage  if i fear said father clement it is not for myself for whether i be brained with the axes of these wild men like an ox when worn out by labour he is condemned to the slaughter or whether i am bound with their bowstrings and delivered over to those who will take my life with more cruel ceremony it can but little concern me if they suffer thee dearest daughter to escape uninjured  we have neither of us replied the maiden of perth any cause for apprehending evil and here comes conachar to assure us of it  yet as she spoke she almost doubted her own eyes so altered were the manner and attire of the handsome stately and almost splendidly dressed youth who springing like a roebuck from a cliff of considerable height lighted just in front of her his dress was of the same tartan worn by those who had first made their appearance but closed at the throat and elbows with a necklace and armlets of gold the hauberk which he wore over his person was of steel but so clearly burnished that it shone like silver his arms were profusely ornamented and his bonnet besides the eagles feather marking the quality of chief was adorned with a chain of gold wrapt several times around it and secured by a large clasp glistening with pearls his brooch by which the tartan mantle or plaid as it is now called was secured on the shoulder was also of gold large and curiously carved he bore no weapon in his hand excepting a small sapling stick with a hooked head his whole appearance and gait which used formerly to denote a sullen feeling of conscious degradation was now bold forward and haughty and he stood before catharine with smiling confidence as if fully conscious of his improved appearance and waiting till she should recognise him  conachar said catharine desirous to break this state of suspense are these your fathers men  no fair catharine answered the young man conachar is no more unless in regard to the wrongs he has sustained and the vengeance which they demand i am ian eachin macian son to the chief of the clan quhele i have moulted my feathers as you see when i changed my name and for these men they are not my fathers followers but mine you see only one half of them collected they form a band consisting of my foster father and eight sons who are my bodyguard and the children of my belt who breathe but to do my will but conachar he added in a softer tone of voice lives again so soon as catharine desires to see him and while he is the young chief of the clan quhele to all others he is to her as humble and obedient as when he was simon glovers apprentice see here is the stick i had from you when we nutted together in the sunny braes of lednoch when autumn was young in the year that is gone i would not exchange it catharine for the truncheon of my tribe  while eachin thus spoke catharine began to doubt in her own mind whether she had acted prudently in requesting the assistance of a bold young man elated doubtless by his sudden elevation from a state of servitude to one which she was aware gave him extensive authority over a very lawless body of adherents  you do not fear me fair catharine said the young chief taking her hand i suffered my people to appear before you for a few minutes that i might see how you could endure their presence and methinks you regarded them as if you were born to be a chieftains wife  i have no reason to fear wrong from highlanders said catharine firmly especially as i thought conachar was with them conachar has drunk of our cup and eaten of our bread and my father has often had traffic with highlanders and never was there wrong or quarrel betwixt him and them  no replied hector for such is the saxon equivalent for eachin what never when he took the part of the gow chrom the bandy legged smith against eachin macian say nothing to excuse it and believe it will be your own fault if i ever again allude to it but you had some command to lay upon me speak and you shall be obeyed  catharine hastened to reply for there was something in the young chiefs manner and language which made her desire to shorten the interview  eachin she said since conachar is no longer your name you ought to be sensible that in claiming as i honestly might a service from my equal i little thought that i was addressing a person of such superior power and consequence you as well as i have been obliged to the religious instruction of this good man he is now in great danger wicked men have accused him with false charges and he is desirous to remain in safety and concealment till the storm shall pass away  ha the good clerk clement ay the worthy clerk did much for me and more than my rugged temper was capable to profit by i will be glad to see any one in the town of perth persecute one who hath taken hold of macians mantle  it may not be safe to trust too much to that said catharine i nothing doubt the power of your tribe but when the black douglas takes up a feud he is not to be scared by the shaking of a highland plaid  the highlander disguised his displeasure at this speech with a forced laugh  the sparrow he said that is next the eye seems larger than the eagle that is perched on bengoile you fear the douglasses most because they sit next to you but be it as you will you will not believe how wide our hills and vales and forests extend beyond the dusky barrier of yonder mountains and you think all the world lies on the banks of the tay but this good clerk shall see hills that could hide him were all the douglasses on his questay and he shall see men enough also to make them glad to get once more southward of the grampians and wherefore should you not go with the good man i will send a party to bring him in safety from perth and we will set up the old trade beyond loch tayonly no more cutting out of gloves for me i will find your father in hides but i will not cut them save when they are on the creatures backs  my father will come one day and see your housekeeping conachari mean hector but times must be quieter for there is feud between the townspeople and the followers of the noblemen and there is speech of war about to break out in the highlands  yes by our lady catharine and were it not for that same highland war you should nor thus put off your highland visit my pretty mistress but the race of the hills are no longer to be divided into two nations they will fight like men for the supremacy and he who gets it will deal with the king of scotland as an equal not as a superior pray that the victory may fall to macian my pious st catharine for thou shalt pray for one who loves thee dearly  i will pray for the right said catharine or rather i will pray that there be peace on all sides farewell kind and excellent father clement believe i shall never forget thy lessons remember me in thy prayers but how wilt thou be able to sustain a journey so toilsome  they shall carry him if need be said hector if we go far without finding a horse for him but you catharineit is far from hence to perth let me attend you thither as i was wont  if you were as you were wont i would not refuse your escort but gold brooches and bracelets are perilous company when the liddesdale and annandale lancers are riding as throng upon the highway as the leaves at hallowmass and there is no safe meeting betwixt highland tartans and steel jackets  she hazarded this remark as she somewhat suspected that in casting his slough young eachin had not entirely surmounted the habits which he had acquired in his humbler state and that though he might use bold words he would not be rash enough to brave the odds of numbers to which a descent into the vicinity of the city would be likely to expose him it appeared that she judged correctly for after a farewell in which she compounded for the immunity of her lips by permitting him to kiss her hand she returned towards perth and could obtain at times when she looked back an occasional glance of the highlanders as winding through the most concealed and impracticable paths they bent their way towards the north  she felt in part relieved from her immediate anxiety as the distance increased betwixt her and these men whose actions were only directed by the will of their chief and whose chief was a giddy and impetuous boy she apprehended no insult on her return to perth from the soldiery of any party whom she might meet for the rules of chivalry were in those days a surer protection to a maiden of decent appearance than an escort of armed men whose cognizance might not be acknowledged as friendly by any other party whom they might chance to encounter but more remote dangers pressed on her apprehension the pursuit of the licentious prince was rendered formidable by threats which his unprincipled counsellor ramorny had not shunned to utter against her father if she persevered in her coyness these menaces in such an age and from such a character were deep grounds for alarm nor could she consider the pretensions to her favour which conachar had scarce repressed during his state of servitude and seemed now to avow boldly as less fraught with evil since there had been repeated incursions of the highlanders into the very town of perth and citizens had on more occasions than one been made prisoners and carried off from their own houses or had fallen by the claymore in the very streets of their city she feared too her fathers importunity on behalf of the smith of whose conduct on st valentines day unworthy reports had reached her and whose suit had he stood clear in her good opinion she dared not listen to while ramornys threats of revenge upon her father rung on her ear she thought on these various dangers with the deepest apprehension and an earnest desire to escape from them and herself by taking refuge in the cloister but saw no possibility of obtaining her fathers consent to the only course from which she expected peace and protection  in the course of these reflections we cannot discover that she very distinctly regretted that her perils attended her because she was the fair maid of perth this was one point which marked that she was not yet altogether an angel and perhaps it was another that in despite of henry smiths real or supposed delinquencies a sigh escaped from her bosom when she thought upon st valentines dawn    chapter xv       oh for a draught of power to steep      the soul of agony in sleep       bertha   we have shown the secrets of the confessional those of the sick chamber are not hidden from us the darkened apartment where salves and medicines showed that the leech had been busy in his craft a tall thin form lay on a bed arrayed in a nightgown belted around him with pain on his brow and a thousand stormy passions agitating his bosom everything in the apartment indicated a man of opulence and of expense henbane dwining the apothecary who seemed to have the care of the patient stole with a crafty and catlike step from one corner of the room to another busying himself with mixing medicines and preparing dressings the sick man groaned once or twice on which the leech advancing to his bedside asked whether these sounds were a token of the pain of his body or of the distress of his mind  of both thou poisoning varlet said sir john ramorny and of being encumbered with thy accursed company  if that is all i can relieve your knighthood of one of these ills by presently removing myself elsewhere thanks to the feuds of this boisterous time had i twenty hands instead of these two poor servants of my art displaying his skinny palms there is enough of employment for themwell requited employment too where thanks and crowns contend which shall best pay my services while you sir john wreak upon your chirurgeon the anger you ought only to bear against the author of your wound  villain it is beneath me to reply to thee said the patient but every word of thy malignant tongue is a dirk inflicting wounds which set all the medicines of arabia at defiance  sir john i understand you not but if you give way to these tempestuous fits of rage it is impossible but fever and inflammation must be the result  why then dost thou speak in a sense to chafe my blood why dost thou name the supposition of thy worthless self having more hands than nature gave thee while i a knight and gentleman am mutilated like a cripple  sir john replied the chirurgeon i am no divine nor a mainly obstinate believer in some things which divines tell us yet i may remind you that you have been kindly dealt with for if the blow which has done you this injury had lighted on your neck as it was aimed it would have swept your head from your shoulders instead of amputating a less considerable member  i wish it had dwiningi wish it had lighted as it was addressed i should not then have seen a policy which had spun a web so fine as mine burst through by the brute force of a drunken churl i should not have been reserved to see horses which i must not mount lists which i must no longer enter splendours which i cannot hope to share or battles which i must not take part in i should not with a mans passions for power and for strife be set to keep place among the women despised by them too as a miserable impotent cripple unable to aim at obtaining the favour of the sex  supposing all this to be so i will yet pray of your knighthood to remark replied dwining still busying himself with arranging the dressings of the wounds that your eyes which you must have lost with your head may being spared to you present as rich a prospect of pleasure as either ambition or victory in the list or in the field or the love of woman itself could have proposed to you  my sense is too dull to catch thy meaning leech replied ramorny what is this precious spectacle reserved to me in such a shipwreck  the dearest that mankind knows replied dwining and then in the accent of a lover who utters the name of his beloved mistress and expresses his passion for her in the very tone of his voice he added the word revenge  the patient had raised himself on his couch to listen with some anxiety for the solution of the physicians enigma he laid himself down again as he heard it explained and after a short pause asked in what christian college learned you this morality good master dwining  in no christian college answered his physician for though it is privately received in most it is openly and manfully adopted in none but i have studied among the sages of granada where the fiery souled moor lifts high his deadly dagger as it drops with his enemys blood and avows the doctrine which the pallid christian practises though cowardlike he dare not name it  thou art then a more high souled villain than i deemed thee said ramorny  let that pass answered dwining the waters that are the stillest are also the deepest and the foe is most to be dreaded who never threatens till he strikes you knights and men at arms go straight to your purpose with sword in hand we who are clerks win our access with a noiseless step and an indirect approach but attain our object not less surely  and i said the knight who have trod to my revenge with a mailed foot which made all echo around it must now use such a slipper as thineha  he who lacks strength said the wily mediciner must attain his purpose by skill  and tell me sincerely mediciner wherefore thou wouldst read me these devils lessons why wouldst thou thrust me faster or farther on to my vengeance than i may seem to thee ready to go of my own accord i am old in the ways of the world man and i know that such as thou do not drop words in vain or thrust themselves upon the dangerous confidence of men like me save with the prospect of advancing some purpose of their own what interest hast thou in the road whether peaceful or bloody which i may pursue on these occurrents  in plain dealing sir knight though it is what i seldom use answered the leech my road to revenge is the same with yours  with mine man said ramorny with a tone of scornful surprise i thought it had been high beyond thy reach thou aim at the same revenge with ramorny  ay truly replied dwining for the smithy churl under whose blow you have suffered has often done me despite and injury he has thwarted me in counsel and despised me in action his brutal and unhesitating bluntness is a living reproach to the subtlety of my natural disposition i fear him and i hate him  and you hope to hind an active coadjutor in me said ramorny in the same supercilious tone as before but know the artisan fellow is too low in degree to be to me either the object of hatred or of fear yet he shall not escape we hate not the reptile that has stung us though we might shake it off the wound and tread upon it i know the ruffian of old as a stout man at arms and a pretender as i have heard to the favour of the scornful puppet whose beauties forsooth spurred us to our wise and hopeful attempt fiends that direct this nether world by what malice have ye decided that the hand which has couched a lance against the bosom of a prince should be struck off like a sapling by the blow of a churl and during the turmoil of a midnight riot well mediciner thus far our courses hold together and i bid thee well believe that i will crush for thee this reptile mechanic but do not thou think to escape me when that part of my revenge is done which will be most easily and speedily accomplished  not it may be altogether so easily accomplished said the apothecary for if your knighthood will credit me there will be found small ease or security in dealing with him he is the strongest boldest and most skilful swordsman in perth and all the country around it  fear nothing he shall be met with had he the strength of sampson but then mark me hope not thou to escape my vengeance unless thou become my passive agent in the scene which is to follow mark me i say once more i have studied at no moorish college and lack some of thy unbounded appetite for revenge but yet i will have my share of vengeance listen to me mediciner while i shall thus far unfold myself but beware of treachery for powerful as thy fiend is thou hast taken lessons from a meaner devil than mine hearkenthe master whom i have served through vice and virtue with too much zeal for my own character perhaps but with unshaken fidelity to himthe very man to soothe whose frantic folly i have incurred this irreparable loss is at the prayer of his doating father about to sacrifice me by turning me out of his favour and leaving me at the mercy of the hypocritical relative with whom he seeks a precarious reconciliation at my expense if he perseveres in this most ungrateful purpose thy fiercest moors were their complexion swarthy as the smoke of hell shall blush to see their revenge outdone but i will give him one more chance for honour and safety before my wrath shall descend on him in unrelenting and unmitigated fury there then thus far thou hast my confidence close hands on our bargain close hands did i say where is the hand that should be the pledge and representative of ramornys plighted word is it nailed on the public pillory or flung as offal to the houseless dogs who are even now snarling over it lay thy finger on the mutilated stump then and swear to be a faithful actor in my revenge as i shall be in yours how now sir leech look you paleyou who say to death stand back or advance can you tremble to think of him or to hear him named i have not mentioned your fee for one who loves revenge for itself requires no deeper bribe yet if broad lands and large sums of gold can increase thy zeal in a brave cause believe me these shall not be lacking  they tell for something in my humble wishes said dwining the poor man in this bustling world is thrust down like a dwarf in a crowd and so trodden under foot the rich and powerful rise like giants above the press and are at ease while all is turmoil around them  then shalt thou arise above the press mediciner as high as gold can raise thee this purse is weighty yet it is but an earnest of thy guerdon  and this smith my noble benefactor said the leech as he pouched the gratuitythis henry of the wynd or what ever is his namewould not the news that he hath paid the penalty of his action assuage the pain of thy knighthoods wound better than the balm of mecca with which i have salved it  he is beneath the thoughts of ramorny and i have no more resentment against him than i have ill will at the senseless weapon which he swayed but it is just thy hate should be vented upon him where is he chiefly to be met with  that also i have considered said dwining to make the attempt by day in his own house were too open and dangerous for he hath five servants who work with him at the stithy four of them strong knaves and all loving to their master by night were scarce less desperate for he hath his doors strongly secured with bolt of oak and bar of iron and ere the fastenings of his house could be forced the neighbourhood would rise to his rescue especially as they are still alarmed by the practice on st valentines even  oh ay true mediciner said ramorny for deceit is thy nature even with me thou knewest my hand and signet as thou saidst when that hand was found cast out on the street like the disgusting refuse of a shambleswhy having such knowledge wentst thou with these jolterheaded citizens to consult that patrick charteris whose spurs should be hacked off from his heels for the communion which he holds with paltry burghers and whom thou broughtst here with the fools to do dishonour to the lifeless hand which had it held its wonted place he was not worthy to have touched in peace or faced in war  my noble patron as soon as i had reason to know you had been the sufferer i urged them with all my powers of persuasion to desist from prosecuting the feud but the swaggering smith and one or two other hot heads cried out for vengeance your knighthood must know this fellow calls himself bachelor to the fair maiden of perth and stands upon his honour to follow up her fathers quarrel but i have forestalled his market in that quarter and that is something in earnest of revenge  how mean you by that sir leech said the patient  your knighthood shall conceive said the mediciner that this smith doth not live within compass but is an outlier and a galliard i met him myself on st valentines day shortly after the affray between the townsfolk and the followers of douglas yes i met him sneaking through the lanes and bye passages with a common minstrel wench with her messan and her viol on his one arm and her buxom self hanging upon the other what thinks your honour is not this a trim squire to cross a princes love with the fairest girl in perth strike off the hand of a knight and baron and become gentleman usher to a strolling glee woman all in the course of the same four and twenty hours  marry i think the better of him that he has so much of a gentlemans humour clown though he be said ramorny i would he had been a precisian instead of a galliard and i should have had better heart to aid thy revenge and such revengerevenge on a smithin the quarrel of a pitiful manufacturer of rotten cheverons pah and yet it shall be taken in full thou hast commenced it i warrant me by thine own manoeuvres  in a small degree only said the apothecary i took care that two or three of the most notorious gossips in curfew street who liked not to hear catharine called the fair maid of perth should be possessed of this story of her faithful valentine they opened on the scent so keenly that rather than doubt had fallen on the tale they would have vouched for it as if their own eyes had seen it the lover came to her fathers within an hour after and your worship may think what a reception he had from the angry glover for the damsel herself would not be looked upon and thus your honour sees i had a foretaste of revenge but i trust to receive the full draught from the hands of your lordship with whom i am in a brotherly league which  brotherly said the knight contemptuously but be it so the priests say we are all of one common earth i cannot tell there seems to me some difference but the better mould shall keep faith with the baser and thou shalt have thy revenge call thou my page hither  a young man made his appearance from the anteroom upon the physicians summons  eviot said the knight does bonthron wait and is he sober  he is as sober as sleep can make him after a deep drink answered the page  then fetch him hither and do thou shut the door  a heavy step presently approached the apartment and a man entered whose deficiency of height seemed made up in breadth of shoulders and strength of arm  there is a man thou must deal upon bonthron said the knight the man smoothed his rugged features and grinned a smile of satisfaction  that mediciner will show thee the party take such advantage of time place and circumstance as will ensure the result and mind you come not by the worst for the man is the fighting smith of the wynd  it will be a tough job growled the assassin for if i miss my blow i may esteem myself but a dead man all perth rings with the smiths skill and strength  take two assistants with thee said the knight  not i said bonthron if you double anything let it be the reward  account it doubled said his master but see thy work be thoroughly executed  trust me for that sir knight seldom have i failed  use this sage mans directions said the wounded knight pointing to the physician and hark thee await his coming forth and drink not till the business be done  i will not answered the dark satellite my own life depends on my blow being steady and sure i know whom i have to deal with  vanish then till he summons you and have axe and dagger in readiness  bonthron nodded and withdrew  will your knighthood venture to entrust such an act to a single hand said the mediciner when the assassin had left the room may i pray you to remember that yonder party did two nights since baffle six armed men  question me not sir mediciner a man like bonthron who knows time and place is worth a score of confused revellers call eviot thou shalt first exert thy powers of healing and do not doubt that thou shalt in the farther work be aided by one who will match thee in the art of sudden and unexpected destruction  the page eviot again appeared at the mediciners summons and at his masters sign assisted the chirurgeon in removing the dressings from sir john ramornys wounded arm dwining viewed the naked stump with a species of professional satisfaction enhanced no doubt by the malignant pleasure which his evil disposition took in the pain and distress of his fellow creatures the knight just turned his eye on the ghastly spectacle and uttered under the pressure of bodily pain or mental agony a groan which he would fain have repressed  you groan sir said the leech in his soft insinuating tone of voice but with a sneer of enjoyment mixed with scorn curling upon his lip which his habitual dissimulation could not altogether disguiseyou groan but be comforted this henry smith knows his business his sword is as true to its aim as his hammer to the anvil had a common swordsman struck this fatal blow he had harmed the bone and damaged the muscles so that even my art might not have been able to repair them but henry smiths cut is clean and as sure as that with which my own scalpel could have made the amputation in a few days you will be able with care and attention to the ordinances of medicine to stir abroad  but my handthe loss of my hand  it may be kept secret for a time said the mediciner i have possessed two or three tattling fools in deep confidence that the hand which was found was that of your knighthoods groom black quentin and your knighthood knows that he has parted for fife in such sort as to make it generally believed  i know well enough said ramorny that the rumour may stifle the truth for a short time but what avails this brief delay  it may be concealed till your knighthood retires for a time from the court and then when new accidents have darkened the recollection of the present stir it may be imputed to a wound received from the shivering of a spear or from a crossbow bolt your slave will find a suitable device and stand for the truth of it  the thought maddens me said ramorny with another groan of mental and bodily agony yet i see no better remedy  there is none other said the leech to whose evil nature his patrons distress was delicious nourishment in the mean while it is believed you are confined by the consequences of some bruises aiding the sense of displeasure at the princes having consented to dismiss you from his household at the remonstrance of albany which is publicly known  villain thou rackst me exclaimed the patient  upon the whole therefore said dwining your knighthood has escaped well and saving the lack of your hand a mischance beyond remedy you ought rather to rejoice than complain for no barber chirurgeon in france or england could have more ably performed the operation than this churl with one downright blow  i understand my obligation fully said ramorny struggling with his anger and affecting composure and if bonthron pays him not with a blow equally downright and rendering the aid of the leech unnecessary say that john of ramorny cannot requite an obligation  that is spoke like yourself noble knight answered the mediciner and let me further say that the operators skill must have been vain and the hemorrhage must have drained your life veins but for the bandages the cautery and the styptics applied by the good monks and the poor services of your humble vassal henbane dwining  peace exclaimed the patient with thy ill omened voice and worse omened name methinks as thou mentionest the tortures i have undergone my tingling nerves stretch and contract themselves as if they still actuated the fingers that once could clutch a dagger  that explained the leech may it please your knighthood is a phenomenon well known to our profession there have been those among the ancient sages who have thought that there still remained a sympathy between the severed nerves and those belonging to the amputated limb and that the several fingers are seen to quiver and strain as corresponding with the impulse which proceeds from their sympathy with the energies of the living system could we recover the hand from the cross or from the custody of the black douglas i would be pleased to observe this wonderful operation of occult sympathies but i fear me one might as safely go to wrest the joint from the talons of an hungry eagle  and thou mayst as safely break thy malignant jests on a wounded lion as on john of ramorny said the knight raising himself in uncontrollable indignation caitiff proceed to thy duty and remember that if my hand can no longer clasp a dagger i can command an hundred  the sight of one drawn and brandished in anger were sufficient said dwining to consume the vital powers of your chirurgeon but who then he added in a tone partly insinuating partly jeeringwho would then relieve the fiery and scorching pain which my patron now suffers and which renders him exasperated even with his poor servant for quoting the rules of healing so contemptible doubtless compared with the power of inflicting wounds  then as daring no longer to trifle with the mood of his dangerous patient the leech addressed himself seriously to salving the wound and applied a fragrant balm the odour of which was diffused through the apartment while it communicated a refreshing coolness instead of the burning heata change so gratifying to the fevered patient that as he had before groaned with agony he could not now help sighing for pleasure as he sank back on his couch to enjoy the ease which the dressing bestowed  your knightly lordship now knows who is your friend said dwining had you yielded to a rash impulse and said slay me this worthless quacksalver where within the four seas of britain would you have found the man to have ministered to you as much comfort  forget my threats good leech said ramorny and beware how you tempt me such as i brook not jests upon our agony see thou keep thy scoffs to pass upon misers that is miserable persons as used in spenser and other writers of his time though the sense is now restricted to those who are covetous in the hospital  dwining ventured to say no more but poured some drops from a phial which he took from his pocket into a small cup of wine allayed with water  this draught said the man of art is medicated to produce a sleep which must not be interrupted  for how long will it last asked the knight  the period of its operation is uncertainperhaps till morning  perhaps for ever said the patient sir mediciner taste me that liquor presently else it passes not my lips  the leech obeyed him with a scornful smile i would drink the whole with readiness but the juice of this indian gum will bring sleep on the healthy man as well as upon the patient and the business of the leech requires me to be a watcher  i crave your pardon sir leech said ramorny looking downwards as if ashamed to have manifested suspicion  there is no room for pardon where offence must not be taken answered the mediciner an insect must thank a giant that he does not tread on him yet noble knight insects have their power of harming as well as physicians what would it have cost me save a moments trouble so to have drugged that balm as should have made your arm rot to the shoulder joint and your life blood curdle in your veins to a corrupted jelly what is there that prevented me to use means yet more subtle and to taint your room with essences before which the light of life twinkles more and more dimly till it expires like a torch amidst the foul vapours of some subterranean dungeon you little estimate my power if you know not that these and yet deeper modes of destruction stand at command of my art but a physician slays not the patient by whose generosity he lives and far less will he the breath of whose nostrils is the hope of revenge destroy the vowed ally who is to favour his pursuit of it yet one word should a necessity occur for rousing yourselffor who in scotland can promise himself eight hours uninterrupted reposethen smell at the strong essence contained in this pouncet box and now farewell sir knight and if you cannot think of me as a man of nice conscience acknowledge me at least as one of reason and of judgment  so saying the mediciner left the room his usual mean and shuffling gait elevating itself into something more noble as conscious of a victory over his imperious patient  sir john ramorny remained sunk in unpleasing reflections until he began to experience the incipient effects of his soporific draught he then roused himself for an instant and summoned his page  eviot what ho eviot i have done ill to unbosom myself so far to this poisonous quacksalver eviot  the page entered  is the mediciner gone forth  yes so please your knighthood  alone or accompanied  bonthron spoke apart with him and followed him almost immediatelyby your lordships command as i understood him  lackaday yes he goes to seek some medicaments he will return anon if he be intoxicated see he comes not near my chamber and permit him not to enter into converse with any one he raves when drink has touched his brain he was a rare fellow before a southron bill laid his brain pan bare but since that time he talks gibberish whenever the cup has crossed his lips said the leech aught to you eviot  nothing save to reiterate his commands that your honour be not disturbed  which thou must surely obey said the knight i feel the summons to rest of which i have been deprived since this unhappy wound at least if i have slept it has been but for a snatch aid me to take off my gown eviot  may god and the saints send you good rest my lord said the page retiring after he had rendered his wounded master the assistance required  as eviot left the room the knight whose brain was becoming more and more confused muttered over the pages departing salutation  godsaintsi have slept sound under such a benison but now methinks if i awake not to the accomplishment of my proud hopes of power and revenge the best wish for me is that the slumbers which now fall around my head were the forerunners of that sleep which shall return my borrowed powers to their original nonexistencei can argue it no farther  thus speaking he fell into a profound sleep    chapter xvi       on fasterns een when we war fou       scots song   the night which sunk down on the sickbed of ramorny was not doomed to be a quiet one two hours had passed since curfew bell then rung at seven oclock at night and in those primitive times all were retired to rest excepting such whom devotion or duty or debauchery made watchers and the evening being that of shrovetide or as it was called in scotland fasterns een the vigils of gaiety were by far the most frequented of the three  the common people had throughout the day toiled and struggled at football the nobles and gentry had fought cocks and hearkened to the wanton music of the minstrel while the citizens had gorged themselves upon pancakes fried in lard and brose or brewisthe fat broth that is in which salted beef had been boiled poured upon highly toasted oatmeal a dish which even now is not ungrateful to simple old fashioned scottish palates these were all exercises and festive dishes proper to the holiday it was no less a solemnity of the evening that the devout catholic should drink as much good ale and wine as he had means to procure and if young and able that he should dance at the ring or figure among the morrice dancers who in the city of perth as elsewhere wore a peculiarly fantastic garb and distinguished themselves by their address and activity all this gaiety took place under the prudential consideration that the long term of lent now approaching with its fasts and deprivations rendered it wise for mortals to cram as much idle and sensual indulgence as they could into the brief space which intervened before its commencement  the usual revels had taken place and in most parts of the city were succeeded by the usual pause a particular degree of care had been taken by the nobility to prevent any renewal of discord betwixt their followers and the citizens of the town so that the revels had proceeded with fewer casualties than usual embracing only three deaths and certain fractured limbs which occurring to individuals of little note were not accounted worth inquiring into the carnival was closing quietly in general but in some places the sport was still kept up  one company of revellers who had been particularly noticed and applauded seemed unwilling to conclude their frolic the entry as it was called consisted of thirteen persons habited in the same manner having doublets of chamois leather sitting close to their bodies curiously slashed and laced they wore green caps with silver tassels red ribands and white shoes had bells hung at their knees and around their ankles and naked swords in their hands this gallant party having exhibited a sword dance before the king with much clashing of weapons and fantastic interchange of postures went on gallantly to repeat their exhibition before the door of simon glover where having made a fresh exhibition of their agility they caused wine to be served round to their own company and the bystanders and with a loud shout drank to the health of the fair maid of perth this summoned old simon to the door of his habitation to acknowledge the courtesy of his countrymen and in his turn to send the wine around in honour of the merry morrice dancers of perth  we thank thee father simon said a voice which strove to drown in an artificial squeak the pert conceited tone of oliver proudfute but a sight of thy lovely daughter had been more sweet to us young bloods than a whole vintage of malvoisie  i thank thee neighbours for your goodwill replied the glover my daughter is ill at ease and may not come forth into the cold night air but if this gay gallant whose voice methinks i should know will go into my poor house she will charge him with thanks for the rest of you  bring them to us at the hostelrie of the griffin cried the rest of the ballet to their favoured companion for there will we ring in lent and have another rouse to the health of the lovely catharine  have with you in half an hour said oliver and see who will quaff the largest flagon or sing the loudest glee nay i will be merry in what remains of fasterns even should lent find me with my mouth closed for ever  farewell then cried his mates in the morricefare well slashing bonnet maker till we meet again  the morrice dancers accordingly set out upon their further progress dancing and carolling as they went along to the sound of four musicians who led the joyous band while simon glover drew their coryphaeus into his house and placed him in a chair by his parlour fire  but where is your daughter said oliver she is the bait for us brave blades  why truly she keeps her apartment neighbour oliver and to speak plainly she keeps her bed  why then will i upstairs to see her in her sorrow you have marred my ramble gaffer glover and you owe me amendsa roving blade like me i will not lose both the lass and the glass keeps her bed does she       my dog and i we have a trick      to visit maids when they are sick      when they are sick and like to die      oh thither do come my dog and i       and when i die as needs must hap      then bury me under the good ale tap      with folded arms there let me lie      cheek for jowl my dog and i  canst thou not be serious for a moment neighbour proudfute said the glover i want a word of conversation with you  serious answered his visitor why i have been serious all this day i can hardly open my mouth but something comes out about death a burial or suchlikethe most serious subjects that i wot of  st john man said the glover art then fey  no not a whit it is not my own death which these gloomy fancies foretell i have a strong horoscope and shall live for fifty years to come but it is the case of the poor fellowthe douglas man whom i struck down at the fray of st valentines he died last night it is that which weighs on my conscience and awakens sad fancies ah father simon we martialists that have spilt blood in our choler have dark thoughts at times i sometimes wish that my knife had cut nothing but worsted thrums  and i wish said simon that mine had cut nothing but bucks leather for it has sometimes cut my own fingers but thou mayst spare thy remorse for this bout there was but one man dangerously hurt at the affray and it was he from whom henry smith hewed the hand and he is well recovered his name is black quentin one of sir john ramornys followers he has been sent privately back to his own country of fife  what black quentin why that is the very man that henry and i as we ever keep close together struck at in the same moment only my blow fell somewhat earlier i fear further feud will come of it and so does the provost and is he recovered why then i will be jovial and since thou wilt not let me see how kate becomes her night gear i will back to the griffin to my morrice dancers  nay stay but one instant thou art a comrade of henry wynd and hast done him the service to own one or two deeds and this last among others i would thou couldst clear him of other charges with which fame hath loaded him  nay i will swear by the hilt of my sword they are as false as hell father simon whatblades and targets shall not men of the sword stick together  nay neighbour bonnet maker be patient thou mayst do the smith a kind turn an thou takest this matter the right way i have chosen thee to consult with anent this matternot that i hold thee the wisest head in perth for should i say so i should lie  ayay answered the self satisfied bonnet maker i know where you think my fault lies you cool heads think we hot heads are foolsi have heard men call henry wynd such a score of times  fool enough and cool enough may rhyme together passing well said the glover but thou art good natured and i think lovest this crony of thine it stands awkwardly with us and him just now continued simon thou knowest there hath been some talk of marriage between my daughter catharine and henry gow  i have heard some such song since st valentines morn ah he that shall win the fair maid of perth must be a happy man and yet marriage spoils many a pretty fellow i myself somewhat regret  prithee truce with thy regrets for the present man interrupted the glover somewhat peevishly you must know oliver that some of these talking women who i think make all the business of the world their own have accused henry of keeping light company with glee women and suchlike catharine took it to heart and i held my child insulted that he had not waited upon her like a valentine but had thrown himself into unseemly society on the very day when by ancient custom he might have had an opportunity to press his interest with my daughter therefore when he came hither late on the evening of st valentines i like a hasty old fool bid him go home to the company he had left and denied him admittance i have not seen him since and i begin to think that i may have been too rash in the matter she is my only child and the grave should have her sooner than a debauchee but i have hitherto thought i knew henry gow as if he were my son i cannot think he would use us thus and it may be there are means of explaining what is laid to his charge i was led to ask dwining who is said to have saluted the smith while he was walking with this choice mate if i am to believe his words this wench was the smiths cousin joan letham but thou knowest that the potter carrier ever speaks one language with his visage and another with his tongue now thou oliver hast too little witi mean too much honestyto belie the truth and as dwining hinted that thou also hadst seen her  i see her simon glover will dwining say that i saw her  no not precisely that but he says you told him you had met the smith thus accompanied  he lies and i will pound him into a gallipot said oliver proudfute  how did you never tell him then of such a meeting  what an if i did said the bonnet maker did not he swear that he would never repeat again to living mortal what i communicated to him and therefore in telling the occurrent to you he hath made himself a liar  thou didst not meet the smith then said simon with such a loose baggage as fame reports  lackaday not i perhaps i did perhaps i did not think father simoni have been a four years married man and can you expect me to remember the turn of a glee womans ankle the trip of her toe the lace upon her petticoat and such toys no i leave that to unmarried wags like my gossip henry  the upshot is then said the glover much vexed you did meet him on st valentines day walking the public streets  not so neighbour i met him in the most distant and dark lane in perth steering full for his own house with bag and baggage which as a gallant fellow he carried in his arms the puppy dog on one and the jilt herselfand to my thought she was a pretty onehanging upon the other  now by good st john said the glover this infamy would make a christian man renounce his faith and worship mahound in very anger but he has seen the last of my daughter i would rather she went to the wild highlands with a barelegged cateran than wed with one who could at such a season so broadly forget honour and decency out upon him  tushtush father simon said the liberal minded bonnet maker you consider not the nature of young blood their company was not long forto speak truth i did keep a little watch on himi met him before sunrise conducting his errant damsel to the ladys stairs that the wench might embark on the tay from perth and i know for certainty for i made inquiry that she sailed in a gabbart for dundee so you see it was but a slight escape of youth  and he came here said simon bitterly beseeching for admittance to my daughter while he had his harlot awaiting him at home i had rather he had slain a score of men it skills not talking least of all to thee oliver proudfute who if thou art not such a one as himself would fain be thought so but  nay think not of it so seriously said oliver who began to reflect on the mischief his tattling was likely to occasion to his friend and on the consequences of henry gows displeasure when he should learn the disclosure which he had made rather in vanity of heart than in evil intention  consider he continued that there are follies belonging to youth occasion provokes men to such frolics and confession wipes them off i care not if i tell thee that though my wife be as goodly a woman as the city has yet i myself  peace silly braggart said the glover in high wrath thy loves and thy battles are alike apocryphal if thou must needs lie which i think is thy nature canst thou invent no falsehood that may at least do thee some credit do i not see through thee as i could see the light through the horn of a base lantern do i not know thou filthy weaver of rotten worsted that thou durst no more cross the threshold of thy own door if thy wife heard of thy making such a boast than thou darest cross naked weapons with a boy of twelve years old who has drawn a sword for the first time of his life by st john it were paying you for your tale bearing trouble to send thy maudie word of thy gay brags  the bonnet maker at this threat started as if a crossbow bolt had whizzed past his head when least expected and it was with a trembling voice that he replied nay good father glover thou takest too much credit for thy grey hairs consider good neighbour thou art too old for a young martialist to wrangle with and in the matter of my maudie i can trust thee for i know no one who would be less willing than thou to break the peace of families  trust thy coxcomb no longer with me said the incensed glover but take thyself and the thing thou callst a head out of my reach lest i borrow back five minutes of my youth and break thy pate  you have had a merry fasterns even neighbour said the bonnet maker and i wish you a quiet sleep we shall meet better friends tomorrow  out of my doors tonight said the glover i am ashamed so idle a tongue as thine should have power to move me thus  idiotbeastloose tongued coxcomb he exclaimed throwing himself into a chair as the bonnet maker disappeared that a fellow made up of lies should not have had the grace to frame one when it might have covered the shame of a friend and iwhat am i that i should in my secret mind wish that such a gross insult to me and my child had been glossed over yet such was my opinion of henry that i would have willingly believed the grossest figment the swaggering ass could have invented well it skills not thinking of it our honest name must be maintained though everything else should go to ruin  while the glover thus moralised on the unwelcome confirmation of the tale he wished to think untrue the expelled morrice dancer had leisure in the composing air of a cool and dark february night to meditate on the consequences of the glovers unrestrained anger  but it is nothing he bethought himself to the wrath of henry wynd who hath killed a man for much less than placing displeasure betwixt him and catharine as well as her fiery old father certainly i were better have denied everything but the humour of seeming a knowing gallant as in truth i am fairly overcame me were i best go to finish the revel at the griffin but then maudie will rampauge on my returnay and this being holiday even i may claim a privilege i have it i will not to the griffini will to the smiths who must be at home since no one hath seen him this day amid the revel i will endeavour to make peace with him and offer my intercession with the glover harry is a simple downright fellow and though i think he is my better in a broil yet in discourse i can turn him my own way the streets are now quiet the night too is dark and i may step aside if i meet any rioters i will to the smiths and securing him for my friend i care little for old simon st ringan bear me well through this night and i will clip my tongue out ere it shall run my head into such peril again yonder old fellow when his blood was up looked more like a carver of buff jerkins than a clipper of kid gloves  with these reflections the puissant oliver walked swiftly yet with as little noise as possible towards the wynd in which the smith as our readers are aware had his habitation but his evil fortune had not ceased to pursue him as he turned into the high or principal street he heard a burst of music very near him followed by a loud shout  my merry mates the morrice dancers thought he i would know old jeremys rebeck among an hundred i will venture across the street ere they pass on if i am espied i shall have the renown of some private quest which may do me honour as a roving blade  with these longings for distinction among the gay and gallant combated however internally by more prudential considerations the bonnet maker made an attempt to cross the street but the revellers whoever they might be were accompanied by torches the flash of which fell upon oliver whose light coloured habit made him the more distinctly visible the general shout of a prizea prize overcame the noise of the minstrel and before the bonnet maker could determine whether it were better to stand or fly two active young men clad in fantastic masking habits resembling wild men and holding great clubs seized upon him saying in a tragical tone yield thee man of bells and bombastyield thee rescue or no rescue or truly thou art but a dead morrice dancer  to whom shall i yield me said the bonnet maker with a faltering voice for though he saw he had to do with a party of mummers who were afoot for pleasure yet he observed at the same time that they were far above his class and he lost the audacity necessary to support his part in a game where the inferior was likely to come by the worst  dost thou parley slave answered one of the maskers and must i show thee that thou art a captive by giving thee incontinently the bastinado  by no means puissant man of ind said the bonnet maker lo i am conformable to your pleasure  come then said those who had arrested himcome and do homage to the emperor of mimes king of caperers and grand duke of the dark hours and explain by what right thou art so presumptuous as to prance and jingle and wear out shoe leather within his dominions without paying him tribute knowst thou not thou hast incurred the pains of high treason  that were hard methinks said poor oliver since i knew not that his grace exercised the government this evening but i am willing to redeem the forfeit if the purse of a poor bonnet maker may by the mulct of a gallon of wine or some such matter  bring him before the emperor was the universal cry and the morrice dancer was placed before a slight but easy and handsome figure of a young man splendidly attired having a cincture and tiara of peacocks feathers then brought from the east as a marvellous rarity a short jacket and under dress of leopards skin fitted closely the rest of his person which was attired in flesh coloured silk so as to resemble the ordinary idea of an indian prince he wore sandals fastened on with ribands of scarlet silk and held in his hand a sort of fan such as ladies then used composed of the same feathers assembled into a plume or tuft  what mister wight have we here said the indian chief who dares to tie the bells of a morrice on the ankles of a dull ass hark ye friend your dress should make you a subject of ours since our empire extends over all merryland including mimes and minstrels of every description what tongue tied he lacks wine minister to him our nutshell full of sack  a huge calabash full of sack was offered to the lips of the supplicant while this prince of revellers exhorted him  crack me this nut and do it handsomely and without wry faces  but however oliver might have relished a moderate sip of the same good wine he was terrified at the quantity he was required to deal with he drank a draught and then entreated for mercy  so please your princedom i have yet far to go and if i were to swallow your graces bounty for which accept my dutiful thanks i should not be able to stride over the next kennel  art thou in case to bear thyself like a galliard now cut me a caperha onetwothreeadmirable againgive him the spur here a satellite of the indian gave oliver a slight touch with his sword nay that is best of all he sprang like a cat in a gutter tender him the nut once more nay no compulsion he has paid forfeit and deserves not only free dismissal but reward kneel downkneel and arise sir knight of the calabash what is thy name and one of you lend me a rapier  oliver may it please your honouri mean your principality  oliver man nay then thou art one of the douze peers already and fate has forestalled our intended promotion yet rise up sweet sir oliver thatchpate knight of the honourable order of the pumpkinrise up in the name of nonsense and begone about thine own concerns and the devil go with thee  so saying the prince of the revels bestowed a smart blow with the flat of the weapon across the bonnet makers shoulders who sprung to his feet with more alacrity of motion than he had hitherto displayed and accelerated by the laugh and halloo which arose behind him arrived at the smiths house before he stopped with the same speed with which a hunted fox makes for his den  it was not till the affrighted bonnet maker had struck a blow on the door that he recollected he ought to have bethought himself beforehand in what manner he was to present himself before henry and obtain his forgiveness for his rash communications to simon glover no one answered to his first knock and perhaps as these reflections arose in the momentary pause of recollection which circumstances permitted the perplexed bonnet maker might have flinched from his purpose and made his retreat to his own premises without venturing upon the interview which he had purposed but a distant strain of minstrelsy revived his apprehensions of falling once more into the hands of the gay maskers from whom he had escaped and he renewed his summons on the door of the smiths dwelling with a hurried though faltering hand he was then appalled by the deep yet not unmusical voice of henry gow who answered from within who calls at this hour and what is it that you want  it is ioliver proudfute replied the bonnet maker i have a merry jest to tell you gossip henry  carry thy foolery to some other market i am in no jesting humour said henry go hence i will see no one tonight  but gossipgood gossip answered the martialist with out i am beset with villains and beg the shelter of your roof  fool that thou art replied henry no dunghill cock the most recreant that has fought this fasterns eve would ruffle his feathers at such a craven as thou  at this moment another strain of minstrelsy and as the bonnet maker conceited one which approached much nearer goaded his apprehensions to the uttermost and in a voice the tones of which expressed the undisguised extremity of instant fear he exclaimed  for the sake of our old gossipred and for the love of our blessed lady admit me henry if you would not have me found a bloody corpse at thy door slain by the bloody minded douglasses  that would be a shame to me thought the good natured smith and sooth to say his peril may be real there are roving hawks that will strike at a sparrow as soon as a heron  with these reflections half muttered half spoken henry undid his well fastened door proposing to reconnoitre the reality of the danger before he permitted his unwelcome guest to enter the house but as he looked abroad to ascertain how matters stood oliver bolted in like a scared deer into a thicket and harboured himself by the smiths kitchen fire before henry could look up and down the lane and satisfy himself there were no enemies in pursuit of the apprehensive fugitive he secured his door therefore and returned into the kitchen displeased that he had suffered his gloomy solitude to be intruded upon by sympathising with apprehensions which he thought he might have known were so easily excited as those of his timid townsman  how now he said coldly enough when he saw the bonnet maker calmly seated by his hearth what foolish revel is this master oliver i see no one near to harm you  give me a drink kind gossip said oliver i am choked with the haste i have made to come hither  i have sworn said henry that this shall be no revel night in this house i am in my workday clothes as you see and keep fast as i have reason instead of holiday you have had wassail enough for the holiday evening for you speak thick already if you wish more ale or wine you must go elsewhere  i have had overmuch wassail already said poor oliver and have been well nigh drowned in it that accursed calabash a draught of water kind gossipyou will not surely let me ask for that in vain or if it is your will a cup of cold small ale  nay if that be all said henry it shall not be lacking but it must have been much which brought thee to the pass of asking for either  so saying he filled a quart flagon from a barrel that stood nigh and presented it to his guest oliver eagerly accepted it raised it to his head with a trembling hand imbibed the contents with lips which quivered with emotion and though the potation was as thin as he had requested so much was he exhausted with the combined fears of alarm and of former revelry that when he placed the flagon on the oak table he uttered a deep sigh of satisfaction and remained silent  well now you have had your draught gossip said the smith what is it you want where are those that threatened you i could see no one  nobut there were twenty chased me into the wynd said oliver but when they saw us together you know they lost the courage that brought all of them upon one of us  nay do not trifle friend oliver replied his host my mood lies not that way  i jest not by st john of perth i have been stayed and foully outraged gliding his hand sensitively over the place affected by mad david of rothsay roaring ramorny and the rest of them they made me drink a firkin of malvoisie  thou speakest folly man ramorny is sick nigh to death as the potter carrier everywhere reports they and he cannot surely rise at midnight to do such frolics  i cannot tell replied oliver but i saw the party by torchlight and i can make bodily oath to the bonnets i made for them since last innocents they are of a quaint device and i should know my own stitch  well thou mayst have had wrong answered henry if thou art in real danger i will cause them get a bed for thee here but you must fill it presently for i am not in the humour of talking  nay i would thank thee for my quarters for a night only my maudie will be angrythat is not angry for that i care not forbut the truth is she is overanxious on a revel night like this knowing my humour is like thine for a word and a blow  why then go home said the smith and show her that her treasure is in safety master oliver the streets are quiet and to speak a blunt word i would be alone  nay but i have things to speak with thee about of moment replied oliver who afraid to stay seemed yet unwilling to go there has been a stir in our city council about the affair of st valentines even the provost told me not four hours since that the douglas and he had agreed that the feud should be decided by a yeoman on either party and that our acquaintance the devils dick was to wave his gentry and take up the cause for douglas and the nobles and that you or i should fight for the fair city now though i am the elder burgess yet i am willing for the love and kindness we have always borne to each other to give thee the precedence and content myself with the humbler office of stickler  henry smith though angry could scarce forbear a smile  if it is that which breaks thy quiet and keeps thee out of thy bed at midnight i will make the matter easy thou shalt not lose the advantage offered thee i have fought a score of duelsfar far too many thou hast i think only encountered with thy wooden soldan it were unjustunfairunkindin me to abuse thy friendly offer so go home good fellow and let not the fear of losing honour disturb thy slumbers rest assured that thou shalt answer the challenge as good right thou hast having had injury from this rough rider  gramercy and thank thee kindly said oliver much embarrassed by his friends unexpected deference thou art the good friend i have always thought thee but i have as much friendship for henry smith as he for oliver proudfute i swear by st john i will not fight in this quarrel to thy prejudice so having said so i am beyond the reach of temptation since thou wouldst not have me mansworn though it were to fight twenty duels  hark thee said the smith acknowledge thou art afraid oliver tell the honest truth at once otherwise i leave thee to make the best of thy quarrel  nay good gossip replied the bonnet maker thou knowest i am never afraid but in sooth this is a desperate ruffian and as i have a wifepoor maudie thou knowestand a small family and thou  and i interrupted henry hastily have none and never shall have  why truly such being the case i would rather thou foughtst this combat than i  now by our halidome gossip answered the smith thou art easily gored know thou silly fellow that sir patrick charteris who is ever a merry man hath but jested with thee dost thou think he would venture the honour of the city on thy head or that i would yield thee the precedence in which such a matter was to be disputed lackaday go home let maudie tie a warm nightcap on thy head get thee a warm breakfast and a cup of distilled waters and thou wilt be in ease tomorrow to fight thy wooden dromond or soldan as thou callst him the only thing thou wilt ever lay downright blow upon  ay sayst thou so comrade answered oliver much relieved yet deeming it necessary to seem in part offended i care not for thy dogged humour it is well for thee thou canst not wake my patience to the point of falling foul enoughwe are gossips and this house is thine why should the two best blades in perth clash with each other what i know thy rugged humour and can forgive it but is the feud really soldered up  as completely as ever hammer fixed rivet said the smith the town hath given the johnstone a purse of gold for not ridding them of a troublesome fellow called oliver proudfute when he had him at his mercy and this purse of gold buys for the provost the sleepless isle which the king grants him for the king pays all in the long run and thus sir patrick gets the comely inch which is opposite to his dwelling and all honour is saved on both sides for what is given to the provost is given you understand to the town besides all this the douglas hath left perth to march against the southron who men say are called into the marches by the false earl of march so the fair city is quit of him and his cumber  but in st johns name how came all that about said oliver and no one spoken to about it  why look thee friend oliver this i take to have been the case the fellow whom i cropped of a hand is now said to have been a servant of sir john ramornys who hath fled to his motherland of fife to which sir john himself is also to be banished with full consent of every honest man now anything which brings in sir john ramorny touches a much greater mani think simon glover told as much to sir patrick charteris if it be as i guess i have reason to thank heaven and all the saints i stabbed him not upon the ladder when i made him prisoner  and i too thank heaven and all the saints most devoutly said oliver i was behind thee thou knowest and  no more of that if thou best wise there are laws against striking princes said the smith best not handle the horseshoe till it cools all is hushed up now  if this be so said oliver partly disconcerted but still more relieved by the intelligence he received from his better informed friend i have reason to complain of sir patrick charteris for jesting with the honour of an honest burgess being as he is provost of our town  do oliver challenge him to the field and he will bid his yeoman loose his dogs on thee but come night wears apace will you be shogging  nay i had one word more to say to thee good gossip but first another cup of your cold ale  pest on thee for a fool thou makest me wish thee where told liquors are a scarce commodity there swill the barrelful an thou wilt  oliver took the second flagon but drank or rather seemed to drink very slowly in order to gain time for considering how he should introduce his second subject of conversation which seemed rather delicate for the smiths present state of irritability at length nothing better occurred to him than to plunge into the subject at once with i have seen simon glover today gossip  well said the smith in a low deep and stern tone of voice and if thou hast what is that to me  nothingnothing answered the appalled bonnet maker only i thought you might like to know that he questioned me close if i had seen thee on st valentines day after the uproar at the dominicans and in what company thou wert  and i warrant thou toldst him thou metst me with a glee woman in the mirk loaning yonder  thou knowst henry i have no gift at lying but i made it all up with him  as how i pray you said the smith  marry thus father simon said i you are an old man and know not the quality of us in whose veins youth is like quicksilver you think now he cares about this girl said i and perhaps that he has her somewhere here in perth in a corner no such matter i know said i and i will make oath to it that she left his house early next morning for dundee ha have i helped thee at need  truly i think thou hast and if anything could add to my grief and vexation at this moment it is that when i am so deep in the mire an ass like thee should place his clumsy hoof on my head to sink me entirely come away with thee and mayst thou have such luck as thy meddling humour deserves and then i think thou wilt be found with a broken neck in the next gutter come get you out or i will put you to the door with head and shoulders forward  haha exclaimed oliver laughing with some constraint thou art such a groom but in sadness gossip henry wilt thou not take a turn with me to my own house in the meal vennel  curse thee no answered the smith  i will bestow the wine on thee if thou wilt go said oliver  i will bestow the cudgel on thee if thou stayst said henry  nay then i will don thy buff coat and cap of steel and walk with thy swashing step and whistling thy pibroch of broken bones at loncarty and if they take me for thee there dare not four of them come near me  take all or anything thou wilt in the fiends name only be gone  wellwell hal we shall meet when thou art in better humour said oliver who had put on the dress  go and may i never see thy coxcombly face again  oliver at last relieved his host by swaggering off imitating as well as he could the sturdy step and outward gesture of his redoubted companion and whistling a pibroch composed on the rout of the danes at loncarty which he had picked up from its being a favourite of the smiths whom he made a point of imitating as far as he could but as the innocent though conceited fellow stepped out from the entrance of the wynd where it communicated with the high street he received a blow from behind against which his headpiece was no defence and he fell dead upon the spot an attempt to mutter the name of henry to whom he always looked for protection quivering upon his dying tongue    chapter xvii       nay i will fit you for a young prince       falstaff   we return to the revellers who had half an hour before witnessed with such boisterous applause olivers feat of agility being the last which the poor bonnet maker was ever to exhibit and at the hasty retreat which had followed it animated by their wild shout after they had laughed their fill they passed on their mirthful path in frolic and jubilee stopping and frightening some of the people whom they met but it must be owned without doing them any serious injury either in their persons or feelings at length tired with his rambles their chief gave a signal to his merry men to close around him  we my brave hearts and wise counsellors are he said the real king over all in scotland that is worth commanding we sway the hours when the wine cup circulates and when beauty becomes kind when frolic is awake and gravity snoring upon his pallet we leave to our vice regent king robert the weary task of controlling ambitious nobles gratifying greedy clergymen subduing wild highlanders and composing deadly feuds and since our empire is one of joy and pleasure meet it is that we should haste with all our forces to the rescue of such as own our sway when they chance by evil fortune to become the prisoners of care and hypochondriac malady i speak in relation chiefly to sir john whom the vulgar call ramorny we have not seen him since the onslaught of curfew street and though we know he was somedeal hurt in that matter we cannot see why he should not do homage in leal and duteous sort here you our calabash king at arms did you legally summon sir john to his part of this evenings revels  i did my lord  and did you acquaint him that we have for this night suspended his sentence of banishment that since higher powers have settled that part we might at least take a mirthful leave of an old friend  i so delivered it my lord answered the mimic herald  and sent he not a word in writing he that piques himself upon being so great a clerk  he was in bed my lord and i might not see him so far as i hear he hath lived very retired harmed with some bodily bruises malcontent with your highnesss displeasure and doubting insult in the streets he having had a narrow escape from the burgesses when the churls pursued him and his two servants into the dominican convent the servants too have been removed to fife lest they should tell tales  why it was wisely done said the prince who we need not inform the intelligent reader had a better title to be so called than arose from the humours of the eveningit was prudently done to keep light tongued companions out of the way but st johns absenting himself from our solemn revels so long before decreed is flat mutiny and disclamation of allegiance or if the knight be really the prisoner of illness and melancholy we must ourself grace him with a visit seeing there can be no better cure for those maladies than our own presence and a gentle kiss of the calabash forward ushers minstrels guard and attendants bear on high the great emblem of our dignity up with the calabash i say and let the merry men who carry these firkins which are to supply the wine cup with their life blood be chosen with regard to their state of steadiness their burden is weighty and precious and if the fault is not in our eyes they seem to us to reel and stagger more than were desirable now move on sirs and let our minstrels blow their blythest and boldest  on they went with tipsy mirth and jollity the numerous torches flashing their red light against the small windows of the narrow streets from whence nightcapped householders and sometimes their wives to boot peeped out by stealth to see what wild wassail disturbed the peaceful streets at that unwonted hour at length the jolly train halted before the door of sir john ramornys house which a small court divided from the street  here they knocked thundered and hallood with many denunciations of vengeance against the recusants who refused to open the gates the least punishment threatened was imprisonment in an empty hogshead within the massamore principal dungeon of the prince of pastimes feudal palace videlicet the ale cellar but eviot ramornys page heard and knew well the character of the intruders who knocked so boldly and thought it better considering his masters condition to make no answer at all in hopes that the revel would pass on than to attempt to deprecate their proceedings which he knew would be to no purpose his masters bedroom looking into a little garden his page hoped he might not be disturbed by the noise and he was confident in the strength of the outward gate upon which he resolved they should beat till they tired themselves or till the tone of their drunken humour should change the revellers accordingly seemed likely to exhaust themselves in the noise they made by shouting and beating the door when their mock prince alas too really such upbraided them as lazy and dull followers of the god of wine and of mirth  bring forward he said our key yonder it lies and apply it to this rebellious gate  the key he pointed at was a large beam of wood left on one side of the street with the usual neglect of order characteristic of a scottish borough of the period  the shouting men of ind instantly raised it in their arms and supporting it by their united strength ran against the door with such force that hasp hinge and staple jingled and gave fair promise of yielding eviot did not choose to wait the extremity of this battery he came forth into the court and after some momentary questions for forms sake caused the porter to undo the gate as if he had for the first time recognised the midnight visitors  false slave of an unfaithful master said the prince where is our disloyal subject sir john ramorny who has proved recreant to our summons  my lord said eviot bowing at once to the real and to the assumed dignity of the leader my master is just now very much indisposed he has taken an opiateandyour highness must excuse me if i do my duty to him in saying he cannot be spoken with without danger of his life  tush tell me not of danger master teviotchevioteviotwhat is it they call thee but show me thy masters chamber or rather undo me the door of his lodging and i will make a good guess at it myself bear high the calabash my brave followers and see that you spill not a drop of the liquor which dan bacchus has sent for the cure of all diseases of the body and cares of the mind advance it i say and let us see the holy rind which incloses such precious liquor  the prince made his way into the house accordingly and acquainted with its interior ran upstairs followed by eviot in vain imploring silence and with the rest of the rabble rout burst into the room of the wounded master of the lodging  he who has experienced the sensation of being compelled to sleep in spite of racking bodily pains by the administration of a strong opiate and of having been again startled by noise and violence out of the unnatural state of insensibility in which he had been plunged by the potency of the medicine may be able to imagine the confused and alarmed state of sir john ramornys mind and the agony of his body which acted and reacted upon each other if we add to these feelings the consciousness of a criminal command sent forth and in the act of being executed it may give us some idea of an awakening to which in the mind of the party eternal sleep would be a far preferable doom the groan which he uttered as the first symptom of returning sensation had something in it so terrific that even the revellers were awed into momentary silence and as from the half recumbent posture in which he had gone to sleep he looked around the room filled with fantastic shapes rendered still more so by his disturbed intellects he muttered to himself  it is thus then after all and the legend is true these are fiends and i am condemned for ever the fire is not external but i feel iti feel it at my heartburning as if the seven times heated furnace were doing its work within  while he cast ghastly looks around him and struggled to recover some share of recollection eviot approached the prince and falling on his knees implored him to allow the apartment to be cleared  it may he said cost my master his life  never fear cheviot replied the duke of rothsay were he at the gates of death here is what should make the fiends relinquish their prey advance the calabash my masters  it is death for him to taste it in his present state said eviot if he drinks wine he dies  some one must drink it for himhe shall be cured vicariously and may our great dan bacchus deign to sir john ramorny the comfort the elevation of heart the lubrication of lungs and lightness of fancy which are his choicest gifts while the faithful follower who quaffs in his stead shall have the qualms the sickness the racking of the nerves the dimness of the eyes and the throbbing of the brain with which our great master qualifies gifts which would else make us too like the gods what say you eviot will you be the faithful follower that will quaff in your lords behalf and as his representative do this and we will hold ourselves contented to depart for methinks our subject doth look something ghastly  i would do anything in my slight power said eviot to save my master from a draught which may be his death and your grace from the sense that you had occasioned it but here is one who will perform the feat of goodwill and thank your highness to boot  whom have we here said the prince a butcher and i think fresh from his office do butchers ply their craft on fasterns eve foh how he smells of blood  this was spoken of bonthron who partly surprised at the tumult in the house where he had expected to find all dark and silent and partly stupid through the wine which the wretch had drunk in great quantities stood in the threshold of the door staring at the scene before him with his buff coat splashed with blood and a bloody axe in his hand exhibiting a ghastly and disgusting spectacle to the revellers who felt though they could not tell why fear as well as dislike at his presence  as they approached the calabash to this ungainly and truculent looking savage and as he extended a hand soiled as it seemed with blood to grasp it the prince called out  downstairs with him let not the wretch drink in our presence find him some other vessel than our holy calabash the emblem of our revels a swines trough were best if it could be come by away with him let him be drenched to purpose in atonement for his masters sobriety leave me alone with sir john ramorny and his page by my honour i like not yon ruffians looks  the attendants of the prince left the apartment and eviot alone remained  i fear said the prince approaching the bed in different form from that which he had hitherto usedi fear my dear sir john that this visit has been unwelcome but it is your own fault although you know our old wont and were your self participant of our schemes for the evening you have not come near us since st valentines it is now fasterns even and the desertion is flat disobedience and treason to our kingdom of mirth and the statutes of the calabash  ramorny raised his head and fixed a wavering eye upon the prince then signed to eviot to give him something to drink a large cup of ptisan was presented by the page which the sick man swallowed with eager and trembling haste he then repeatedly used the stimulating essence left for the purpose by the leech and seemed to collect his scattered senses  let me feel your pulse dear ramorny said the prince i know something of that craft how do your offer me the left hand sir john that is neither according to the rules of medicine nor of courtesy  the right has already done its last act in your highnesss service muttered the patient in a low and broken tone  how mean you by that said the prince i am aware thy follower black quentin lost a hand but he can steal with the other as much as will bring him to the gallows so his fate cannot be much altered  it is not that fellow who has had the loss in your graces service it is i john of ramorny  you said the prince you jest with me or the opiate still masters your reason  if the juice of all the poppies in egypt were blended in one draught said ramorny it would lose influence over me when i look upon this he drew his right arm from beneath the cover of the bedclothes and extending it towards the prince wrapped as it was in dressings were these undone and removed he said your highness would see that a bloody stump is all that remains of a hand ever ready to unsheath the sword at your graces slightest bidding  rothsay started back in horror this he said must be avenged  it is avenged in small part said ramornythat is i thought i saw bonthron but now or was it that the dream of hell that first arose in my mind when i awakened summoned up an image so congenial eviot call the miscreantthat is if he is fit to appear  eviot retired and presently returned with bonthron whom he had rescued from the penance to him no unpleasing infliction of a second calabash of wine the brute having gorged the first without much apparent alteration in his demeanour  eviot said the prince let not that beast come nigh me my soul recoils from him in fear and disgust there is something in his looks alien from my nature and which i shudder at as at a loathsome snake from which my instinct revolts  first hear him speak my lord answered ramorny unless a wineskin were to talk nothing could use fewer words hast thou dealt with him bonthron  the savage raised the axe which he still held in his hand and brought it down again edgeways  good how knew you your man the night i am told is dark  by sight and sound garb gait and whistle  enough vanish and eviot let him have gold and wine to his brutish contentment vanish and go thou with him  and whose death is achieved said the prince released from the feelings of disgust and horror under which he suffered while the assassin was in presence i trust this is but a jest else must i call it a rash and savage deed who has had the hard lot to be butchered by that bloody and brutal slave  one little better than himself said the patient a wretched artisan to whom however fate gave the power of reducing ramorny to a mutilated cripplea curse go with his base spirit his miserable life is but to my revenge what a drop of water would be to a furnace i must speak briefly for my ideas again wander it is only the necessity of the moment which keeps them together as a thong combines a handful of arrows you are in danger my lordi speak it with certainty you have braved douglas and offended your uncle displeased your father though that were a trifle were it not for the rest  i am sorry i have displeased my father said the prince entirely diverted from so insignificant a thing as the slaughter of an artisan by the more important subject touched upon if indeed it be so but if i live the strength of the douglas shall be broken and the craft of albany shall little avail him  ayifif my lord said ramorny with such opposites as you have you must not rest upon if or but you must resolve at once to slay or be slain  how mean you ramorny your fever makes you rave answered the duke of rothsay  no my lord said ramorny were my frenzy at the highest the thoughts that pass through my mind at this moment would qualify it it may be that regret for my own loss has made me desperate that anxious thoughts for your highnesss safety have made me nourish bold designs but i have all the judgment with which heaven has gifted me when i tell you that if ever you would brook the scottish crown nay more if ever you would see another st valentines day you must  what is it that i must do ramorny said the prince with an air of dignity nothing unworthy of myself i hope  nothing certainly unworthy or misbecoming a prince of scotland if the bloodstained annals of our country tell the tale truly but that which may well shock the nerves of a prince of mimes and merry makers  thou art severe sir john ramorny said the duke of rothsay with an air of displeasure but thou hast dearly bought a right to censure us by what thou hast lost in our cause  my lord of rothsay said the knight the chirurgeon who dressed this mutilated stump told me that the more i felt the pain his knife and brand inflicted the better was my chance of recovery i shall not therefore hesitate to hurt your feelings while by doing so i may be able to bring you to a sense of what is necessary for your safety your grace has been the pupil of mirthful folly too long you must now assume manly policy or be crushed like a butterfly on the bosom of the flower you are sporting on  i think i know your cast of morals sir john you are weary of merry follythe churchmen call it viceand long for a little serious crime a murder now or a massacre would enhance the flavour of debauch as the taste of the olive gives zest to wine but my worst acts are but merry malice i have no relish for the bloody trade and abhor to see or hear of its being acted even on the meanest caitiff should i ever fill the throne i suppose like my father before me i must drop my own name and be dubbed robert in honour of the bruce well an if it be so every scots lad shall have his flag on in one hand and the other around his lasss neck and manhood shall be tried by kisses and bumpers not by dirks and dourlachs and they shall write on my grave here lies robert fourth of his name he won not battles like robert the first he rose not from a count to a king like robert the second he founded not churches like robert the third but was contented to live and die king of good fellows of all my two centuries of ancestors i would only emulate the fame of  old king coul who had a brown bowl  my gracious lord said ramorny let me remind you that your joyous revels involve serious evils if i had lost this hand in fighting to attain for your grace some important advantage over your too powerful enemies the loss would never have grieved me but to be reduced from helmet and steel coat to biggin and gown in a night brawl  why there again now sir john interrupted the reckless prince how canst thou be so unworthy as to be for ever flinging thy bloody hand in my face as the ghost of gaskhall threw his head at sir william wallace bethink thee thou art more unreasonable than fawdyon himself for wight wallace had swept his head off in somewhat a hasty humour whereas i would gladly stick thy hand on again were that possible and hark thee since that cannot be i will get thee such a substitute as the steel hand of the old knight of carslogie with which he greeted his friends caressed his wife braved his antagonists and did all that might be done by a hand of flesh and blood in offence or defence depend on it john ramorny we have much that is superfluous about us man can see with one eye hear with one ear touch with one hand smell with one nostril and why we should have two of each unless to supply an accidental loss or injury i for one am at a loss to conceive  sir john ramorny turned from the prince with a low groan  nay sir john said the duke i am quite serious you know the truth touching the legend of steel hand of carslogie better than i since he was your own neighbour in his time that curious engine could only be made in rome but i will wager an hundred marks with you that let the perth armourer have the use of it for a pattern henry of the wynd will execute as complete an imitation as all the smiths in rome could accomplish with all the cardinals to bid a blessing on the work  i could venture to accept your wager my lord answered ramorny bitterly but there is no time for foolery you have dismissed me from your service at command of your uncle  at command of my father answered the prince  upon whom your uncles commands are imperative replied ramorny i am a disgraced man thrown aside as i may now fling away my right hand glove as a thing useless yet my head might help you though my hand be gone is your grace disposed to listen to me for one word of serious import for i am much exhausted and feel my force sinking under me  speak your pleasure said the prince thy loss binds me to hear thee thy bloody stump is a sceptre to control me speak then but be merciful in thy strength of privilege  i will be brief for mine own sake as well as thine indeed i have but little to say douglas places himself immediately at the head of his vassals he will assemble in the name of king robert thirty thousand borderers whom he will shortly after lead into the interior to demand that the duke of rothsay receive or rather restore his daughter to the rank and privileges of his duchess king robert will yield to any conditions which may secure peace what will the duke do  the duke of rothsay loves peace said the prince haughtily but he never feared war ere he takes back yonder proud peat to his table and his bed at the command of her father douglas must be king of scotland  be it so but even this is the less pressing peril especially as it threatens open violence for the douglas works not in secret  what is there which presses and keeps us awake at this late hour i am a weary man thou a wounded one and the very tapers are blinking as if tired of our conference  tell me then who is it that rules this kingdom of scotland said ramorny  robert third of the name said the prince raising his bonnet as he spoke and long may he sway the sceptre  true and amen answered ramorny but who sways king robert and dictates almost every measure which the good king pursues  my lord of albany you would say replied the prince yes it is true my father is guided almost entirely by the counsels of his brother nor can we blame him in our consciences sir john ramorny for little help hath he had from his son  let us help him now my lord said ramorny i am possessor of a dreadful secret albany hath been trafficking with me to join him in taking your graces life he offers full pardon for the past high favour for the future  how manmy life i trust though thou dost only mean my kingdom it were impious he is my fathers brotherthey sat on the knees of the same fatherlay in the bosom of the same mother out on thee man what follies they make thy sickbed believe  believe indeed said ramorny it is new to me to be termed credulous but the man through whom albany communicated his temptations is one whom all will believe so soon as he hints at mischiefeven the medicaments which are prepared by his hands have a relish of poison  tush such a slave would slander a saint replied the prince thou art duped for once ramorny shrewd as thou art my uncle of albany is ambitious and would secure for himself and for his house a larger portion of power and wealth than he ought in reason to desire but to suppose he would dethrone or slay his brothers sonfie ramorny put me not to quote the old saw that evil doers are evil dreaders it is your suspicion not your knowledge which speaks  your grace is fatally deluded i will put it to an issue the duke of albany is generally hated for his greed and covetousness your highness is it may be more beloved than  ramorny stopped the prince calmly filled up the blank more beloved than i am honoured it is so i would have it ramorny  at least said ramorny you are more beloved than you are feared and that is no safe condition for a prince but give me your honour and knightly word that you will not resent what good service i shall do in your behalf and lend me your signet to engage friends in your name and the duke of albany shall not assume authority in this court till the wasted hand which once terminated this stump shall be again united to the body and acting in obedience to the dictates of my mind  you would not venture to dip your hands in royal blood said the prince sternly  fie my lord at no rate blood need not be shed life may nay will be extinguished of itself for want of trimming it with fresh oil or screening it from a breath of wind the quivering light will die in the socket to suffer a man to die is not to kill him  truei had forgot that policy well then suppose my uncle albany does not continue to livei think that must be the phrasewho then rules the court of scotland  robert the third with consent advice and authority of the most mighty david duke of rothsay lieutenant of the kingdom and alter ego in whose favour indeed the good king wearied with the fatigues and troubles of sovereignty will i guess be well disposed to abdicate so long live our brave young monarch king david the third  ille manu fortis anglis ludebit in hortis  and our father and predecessor said rothsay will he continue to live to pray for us as our beadsman by whose favour he holds the privilege of laying his grey hairs in the grave as soon and no earlier than the course of nature permits or must he also encounter some of those negligences in consequence of which men cease to continue to live and can change the limits of a prison or of a convent resembling one for the dark and tranquil cell where the priests say that the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest  you speak in jest my lord replied ramorny to harm the good old king were equally unnatural and impolitic  why shrink from that man when thy whole scheme answered the prince in stern displeasure is one lesson of unnatural guilt mixed with short sighted ambition if the king of scotland can scarcely make head against his nobles even now when he can hold up before them an unsullied and honourable banner who would follow a prince that is blackened with the death of an uncle and the imprisonment of a father why man thy policy were enough to revolt a heathen divan to say nought of the council of a christian nation thou wert my tutor ramorny and perhaps i might justly upbraid thy lessons and example for some of the follies which men chide in me perhaps if it had not been for thee i had not been standing at midnight in this fools guise looking at his dress to hear an ambitious profligate propose to me the murder of an uncle the dethronement of the best of fathers since it is my fault as well as thine that has sunk me so deep in the gulf of infamy it were unjust that thou alone shouldst die for it but dare not to renew this theme to me on peril of thy life i will proclaim thee to my fatherto albanyto scotlandthroughout its length and breadth as many market crosses as are in the land shall have morsels of the traitors carcass who dare counsel such horrors to the heir of scotland well hope i indeed that the fever of thy wound and the intoxicating influence of the cordials which act on thy infirm brain have this night operated on thee rather than any fixed purpose  in sooth my lord said ramorny if i have said any thing which could so greatly exasperate your highness it must have been by excess of zeal mingled with imbecility of understanding surely i of all men am least likely to propose ambitious projects with a prospect of advantage to myself alas my only future views must be to exchange lance and saddle for the breviary and the confessional the convent of lindores must receive the maimed and impoverished knight of ramorny who will there have ample leisure to meditate upon the text put not thy faith in princes  it is a goodly purpose said the prince and we will not be lacking to promote it our separation i thought would have been but for a time it must now be perpetual certainly after such talk as we have held it were meet that we should live asunder but the convent of lindores or what ever other house receives thee shall be richly endowed and highly favoured by us and now sir john of ramorny sleepsleepand forget this evil omened conversation in which the fever of disease and of wine has rather i trust held colloquy than your own proper thoughts light to the door eviot  a call from eviot summoned the attendants of the prince who had been sleeping on the staircase and hall exhausted by the revels of the evening  is there none amongst you sober said the duke of rothsay disgusted by the appearance of his attendants  not a mannot a man answered the followers with a drunken shout we are none of us traitors to the emperor of merry makers  and are all of you turned into brutes then said the prince  in obedience and imitation of your grace answered one fellow or if we are a little behind your highness one pull at the pitcher will  peace beast said the duke of rothsay are there none of you sober i say  yes my noble liege was the answer here is one false brother watkins the englishman  come hither then watkins and aid me with a torch give me a cloak too and another bonnet and take away this trumpery throwing down his coronet of feathers i would i could throw off all my follies as easily english wat attend me alone and the rest of you end your revelry and doff your mumming habits the holytide is expended and the fast has begun  our monarch has abdicated sooner than usual this night said one of the revel rout but as the prince gave no encouragement such as happened for the time to want the virtue of sobriety endeavoured to assume it as well as they could and the whole of the late rioters began to adopt the appearance of a set of decent persons who having been surprised into intoxication endeavoured to disguise their condition by assuming a double portion of formality of behaviour in the interim the prince having made a hasty reform in his dress was lighted to the door by the only sober man of the company but in his progress thither had well nigh stumbled over the sleeping bulk of the brute bonthron  how now is that vile beast in our way once more he said in anger and disgust here some of you toss this caitiff into the horse trough that for once in his life he may be washed clean  while the train executed his commands availing themselves of a fountain which was in the outer court and while bonthron underwent a discipline which he was incapable of resisting otherwise than by some inarticulate groans and snorts like those of a dying boar the prince proceeded on his way to his apartments in a mansion called the constables lodgings from the house being the property of the earls of errol on the way to divert his thoughts from the more unpleasing matters the prince asked his companion how he came to be sober when the rest of the party had been so much overcome with liquor  so please your honours grace replied english wat i confess it was very familiar in me to be sober when it was your graces pleasure that your train should be mad drunk but in respect they were all scottishmen but myself i thought it argued no policy in getting drunken in their company seeing that they only endure me even when we are all sober and if the wine were uppermost i might tell them a piece of my mind and be paid with as many stabs as there are skenes in the good company  so it is your purpose never to join any of the revels of our household  under favour yes unless it be your graces pleasure that the residue of your train should remain one day sober to admit will watkins to get drunk without terror of his life  such occasion may arrive where dost thou serve watkins  in the stable so please you  let our chamberlain bring thee into the household as a yeoman of the night watch i like thy favour and it is something to have one sober fellow in the house although he is only such through the fear of death attend therefore near our person and thou shalt find sobriety a thriving virtue  meantime a load of care and fear added to the distress of sir john ramornys sick chamber his reflections disordered as they were by the opiate fell into great confusion when the prince in whose presence he had suppressed its effect by strong resistance had left the apartment his consciousness which he had possessed perfectly during the interview began to be very much disturbed he felt a general sense that he had incurred a great danger that he had rendered the prince his enemy and that he had betrayed to him a secret which might affect his own life in this state of mind and body it was not strange that he should either dream or else that his diseased organs should become subject to that species of phantasmagoria which is excited by the use of opium he thought that the shade of queen annabella stood by his bedside and demanded the youth whom she had placed under his charge simple virtuous gay and innocent  thou hast rendered him reckless dissolute and vicious said the shade of pallid majesty yet i thank thee john of ramorny ungrateful to me false to thy word and treacherous to my hopes thy hate shall counteract the evil which thy friendship has done to him and well do i hope that now thou art no longer his counsellor a bitter penance on earth may purchase my ill fated child pardon and acceptance in a better world  ramorny stretched out his arms after his benefactress and endeavoured to express contrition and excuse but the countenance of the apparition became darker and sterner till it was no longer that of the late queen but presented the gloomy and haughty aspect of the black douglas then the timid and sorrowful face of king robert who seemed to mourn over the approaching dissolution of his royal house and then a group of fantastic features partly hideous partly ludicrous which moped and chattered and twisted themselves into unnatural and extravagant forms as if ridiculing his endeavour to obtain an exact idea of their lineaments    chapter xviii       a purple land where law secures not life       byron   the morning of ash wednesday arose pale and bleak as usual at this season in scotland where the worst and most inclement weather often occurs in the early spring months it was a severe day of frost and the citizens had to sleep away the consequences of the preceding holidays debauchery the sun had therefore risen for an hour above the horizon before there was any general appearance of life among the inhabitants of perth so that it was some time after daybreak when a citizen going early to mass saw the body of the luckless oliver proudfute lying on its face across the kennel in the manner in which he had fallen under the blow as our readers will easily imagine of anthony bonthron the boy of the beltthat is the executioner of the pleasureof john of ramorny  this early citizen was allan griffin so termed because he was master of the griffin inn and the alarm which he raised soon brought together first straggling neighbours and by and by a concourse of citizens at first from the circumstance of the well known buff coat and the crimson feather in the head piece the noise arose that it was the stout smith that lay there slain this false rumour continued for some time for the host of the griffin who himself had been a magistrate would not permit the body to be touched or stirred till bailie craigdallie arrived so that the face was not seen  this concerns the fair city my friends he said and if it is the stout smith of the wynd who lies here the man lives not in perth who will not risk land and life to avenge him look you the villains have struck him down behind his back for there is not a man within ten scotch miles of perth gentle or simple highland or lowland that would have met him face to face with such evil purpose oh brave men of perth the flower of your manhood has been cut down and that by a base and treacherous hand  a wild cry of fury arose from the people who were fast assembling  we will take him on our shoulders said a strong butcher we will carry him to the kings presence at the dominican convent  ayay answered a blacksmith neither bolt nor bar shall keep us from the king neither monk nor mass shall break our purpose a better armourer never laid hammer on anvil  to the dominicansto the dominicans shouted the assembled people  bethink you burghers said another citizen our king is a good king and loves us like his children it is the douglas and the duke of albany that will not let good king robert hear the distresses of his people  are we to be slain in our own streets for the kings softness of heart said the butcher the bruce did otherwise if the king will not keep us we will keep ourselves ring the bells backward every bell of them that is made of metal cry and spare not st johnstons hunt is up  ay cried another citizen and let us to the holds of albany and the douglas and burn them to the ground let the fires tell far and near that perth knew how to avenge her stout henry gow he has fought a score of times for the fair citys right let us show we can once to avenge his wrong hally ho brave citizens st johnstons hunt is up  this cry the well known rallying word amongst the inhabitants of perth and seldom heard but on occasions of general uproar was echoed from voice to voice and one or two neighbouring steeples of which the enraged citizens possessed themselves either by consent of the priests or in spite of their opposition began to ring out the ominous alarm notes in which as the ordinary succession of the chimes was reversed the bells were said to be rung backward  still as the crowd thickened and the roar waxed more universal and louder allan griffin a burly man with a deep voice and well respected among high and low kept his station as he bestrode the corpse and called loudly to the multitude to keep back and wait the arrival of the magistrates  we must proceed by order in this matter my masters we must have our magistrates at our head they are duly chosen and elected in our town hall good men and true every one we will not be called rioters or idle perturbators of the kings peace stand you still and make room for yonder comes bailie craigdallie ay and honest simon glover to whom the fair city is so much bounden alasalas my kind townsmen his beautiful daughter was a bride yesternight this morning the fair maid of perth is a widow before she has been a wife  this new theme of sympathy increased the rage and sorrow of the crowd the more as many women now mingled with them who echoed back the alarm cry to the men  ayay st johnstons hunt is up for the fair maid of perth and the brave henry gow upup every one of you spare not for your skin cutting to the stablesto the stables when the horse is gone the man at arms is uselesscut off the grooms and yeomen lame maim and stab the horses kill the base squires and pages let these proud knights meet us on their feet if they dare  they dare notthey dare not answered the men their strength is their horses and armour and yet the haughty and ungrateful villains have slain a man whose skill as an armourer was never matched in milan or venice to armsto arms brave burghers st johnstons hunt is up  amid this clamour the magistrates and superior class of inhabitants with difficulty obtained room to examine the body having with them the town clerk to take an official protocol or as it is still called a precognition of the condition in which it was found to these delays the multitude submitted with a patience and order which strongly marked the national character of a people whose resentment has always been the more deeply dangerous that they will without relaxing their determination of vengeance submit with patience to all delays which are necessary to ensure its attainment the multitude therefore received their magistrates with a loud cry in which the thirst of revenge was announced together with the deferential welcome to the patrons by whose direction they expected to obtain it in right and legal fashion  while these accents of welcome still rung above the crowd who now filled the whole adjacent streets receiving and circulating a thousand varying reports the fathers of the city caused the body to be raised and more closely examined when it was instantly perceived and the truth publicly announced that not the armourer of the wynd so highly and according to the esteemed qualities of the time so justly popular among his fellow citizens but a man of far less general estimation though not without his own value in society lay murdered before themthe brisk bonnet maker oliver proudfute the resentment of the people had so much turned upon the general opinion that their frank and brave champion henry gow was the slaughtered person that the contradiction of the report served to cool the general fury although if poor oliver had been recognised at first there is little doubt that the cry of vengeance would have been as unanimous though not probably so furious as in the case of henry wynd the first circulation of the unexpected intelligence even excited a smile among the crowd so near are the confines of the ludicrous to those of the terrible  the murderers have without doubt taken him for henry smith said griffin which must have been a great comfort to him in the circumstances  but the arrival of other persons on the scene soon restored its deeply tragic character    chapter xix       whos that that rings the bell diablos ho      the town will rise       othello act ii scene iii   the wild rumours which flew through the town speedily followed by the tolling of the alarm bells spread general consternation the nobles and knights with their followers gathered in different places of rendezvous where a defence could best be maintained and the alarm reached the royal residence where the young prince was one of the first to appear to assist if necessary in the defence of the old king the scene of the preceding night ran in his recollection and remembering the bloodstained figure of bonthron he conceived though indistinctly that the ruffians action had been connected with this uproar the subsequent and more interesting discourse with sir john ramorny had however been of such an impressive nature as to obliterate all traces of what he had vaguely heard of the bloody act of the assassin excepting a confused recollection that some one or other had been slain it was chiefly on his fathers account that he had assumed arms with his household train who clad in bright armour and bearing lances in their hands made now a figure very different from that of the preceding night when they appeared as intoxicated bacchanalians the kind old monarch received this mark of filial attachment with tears of gratitude and proudly presented his son to his brother albany who entered shortly afterwards he took them each by the hand  now are we three stuarts he said as inseparable as the holy trefoil and as they say the wearer of that sacred herb mocks at magical delusion so we while we are true to each other may set malice and enmity at defiance  the brother and son kissed the kind hand which pressed theirs while robert iii expressed his confidence in their affection the kiss of the youth was for the time sincere that of the brother was the salute of the apostate judas  in the mean time the bell of st johns church alarmed amongst others the inhabitants of curfew street in the house of simon glover old dorothy glover as she was called for she also took name from the trade she practised under her masters auspices was the first to catch the sound though somewhat deaf upon ordinary occasions her ear for bad news was as sharp as a kites scent for carrion for dorothy otherwise an industrious faithful and even affectionate creature had that strong appetite for collecting and retailing sinister intelligence which is often to be marked in the lower classes little accustomed to be listened to they love the attention which a tragic tale ensures to the bearer and enjoy perhaps the temporary equality to which misfortune reduces those who are ordinarily accounted their superiors dorothy had no sooner possessed herself of a slight packet of the rumours which were flying abroad than she bounced into her masters bedroom who had taken the privilege of age and the holytide to sleep longer than usual  there he lies honest man said dorothy half in a screeching and half in a wailing tone of sympathythere he lies his best friend slain and he knowing as little about it as the babe new born that kens not life from death  how now said the glover starting up out of his bed what is the matter old woman is my daughter well  old woman said dorothy who having her fish hooked chose to let him play a little i am not so old said she flouncing out of the room as to bide in the place till a man rises from his naked bed  and presently she was heard at a distance in the parlour beneath melodiously singing to the scrubbing of her own broom  dorothyscreech owldevilsay but my daughter is well  i am well my father answered the fair maid of perth speaking from her bedroom perfectly well but what for our ladys sake is the matter the bells ring backward and there is shrieking and crying in the streets  i will presently know the cause here conachar come speedily and tie my points i forgotthe highland loon is far beyond fortingall patience daughter i will presently bring you news  ye need not hurry yourself for that simon glover quoth the obdurate old woman the best and the worst of it may be tauld before you could hobble over your door stane i ken the haill story abroad for thought i our goodman is so wilful that hell be for banging out to the tuilzie be the cause what it like and sae i maun een stir my shanks and learn the cause of all this or he will hae his auld nose in the midst of it and maybe get it nipt off before he knows what for  and what is the news then old woman said the impatient glover still busying himself with the hundred points or latchets which were the means of attaching the doublet to the hose  dorothy suffered him to proceed in his task till she conjectured it must be nearly accomplished and foresaw that if she told not the secret herself her master would be abroad to seek in person for the cause of the disturbance she therefore hallood out aweelaweel ye canna say it is me fault if you hear ill news before you have been at the morning mass i would have kept it from ye till ye had heard the priests word but since you must hear it you have een lost the truest friend that ever gave hand to another and perth maun mourn for the bravest burgher that ever took a blade in hand  harry smith harry smith exclaimed the father and the daughter at once  oh ay there ye hae it at last said dorothy and whose fault was it but your ain ye made such a piece of work about his companying with a glee woman as if he had companied with a jewess  dorothy would have gone on long enough but her master exclaimed to his daughter who was still in her own apartment it is nonsense catharineall the dotage of an old fool no such thing has happened i will bring you the true tidings in a moment and snatching up his staff the old man hurried out past dorothy and into the street where the throng of people were rushing towards the high street  dorothy in the mean time kept muttering to herself thy father is a wise man take his ain word for it he will come next by some scathe in the hobbleshow and then it will be dorothy get the lint and dorothy spread the plaster but now it is nothing but nonsense and a lie and impossibility that can come out of dorothys mouth impossible does auld simon think that harry smiths head was as hard as his stithy and a haill clan of highlandmen dinging at him  here she was interrupted by a figure like an angel who came wandering by her with wild eye cheek deadly pale hair dishevelled and an apparent want of consciousness which terrified the old woman out of her discontented humour  our lady bless my bairn said she what look you sae wild for  did you not say some one was dead said catharine with a frightful uncertainty of utterance as if her organs of speech and hearing served her but imperfectly  dead hinny ayay dead eneugh yell no hae him to gloom at ony mair  dead repeated catharine still with the same uncertainty of voice and manner deadslainand by highlanders  ise warrant by highlanders the lawless loons wha is it else that kills maist of the folks about unless now and than when the burghers take a tirrivie and kill ane another or whiles that the knights and nobles shed blood but ise uphauld its been the highlandmen this bout the man was no in perth laird or loon durst have faced henry smith man to man theres been sair odds against him yell see that when its looked into  highlanders repeated catharine as if haunted by some idea which troubled her senses highlanders oh conacharconachar  indeed and i dare say you have lighted on the very man catharine they quarrelled as you saw on the st valentines even and had a warstle a highlandman has a long memory for the like of that gie him a cuff at martinmas and his cheek will be tingling at whitsunday but what could have brought down the lang legged loons to do their bloody wark within burgh  woes me it was i said catharineit was i brought the highlanders downi that sent for conacharay they have lain in waitbut it was i that brought them within reach of their prey but i will see with my own eyesand thensomething we will do say to my father i will be back anon  are ye distraught lassie shouted dorothy as catharine made past her towards the street door you would not gang into the street with the hair hanging down your haffets in that guise and you kennd for the fair maid of perth mass but shes out in the street come ot what like and the auld glover will be as mad as if i could withhold her will she nill she flyte she fling she this is a brave morning for an ash wednesday whats to be done if i were to seek my master among the multitude i were like to be crushed beneath their feet and little moan made for the old woman and am i to run after catharine who ere this is out of sight and far lighter of foot than i am so i will just down the gate to nicol barbers and tell him a about it  while the trusty dorothy was putting her prudent resolve into execution catharine ran through the streets of perth in a manner which at another moment would have brought on her the attention of every one who saw her hurrying on with a reckless impetuosity wildly and widely different from the ordinary decency and composure of her step and manner and without the plaid scarf or mantle which women of good of fair character and decent rank universally carried around them when they went abroad but distracted as the people were every one inquiring or telling the cause of the tumult and most recounting it different ways the negligence of her dress and discomposure of her manner made no impression on any one and she was suffered to press forward on the path she had chosen without attracting more notice than the other females who stirred by anxious curiosity or fear had come out to inquire the cause of an alarm so generalit might be to seek for friends for whose safety they were interested  as catharine passed along she felt all the wild influence of the agitating scene and it was with difficulty she forbore from repeating the cries of lamentation and alarm which were echoed around her in the mean time she rushed rapidly on embarrassed like one in a dream with a strange sense of dreadful calamity the precise nature of which she was unable to define but which implied the terrible consciousness that the man who loved her so fondly whose good qualities she so highly esteemed and whom she now felt to be dearer than perhaps she would before have acknowledged to her own bosom was murdered and most probably by her means the connexion betwixt henrys supposed death and the descent of conachar and his followers though adopted by her in a moment of extreme and engrossing emotion was sufficiently probable to have been received for truth even if her understanding had been at leisure to examine its credibility without knowing what she sought except the general desire to know the worst of the dreadful report she hurried forward to the very spot which of all others her feelings of the preceding day would have induced her to avoid  who would upon the evening of shrovetide have persuaded the proud the timid the shy the rigidly decorous catharine glover that before mass on ash wednesday she should rush through the streets of perth making her way amidst tumult and confusion with her hair unbound and her dress disarranged to seek the house of that same lover who she had reason to believe had so grossly and indelicately neglected and affronted her as to pursue a low and licentious amour yet so it was and her eagerness taking as if by instinct the road which was most free she avoided the high street where the pressure was greatest and reached the wynd by the narrow lanes on the northern skirt of the town through which henry smith had formerly escorted louise but even these comparatively lonely passages were now astir with passengers so general was the alarm catharine glover made her way through them however while such as observed her looked on each other and shook their heads in sympathy with her distress at length without any distinct idea of her own purpose she stood before her lovers door and knocked for admittance  the silence which succeeded the echoing of her hasty summons increased the alarm which had induced her to take this desperate measure  openopen henry she cried open if you yet live open if you would not find catharine glover dead upon your threshold  as she cried thus frantically to ears which she was taught to believe were stopped by death the lover she invoked opened the door in person just in time to prevent her sinking on the ground the extremity of his ecstatic joy upon an occasion so unexpected was qualified only by the wonder which forbade him to believe it real and by his alarm at the closed eyes half opened and blanched lips total absence of complexion and apparently total cessation of breathing  henry had remained at home in spite of the general alarm which had reached his ears for a considerable time fully determined to put himself in the way of no brawls that he could avoid and it was only in compliance with a summons from the magistrates which as a burgher he was bound to obey that taking his sword and a spare buckler from the wall he was about to go forth for the first time unwillingly to pay his service as his tenure bound him  it is hard he said to be put forward in all the town feuds when the fighting work is so detestable to catharine i am sure there are enough of wenches in perth that say to their gallants go out do your devoir bravely and win your ladys grace and yet they send not for their lovers but for me who cannot do the duties of a man to protect a minstrel woman or of a burgess who fights for the honour of his town but this peevish catharine uses me as if i were a brawler and bordeller  such were the thoughts which occupied his mind when as he opened his door to issue forth the person dearest to his thoughts but whom he certainly least expected to see was present to his eyes and dropped into his arms  his mixture of surprise joy and anxiety did not deprive him of the presence of mind which the occasion demanded to place catharine glover in safety and recall her to herself was to be thought of before rendering obedience to the summons of the magistrates however pressingly that had been delivered he carried his lovely burden as light as a feather yet more precious than the same quantity of purest gold into a small bedchamber which had been his mothers it was the most fit for an invalid as it looked into the garden and was separated from the noise of the tumult  here nursenurse shoolbredcome quickcome for death and lifehere is one wants thy help  up trotted the old dame if it should but prove any one that will keep thee out of the scuffle for she also had been aroused by the noise but what was her astonishment when placed in love and reverence on the bed of her late mistress and supported by the athletic arms of her foster son she saw the apparently lifeless form of the fair maid of perth  catharine glover she said and holy mother a dying woman as it would seem  not so old woman said her foster son the dear heart throbsthe sweet breath comes and returns come thou that may aid her more meetly than ibring wateressenceswhatever thy old skill can devise heaven did not place her in my arms to die but to live for herself and me  with an activity which her age little promised nurse shoolbred collected the means of restoring animation for like many women of the period she understood what was to be done in such cases nay possessed a knowledge of treating wounds of an ordinary description which the warlike propensities of her foster son kept in pretty constant exercise  come now she said son henry unfold your arms from about my patient though she is worth the pressing and set thy hands at freedom to help me with what i want nay i will not insist on your quitting her hand if you will beat the palm gently as the fingers unclose their clenched grasp  i beat her slight beautiful hand said henry you were as well bid me beat a glass cup with a forehammer as tap her fair palm with my horn hard fingers but the fingers do unfold and we will find a better way than beating and he applied his lips to the pretty hand whose motion indicated returning sensation one or two deep sighs succeeded and the fair maid of perth opened her eyes fixed them on her lover as he kneeled by the bedside and again sunk back on the pillow as she withdrew not her hand from her lovers hold or from his grasp we must in charity believe that the return to consciousness was not so complete as to make her aware that he abused the advantage by pressing it alternately to his lips and his bosom at the same time we are compelled to own that the blood was colouring in her cheek and that her breathing was deep and regular for a minute or two during this relapse  the noise at the door began now to grow much louder and henry was called for by all his various names of smith gow and hal of the wynd as heathens used to summon their deities by different epithets at last like portuguese catholics when exhausted with entreating their saints the crowd without had recourse to vituperative exclamations  out upon you henry you are a disgraced man man sworn to your burgher oath and a traitor to the fair city unless you come instantly forth  it would seem that nurse shoolbreds applications were now so far successful that catharines senses were in some measure restored for turning her face more towards that of her lover than her former posture permitted she let her right hand fall on his shoulder leaving her left still in his possession and seeming slightly to detain him while she whispered do not go henrystay with me they will kill thee these men of blood  it would seem that this gentle invocation the result of finding the lover alive whom she expected to have only recognised as a corpse though it was spoken so low as scarcely to be intelligible had more effect to keep henry wynd in his present posture than the repeated summons of many voices from without had to bring him downstairs  mass townsmen cried one hardy citizen to his companions the saucy smith but jests with us let us into the house and bring him out by the lug and the horn  take care what you are doing said a more cautious assailant the man that presses on henry gows retirement may go into his house with sound bones but will return with ready made work for the surgeon but here comes one has good right to do our errand to him and make the recreant hear reason on both sides of his head  the person of whom this was spoken was no other than simon glover himself he had arrived at the fatal spot where the unlucky bonnet makers body was lying just in time to discover to his great relief that when it was turned with the face upwards by bailie craigdallies orders the features of the poor braggart proudfute were recognised when the crowd expected to behold those of their favorite champion henry smith a laugh or something approaching to one went among those who remembered how hard oliver had struggled to obtain the character of a fighting man however foreign to his nature and disposition and remarked now that he had met with a mode of death much better suited to his pretensions than to his temper but this tendency to ill timed mirth which savoured of the rudeness of the times was at once hushed by the voice and cries and exclamations of a woman who struggled through the crowd screaming at the same time oh my husbandmy husband  room was made for the sorrower who was followed by two or three female friends maudie proudfute had been hitherto only noticed as a good looking black haired woman believed to be dink and disdainful to those whom she thought meaner or poorer than herself and lady and empress over her late husband whom she quickly caused to lower his crest when she chanced to hear him crowing out of season but now under the influence of powerful passion she assumed a far more imposing character  do you laugh she said you unworthy burghers of perth because one of your own citizens has poured his blood into the kennel or do you laugh because the deadly lot has lighted on my husband how has he deserved this did he not maintain an honest house by his own industry and keep a creditable board where the sick had welcome and the poor had relief did he not lend to those who wanted stand by his neighbours as a friend keep counsel and do justice like a magistrate  it is trueit is true answered the assembly his blood is our blood as much as if it were henry gows  you speak truth neighbours said bailie craigdallie and this feud cannot be patched up as the former was citizens blood must not flow unavenged down our kennels as if it were ditch water or we shall soon see the broad tay crimsoned with it but this blow was never meant for the poor man on whom it has unhappily fallen every one knew what oliver proudfute was how wide he would speak and how little he would do he has henry smiths buff coat target and head piece all the town know them as well as i do there is no doubt ont he had the trick as you know of trying to imitate the smith in most things some one blind with rage or perhaps through liquor has stricken the innocent bonnet maker whom no man either hated or feared or indeed cared either much or little about instead of the stout smith who has twenty feuds upon his hands  what then is to be done bailie cried the multitude  that my friends your magistrates will determine for you as we shall instantly meet together when sir patrick charteris cometh here which must be anon meanwhile let the chirurgeon dwining examine that poor piece of clay that he may tell us how he came by his fatal death and then let the corpse be decently swathed in a clean shroud as becomes an honest citizen and placed before the high altar in the church of st john the patron of the fair city cease all clamour and noise and every defensible man of you as you would wish well to the fair town keep his weapons in readiness and be prepared to assemble on the high street at the tolling of the common bell from the townhouse and we will either revenge the death of our fellow citizen or else we shall take such fortune as heaven will send us meanwhile avoid all quarrelling with the knights and their followers till we know the innocent from the guilty but wherefore tarries this knave smith he is ready enough in tumults when his presence is not wanted and lags he now when his presence may serve the fair city what ails him doth any one know hath he been upon the frolic last fasterns even  rather he is sick or sullen master bailie said one of the citys mairs or sergeants for though he is within door as his knaves report yet he will neither answer to us nor admit us  so please your worship master bailie said simon glover i will go myself to fetch henry smith i have some little difference to make up with him and blessed be our lady who hath so ordered it that i find him alive as a quarter of an hour since i could never have expected  bring the stout smith to the council house said the bailie as a mounted yeoman pressed through the crowd and whispered in his ear here is a good fellow who says the knight of kinfauns is entering the port  such was the occasion of simon glover presenting himself at the house of henry gow at the period already noticed  unrestrained by the considerations of doubt and hesitation which influenced others he repaired to the parlour and having overheard the bustling of dame shoolbred he took the privilege of intimacy to ascend to the bedroom and with the slight apology of i crave your pardon good neighbour he opened the door and entered the apartment where a singular and unexpected sight awaited him at the sound of his voice may catharine experienced a revival much speedier than dame shoolbreds restoratives had been able to produce and the paleness of her complexion changed into a deep glow of the most lovely red she pushed her lover from her with both her hands which until this minute her want of consciousness or her affection awakened by the events of the morning had well nigh abandoned to his caresses henry smith bashful as we know him stumbled as he rose up and none of the party were without a share of confusion excepting dame shoolbred who was glad to make some pretext to turn her back to the others in order that she might enjoy a laugh at their expense which she felt herself utterly unable to restrain and in which the glover whose surprise though great was of short duration and of a joyful character sincerely joined  now by good st john he said i thought i had seen a sight this morning that would cure me of laughter at least till lent was over but this would make me curl my cheek if i were dying why here stands honest henry smith who was lamented as dead and tolld out for from every steeple in town alive merry and as it seems from his ruddy complexion as like to live as any man in perth and here is my precious daughter that yesterday would speak of nothing but the wickedness of the wights that haunt profane sports and protect glee maidens ay she who set st valentine and st cupid both at defiancehere she is turned a glee maiden herself for what i can see truly i am glad to see that you my good dame shoolbred who give way to no disorder have been of this loving party  you do me wrong my dearest father said catharine as if about to weep i came here with far different expectations than you suppose i only came becausebecause  because you expected to find a dead lover said her father and you have found a living one who can receive the tokens of your regard and return them now were it not a sin i could find in my heart to thank heaven that thou hast been surprised at last into owning thyself a woman simon glover is not worthy to have an absolute saint for his daughter nay look not so piteously nor expect condolence from me only i will try not to look merry if you will be pleased to stop your tears or confess them to be tears of joy  if i were to die for such a confession said poor catharine i could not tell what to call them only believe dear father and let henry believe that i would never have come hither unlessunless  unless you had thought that henry could not come to you said her father and now shake hands in peace and concord and agree as valentines should yesterday was shrovetide henry we will hold that thou hast confessed thy follies hast obtained absolution and art relieved of all the guilt thou stoodest charged with  nay touching that father simon said the smith now that you are cool enough to hear me i can swear on the gospels and i can call my nurse dame shoolbred to witness  naynay said the glover but wherefore rake up differences which should all be forgotten  hark ye simonsimon glover this was now echoed from beneath  true son smith said the glover seriously we have other work in hand you and i must to the council instantly catharine shall remain here with dame shoolbred who will take charge of her till we return and then as the town is in misrule we two harry will carry her home and they will be bold men that cross us  nay my dear father said catharine with a smile now you are taking oliver proudfutes office that doughty burgher is henrys brother at arms  her fathers countenance grew dark  you have spoke a stinging word daughter but you know not what has happened kiss him catharine in token of forgiveness  not so said catharine i have done him too much grace already when he has seen the errant damsel safe home it will be time enough to claim his reward  meantime said henry i will claim as your host what you will not allow me on other terms  he folded the fair maiden in his arms and was permitted to take the salute which she had refused to bestow  as they descended the stair together the old man laid his hand on the smiths shoulder and said henry my dearest wishes are fulfilled but it is the pleasure of the saints that it should be in an hour of difficulty and terror  true said the smith but thou knowest father if our riots be frequent at perth at least they seldom last long  then opening a door which led from the house into the smithy here comrades he cried anton cuthbert dingwell and ringen let none of you stir from the place till i return be as true as the weapons i have taught you to forge a french crown and a scotch merrymaking for you if you obey my command i leave a mighty treasure in your charge watch the doors well let little jannekin scout up and down the wynd and have your arms ready if any one approaches the house open the doors to no man till father glover or i return it concerns my life and happiness  the strong swarthy giants to whom he spoke answered death to him who attempts it  my catharine is now as safe said he to her father as if twenty men garrisoned a royal castle in her cause we shall pass most quietly to the council house by walking through the garden  he led the way through a little orchard accordingly where the birds which had been sheltered and fed during the winter by the good natured artisan early in the season as it was were saluting the precarious smiles of a february sun with a few faint and interrupted attempts at melody  hear these minstrels father said the smith i laughed at them this morning in the bitterness of my heart because the little wretches sung with so much of winter before them but now methinks i could bear a blythe chorus for i have my valentine as they have theirs and whatever ill may lie before me for tomorrow i am today the happiest man in perth city or county burgh or landward  yet i must allay your joy said the old glover though heaven knows i share it poor oliver proudfute the inoffensive fool that you and i knew so well has been found this morning dead in the streets  only dead drunk i trust said the smith nay a candle and a dose of matrimonial advice will bring him to life again  no henryno he is slainslain with a battle axe or some such weapon  impossible replied the smith he was light footed enough and would not for all perth have trusted to his hands when he could extricate himself by his heels  no choice was allowed him the blow was dealt in the very back of his head he who struck must have been a shorter man than himself and used a horsemans battle axe or some such weapon for a lochaber axe must have struck the upper part of his head but there he lies dead brained i may say by a most frightful wound  this is inconceivable said henry wynd he was in my house at midnight in a morricers habit seemed to have been drinking though not to excess he told me a tale of having been beset by revellers and being in danger but alas you know the mani deemed it was a swaggering fit as he sometimes took when he was in liquor and may the merciful virgin forgive me i let him go without company in which i did him inhuman wrong holy st john be my witness i would have gone with any helpless creature and far more with him with whom i have so often sat at the same board and drunken of the same cup who of the race of man could have thought of harming a creature so simple and so unoffending excepting by his idle vaunts  henry he wore thy head piece thy buff coat thy target how came he by these  why he demanded the use of them for the night and i was ill at ease and well pleased to be rid of his company having kept no holiday and being determined to keep none in respect of our misunderstanding  it is the opinion of bailie craigdallie and all our sagest counsellors that the blow was intended for yourself and that it becomes you to prosecute the due vengeance of our fellow citizen who received the death which was meant for you  the smith was for some time silent they had now left the garden and were walking in a lonely lane by which they meant to approach the council house of the burgh without being exposed to observation or idle inquiry  you are silent my son yet we two have much to speak of said simon glover bethink thee that this widowed woman maudlin if she should see cause to bring a charge against any one for the wrong done to her and her orphan children must support it by a champion according to law and custom for be the murderer who he may we know enough of these followers of the nobles to be assured that the party suspected will appeal to the combat in derision perhaps of we whom they will call the cowardly burghers while we are men with blood in our veins this must not be henry wynd  i see where you would draw me father answered henry dejectedly and st john knows i have heard a summons to battle as willingly as war horse ever heard the trumpet but bethink you father how i have lost catharines favour repeatedly and have been driven well nigh to despair of ever regaining it for being if i may say so even too ready a man of my hands and here are all our quarrels made up and the hopes that seemed this morning removed beyond earthly prospect have become nearer and brighter than ever and must i with the dear ones kiss of forgiveness on my lips engage in a new scene of violence which you are well aware will give her the deepest offence  it is hard for me to advise you henry said simon but this i must ask you have you or have you not reason to think that this poor unfortunate oliver has been mistaken for you  i fear it too much said henry he was thought something like me and the poor fool had studied to ape my gestures and manner of walking nay the very airs which i have the trick of whistling that he might increase a resemblance which has cost him dear i have ill willers enough both in burgh and landward to owe me a shrewd turn and he i think could have none such  well henry i cannot say but my daughter will be offended she has been much with father clement and has received notions about peace and forgiveness which methinks suit ill with a country where the laws cannot protect us unless we have spirit to protect ourselves if you determine for the combat i will do my best to persuade her to look on the matter as the other good womanhood in the burgh will do and if you resolve to let the matter restthe man who has lost his life for yours remaining unavenged the widow and the orphans without any reparation for the loss of a husband and fatheri will then do you the justice to think that i at least ought not to think the worse of you for your patience since it was adopted for love of my child but henry we must in that case remove ourselves from bonny st johnston for here we will be but a disgraced family  henry groaned deeply and was silent for an instant then replied i would rather be dead than dishonoured though i should never see her again had it been yester evening i would have met the best blade among these men at arms as blythely as ever i danced at a maypole but today when she had first as good as said henry smith i love thee father glover it is very hard yet it is all my own fault this poor unhappy oliver i ought to have allowed him the shelter of my roof when he prayed me in his agony of fear or had i gone with him i should then have prevented or shared his fate but i taunted him ridiculed him loaded him with maledictions though the saints know they were uttered in idle peevishness of impatience i drove him out from my doors whom i knew so helpless to take the fate which was perhaps intended for me i must avenge him or be dishonoured for ever see father i have been called a man hard as the steel i work in does burnished steel ever drop tears like these shame on me that i should shed them  it is no shame my dearest son said simon thou art as kind as brave and i have always known it there is yet a chance for us no one may be discovered to whom suspicion attaches and where none such is found the combat cannot take place it is a hard thing to wish that the innocent blood may not be avenged but if the perpetrator of this foul murder be hidden for the present thou wilt be saved from the task of seeking that vengeance which heaven doubtless will take at its own proper time  as they spoke thus they arrived at the point of the high street where the council house was situated as they reached the door and made their way through the multitude who thronged the street they found the avenues guarded by a select party of armed burghers and about fifty spears belonging to the knight of kinfauns who with his allies the grays blairs moncrieffs and others had brought to perth a considerable body of horse of which these were a part so soon as the glover and smith presented themselves they were admitted to the chamber in which the magistrates were assembled    chapter xx       a woman wails for justice at the gate      a widowd woman wan and desolate       bertha   the council room of perth presented a singular spectacle in a gloomy apartment ill and inconveniently lighted by two windows of different form and of unequal size were assembled around a large oaken table a group of men of whom those who occupied the higher seats were merchants that is guild brethren or shopkeepers arrayed in decent dresses becoming their station but most of them bearing like the regent york signs of war around their aged necksgorgets namely and baldricks which sustained their weapons the lower places around the table were occupied by mechanics and artisans the presidents or deacons as they were termed of the working classes in their ordinary clothes somewhat better arranged than usual these too wore pieces of armour of various descriptions some had the blackjack or doublets covered with small plates of iron of a lozenge shape which secured through the upper angle hung in rows above each other and which swaying with the motion of the wearers person formed a secure defence to the body others had buff coats which as already mentioned could resist the blow of a sword and even a lances point unless propelled with great force at the bottom of the table surrounded as it was with this varied assembly sat sir louis lundin no military man but a priest and parson of st johns arrayed in his canonical dress and having his pen and ink before him he was town clerk of the burgh and like all the priests of the period who were called from that circumstance the popes knights received the honourable title of dominus contracted into dom or dan or translated into sir the title of reverence due to the secular chivalry  on an elevated seat at the head of the council board was placed sir patrick charteris in complete armour brightly burnisheda singular contrast to the motley mixture of warlike and peaceful attire exhibited by the burghers who were only called to arms occasionally the bearing of the provost while it completely admitted the intimate connexion which mutual interests had created betwixt himself the burgh and the magistracy was at the same time calculated to assert the superiority which in virtue of gentle blood and chivalrous rank the opinions of the age assigned to him over the members of the assembly in which he presided two squires stood behind him one of them holding the knights pennon and another his shield bearing his armorial distinctions being a hand holding a dagger or short sword with the proud motto this is my charter a handsome page displayed the long sword of his master and another bore his lance all which chivalrous emblems and appurtenances were the more scrupulously exhibited that the dignitary to whom they belonged was engaged in discharging the office of a burgh magistrate in his own person the knight of kinfauns appeared to affect something of state and stiffness which did not naturally pertain to his frank and jovial character  so you are come at length henry smith and simon glover said the provost know that you have kept us waiting for your attendance should it so chance again while we occupy this place we will lay such a fine on you as you will have small pleasure in paying enoughmake no excuses they are not asked now and another time they will not be admitted know sirs that our reverend clerk hath taken down in writing and at full length what i will tell you in brief that you may see what is to be required of you henry smith in particular our late fellow citizen oliver proudfute hath been found dead in the high street close by the entrance into the wynd it seemeth he was slain by a heavy blow with a short axe dealt from behind and at unawares and the act by which he fell can only be termed a deed of foul and forethought murder so much for the crime the criminal can only be indicated by circumstances it is recorded in the protocol of the reverend sir louis lundin that divers well reported witnesses saw our deceased citizen oliver proudfute till a late period accompanying the entry of the morrice dancers of whom he was one as far as the house of simon glover in curfew street where they again played their pageant it is also manifested that at this place he separated from the rest of the band after some discourse with simon glover and made an appointment to meet with the others of his company at the sign of the griffin there to conclude the holiday now simon i demand of you whether this be truly stated so far as you know and further what was the purport of the defunct oliver proudfutes discourse with you  my lord provost and very worshipful sir patrick answered simon glover you and this honourable council shall know that touching certain reports which had been made of the conduct of henry smith some quarrel had arisen between myself and another of my family and the said smith here present now this our poor fellow citizen oliver proudfute having been active in spreading these reports as indeed his element lay in such gossipred some words passed betwixt him and me on the subject and as i think he left me with the purpose of visiting henry smith for he broke off from the morrice dancers promising as it seems to meet them as your honour has said at the sign of the griffin in order to conclude the evening but what he actually did i know not as i never again saw him in life  it is enough said sir patrick and agrees with all that we have heard now worthy sirs we next find our poor fellow citizen environed by a set of revellers and maskers who had assembled in the high street by whom he was shamefully ill treated being compelled to kneel down in the street and there to quaff huge quantities of liquor against his inclination until at length he escaped from them by flight this violence was accomplished with drawn swords loud shouts and imprecations so as to attract the attention of several persons who alarmed by the tumult looked out from their windows as well as of one or two passengers who keeping aloof from the light of the torches lest they also had been maltreated beheld the usage which our fellow citizen received in the high street of the burgh and although these revellers were disguised and used vizards yet their disguises were well known being a set of quaint masking habits prepared some weeks ago by command of sir john ramorny master of the horse to his royal highness the duke of rothsay prince royal of scotland  a low groan went through the assembly  yes so it is brave burghers continued sir patrick our inquiries have led us into conclusions both melancholy and terrible but as no one can regret the point at which they seem likely to arrive more than i do so no man living can dread its consequences less it is even so various artisans employed upon the articles have described the dresses prepared for sir john ramornys mask as being exactly similar to those of the men by whom oliver proudfute was observed to be maltreated and one mechanic being wingfield the feather dresser who saw the revellers when they had our fellow citizen within their hands remarked that they wore the cinctures and coronals of painted feathers which he himself had made by the order of the princes master of horse  after the moment of his escape from these revellers we lose all trace of oliver but we can prove that the maskers went to sir john ramornys where they were admitted after some show of delay it is rumoured that thou henry smith sawest our unhappy fellow citizen after he had been in the hands of these revellers what is the truth of the matter  he came to my house in the wynd said henry about half an hour before midnight and i admitted him something unwillingly as he had been keeping carnival while i remained at home and there is ill talk says the proverb betwixt a full man and a fasting  and in which plight seemed he when thou didst admit him said the provost  he seemed answered the smith out of breath and talked repeatedly of having been endangered by revellers i paid but small regard for he was ever a timorous chicken spirited though well meaning man and i held that he was speaking more from fancy than reality but i shall always account it for foul offence in myself that i did not give him my company which he requested and if i live i will found masses for his soul in expiation of my guilt  did he describe those from whom he received the injury said the provost  revellers in masking habits replied henry  and did he intimate his fear of having to do with them on his return again demanded sir patrick  he alluded particularly to his being waylaid which i treated as visionary having been able to see no one in the lane  had he then no help from thee of any kind whatsoever said the provost  yes worshipful replied the smith he exchanged his morrice dress for my head piece buff coat and target which i hear were found upon his body and i have at home his morrice cap and bells with the jerkin and other things pertaining he was to return my garb of fence and get back his own masking suit this day had the saints so permitted  you saw him not then afterwards  never my lord  one word more said the provost have you any reason to think that the blow which slew oliver proudfute was meant for another man  i have answered the smith but it is doubtful and may be dangerous to add such a conjecture which is besides only a supposition  speak it out on your burgher faith and oath for whom think you was the blow meant  if i must speak replied henry i believe oliver proudfute received the fate which was designed for myself the rather that in his folly oliver spoke of trying to assume my manner of walking as well as my dress  have you feud with any one that you form such an idea said sir patrick charteris  to my shame and sin be it spoken i have feud with highland and lowland english and scot perth and angus i do not believe poor oliver had feud with a new hatched chicken alas he was the more fully prepared for a sudden call  hark ye smith said the provost answer me distinctly is there cause of feud between the household of sir john ramorny and yourself  to a certainty my lord there is it is now generally said that black quentin who went over tay to fife some days since was the owner of the hand which was found in couvrefew street upon the eve of st valentine it was i who struck off that hand with a blow of my broadsword as this black quentin was a chamberlain of sir john and much trusted it is like there must be feud between me and his masters dependants  it bears a likely front smith said sir patrick charteris and now good brothers and wise magistrates there are two suppositions each of which leads to the same conclusion the maskers who seized our fellow citizen and misused him in a manner of which his body retains some slight marks may have met with their former prisoner as he returned homewards and finished their ill usage by taking his life he himself expressed to henry gow fears that this would be the case if this be really true one or more of sir john ramornys attendants must have been the assassins but i think it more likely that one or two of the revellers may have remained on the field or returned to it having changed perhaps their disguise and that to those men for oliver proudfute in his own personal appearance would only have been a subject of sport his apparition in the dress and assuming as he proposed to do the manner of henry smith was matter of deep hatred and that seeing him alone they had taken as they thought a certain and safe mode to rid themselves of an enemy so dangerous as all men know henry wynd is accounted by those that are his unfriends the same train of reasoning again rests the guilt with the household of sir john ramorny how think you sirs are we not free to charge the crime upon them  the magistrates whispered together for several minutes and then replied by the voice of bailie craigdallie noble knight and our worthy provost we agree entirely in what your wisdom has spoken concerning this dark and bloody matter nor do we doubt your sagacity in tracing to the fellowship and the company of john ramorny of that ilk the villainy which hath been done to our deceased fellow citizen whether in his own character and capacity or as mistaking him for our brave townsman henry of the wynd but sir john in his own behalf and as the princes master of the horse maintains an extensive household and as of course the charge will be rebutted by a denial we would ask how we shall proceed in that case it is true could we find law for firing the lodging and putting all within it to the sword the old proverb of short rede good rede might here apply for a fouler household of defiers of god destroyers of men and debauchers of women are nowhere sheltered than are in ramornys band but i doubt that this summary mode of execution would scarce be borne out by the laws and no tittle of evidence which i have heard will tend to fix the crime on any single individual or individuals  before the provost could reply the town clerk arose and stroking his venerable beard craved permission to speak which was instantly granted  brethren he said as well in our fathers time as ours hath god on being rightly appealed to condescended to make manifest the crimes of the guilty and the innocence of those who may have been rashly accused let us demand from our sovereign lord king robert who when the wicked do not interfere to pervert his good intentions is as just and clement a prince as our annals can show in their long line in the name of the fair city and of all the commons in scotland that he give us after the fashion of our ancestors the means of appealing to heaven for light upon this dark murder we will demand the proof by bier right often granted in the days of our sovereigns ancestors approved of by bulls and decretals and administered by the great emperor charlemagne in france by king arthur in britain and by gregory the great and the mighty achaius in this our land of scotland  i have heard of the bier right sir louis quoth the provost and i know we have it in our charters of the fair city but i am something ill learned in the ancient laws and would pray you to inform us more distinctly of its nature  we will demand of the king said sir louis lundin my advice being taken that the body of our murdered fellow citizen be transported into the high church of st john and suitable masses said for the benefit of his soul and for the discovery of his foul murder meantime we shall obtain an order that sir john ramorny give up a list of such of his household as were in perth in the course of the night between fasterns even and this ash wednesday and become bound to present them on a certain day and hour to be early named in the high church of st john there one by one to pass before the bier of our murdered fellow citizen and in the form prescribed to call upon god and his saints to bear witness that he is innocent of the acting art or part of the murder and credit me as has been indeed proved by numerous instances that if the murderer shall endeavour to shroud himself by making such an appeal the antipathy which subsists between the dead body and the hand which dealt the fatal blow that divorced it from the soul will awaken some imperfect life under the influence of which the veins of the dead man will pour forth at the fatal wounds the blood which has been so long stagnant in the veins or to speak more certainly it is the pleasure of heaven by some hidden agency which we cannot comprehend to leave open this mode of discovering the wickedness of him who has defaced the image of his creator  i have heard this law talked of said sir patrick and it was enforced in the bruces time this surely is no unfit period to seek by such a mystic mode of inquiry the truth to which no ordinary means can give us access seeing that a general accusation of sir johns household would full surely be met by a general denial yet i must crave farther of sir louis our reverend town clerk how we shall prevent the guilty person from escaping in the interim  the burghers will maintain a strict watch upon the wall drawbridges shall be raised and portcullises lowered from sunset to sunrise and strong patrols maintained through the night this guard the burghers will willingly maintain to secure against the escape of the murderer of their townsman  the rest of the counsellors acquiesced by word sign and look in this proposal  again said the provost what if any one of the suspected household refuse to submit to the ordeal of bier right  he may appeal to that of combat said the reverend city scribe with an opponent of equal rank because the accused person must have his choice in the appeal to the judgment of god by what ordeal he will be tried but if he refuses both he must be held as guilty and so punished  the sages of the council unanimously agreed with the opinion of their provost and town clerk and resolved in all formality to petition the king as a matter of right that the murder of their fellow citizen should be inquired into according to this ancient form which was held to manifest the truth and received as matter of evidence in case of murder so late as towards the end of the 17th century but before the meeting dissolved bailie craigdallie thought it meet to inquire who was to be the champion of maudie or magdalen proudfute and her two children  there need be little inquiry about that said sir patrick charteris we are men and wear swords which should be broken over the head of any one amongst us who will not draw it in behalf of the widow and orphans of our murdered fellow citizen and in brave revenge of his death if sir john ramorny shall personally resent the inquiry patrick charteris of kinfauns will do battle with him to the outrance whilst horse and man may stand or spear and blade hold together but in case the challenger be of yeomanly degree well wot i that magdalen proudfute may choose her own champion among the bravest burghers of perth and shame and dishonour were it to the fair city for ever could she light upon one who were traitor and coward enough to say her nay bring her hither that she may make her election  henry smith heard this with a melancholy anticipation that the poor womans choice would light upon him and that his recent reconciliation with his mistress would be again dissolved by his being engaged in a fresh quarrel from which there lay no honourable means of escape and which in any other circumstances he would have welcomed as a glorious opportunity of distinguishing himself both in sight of the court and of the city he was aware that under the tuition of father clement catharine viewed the ordeal of battle rather as an insult to religion than an appeal to the deity and did not consider it as reasonable that superior strength of arm or skill of weapon should be resorted to as the proof of moral guilt or innocence he had therefore much to fear from her peculiar opinions in this particular refined as they were beyond those of the age she lived in  while he thus suffered under these contending feelings magdalen the widow of the slaughtered man entered the court wrapt in a deep mourning veil and followed and supported by five or six women of good that is of respectability dressed in the same melancholy attire one of her attendants held an infant in her arms the last pledge of poor olivers nuptial affections another led a little tottering creature of two years or thereabouts which looked with wonder and fear sometimes on the black dress in which they had muffled him and sometimes on the scene around him  the assembly rose to receive the melancholy group and saluted them with an expression of the deepest sympathy which magdalen though the mate of poor oliver returned with an air of dignity which she borrowed perhaps from the extremity of her distress sir patrick charteris then stepped forward and with the courtesy of a knight to a female and of a protector to an oppressed and injured widow took the poor womans hand and explained to her briefly by what course the city had resolved to follow out the vengeance due for her husbands slaughter  having with a softness and gentleness which did not belong to his general manner ascertained that the unfortunate woman perfectly understood what was meant he said aloud to the assembly good citizens of perth and freeborn men of guild and craft attend to what is about to pass for it concerns your rights and privileges here stands magdalen proudfute desirous to follow forth the revenge due for the death of her husband foully murdered as she sayeth by sir john ramorny knight of that ilk and which she offers to prove by the evidence of bier right or by the body of a man therefore i patrick charteris being a belted knight and freeborn gentleman offer myself to do battle in her just quarrel whilst man and horse may endure if any one of my degree shall lift my glove how say you magdalen proudfute will you accept me for your champion  the widow answered with difficulty i can desire none nobler  sir patrick then took her right hand in his and kissing her forehead for such was the ceremony said solemnly so may god and st john prosper me at my need as i will do my devoir as your champion knightly truly and manfully go now magdalen and choose at your will among the burgesses of the fair city present or absent any one upon whom you desire to rest your challenge if he against whom you bring plaint shall prove to be beneath my degree  all eyes were turned to henry smith whom the general voice had already pointed out as in every respect the fittest to act as champion on the occasion but the widow waited not for the general prompting of their looks as soon as sir patrick had spoken she crossed the floor to the place where near the bottom of the table the armourer stood among the men of his degree and took him by the hand  henry gow or smith she said good burgher and draftsman mymy  husband she would have said but the word would not come forth she was obliged to change the expression  he who is gone loved and prized you over all men therefore meet it is that thou shouldst follow out the quarrel of his widow and orphans  if there had been a possibility which in that age there was not of henrys rejecting or escaping from a trust for which all men seemed to destine him every wish and idea of retreat was cut off when the widow began to address him and a command from heaven could hardly have made a stronger impression than did the appeal of the unfortunate magdalen her allusion to his intimacy with the deceased moved him to the soul during olivers life doubtless there had been a strain of absurdity in his excessive predilection for henry which considering how very different they were in character had in it something ludicrous but all this was now forgotten and henry giving way to his natural ardour only remembered that oliver had been his friend and intimatea man who had loved and honoured him as much as he was capable of entertaining such sentiments for any one and above all that there was much reason to suspect that the deceased had fallen victim to a blow meant for henry himself  it was therefore with an alacrity which the minute before he could scarce have commanded and which seemed to express a stern pleasure that having pressed his lips to the cold brow of the unhappy magdalen the armourer replied  i henry the smith dwelling in the wynd of perth good man and true and freely born accept the office of champion to this widow magdalen and these orphans and will do battle in their quarrel to the death with any man whomsoever of my own degree and that so long as i shall draw breath so help me at my need god and good st john  there arose from the audience a half suppressed cry expressing the interest which the persons present took in the prosecution of the quarrel and their confidence in the issue  sir patrick charteris then took measures for repairing to the kings presence and demanding leave to proceed with inquiry into the murder of oliver proudfute according to the custom of bier right and if necessary by combat  he performed this duty after the town council had dissolved in a private interview between himself and the king who heard of this new trouble with much vexation and appointed next morning after mass for sir patrick and the parties interested to attend his pleasure in council in the mean time a royal pursuivant was despatched to the constables lodgings to call over the roll of sir john ramornys attendants and charge him with his whole retinue under high penalties to abide within perth until the kings pleasure should be farther known    chapter xxi       in gods name see the lists and all things fit      there let them end itgod defend the right       henry iv part ii   in the same council room of the conventual palace of the dominicans king robert was seated with his brother albany whose affected austerity of virtue and real art and dissimulation maintained so high an influence over the feeble minded monarch it was indeed natural that one who seldom saw things according to their real forms and outlines should view them according to the light in which they were presented to him by a bold astucious man possessing the claim of such near relationship  ever anxious on account of his misguided and unfortunate son the king was now endeavouring to make albany coincide in opinion with him in exculpating rothsay from any part in the death of the bonnet maker the precognition concerning which had been left by sir patrick charteris for his majestys consideration  this is an unhappy matter brother robin he saida most unhappy occurrence and goes nigh to put strife and quarrel betwixt the nobility and the commons here as they have been at war together in so many distant lands i see but one cause of comfort in the matter and that is that sir john ramorny having received his dismissal from the duke of rothsays family it cannot be said that he or any of his people who may have done this bloody deedif it has truly been done by themhave been encouraged or hounded out upon such an errand by my poor boy i am sure brother you and i can bear witness how readily upon my entreaties he agreed to dismiss ramorny from his service on account of that brawl in curfew street  i remember his doing so said albany and well do i hope that the connexion betwixt the prince and ramorny has not been renewed since he seemed to comply with your graces wishes  seemed to comply the connexion renewed said the king what mean you by these expressions brother surely when david promised to me that if that unhappy matter of curfew street were but smothered up and concealed he would part with ramorny as he was a counsellor thought capable of involving him in similar fooleries and would acquiesce in our inflicting on him either exile or such punishment as it should please us to imposesurely you cannot doubt that he was sincere in his professions and would keep his word remember you not that when you advised that a heavy fine should be levied upon his estate in fife in lieu of banishment the prince himself seemed to say that exile would be better for ramorny and even for himself  i remember it well my royal brother nor truly could i have suspected ramorny of having so much influence over the prince after having been accessory to placing him in a situation so perilous had it not been for my royal kinsmans own confession alluded to by your grace that if suffered to remain at court he might still continue to influence his conduct i then regretted i had advised a fine in place of exile but that time is passed and now new mischief has occurred fraught with much peril to your majesty as well as to your royal heir and to the whole kingdom  what mean you robin said the weak minded king by the tomb of our parents by the soul of bruce our immortal ancestor i entreat thee my dearest brother to take compassion on me tell me what evil threatens my son or my kingdom  the features of the king trembling with anxiety and his eyes brimful of tears were bent upon his brother who seemed to assume time for consideration ere he replied  my lord the danger lies here your grace believed that the prince had no accession to this second aggression upon the citizens of perththe slaughter of this bonnet making fellow about whose death they clamour as a set of gulls about their comrade when one of the noisy brood is struck down by a boors shaft  their lives said the king are dear to themselves and their friends robin  truly ay my liege and they make them dear to us too ere we can settle with the knaves for the least blood wit but as i said your majesty thinks the prince had no share in this last slaughter i will not attempt to shake your belief in that delicate point but will endeavour to believe along with you what you think is rule for me robert of albany will never think otherwise than robert of broad scotland  thank you thank you said the king taking his brothers hand i knew i might rely that your affection would do justice to poor heedless rothsay who exposes himself to so much misconstruction that he scarcely deserves the sentiments you feel for him  albany had such an immovable constancy of purpose that he was able to return the fraternal pressure of the kings hand while tearing up by the very roots the hopes of the indulgent fond old man  but alas the duke continued with a sigh this burly intractable knight of kinfauns and his brawling herd of burghers will not view the matter as we do they have the boldness to say that this dead fellow had been misused by rothsay and his fellows who were in the street in mask and revel stopping men and women compelling them to dance or to drink huge quantities of wine with other follies needless to recount and they say that the whole party repaired in sir john ramornys and broke their way into the house in order to conclude their revel there thus affording good reason to judge that the dismissal of sir john from the princes service was but a feigned stratagem to deceive the public and hence they urge that if ill were done that night by sir john ramorny or his followers much it is to be thought that the duke of rothsay must have at least been privy to if he did not authorise it  albany this is dreadful said the king would they make a murderer of my boy would they pretend my david would soil his hands in scottish blood without having either provocation or purpose nono they will not invent calumnies so broad as these for they are flagrant and incredible  pardon my liege answered the duke of albany they say the cause of quarrel which occasioned the riot in curfew street and its consequences were more proper to the prince than to sir john since none suspects far less believes that that hopeful enterprise was conducted for the gratification of the knight of ramorny  thou drivest me mad robin said the king  i am dumb answered his brother i did but speak my poor mind according to your royal order  thou meanest well i know said the king but instead of tearing me to pieces with the display of inevitable calamities were it not kinder robin to point me out some mode to escape from them  true my liege but as the only road of extrication is rough and difficult it is necessary your grace should be first possessed with the absolute necessity of using it ere you hear it even described the chirurgeon must first convince his patient of the incurable condition of a shattered member ere he venture to name amputation though it be the only remedy  the king at these words was roused to a degree of alarm and indignation greater than his brother had deemed he could be awakened to  shattered and mortified member my lord of albany amputation the only remedy these are unintelligible words my lord if thou appliest them to our son rothsay thou must make them good to the letter else mayst thou have bitter cause to rue the consequence  you construe me too literally my royal liege said albany i spoke not of the prince in such unbeseeming terms for i call heaven to witness that he is dearer to me as the son of a well beloved brother than had he been son of my own but i spoke in regard to separating him from the follies and vanities of life which holy men say are like to mortified members and ought like them to be cut off and thrown from us as things which interrupt our progress in better things  i understandthou wouldst have this ramorny who hath been thought the instrument of my sons follies exiled from court said the relieved monarch until these unhappy scandals are forgotten and our subjects are disposed to look upon our son with different and more confiding eyes  that were good counsel my liege but mine went a littlea very littlefarther i would have the prince himself removed for some brief period from court  how albany part with my child my firstborn the light of my eyes andwilful as he isthe darling of my heart oh robin i cannot and i will not  nay i did but suggest my lord i am sensible of the wound such a proceeding must inflict on a parents heart for am i not myself a father and he hung his head as if in hopeless despondency  i could not survive it albany when i think that even our own influence over him which sometimes forgotten in our absence is ever effectual whilst he is with us is by your plan to be entirely removed what perils might he not rush upon i could not sleep in his absencei should hear his death groan in every breeze and you albany though you conceal it better would be nearly as anxious  thus spoke the facile monarch willing to conciliate his brother and cheat himself by taking it for granted that an affection of which there were no traces subsisted betwixt the uncle and nephew  your paternal apprehensions are too easily alarmed my lord said albany i do not propose to leave the disposal of the princes motions to his own wild pleasure i understand that the prince is to be placed for a short time under some becoming restraintthat he should be subjected to the charge of some grave counsellor who must be responsible both for his conduct and his safety as a tutor for his pupil  how a tutor and at rothsays age exclaimed the king he is two years beyond the space to which our laws limit the term of nonage  the wiser romans said albany extended it for four years after the period we assign and in common sense the right of control ought to last till it be no longer necessary and so the time ought to vary with the disposition here is young lindsay the earl of crawford who they say gives patronage to ramorny on this appeal he is a lad of fifteen with the deep passions and fixed purpose of a man of thirty while my royal nephew with much more amiable and noble qualities both of head and heart sometimes shows at twentythree years of age the wanton humours of a boy towards whom restraint may be kindness and do not be discouraged that it is so my liege or angry with your brother for telling the truth since the best fruits are those that are slowest in ripening and the best horses such as give most trouble to the grooms who train them for the field or lists  the duke stopped and after suffering king robert to indulge for two or three minutes in a reverie which he did not attempt to interrupt he added in a more lively tone but cheer up my noble liege perhaps the feud may be made up without farther fighting or difficulty the widow is poor for her husband though he was much employed had idle and costly habits the matter may be therefore redeemed for money and the amount of an assythment may be recovered out of ramornys estate  nay that we will ourselves discharge said king robert eagerly catching at the hope of a pacific termination of this unpleasing debate ramornys prospects will be destroyed by his being sent from court and deprived of his charge in rothsays household and it would be ungenerous to load a falling man but here comes our secretary the prior to tell us the hour of council approaches good morrow my worthy father  benedicite my royal liege answered the abbot  now good father continued the king without waiting for rothsay whose accession to our counsels we will ourselves guarantee proceed we to the business of our kingdom what advices have you from the douglas  he has arrived at his castle of tantallon my liege and has sent a post to say that though the earl of march remains in sullen seclusion in his fortress of dunbar his friends and followers are gathering and forming an encampment near coldingham where it is supposed they intend to await the arrival of a large force of english which hotspur and sir ralph percy are assembling on the english frontier  that is cold news said the king and may god forgive george of dunbar  the prince entered as he spoke and he continued ha thou art here at length rothsay i saw thee not at mass  i was an idler this morning said the prince having spent a restless and feverish night  ah foolish boy answered the king hadst thou not been over restless on fasterns eve thou hadst not been feverish on the night of ash wednesday  let me not interrupt your praying my liege said the prince lightly your grace was invoking heaven in behalf of some onean enemy doubtless for these have the frequent advantage of your orisons  sit down and be at peace foolish youth said his father his eye resting at the same time on the handsome face and graceful figure of his favourite son rothsay drew a cushion near to his fathers feet and threw himself carelessly down upon it while the king resumed  i was regretting that the earl of march having separated warm from my hand with full assurance that he should receive compensation for everything which he could complain of as injurious should have been capable of caballing with northumberland against his own country is it possible he could doubt our intentions to make good our word  i will answer for himno said the prince march never doubted your highnesss word marry he may well have made question whether your learned counsellors would leave your majesty the power of keeping it  robert the third had adopted to a great extent the timid policy of not seeming to hear expressions which being heard required even in his own eyes some display of displeasure he passed on therefore in his discourse without observing his sons speech but in private rothsays rashness augmented the displeasure which his father began to entertain against him  it is well the douglas is on the marches said the king his breast like those of his ancestors has ever been the best bulwark of scotland  then woe betide us if he should turn his back to the enemy said the incorrigible rothsay  dare you impeach the courage of douglas replied the king extremely chafed  no man dare question the earls courage said rothsay it is as certain as his pride but his luck may be something doubted  by st andrew david exclaimed his father thou art like a screech owl every word thou sayest betokens strife and calamity  i am silent father answered the youth  and what news of our highland disturbances continued the king addressing the prior  i trust they have assumed a favourable aspect answered the clergyman the fire which threatened the whole country is likely to be drenched out by the blood of some forty or fifty kerne for the two great confederacies have agreed by solemn indenture of arms to decided their quarrel with such weapons as your highness may name and in your royal presence in such place as shall be appointed on the 30th of march next to come being palm sunday the number of combatants being limited to thirty on each side and the fight to be maintained to extremity since they affectionately make humble suit and petition to your majesty that you will parentally condescend to waive for the day your royal privilege of interrupting the combat by flinging down of truncheon or crying of ho until the battle shall be utterly fought to an end  the wild savages exclaimed the king would they limit our best and dearest royal privilege that of putting a stop to strife and crying truce to battle will they remove the only motive which could bring me to the butcherly spectacle of their combat would they fight like men or like their own mountain wolves  my lord said albany the earl of crawford and i had presumed without consulting you to ratify that preliminary for the adoption of which we saw much and pressing reason  how the earl of crawford said the king methinks he is a young counsellor on such grave occurrents  he is replied albany notwithstanding his early years of such esteem among his highland neighbours that i could have done little with them but for his aid and influence  hear this young rothsay said the king reproachfully to his heir  i pity crawford sire replied the prince he has too early lost a father whose counsels would have better become such a season as this  the king turned next towards albany with a look of triumph at the filial affection which his son displayed in his reply  albany proceeded without emotion it is not the life of these highlandmen but their death which is to be profitable to this commonwealth of scotland and truly it seemed to the earl of crawford and myself most desirable that the combat should be a strife of extermination  marry said the prince if such be the juvenile policy of lindsay he will be a merciful ruler some ten or twelve years hence out upon a boy that is hard of heart before he has hair upon his lip better he had contented himself with fighting cocks on fasterns even than laying schemes for massacring men on palm sunday as if he were backing a welsh main where all must fight to death  rothsay is right albany said the king it were unlike a christian monarch to give way in this point i cannot consent to see men battle until they are all hewn down like cattle in the shambles it would sicken me to look at it and the warder would drop from my hand for mere lack of strength to hold it  it would drop unheeded said albany let me entreat your grace to recollect that you only give up a royal privilege which exercised would win you no respect since it would receive no obedience were your majesty to throw down your warder when the war is high and these mens blood is hot it would meet no more regard than if a sparrow should drop among a herd of battling wolves the straw which he was carrying to his nest nothing will separate them but the exhaustion of slaughter and better they sustain it at the hands of each other than from the swords of such troops as might attempt to separate them at your majestys commands an attempt to keep the peace by violence would be construed into an ambush laid for them both parties would unite to resist it the slaughter would be the same and the hoped for results of future peace would be utterly disappointed  there is even too much truth in what you say brother robin replied the flexible king to little purpose is it to command what i cannot enforce and although i have the unhappiness to do so each day of my life it were needless to give such a very public example of royal impotency before the crowds who may assemble to behold this spectacle let these savage men therefore work their bloody will to the uttermost upon each other i will not attempt to forbid what i cannot prevent them from executing heaven help this wretched country i will to my oratory and pray for her since to aid her by hand and head is alike denied to me father prior i pray the support of your arm  nay but brother said albany forgive me if i remind you that we must hear the matter between the citizens of perth and ramorny about the death of a townsman  truetrue said the monarch reseating himself more violencemore battle oh scotland scotland if the best blood of thy bravest children could enrich thy barren soil what land on earth would excel thee in fertility when is it that a white hair is seen on the beard of a scottishman unless he be some wretch like thy sovereign protected from murder by impotence to witness the scenes of slaughter to which he cannot put a period let them come in delay them not they are in haste to kill and grudge each other each fresh breath of their creators blessed air the demon of strife and slaughter hath possessed the whole land  as the mild prince threw himself back on his seat with an air of impatience and anger not very usual with him the door at the lower end of the room was unclosed and advancing from the gallery into which it led where in perspective was seen a guard of the bute men or brandanes under arms came in mournful procession the widow of poor oliver led by sir patrick charteris with as much respect as if she had been a lady of the first rank behind them came two women of good the wives of magistrates of the city both in mourning garments one bearing the infant and the other leading the elder child the smith followed in his best attire and wearing over his buff coat a scarf of crape bailie craigdallie and a brother magistrate closed the melancholy procession exhibiting similar marks of mourning  the good kings transitory passion was gone the instant he looked at the pallid countenance of the sorrowing widow and beheld the unconsciousness of the innocent orphans who had sustained so great a loss and when sir patrick charteris had assisted magdalen proudfute to kneel down and still holding her hand kneeled himself on one knee it was with a sympathetic tone that king robert asked her name and business she made no answer but muttered something looking towards her conductor  speak for the poor woman sir patrick charteris said the king and tell us the cause of her seeking our presence  so please you my liege answered sir patrick rising up this woman and these unhappy orphans make plaint to your highness upon sir john ramorny of ramorny knight that by him or by some of his household her umquhile husband oliver proudfute freeman and burgess of perth was slain upon the streets of the city on the eve of shrove tuesday or morning of ash wednesday  woman replied the king with much kindness thou art gentle by sex and shouldst be pitiful even by thy affliction for our own calamity ought to make usnay i think it doth make usmerciful to others thy husband hath only trodden the path appointed to us all  in his case said the widow my liege must remember it has been a brief and a bloody one  i agree he hath had foul measure but since i have been unable to protect him as i confess was my royal duty i am willing in atonement to support thee and these orphans as well or better than you lived in the days of your husband only do thou pass from this charge and be not the occasion of spilling more life remember i put before you the choice betwixt practising mercy and pursuing vengeance and that betwixt plenty and penury  it is true my liege we are poor answered the widow with unshaken firmness but i and my children will feed with the beasts of the field ere we live on the price of my husbands blood i demand the combat by my champion as you are belted knight and crowned king  i knew it would be so said the king aside to albany in scotland the first words stammered by an infant and the last uttered by a dying greybeard are combatbloodrevenge it skills not arguing farther admit the defendants  sir john ramorny entered the apartment he was dressed in a long furred robe such as men of quality wore when they were unarmed concealed by the folds of drapery his wounded arm was supported by a scarf or sling of crimson silk and with the left arm he leaned on a youth who scarcely beyond the years of boyhood bore on his brow the deep impression of early thought and premature passion this was that celebrated lindsay earl of crawford who in his after days was known by the epithet of the tiger earl and who ruled the great and rich valley of strathmore with the absolute power and unrelenting cruelty of a feudal tyrant two or three gentlemen friends of the earl or of his own countenanced sir john ramorny by their presence on this occasion the charge was again stated and met by a broad denial on the part of the accused and in reply the challengers offered to prove their assertion by an appeal to the ordeal of bier right  i am not bound answered sir john ramorny to submit to this ordeal since i can prove by the evidence of my late royal master that i was in my own lodgings lying on my bed ill at ease while this provost and these bailies pretend i was committing a crime to which i had neither will nor temptation i can therefore be no just object of suspicion  i can aver said the prince that i saw and conversed with sir john ramorny about some matters concerning my own household on the very night when this murder was adoing i therefore know that he was ill at ease and could not in person commit the deed in question but i know nothing of the employment of his attendants and will not take it upon me to say that some one of them may not have been guilty of the crime now charged on them  sir john ramorny had during the beginning of this speech looked round with an air of defiance which was somewhat disconcerted by the concluding sentence of rothsays speech  i thank your highness he said with a smile for your cautious and limited testimony in my behalf he was wise who wrote put not your faith in princes  if you have no other evidence of your innocence sir john ramorny said the king we may not in respect to your followers refuse to the injured widow and orphans the complainers the grant of a proof by ordeal of bier right unless any of them should prefer that of combat for yourself you are by the princes evidence freed from the attaint  my liege answered sir john i can take warrant upon myself for the innocence of my household and followers  why so a monk or a woman might speak said sir patrick charteris in knightly language wilt thou sir john de ramorny do battle with me in the behalf of thy followers  the provost of perth had not obtained time to name the word combat said ramorny ere i would have accepted it but i am not at present fit to hold a lance  i am glad of it under your favour sir john there will be the less bloodshed said the king you must therefore produce your followers according to your stewards household book in the great church of st john that in presence of all whom it may concern they may purge themselves of this accusation see that every man of them do appear at the time of high mass otherwise your honour may be sorely tainted  they shall attend to a man said sir john ramorny  then bowing low to the king he directed himself to the young duke of rothsay and making a deep obeisance spoke so as to be heard by him alone you have used me generously my lord one word of your lips could have ended this controversy and you have refused to speak it  on my life whispered the prince i spake as far as the extreme verge of truth and conscience would permit i think thou couldst not expect i should frame lies for thee and after all john in my broken recollections of that night i do bethink me of a butcherly looking mute with a curtal axe much like such a one as may have done yonder night job ha have i touched you sir knight  ramorny made no answer but turned as precipitately as if some one had pressed suddenly on his wounded arm and regained his lodgings with the earl of crawford to whom though disposed for anything rather than revelry he was obliged to offer a splendid collation to acknowledge in some degree his sense of the countenance which the young noble had afforded him    chapter xxii       in pottingry he wrocht great pyne      he murdreit mony in medecyne       dunbar   when after an entertainment the prolonging of which was like torture to the wounded knight the earl of crawford at length took horse to go to his distant quarters in the castle of dupplin where he resided as a guest the knight of ramorny retired into his sleeping apartment agonized by pains of body and anxiety of mind here he found henbane dwining on whom it was his hard fate to depend for consolation in both respects the physician with his affectation of extreme humility hoped he saw his exalted patient merry and happy  merry as a mad dog said ramorny and happy as the wretch whom the cur hath bitten and who begins to feel the approach of the ravening madness that ruthless boy crawford saw my agony and spared not a single carouse i must do him justice forsooth if i had done justice to him and to the world i had thrown him out of window and cut short a career which if he grew up as he has begun will prove a source of misery to all scotland but especially to tayside take heed as thou undoest the ligatures chirurgeon the touch of a flys wing on that raw glowing stump were like a dagger to me  fear not my noble patron said the leech with a chuckling laugh of enjoyment which he vainly endeavoured to disguise under a tone of affected sensibility we will apply some fresh balsam andhe he herelieve your knightly honour of the irritation which you sustain so firmly  firmly man said ramorny grinning with pain i sustain it as i would the scorching flames of purgatory the bone seems made of red hot iron thy greasy ointment will hiss as it drops upon the wound and yet it is decembers ice compared to the fever fit of my mind  we will first use our emollients upon the body my noble patron said dwining and then with your knighthoods permission your servant will try his art on the troubled mind though i fain hope even the mental pain also may in some degree depend on the irritation of the wound and that abated as i trust the corporeal pangs will soon be perhaps the stormy feelings of the mind may subside of themselves  henbane dwining said the patient as he felt the pain of his wound assuaged thou art a precious and invaluable leech but some things are beyond thy power thou canst stupify my bodily cause of this raging agony but thou canst not teach me to bear the score of the boy whom i have brought upwhom i loved dwiningfor i did love himdearly love him the worst of my ill deeds have been to flatter his vices and he grudged me a word of his mouth when a word would have allayed this cumber he smiled tooi saw him smilewhen yon paltry provost the companion and patron of wretched burghers defied me whom this heartless prince knew to be unable to bear arms ere i forget or forgive it thou thyself shalt preach up the pardoning of injuries and then the care for tomorrow thinkst thou henbane dwining that in very reality the wounds of the slaughtered corpse will gape and shed tears of fresh blood at the murderers approach  i cannot tell my lord save by report said dwining which avouches the fact  the brute bonthron said ramorny is startled at the apprehension of such a thing and speaking of being rather willing to stand the combat what thinkst thou he is a fellow of steel  it is the armourers trade to deal with steel replied dwining  were bonthron to fall it would little grieve me said ramorny though i should miss an useful hand  i well believe your lordship will not sorrow as for that you lost in curfew street excuse my pleasantry he he but what are the useful properties of this fellow bonthron  those of a bulldog answered the knight he worries without barking  you have no fear of his confessing said the physician  who can tell what the dread of approaching death may do replied the patient he has already shown a timorousness entirely alien from his ordinary sullenness of nature he that would scarce wash his hands after he had slain a man is now afraid to see a dead body bleed  well said the leech i must do something for him if i can since it was to further my revenge that he struck yonder downright blow though by ill luck it lighted not where it was intended  and whose fault was that timid villain said ramorny save thine own who marked a rascal deer for a buck of the first head  benedicite noble sir replied the mediciner would you have me who know little save of chamber practice be as skilful of woodcraft as your noble self or tell hart from hind doe from roe in a glade at midnight i misdoubted me little when i saw the figure run past us to the smiths habitation in the wynd habited like a morrice dancer and yet my mind partly misgave me whether it was our man for methought he seemed less of stature but when he came out again after so much time as to change his dress and swaggered onward with buff coat and steel cap whistling after the armourers wonted fashion i do own i was mistaken super totam materiem and loosed your knighthoods bulldog upon him who did his devoir most duly though he pulled down the wrong deer therefore unless the accursed smith kill our poor friend stone dead on the spot i am determined if art may do it that the ban dog bonthron shall not miscarry  it will put thine art to the test man of medicine said ramorny for know that having the worst of the combat if our champion be not killed stone dead in the lists he will be drawn forth of them by the heels and without further ceremony knitted up to the gallows as convicted of the murder and when he hath swung there like a loose tassel for an hour or so i think thou wilt hardly take it in hand to cure his broken neck  i am of a different opinion may it please your knighthood answered dwining gently i will carry him off from the very foot of the gallows into the land of faery like king arthur or sir huon of bordeaux or ugero the dane or i will if i please suffer him to dangle on the gibbet for a certain number of minutes or hours and then whisk him away from the sight of all with as much ease as the wind wafts away the withered leaf  this is idle boasting sir leech replied ramorny the whole mob of perth will attend him to the gallows each more eager than another to see the retainer of a nobleman die for the slaughter of a cuckoldly citizen there will be a thousand of them round the gibbets foot  and were there ten thousand said dwining shall i who am a high clerk and have studied in spain and araby itself not be able to deceive the eyes of this hoggish herd of citizens when the pettiest juggler that ever dealt in legerdemain can gull even the sharp observation of your most intelligent knighthood i tell you i will put the change on them as if i were in possession of keddies ring  if thou speakest truth answered the knight and i think thou darest not palter with me on such a theme thou must have the aid of satan and i will have nought to do with him i disown and defy him  dwining indulged in his internal chuckling laugh when he heard his patron testify his defiance of the foul fiend and saw him second it by crossing himself he composed himself however upon observing ramornys aspect become very stern and said with tolerable gravity though a little interrupted by the effort necessary to suppress his mirthful mood  confederacy most devout sirconfederacy is the soul of jugglery buthe he hei have not the honour to behe hean ally of the gentleman of whom you speakin whose existence i amhe heno very profound believer though your knightship doubtless hath better opportunities of acquaintance  proceed rascal and without that sneer which thou mayst otherwise dearly pay for  i will most undaunted replied dwining know that i have my confederate too else my skill were little worth  and who may that be pray you  stephen smotherwell if it like your honour lockman of this fair city i marvel your knighthood knows him not  and i marvel thy knaveship knows him not on professional acquaintance replied ramorny but i see thy nose is unslit thy ears yet uncropped and if thy shoulders are scarred or branded thou art wise for using a high collared jerkin  he he your honour is pleasant said the mediciner it is not by personal circumstances that i have acquired the intimacy of stephen smotherwell but on account of a certain traffic betwixt us in which ant please you i exchange certain sums of silver for the bodies heads and limbs of those who die by aid of friend stephen  wretch exclaimed the knight with horror is it to compose charms and forward works of witchcraft that you trade for these miserable relics of mortality  he he he no an it please your knighthood answered the mediciner much amused with the ignorance of his patron but we who are knights of the scalpel are accustomed to practise careful carving of the limbs of defunct persons which we call dissection whereby we discover by examination of a dead member how to deal with one belonging to a living man which hath become diseased through injury or otherwise ah if your honour saw my poor laboratory i could show you heads and hands feet and lungs which have been long supposed to be rotting in the mould the skull of wallace stolen from london bridge the head of sir simon fraser the famous ancestor of the lovats slain at halidon hill executed in london in 1306 that never feared man the lovely skull of the fair katie logie should be margaret logie the beautiful mistress of david ii oh had i but had the fortune to have preserved the chivalrous hand of mine honoured patron  out upon thee slave thinkest thou to disgust me with thy catalogue of horrors tell me at once where thy discourse drives how can thy traffic with the hangdog executioner be of avail to serve me or to help my servant bonthron  nay i do not recommend it to your knighthood save in an extremity replied dwining but we will suppose the battle fought and our cock beaten now we must first possess him with the certainty that if unable to gain the day we will at least save him from the hangman provided he confess nothing which can prejudice your knighthoods honour  ha ay a thought strikes me said ramorny we can do more than this we can place a word in bonthrons mouth that will be troublesome enough to him whom i am bound to curse for being the cause of my misfortune let us to the ban dogs kennel and explain to him what is to be done in every view of the question if we can persuade him to stand the bier ordeal it may be a mere bugbear and in that case we are safe if he take the combat he is fierce as a baited bear and may perchance master his opponent then we are more than safe we are avenged if bonthron himself is vanquished we will put thy device in exercise and if thou canst manage it cleanly we may dictate his confession take the advantage of it as i will show thee on further conference and make a giant stride towards satisfaction for my wrongs still there remains one hazard suppose our mastiff mortally wounded in the lists who shall prevent his growling out some species of confession different from what we would recommend  marry that can his mediciner said dwining let me wait on him and have the opportunity to lay but a finger on his wound and trust me he shall betray no confidence  why theres a willing fiend that needs neither pushing nor prompting said ramorny  as i trust i shall need neither in your knighthoods service  we will go indoctrinate our agent continued the knight we shall find him pliant for hound as he is he knows those who feed from those who browbeat him and he holds a late royal master of mine in deep hate for some injurious treatment and base terms which he received at his hand i must also farther concert with thee the particulars of thy practice for saving the ban dog from the hands of the herd of citizens  we leave this worthy pair of friends to their secret practices of which we shall afterwards see the results they were although of different qualities as well matched for device and execution of criminal projects as the greyhound is to destroy the game which the slowhound raises or the slowhound to track the prey which the gazehound discovers by the eye pride and selfishness were the characteristics of both but from the difference of rank education and talents they had assumed the most different appearance in the two individuals  nothing could less resemble the high blown ambition of the favourite courtier the successful gallant and the bold warrior than the submissive unassuming mediciner who seemed even to court and delight in insult whilst in his secret soul he felt himself possessed of a superiority of knowledge a power both of science and of mind which placed the rude nobles of the day infinitely beneath him so conscious was henbane dwining of this elevation that like a keeper of wild beasts he sometimes adventured for his own amusement to rouse the stormy passions of such men as ramorny trusting with his humble manner to elude the turmoil he had excited as an indian boy will launch his light canoe secure from its very fragility upon a broken surf in which the boat of an argosy would be assuredly dashed to pieces that the feudal baron should despise the humble practitioner in medicine was a matter of course but ramorny felt not the less the influence which dwining exercised over him and was in the encounter of their wits often mastered by him as the most eccentric efforts of a fiery horse are overcome by a boy of twelve years old if he has been bred to the arts of the manege but the contempt of dwining for ramorny was far less qualified he regarded the knight in comparison with himself as scarcely rising above the brute creation capable indeed of working destruction as the bull with his horns or the wolf with his fangs but mastered by mean prejudices and a slave to priest craft in which phrase dwining included religion of every kind on the whole he considered ramorny as one whom nature had assigned to him as a serf to mine for the gold which he worshipped and the avaricious love of which was his greatest failing though by no means his worst vice he vindicated this sordid tendency in his own eyes by persuading himself that it had its source in the love of power  henbane dwining he said as he gazed in delight upon the hoards which he had secretly amassed and which he visited from time to time is no silly miser that doats on those pieces for their golden lustre it is the power with which they endow the possessor which makes him thus adore them what is there that these put not within your command do you love beauty and are mean deformed infirm and old here is a lure the fairest hawk of them all will stoop to are you feeble weak subject to the oppression of the powerful here is that will arm in your defence those more mighty than the petty tyrant whom you fear are you splendid in your wishes and desire the outward show of opulence this dark chest contains many a wide range of hill and dale many a fair forest full of game the allegiance of a thousand vassals wish you for favour in courts temporal or spiritual the smiles of kings the pardon of popes and priests for old crimes and the indulgence which encourages priest ridden fools to venture on new onesall these holy incentives to vice may be purchased for gold revenge itself which the gods are said to reserve to themselves doubtless because they envy humanity so sweet a morselrevenge itself is to be bought by it but it is also to be won by superior skill and that is the nobler mode of reaching it i will spare then my treasure for other uses and accomplish my revenge gratis or rather i will add the luxury of augmented wealth to the triumph of requited wrongs  thus thought dwining as returned from his visit to sir john ramorny he added the gold he had received for his various services to the mass of his treasure and having gloated over the whole for a minute or two turned the key on his concealed treasure house and walked forth on his visits to his patients yielding the wall to every man whom he met and bowing and doffing his bonnet to the poorest burgher that owned a petty booth nay to the artificers who gained their precarious bread by the labour of their welked hands  caitiffs was the thought of his heart while he did such obeisancebase sodden witted mechanics did you know what this key could disclose what foul weather from heaven would prevent your unbonneting what putrid kennel in your wretched hamlet would be disgusting enough to make you scruple to fall down and worship the owner of such wealth but i will make you feel my power though it suits my honour to hide the source of it i will be an incubus to your city since you have rejected me as a magistrate like the night mare i will hag ride ye yet remain invisible myself this miserable ramorny too he who in losing his hand has like a poor artisan lost the only valuable part of his frame he heaps insulting language on me as if anything which he can say had power to chafe a constant mind like mine yet while he calls me rogue villain and slave he acts as wisely as if he should amuse himself by pulling hairs out of my head while my hand had hold of his heart strings every insult i can pay back instantly by a pang of bodily pain or mental agony andhe hei run no long accounts with his knighthood that must be allowed  while the mediciner was thus indulging his diabolical musing and passing in his creeping manner along the street the cry of females was heard behind him  ay there he is our lady be praisedthere is the most helpful man in perth said one voice  they may speak of knights and kings for redressing wrongs as they call it but give me worthy master dwining the potter carrier cummers replied another  at the same moment the leech was surrounded and taken hold of by the speakers good women of the fair city  how now whats the matter said dwining whose cow has calved  there is no calving in the case said one of the women but a poor fatherless wean dying so come awa wi you for our trust is constant in you as bruce said to donald of the isles  opiferque per orbem dicor said henbane dwining what is the child dying of  the croupthe croup screamed one of the gossips the innocent is rouping like a corbie  cynanche trachealisthat disease makes brief work show me the house instantly continued the mediciner who was in the habit of exercising his profession liberally not withstanding his natural avarice and humanely in spite of his natural malignity as we can suspect him of no better principle his motive most probably may have been vanity and the love of his art  he would nevertheless have declined giving his attendance in the present case had he known whither the kind gossips were conducting him in time sufficient to frame an apology but ere he guessed where he was going the leech was hurried into the house of the late oliver proudfute from which he heard the chant of the women as they swathed and dressed the corpse of the umquhile bonnet maker for the ceremony of next morning of which chant the following verses may be received as a modern imitation       viewless essence thin and bare      well nigh melted into air      still with fondness hovering near      the earthly form thou once didst wear       pause upon thy pinions flight      be thy course to left or right      be thou doomd to soar or sink      pause upon the awful brink       to avenge the deed expelling      thee untimely from thy dwelling      mystic force thou shalt retain      oer the blood and oer the brain       when the form thou shalt espy      that darkend on thy closing eye      when the footstep thou shalt hear      that thrilld upon thy dying ear       then strange sympathies shall wake      the flesh shall thrill the nerves shall quake      the wounds renew their clotterd flood      and every drop cry blood for blood  hardened as he was the physician felt reluctance to pass the threshold of the man to whose death he had been so directly though so far as the individual was concerned mistakingly accessory  let me pass on women he said my art can only help the livingthe dead are past our power  nay but your patient is upstairsthe youngest orphandwining was compelled to go into the house but he was surprised when the instant he stepped over the threshold the gossips who were busied with the dead body stinted suddenly in their song while one said to the others  in gods name who entered that was a large gout of blood  not so said another voice it is a drop of the liquid balm  nay cummer it was blood again i say who entered the house even now  one looked out from the apartment into the little entrance where dwining under pretence of not distinctly seeing the trap ladder by which he was to ascend into the upper part of this house of lamentation was delaying his progress purposely disconcerted with what had reached him of the conversation  nay it is only worthy master henbane dwining answered one of the sibyls  only master dwining replied the one who had first spoken in a tone of acquiescenceour best helper in need then it must have been balm sure enough  nay said the other it may have been blood nevertheless for the leech look you when the body was found was commanded by the magistrates to probe the wound with his instruments and how could the poor dead corpse know that that was done with good purpose  ay truly cummer and as poor oliver often mistook friends for enemies while he was in life his judgment cannot be thought to have mended now  dwining heard no more being now forced upstairs into a species of garret where magdalen sat on her widowed bed clasping to her bosom her infant which already black in the face and uttering the gasping crowing sound which gives the popular name to the complaint seemed on the point of rendering up its brief existence a dominican monk sat near the bed holding the other child in his arms and seeming from time to time to speak a word or two of spiritual consolation or intermingle some observation on the childs disorder  the mediciner cast upon the good father a single glance filled with that ineffable disdain which men of science entertain against interlopers his own aid was instant and efficacious he snatched the child from the despairing mother stripped its throat and opened a vein which as it bled freely relieved the little patient instantaneously in a brief space every dangerous symptom disappeared and dwining having bound up the vein replaced the infant in the arms of the half distracted mother  the poor womans distress for her husbands loss which had been suspended during the extremity of the childs danger now returned on magdalen with the force of an augmented torrent which has borne down the dam dike that for a while interrupted its waves  oh learned sir she said you see a poor woman of her that you once knew a richer but the hands that restored this bairn to my arms must not leave this house empty generous kind master dwining accept of his beads they are made of ebony and silver he aye liked to have his things as handsome as any gentleman and liker he was in all his ways to a gentleman than any one of his standing and even so came of it  with these words in a mute passion of grief she pressed to her breast and to her lips the chaplet of her deceased husband and proceeded to thrust it into dwinings hands  take it she said for the love of one who loved you well ah he used ever to say if ever man could be brought back from the brink of the grave it must be by master dwinings guidance and his ain bairn is brought back this blessed day and he is lying there stark and stiff and kens naething of its health and sickness oh woe is me and walawa but take the beads and think on his puir soul as you put them through your fingers he will be freed from purgatory the sooner that good people pray to assoilzie him  take back your beads cummer i know no legerdemain can do no conjuring tricks said the mediciner who more moved than perhaps his rugged nature had anticipated endeavoured to avoid receiving the ill omened gift but his last words gave offence to the churchman whose presence he had not recollected when he uttered them  how now sir leech said the dominican do you call prayers for the dead juggling tricks i know that chaucer the english maker says of you mediciners that your study is but little on the bible our mother the church hath nodded of late but her eyes are now opened to discern friends from foes and be well assured  nay reverend father said dwining you take me at too great advantage i said i could do no miracles and was about to add that as the church certainly could work such conclusions those rich beads should be deposited in your hands to be applied as they may best benefit the soul of the deceased  he dropped the beads into the dominicans hand and escaped from the house of mourning  this was a strangely timed visit he said to himself when he got safe out of doors i hold such things cheap as any can yet though it is but a silly fancy i am glad i saved the squalling childs life but i must to my friend smotherwell whom i have no doubt to bring to my purpose in the matter of bonthron and thus on this occasion i shall save two lives and have destroyed only one    chapter xxiii       lo where he lies embalmed in gore      his wound to heaven cries      the floodgates of his blood implore      for vengeance from the skies       uranus and psyche   the high church of st john in perth being that of the patron saint of the burgh had been selected by the magistrates as that in which the community was likely to have most fair play for the display of the ordeal the churches and convents of the dominicans carthusians and others of the regular clergy had been highly endowed by the king and nobles and therefore it was the universal cry of the city council that their ain good auld st john of whose good graces they thought themselves sure ought to be fully confided in and preferred to the new patrons for whom the dominicans carthusians carmelites and others had founded newer seats around the fair city the disputes between the regular and secular clergy added to the jealousy which dictated this choice of the spot in which heaven was to display a species of miracle upon a direct appeal to the divine decision in a case of doubtful guilt and the town clerk was as anxious that the church of st john should be preferred as if there had been a faction in the body of saints for and against the interests of the beautiful town of perth  many therefore were the petty intrigues entered into and disconcerted for the purpose of fixing on the church but the magistrates considering it as a matter touching in a close degree the honour of the city determined with judicious confidence in the justice and impartiality of their patron to confide the issue to the influence of st john  it was therefore after high mass had been performed with the greatest solemnity of which circumstances rendered the ceremony capable and after the most repeated and fervent prayers had been offered to heaven by the crowded assembly that preparations were made for appealing to the direct judgment of heaven on the mysterious murder of the unfortunate bonnet maker  the scene presented that effect of imposing solemnity which the rites of the catholic church are so well qualified to produce the eastern window richly and variously painted streamed down a torrent of chequered light upon the high altar on the bier placed before it were stretched the mortal remains of the murdered man his arms folded on his breast and his palms joined together with the fingers pointed upwards as if the senseless clay was itself appealing to heaven for vengeance against those who had violently divorced the immortal spirit from its mangled tenement  close to the bier was placed the throne which supported robert of scotland and his brother albany the prince sat upon a lower stool beside his fatheran arrangement which occasioned some observation as albanys seat being little distinguished from that of the king the heir apparent though of full age seemed to be degraded beneath his uncle in the sight of the assembled people of perth the bier was so placed as to leave the view of the body it sustained open to the greater part of the multitude assembled in the church  at the head of the bier stood the knight of kinfauns the challenger and at the foot the young earl of crawford as representing the defendant the evidence of the duke of rothsay in expurgation as it was termed of sir john ramorny had exempted him from the necessity of attendance as a party subjected to the ordeal and his illness served as a reason for his remaining at home his household including those who though immediately in waiting upon sir john were accounted the princes domestics and had not yet received their dismissal amounted to eight or ten persons most of them esteemed men of profligate habits and who might therefore be deemed capable in the riot of a festival evening of committing the slaughter of the bonnet maker they were drawn up in a row on the left side of the church and wore a species of white cassock resembling the dress of a penitentiary all eyes being bent on them several of this band seemed so much disconcerted as to excite among the spectators strong prepossessions of their guilt the real murderer had a countenance incapable of betraying hima sullen dark look which neither the feast nor wine cup could enliven and which the peril of discovery and death could not render dejected  we have already noticed the posture of the dead body the face was bare as were the breast and arms the rest of the corpse was shrouded in a winding sheet of the finest linen so that if blood should flow from any place which was covered it could not fail to be instantly manifest  high mass having been performed followed by a solemn invocation to the deity that he would be pleased to protect the innocent and make known the guilty eviot sir john ramornys page was summoned to undergo the ordeal he advanced with an ill assured step perhaps he thought his internal consciousness that bonthron must have been the assassin might be sufficient to implicate him in the murder though he was not directly accessory to it he paused before the bier and his voice faltered as he swore by all that was created in seven days and seven nights by heaven by hell by his part of paradise and by the god and author of all that he was free and sackless of the bloody deed done upon the corpse before which he stood and on whose breast he made the sign of the cross in evidence of the appeal no consequences ensued the body remained stiff as before the curdled wounds gave no sign of blood  the citizens looked on each other with faces of blank disappointment they had persuaded themselves of eviots guilt and their suspicions had been confirmed by his irresolute manner their surprise at his escape was therefore extreme the other followers of ramorny took heart and advanced to take the oath with a boldness which increased as one by one they performed the ordeal and were declared by the voice of the judges free and innocent of every suspicion attaching to them on account of the death of oliver proudfute  but there was one individual who did not partake that increasing confidence the name of bonthronbonthron sounded three times through the aisles of the church but he who owned it acknowledged the call no otherwise than by a sort of shuffling motion with his feet as if he had been suddenly affected with a fit of the palsy  speak dog whispered eviot or prepare for a dogs death  but the murderers brain was so much disturbed by the sight before him that the judges beholding his deportment doubted whether to ordain him to be dragged before the bier or to pronounce judgment in default and it was not until he was asked for the last time whether he would submit to the ordeal that he answered with his usual brevity  i will not what do i know what juggling tricks may be practised to take a poor mans life i offer the combat to any man who says i harmed that dead body  and according to usual form he threw his glove upon the floor of the church  henry smith stepped forward amidst the murmured applauses of his fellow citizens which even the august presence could not entirely suppress and lifting the ruffians glove which he placed in his bonnet laid down his own in the usual form as a gage of battle but bonthron raised it not  he is no match for me growled the savage nor fit to lift my glove i follow the prince of scotland in attending on his master of horse this fellow is a wretched mechanic  here the prince interrupted him thou follow me caitiff i discharge thee from my service on the spot take him in hand smith and beat him as thou didst never thump anvil the villain is both guilty and recreant it sickens me even to look at him and if my royal father will be ruled by me he will give the parties two handsome scottish axes and we will see which of them turns out the best fellow before the day is half an hour older  this was readily assented to by the earl of crawford and sir patrick charteris the godfathers of the parties who as the combatants were men of inferior rank agreed that they should fight in steel caps buff jackets and with axes and that as soon as they could be prepared for the combat  the lists were appointed in the skinners yardsa neighbouring space of ground occupied by the corporation from which it had the name and who quickly cleared a space of about thirty feet by twentyfive for the combatants thither thronged the nobles priests and commonsall excepting the old king who detesting such scenes of blood retired to his residence and devolved the charge of the field upon the earl of errol lord high constable to whose office it more particularly belonged the duke of albany watched the whole proceeding with a close and wary eye his nephew gave the scene the heedless degree of notice which corresponded with his character  when the combatants appeared in the lists nothing could be more striking than the contrast betwixt the manly cheerful countenance of the smith whose sparkling bright eye seemed already beaming with the victory he hoped for and the sullen downcast aspect of the brutal bonthron who looked as if he were some obscene bird driven into sunshine out of the shelter of its darksome haunts they made oath severally each to the truth of his quarrela ceremony which henry gow performed with serene and manly confidence bonthron with a dogged resolution which induced the duke of rothsay to say to the high constable didst thou ever my dear errol behold such a mixture of malignity cruelty and i think fear as in that fellows countenance  he is not comely said the earl but a powerful knave as i have seen  ill gage a hogshead of wine with you my good lord that he loses the day henry the armourer is as strong as he and much more active and then look at his bold bearing there is something in that other fellow that is loathsome to look upon let them yoke presently my dear constable for i am sick of beholding him  the high constable then addressed the widow who in her deep weeds and having her children still beside her occupied a chair within the lists woman do you willingly accept of this man henry the smith to do battle as your champion in this cause  i doi do most willingly answered magdalen proudfute and may the blessing of god and st john give him strength and fortune since he strikes for the orphan and fatherless  then i pronounce this a fenced field of battle said the constable aloud let no one dare upon peril of his life to interrupt this combat by word speech or look sound trumpets and fight combatants  the trumpets flourished and the combatants advancing from the opposite ends of the lists with a steady and even pace looked at each other attentively well skilled in judging from the motion of the eye the direction in which a blow was meditated they halted opposite to and within reach of each other and in turn made more than one feint to strike in order to ascertain the activity and vigilance of the opponent at length whether weary of these manoeuvres or fearing lest in a contest so conducted his unwieldy strength would be foiled by the activity of the smith bonthron heaved up his axe for a downright blow adding the whole strength of his sturdy arms to the weight of the weapon in its descent the smith however avoided the stroke by stepping aside for it was too forcible to be controlled by any guard which he could have interposed ere bonthron recovered guard henry struck him a sidelong blow on the steel headpiece which prostrated him on the ground  confess or die said the victor placing his foot on the body of the vanquished and holding to his throat the point of the axe which terminated in a spike or poniard  i will confess said the villain glaring wildly upwards on the sky let me rise  not till you have yielded said harry smith  i do yield again murmured bonthron and henry proclaimed aloud that his antagonist was defeated  the dukes of rothsay and albany the high constable and the dominican prior now entered the lists and addressing bonthron demanded if he acknowledged himself vanquished  i do answered the miscreant  and guilty of the murder of oliver proudfute  i am but i mistook him for another  and whom didst thou intend to slay said the prior confess my son and merit thy pardon in another world for with this thou hast little more to do  i took the slain man answered the discomfited combatant for him whose hand has struck me down whose foot now presses me  blessed be the saints said the prior now all those who doubt the virtue of the holy ordeal may have their eyes opened to their error lo he is trapped in the snare which he laid for the guiltless  i scarce ever saw the man said the smith i never did wrong to him or his ask him an it please your reverence why he should have thought of slaying me treacherously  it is a fitting question answered the prior give glory where it is due my son even though it is manifested by thy shame for what reason wouldst thou have waylaid this armourer who says he never wronged thee  he had wronged him whom i served answered bonthron and i meditated the deed by his command  by whose command asked the prior  bonthron was silent for an instant then growled out he is too mighty for me to name  hearken my son said the churchman tarry but a brief hour and the mighty and the mean of this earth shall to thee alike be empty sounds the sledge is even now preparing to drag thee to the place of execution therefore son once more i charge thee to consult thy souls weal by glorifying heaven and speaking the truth was it thy master sir john ramorny that stirred thee to so foul a deed  no answered the prostrate villain it was a greater than he and at the same time he pointed with his finger to the prince  wretch said the astonished duke of rothsay do you dare to hint that i was your instigator  you yourself my lord answered the unblushing ruffian  die in thy falsehood accursed slave said the prince and drawing his sword he would have pierced his calumniator had not the lord high constable interposed with word and action  your grace must forgive my discharging mine office this caitiff must be delivered into the hands of the executioner he is unfit to be dealt with by any other much less by your highness  what noble earl said albany aloud and with much real or affected emotion would you let the dog pass alive from hence to poison the peoples ears with false accusations against the prince of scotland i say cut him to mammocks upon the spot  your highness will pardon me said the earl of errol i must protect him till his doom is executed  then let him be gagged instantly said albany and you my royal nephew why stand you there fixed in astonishment call your resolution upspeak to the prisonerswearprotest by all that is sacred that you knew not of this felon deed see how the people look on each other and whisper apart my life ont that this lie spreads faster than any gospel truth speak to them royal kinsman no matter what you say so you be constant in denial  what sir said rothsay starting from his pause of surprise and mortification and turning haughtily towards his uncle would you have me gage my royal word against that of an abject recreant let those who can believe the son of their sovereign the descendant of bruce capable of laying ambush for the life of a poor mechanic enjoy the pleasure of thinking the villains tale true  that will not i for one said the smith bluntly i never did aught but what was in honour towards his royal grace the duke of rothsay and never received unkindness from him in word look or deed and i cannot think he would have given aim to such base practice  was it in honour that you threw his highness from the ladder in curfew street upon fasterns st valentines even said bonthron or think you the favour was received kindly or unkindly  this was so boldly said and seemed so plausible that it shook the smiths opinion of the princes innocence  alas my lord said he looking sorrowfully towards rothsay could your highness seek an innocent fellows life for doing his duty by a helpless maiden i would rather have died in these lists than live to hear it said of the bruces heir  thou art a good fellow smith said the prince but i cannot expect thee to judge more wisely than others away with that convict to the gallows and gibbet him alive an you will that he may speak falsehood and spread scandal on us to the last prolonged moment of his existence  so saying the prince turned away from the lists disdaining to notice the gloomy looks cast towards him as the crowd made slow and reluctant way for him to pass and expressing neither surprise nor displeasure at a deep hollow murmur or groan which accompanied his retreat only a few of his own immediate followers attended him from the field though various persons of distinction had come there in his train even the lower class of citizens ceased to follow the unhappy prince whose former indifferent reputation had exposed him to so many charges of impropriety and levity and around whom there seemed now darkening suspicions of the most atrocious nature  he took his slow and thoughtful way to the church of the dominicans but the ill news which flies proverbially fast had reached his fathers place of retirement before he himself appeared on entering the palace and inquiring for the king the duke of rothsay was surprised to be informed that he was in deep consultation with the duke of albany who mounting on horseback as the prince left the lists had reached the convent before him he was about to use the privilege of his rank and birth to enter the royal apartment when maclouis the commander of the guard of brandanes gave him to understand in the most respectful terms that he had special instructions which forbade his admittance  go at least maclouis and let them know that i wait their pleasure said the prince if my uncle desires to have the credit of shutting the fathers apartment against the son it will gratify him to know that i am attending in the outer hall like a lackey  may it please you said maclouis with hesitation if your highness would consent to retire just now and to wait awhile in patience i will send to acquaint you when the duke of albany goes and i doubt not that his majesty will then admit your grace to his presence at present your highness must forgive me it is impossible you can have access  i understand you maclouis but go nevertheless and obey my commands  the officer went accordingly and returned with a message that the king was indisposed and on the point of retiring to his private chamber but that the duke of albany would presently wait upon the prince of scotland  it was however a full half hour ere the duke of albany appeareda period of time which rothsay spent partly in moody silence and partly in idle talk with maclouis and the brandanes as the levity or irritability of his temper obtained the ascendant  at length the duke came and with him the lord high constable whose countenance expressed much sorrow and embarrassment  fair kinsman said the duke of albany i grieve to say that it is my royal brothers opinion that it will be best for the honour of the royal family that your royal highness do restrict yourself for a time to the seclusion of the high constables lodgings and accept of the noble earl here present for your principal if not sole companion until the scandals which have been this day spread abroad shall be refuted or forgotten  how is this my lord of errol said the prince in astonishment is your house to be my jail and is your lordship to be my jailer  the saints forbid my lord said the earl of errol but it is my unhappy duty to obey the commands of your father by considering your royal highness for some time as being under my ward  the princethe heir of scotland under the ward of the high constable what reason can be given for this is the blighting speech of a convicted recreant of strength sufficient to tarnish my royal escutcheon  while such accusations are not refuted and denied my kinsman said the duke of albany they will contaminate that of a monarch  denied my lord exclaimed the prince by whom are they asserted save by a wretch too infamous even by his own confession to be credited for a moment though a beggars character not a princes were impeached fetch him hither let the rack be shown to him you will soon hear him retract the calumny which he dared to assert  the gibbet has done its work too surely to leave bonthron sensible to the rack said the duke of albany he has been executed an hour since  and why such haste my lord said the prince know you it looks as if there were practice in it to bring a stain on my name  the custom is universal the defeated combatant in the ordeal of battle is instantly transferred from the lists to the gallows and yet fair kinsman continued the duke of albany if you had boldly and strongly denied the imputation i would have judged right to keep the wretch alive for further investigation but as your highness was silent i deemed it best to stifle the scandal in the breath of him that uttered it  st mary my lord but this is too insulting do you my uncle and kinsman suppose me guilty of prompting such an useless and unworthy action as that which the slave confessed  it is not for me to bandy question with your highness otherwise i would ask whether you also mean to deny the scarce less unworthy though less bloody attack upon the house in couvrefew street be not angry with me kinsman but indeed your sequestering yourself for some brief space from the court were it only during the kings residence in this city where so much offence has been given is imperiously demanded  rothsay paused when he heard this exhortation and looking at the duke in a very marked manner replied  uncle you are a good huntsman you have pitched your toils with much skill but you would have been foiled not withstanding had not the stag rushed among the nets of free will god speed you and may you have the profit by this matter which your measures deserve say to my father i obey his arrest my lord high constable i wait only your pleasure to attend you to your lodgings since i am to lie in ward i could not have desired a kinder or more courteous warden  the interview between the uncle and nephew being thus concluded the prince retired with the earl of errol to his apartments the citizens whom they met in the streets passing to the further side when they observed the duke of rothsay to escape the necessity of saluting one whom they had been taught to consider as a ferocious as well as unprincipled libertine the constables lodgings received the owner and his princely guest both glad to leave the streets yet neither feeling easy in the situation which they occupied with regard to each other within doors  we must return to the lists after the combat had ceased and when the nobles had withdrawn the crowds were now separated into two distinct bodies that which made the smallest in number was at the same time the most distinguished for respectability consisting of the better class of inhabitants of perth who were congratulating the successful champion and each other upon the triumphant conclusion to which they had brought their feud with the courtiers the magistrates were so much elated on the occasion that they entreated sir patrick charteriss acceptance of a collation in the town hall to this henry the hero of the day was of course invited or he was rather commanded to attend he listened to the summons with great embarrassment for it may be readily believed his heart was with catharine glover but the advice of his father simon decided him that veteran citizen had a natural and becoming deference for the magistracy of the fair city he entertained a high estimation of all honours which flowed from such a source and thought that his intended son in law would do wrong not to receive them with gratitude  thou must not think to absent thyself from such a solemn occasion son henry was his advice sir patrick charteris is to be there himself and i think it will be a rare occasion for thee to gain his goodwill it is like he may order of thee a new suit of harness and i myself heard worthy bailie craigdallie say there was a talk of furbishing up the citys armoury thou must not neglect the good trade now that thou takest on thee an expensive family  tush father glover answered the embarrassed victor i lack no custom and thou knowest there is catharine who may wonder at my absence and have her ear abused once more by tales of glee maidens and i wot not what  fear not for that said the glover but go like an obedient burgess where thy betters desire to have thee i do not deny that it will cost thee some trouble to make thy peace with catharine about this duel for she thinks herself wiser in such matters than king and council kirk and canons provost and bailies but i will take up the quarrel with her myself and will so work for thee that though she may receive thee tomorrow with somewhat of a chiding it shall melt into tears and smiles like an april morning that begins with a mild shower away with thee then my son and be constant to the time tomorrow morning after mass  the smith though reluctantly was obliged to defer to the reasoning of his proposed father in law and once determined to accept the honour destined for him by the fathers of the city he extricated himself from the crowd and hastened home to put on his best apparel in which he presently afterwards repaired to the council house where the ponderous oak table seemed to bend under the massy dishes of choice tay salmon and delicious sea fish from dundee being the dainties which the fasting season permitted whilst neither wine ale nor metheglin were wanting to wash them down the waits or minstrels of the burgh played during the repast and in the intervals of the music one of them recited with great emphasis a long poetical account of the battle of blackearnside fought by sir william wallace and his redoubted captain and friend thomas of longueville against the english general sewarda theme perfectly familiar to all the guests who nevertheless more tolerant than their descendants listened as if it had all the zest of novelty it was complimentary to the ancestor of the knight of kinfauns doubtless and to other perthshire families in passages which the audience applauded vociferously whilst they pledged each other in mighty draughts to the memory of the heroes who had fought by the side of the champion of scotland the health of henry wynd was quaffed with repeated shouts and the provost announced publicly that the magistrates were consulting how they might best invest him with some distinguished privilege or honorary reward to show how highly his fellow citizens valued his courageous exertions  nay take it not thus an it like your worships said the smith with his usual blunt manner lest men say that valour must be rare in perth when they reward a man for fighting for the right of a forlorn widow i am sure there are many scores of stout burghers in the town who would have done this days dargue as well or better than i for in good sooth i ought to have cracked yonder fellows head piece like an earthen pipkinay and would have done it too if it had not been one which i myself tempered for sir john ramorny but an the fair city think my service of any worth i will conceive it far more than acquitted by any aid which you may afford from the common good to the support of the widow magdalen and her poor orphans  that may well be done said sir patrick charteris and yet leave the fair city rich enough to pay her debts to henry wynd of which every man of us is a better judge than him self who is blinded with an unavailing nicety which men call modesty and if the burgh be too poor for this the provost will bear his share the rovers golden angels have not all taken flight yet  the beakers were now circulated under the name of a cup of comfort to the widow and anon flowed around once more to the happy memory of the murdered oliver now so bravely avenged in short it was a feast so jovial that all agreed nothing was wanting to render it perfect but the presence of the bonnet maker himself whose calamity had occasioned the meeting and who had usually furnished the standing jest at such festive assemblies had his attendance been possible it was drily observed by bailie craigdallie he would certainly have claimed the success of the day and vouched himself the avenger of his own murder  at the sound of the vesper bell the company broke up some of the graver sort going to evening prayers where with half shut eyes and shining countenances they made a most orthodox and edifying portion of a lenten congregation others to their own homes to tell over the occurrences of the fight and feast for the information of the family circle and some doubtless to the licensed freedoms of some tavern the door of which lent did not keep so close shut as the forms of the church required henry returned to the wynd warm with the good wine and the applause of his fellow citizens and fell asleep to dream of perfect happiness and catharine glover  we have said that when the combat was decided the spectators were divided into two bodies of these when the more respectable portion attended the victor in joyous procession much the greater number or what might be termed the rabble waited upon the subdued and sentenced bonthron who was travelling in a different direction and for a very opposite purpose whatever may be thought of the comparative attractions of the house of mourning and of feasting under other circumstances there can be little doubt which will draw most visitors when the question is whether we would witness miseries which we are not to share or festivities of which we are not to partake accordingly the tumbril in which the criminal was conveyed to execution was attended by far the greater proportion of the inhabitants of perth  a friar was seated in the same car with the murderer to whom he did not hesitate to repeat under the seal of confession the same false asseveration which he had made upon the place of combat which charged the duke of rothsay with being director of the ambuscade by which the unfortunate bonnet maker had suffered the same falsehood he disseminated among the crowd averring with unblushing effrontery to those who were nighest to the car that he owed his death to his having been willing to execute the duke of rothsays pleasure for a time he repeated these words sullenly and doggedly in the manner of one reciting a task or a liar who endeavours by reiteration to obtain a credit for his words which he is internally sensible they do not deserve but when he lifted up his eyes and beheld in the distance the black outline of a gallows at least forty feet high with its ladder and its fatal cord rising against the horizon he became suddenly silent and the friar could observe that he trembled very much  be comforted my son said the good priest you have confessed the truth and received absolution your penitence will be accepted according to your sincerity and though you have been a man of bloody hands and cruel heart yet by the churchs prayers you shall be in due time assoilzied from the penal fires of purgatory  these assurances were calculated rather to augment than to diminish the terrors of the culprit who was agitated by doubts whether the mode suggested for his preservation from death would to a certainty be effectual and some suspicion whether there was really any purpose of employing them in his favour for he knew his master well enough to be aware of the indifference with which he would sacrifice one who might on some future occasion be a dangerous evidence against him  his doom however was sealed and there was no escaping from it they slowly approached the fatal tree which was erected on a bank by the rivers side about half a mile from the walls of the citya site chosen that the body of the wretch which was to remain food for the carrion crows might be seen from a distance in every direction here the priest delivered bonthron to the executioner by whom he was assisted up the ladder and to all appearance despatched according to the usual forms of the law he seemed to struggle for life for a minute but soon after hung still and inanimate the executioner after remaining upon duty for more than half an hour as if to permit the last spark of life to be extinguished announced to the admirers of such spectacles that the irons for the permanent suspension of the carcass not having been got ready the concluding ceremony of disembowelling the dead body and attaching it finally to the gibbet would be deferred till the next morning at sunrise  notwithstanding the early hour which he had named master smotherwell had a reasonable attendance of rabble at the place of execution to see the final proceedings of justice with its victim but great was the astonishment and resentment of these amateurs to find that the dead body had been removed from the gibbet they were not however long at a loss to guess the cause of its disappearance bonthron had been the follower of a baron whose estates lay in fife and was himself a native of that province what was more natural than that some of the fife men whose boats were frequently plying on the river should have clandestinely removed the body of their countryman from the place of public shame the crowd vented their rage against smotherwell for not completing his job on the preceding evening and had not he and his assistant betaken themselves to a boat and escaped across the tay they would have run some risk of being pelted to death the event however was too much in the spirit of the times to be much wondered at its real cause we shall explain in the following chapter    chapter xxiv       let gallows gape for dogs let men go free       henry v   the incidents of a narrative of this kind must be adapted to each other as the wards of a key must tally accurately with those of the lock to which it belongs the reader however gentle will not hold himself obliged to rest satisfied with the mere fact that such and such occurrences took place which is generally speaking all that in ordinary life he can know of what is passing around him but he is desirous while reading for amusement of knowing the interior movements occasioning the course of events this is a legitimate and reasonable curiosity for every man hath a right to open and examine the mechanism of his own watch put together for his proper use although he is not permitted to pry into the interior of the timepiece which for general information is displayed on the town steeple  it would be therefore uncourteous to leave my readers under any doubt concerning the agency which removed the assassin bonthron from the gallowsan event which some of the perth citizens ascribed to the foul fiend himself while others were content to lay it upon the natural dislike of bonthrons countrymen of fife to see him hanging on the river side as a spectacle dishonourable to their province  about midnight succeeding the day when the execution had taken place and while the inhabitants of perth were deeply buried in slumber three men muffled in their cloaks and bearing a dark lantern descended the alleys of a garden which led from the house occupied by sir john ramorny to the banks of the tay where a small boat lay moored to a landing place or little projecting pier the wind howled in a low and melancholy manner through the leafless shrubs and bushes and a pale moon waded as it is termed in scotland amongst drifting clouds which seemed to threaten rain the three individuals entered the boat with great precaution to escape observation one of them was a tall powerful man another short and bent downwards the third middle sized and apparently younger than his companions well made and active thus much the imperfect light could discover they seated themselves in the boat and unmoored it from the pier  we must let her drift with the current till we pass the bridge where the burghers still keep guard and you know the proverb a perth arrow hath a perfect flight said the most youthful of the party who assumed the office of helmsman and pushed the boat off from the pier whilst the others took the oars which were muffled and rowed with all precaution till they attained the middle of the river they then ceased their efforts lay upon their oars and trusted to the steersman for keeping her in mid channel  in this manner they passed unnoticed or disregarded beneath the stately gothic arches of the old bridge erected by the magnificent patronage of robert bruce in 1329 and carried away by an inundation in 1621 although they heard the voices of a civic watch which since these disturbances commenced had been nightly maintained in that important pass no challenge was given and when they were so far down the stream as to be out of hearing of these guardians of the night they began to row but still with precaution and to converse though in a low tone  you have found a new trade comrade since i left you said one of the rowers to the other i left you engaged in tending a sick knight and i find you employed in purloining a dead body from the gallows  a living body so please your squirehood master buncle or else my craft hath failed of its purpose  so i am told master pottercarrier but saving your clerkship unless you tell me your trick i will take leave to doubt of its success  a simple toy master buncle not likely to please a genius so acute as that of your valiancie marry thus it is this suspension of the human body which the vulgar call hanging operates death by apoplexiathat is the blood being unable to return to the heart by the compression of the veins it rushes to the brain and the man dies also and as an additional cause of dissolution the lungs no longer receive the needful supply of the vital air owing to the ligature of the cord around the thorax and hence the patient perishes  i understand that well enough but how is such a revulsion of blood to the brain to be prevented sir mediciner said the third person who was no other than ramornys page eviot  marry then replied dwining hang me the patient up in such fashion that the carotid arteries shall not be compressed and the blood will not determine to the brain and apoplexia will not take place and again if there be no ligature around the thorax the lungs will be supplied with air whether the man be hanging in the middle heaven or standing on the firm earth  all this i conceive said eviot but how these precautions can be reconciled with the execution of the sentence of hanging is what my dull brain cannot comprehend  ah good youth thy valiancie hath spoiled a fair wit hadst thou studied with me thou shouldst have learned things more difficult than this but here is my trick i get me certain bandages made of the same substance with your young valiancies horse girths having especial care that they are of a kind which will not shrink on being strained since that would spoil my experiment one loop of this substance is drawn under each foot and returns up either side of the leg to a cincture with which it is united these cinctures are connected by divers straps down the breast and back in order to divide the weight and there are sundry other conveniences for easing the patient but the chief is this the straps or ligatures are attached to a broad steel collar curving outwards and having a hook or two for the better security of the halter which the friendly executioner passes around that part of the machine instead of applying it to the bare throat of the patient thus when thrown off from the ladder the sufferer will find himself suspended not by his neck if it please you but by the steel circle which supports the loops in which his feet are placed and on which his weight really rests diminished a little by similar supports under each arm thus neither vein nor windpipe being compressed the man will breathe as free and his blood saving from fright and novelty of situation will flow as temperately as your valiancies when you stand up in your stirrups to view a field of battle  by my faith a quaint and rare device quoth buncle  is it not pursued the leech and well worth being known to such mounting spirits as your valiancies since there is no knowing to what height sir john ramornys pupils may arrive and if these be such that it is necessary to descend from them by a rope you may find my mode of management more convenient than the common practice marry but you must be provided with a high collared doublet to conceal the ring of steel and above all such a bonus socius as smother well to adjust the noose  base poison vender said eviot men of our calling die on the field of battle  i will save the lesson however replied buncle in case of some pinching occasion but what a night the bloody hangdog bonthron must have had of it dancing a pavise in mid air to the music of his own shackles as the night wind swings him that way and this  it were an alms deed to leave him there said eviot for his descent from the gibbet will but encourage him to new murders he knows but two elementsdrunkenness and bloodshed  perhaps sir john ramorny might have been of your opinion said dwining but it would first have been necessary to cut out the rogues tongue lest he had told strange tales from his airy height and there are other reasons that it concerns not your valiancies to know in truth i myself have been generous in serving him for the fellow is built as strong as edinburgh castle and his anatomy would have matched any that is in the chirurgical hall of padua but tell me master buncle what news bring you from the doughty douglas  they may tell that know said buncle i am the dull ass that bears the message and kens nought of its purport the safer for myself perhaps i carried letters from the duke of albany and from sir john ramorny to the douglas and he looked black as a northern tempest when he opened them i brought them answers from the earl at which they smiled like the sun when the harvest storm is closing over him go to your ephemerides leech and conjure the meaning out of that  methinks i can do so without much cost of wit said the chirurgeon but yonder i see in the pale moonlight our dead alive should he have screamed out to any chance passenger it were a curious interruption to a night journey to be hailed from the top of such a gallows as that hark methinks i do hear his groans amid the whistling of the wind and the creaking of the chains sofair and softly make fast the boat with the grappling and get out the casket with my matters we would be better for a little fire but the light might bring observation on us come on my men of valour march warily for we are bound for the gallows foot follow with the lantern i trust the ladder has been left       sing three merry men and three merry men      and three merry men are we      thou on the land and i on the sand      and jack on the gallows tree  as they advanced to the gibbet they could plainly hear groans though uttered in a low tone dwining ventured to give a low cough once or twice by way of signal but receiving no answer we had best make haste said he to his companions for our friend must be in extremis as he gives no answer to the signal which announces the arrival of help come let us to the gear i will go up the ladder first and cut the rope do you two follow one after another and take fast hold of the body so that he fall not when the halter is unloosed keep sure gripe for which the bandages will afford you convenience bethink you that though he plays an owls part tonight he hath no wings and to fall out of a halter may be as dangerous as to fall into one  while he spoke thus with sneer and gibe he ascended the ladder and having ascertained that the men at arms who followed him had the body in their hold he cut the rope and then gave his aid to support the almost lifeless form of the criminal  by a skilful exertion of strength and address the body of bonthron was placed safely on the ground and the faint yet certain existence of life having been ascertained it was thence transported to the river side where shrouded by the bank the party might be best concealed from observation while the leech employed himself in the necessary means of recalling animation with which he had taken care to provide himself  for this purpose he first freed the recovered person from his shackles which the executioner had left unlocked on purpose and at the same time disengaged the complicated envelopes and bandages by which he had been suspended it was some time ere dwinings efforts succeeded for in despite of the skill with which his machine had been constructed the straps designed to support the body had stretched so considerably as to occasion the sense of suffocation becoming extremely overpowering but the address of the surgeon triumphed over all obstacles and after sneezing and stretching himself with one or two brief convulsions bonthron gave decided proofs of reanimation by arresting the hand of the operator as it was in the act of dropping strong waters on his breast and throat and directing the bottle which contained them to his lips he took almost perforce a considerable gulp of the contents  it is spiritual essence double distilled said the astonished operator and would blister the throat and burn the stomach of any other man but this extraordinary beast is so unlike all other human creatures that i should not wonder if it brought him to the complete possession of his faculties  bonthron seemed to confirm this he started with a strong convulsion sat up stared around and indicated some consciousness of existence  winewine were the first words which he articulated  the leech gave him a draught of medicated wine mixed with water he rejected it under the dishonourable epithet of kennel washings and again uttered the words winewine  nay take it to thee i the devils name said the leech since none but he can judge of thy constitution  a draught long and deep enough to have discomposed the intellects of any other person was found effectual in recalling those of bonthron to a more perfect state though he betrayed no recollection of where he was or what had befallen him and in his brief and sullen manner asked why he was brought to the river side at this time of night  another frolic of the wild prince for drenching me as he did before nails and blood but i would  hold thy peace interrupted eviot and be thankful i pray you if you have any thankfulness in you that thy body is not crows meat and thy soul in a place where water is too scarce to duck thee  i begin to bethink me said the ruffian and raising the flask to his mouth which he saluted with a long and hearty kiss he set the empty bottle on the earth dropped his head on his bosom and seemed to muse for the purpose of arranging his confused recollections  we can abide the issue of his meditations no longer said dwining he will be better after he has slept up sir you have been riding the air these some hours try if the water be not an easier mode of conveyance your valours must lend me a hand i can no more lift this mass than i could raise in my arms a slaughtered bull  stand upright on thine own feet bonthron now we have placed thee upon them said eviot  i cannot answered the patient every drop of blood tingles in my veins as if it had pinpoints and my knees refuse to bear their burden what can be the meaning of all this this is some practice of thine thou dog leech  ayay so it is honest bonthron said dwininga practice thou shalt thank me for when thou comest to learn it in the mean while stretch down in the stern of that boat and let me wrap this cloak about thee  assisted into the boat accordingly bonthron was deposited there as conveniently as things admitted of he answered their attentions with one or two snorts resembling the grunt of a boar who has got some food particularly agreeable to him  and now buncle said the chirurgeon your valiant squireship knows your charge you are to carry this lively cargo by the river to newburgh where you are to dispose of him as you wot of meantime here are his shackles and bandages the marks of his confinement and liberation bind them up together and fling them into the deepest pool you pass over for found in your possession they might tell tales against us all this low light breath of wind from the west will permit you to use a sail as soon as the light comes in and you are tired of rowing your other valiancie master page eviot must be content to return to perth with me afoot for here severs our fair company take with thee the lantern buncle for thou wilt require it more than we and see thou send me back my flasket  as the pedestrians returned to perth eviot expressed his belief that bonthrons understanding would never recover the shock which terror had inflicted upon it and which appeared to him to have disturbed all the faculties of his mind and in particular his memory  it is not so an it please your pagehood said the leech bonthrons intellect such as it is hath a solid character it will but vacillate to and fro like a pendulum which hath been put in motion and then will rest in its proper point of gravity our memory is of all our powers of mind that which is peculiarly liable to be suspended deep intoxication or sound sleep alike destroy it and yet it returns when the drunkard becomes sober or the sleeper is awakened terror sometimes produces the same effect i knew at paris a criminal condemned to die by the halter who suffered the sentence accordingly showing no particular degree of timidity upon the scaffold and behaving and expressing himself as men in the same condition are wont to do accident did for him what a little ingenious practice hath done for our amiable friend from whom we but now parted he was cut down and given to his friends before life was extinct and i had the good fortune to restore him but though he recovered in other particulars he remembered but little of his trial and sentence of his confession on the morning of his executionhe he he in his usual chuckling mannerhe remembered him not a word neither of leaving the prison nor of his passage to the greve where he suffered nor of the devout speeches with which hehe he heedifiedhe he heso many good christians nor of ascending the fatal tree nor of taking the fatal leap had my revenant the slightest recollection but here we reach the point where we must separate for it were unfit should we meet any of the watch that we be found together and it were also prudent that we enter the city by different gates my profession forms an excuse for my going and coming at all times your valiant pagehood will make such explanation as may seem sufficing  i shall make my will a sufficient excuse if i am interrogated said the haughty young man yet i will avoid interruption if possible the moon is quite obscured and the road as black as a wolfs mouth  tut said the physicianer let not your valour care for that we shall tread darker paths ere it be long  without inquiring into the meaning of these evil boding sentences and indeed hardly listening to them in the pride and recklessness of his nature the page of ramorny parted from his ingenious and dangerous companion and each took his own way    chapter xxv       the course of true love never did run smooth       shakspeare   the ominous anxiety of our armourer had not played him false when the good glover parted with his intended son in law after the judicial combat had been decided he found what he indeed had expected that his fair daughter was in no favourable disposition towards her lover but although he perceived that catharine was cold restrained collected had cast away the appearance of mortal passion and listened with a reserve implying contempt to the most splendid description he could give her of the combat in the skinners yards he was determined not to take the least notice of her altered manner but to speak of her marriage with his son henry as a thing which must of course take place at length when she began as on a former occasion to intimate that her attachment to the armourer did not exceed the bounds of friendship that she was resolved never to marry that the pretended judicial combat was a mockery of the divine will and of human laws the glover not unnaturally grew angry  i cannot read thy thoughts wench nor can i pretend to guess under what wicked delusion it is that you kiss a declared lover suffer him to kiss you run to his house when a report is spread of his death and fling yourself into his arms when you find him alone alive all this shows very well in a girl prepared to obey her parents in a match sanctioned by her father but such tokens of intimacy bestowed on one whom a young woman cannot esteem and is determined not to marry are uncomely and unmaidenly you have already been more bounteous of your favours to henry smith than your mother whom god assoilzie ever was to me before i married her i tell thee catharine this trifling with the love of an honest man is what i neither can will nor ought to endure i have given my consent to the match and i insist it shall take place without delay and that you receive henry wynd tomorrow as a man whose bride you are to be with all despatch  a power more potent than yours father will say no replied catharine  i will risk it my power is a lawful one that of a father over a child and an erring child answered her father god and man allow of my influence  then may heaven help us said catharine for if you are obstinate in your purpose we are all lost  we can expect no help from heaven said the glover when we act with indiscretion i am clerk enough myself to know that and that your causeless resistance to my will is sinful every priest will inform you ay and more than that you have spoken degradingly of the blessed appeal to god in the combat of ordeal take heed for the holy church is awakened to watch her sheepfold and to extirpate heresy by fire and steel so much i warn thee of  catharine uttered a suppressed exclamation and with difficulty compelling herself to assume an appearance of composure promised her father that if he would spare her any farther discussion of the subject till tomorrow morning she would then meet him determined to make a full discovery of her sentiments  with this promise simon glover was obliged to remain contented though extremely anxious for the postponed explanation it could not be levity or fickleness of character which induced his daughter to act with so much apparent inconsistency towards the man of his choice and whom she had so lately unequivocally owned to be also the man of her own what external force there could exist of a kind powerful enough to change the resolutions she had so decidedly expressed within twentyfour hours was a matter of complete mystery  but i will be as obstinate as she can be thought the glover and she shall either marry henry smith without farther delay or old simon glover will know an excellent reason to the contrary  the subject was not renewed during the evening but early on the next morning just at sun rising catharine knelt before the bed in which her parent still slumbered her heart sobbed as if it would burst and her tears fell thick upon her fathers face the good old man awoke looked up crossed his childs forehead and kissed her affectionately  i understand thee kate he said thou art come to confession and i trust art desirous to escape a heavy penance by being sincere  catharine was silent for an instant  i need not ask my father if you remember the carthusian monk clement and his preachings and lessons at which indeed you assisted so often that you cannot be ignorant men called you one of his converts and with greater justice termed me so likewise  i am aware of both said the old man raising himself on his elbow but i defy foul fame to show that i ever owned him in any heretical proposition though i loved to hear him talk of the corruptions of the church the misgovernment of the nobles and the wild ignorance of the poor proving as it seemed to me that the sole virtue of our commonweal its strength and its estimation lay among the burgher craft of the better class which i received as comfortable doctrine and creditable to the town and if he preached other than right doctrine wherefore did his superiors in the carthusian convent permit it if the shepherds turn a wolf in sheeps clothing into the flock they should not blame the sheep for being worried  they endured his preaching nay they encouraged it said catharine while the vices of the laity the contentions of the nobles and the oppression of the poor were the subject of his censure and they rejoiced in the crowds who attracted to the carthusian church forsook those of the other convents but the hypocritesfor such they arejoined with the other fraternities in accusing their preacher clement when passing from censuring the crimes of the state he began to display the pride ignorance and luxury of the churchmen themselvestheir thirst of power their usurpation over mens consciences and their desire to augment their worldly wealth  for gods sake catharine said her father speak within doors your voice rises in tone and your speech in bitterness your eyes sparkle it is owing to this zeal in what concerns you no more than others that malicious persons fix upon you the odious and dangerous name of a heretic  you know i speak no more than what is truth said catharine and which you yourself have avouched often  by needle and buckskin no answered the glover hastily wouldst thou have me avouch what might cost me life and limb land and goods for a full commission hath been granted for taking and trying heretics upon whom is laid the cause of all late tumults and miscarriages wherefore few words are best wench i am ever of mind with the old maker  since word is thrall and thought is free keep well thy tongue i counsel thee  the counsel comes too late father answered catharine sinking down on a chair by her fathers bedside the words have been spoken and heard and it is indited against simon glover burgess in perth that he hath spoken irreverent discourses of the doctrines of holy church  as i live by knife and needle interrupted simon it is a lie i never was so silly as to speak of what i understood not  and hath slandered the anointed of the church both regular and secular continued catharine  nay i will never deny the truth said the glover an idle word i may have spoken at the ale bench or over a pottle pot of wine or in right sure company but else my tongue is not one to run my head into peril  so you think my dearest father but your slightest language has been espied your best meaning phrases have been perverted and you are in dittay as a gross railer against church and churchmen and for holding discourse against them with loose and profligate persons such as the deceased oliver proudfute the smith henry of the wynd and others set forth as commending the doctrines of father clement whom they charge with seven rank heresies and seek for with staff and spear to try him to the death but that said catharine kneeling and looking upwards with the aspect of one of those beauteous saints whom the catholics have given to the fine artsthat they shall never do he hath escaped from the net of the fowler and i thank heaven it was by my means  thy means girlart thou mad said the amazed glover  i will not deny what i glory in answered catharine it was by my means that conachar was led to come hither with a party of men and carry off the old man who is now far beyond the highland line  thou my rashmy unlucky child said the glover hast dared to aid the escape of one accused of heresy and to invite highlanders in arms to interfere with the administration of justice within burgh alas thou hast offended both against the laws of the church and those of the realm whatwhat would become of us were this known  it is known my dear father said the maiden firmlyknown even to those who will be the most willing avengers of the deed  this must be some idle notion catharine or some trick of those cogging priests and nuns it accords not with thy late cheerful willingness to wed henry smith  alas dearest father remember the dismal surprise occasioned by his reported death and the joyful amazement at finding him alive and deem it not wonder if i permitted myself under your protection to say more than my reflection justified but then i knew not the worst and thought the danger exaggerated alas i was yesterday fearfully undeceived when the abbess herself came hither and with her the dominican they showed me the commission under the broad seal of scotland for inquiring into and punishing heresy they showed me your name and my own in a list of suspected persons and it was with tearsreal tears that the abbess conjured me to avert a dreadful fate by a speedy retreat into the cloister and that the monk pledged his word that you should not be molested if i complied  the foul fiend take them both for weeping crocodiles said the glover  alas replied catharine complaint or anger will little help us but you see i have had real cause for this present alarm  alarm call it utter ruin alas my reckless child where was your prudence when you ran headlong into such a snare  hear me father said catharine there is still one mode of safety held out it is one which i have often proposed and for which i have in vain supplicated your permission  i understand youthe convent said her father but catharine what abbess or prioress would dare  that i will explain to you father and it will also show the circumstances which have made me seem unsteady of resolution to a degree which has brought censure upon me from yourself and others our confessor old father francis whom i chose from the dominican convent at your command  ay truly interrupted the glover and i so counselled and commanded thee in order to take off the report that thy conscience was altogether under the direction of father clement  well this father francis has at different times urged and provoked me to converse on such matters as he judged i was likely to learn something of from the carthusian preacher heaven forgive me my blindness i fell into the snare spoke freely and as he argued gently as one who would fain be convinced i even spoke warmly in defence of what i believed devoutly the confessor assumed not his real aspect and betrayed not his secret purpose until he had learned all that i had to tell him it was then that he threatened me with temporal punishment and with eternal condemnation had his threats reached me alone i could have stood firm for their cruelty on earth i could have endured and their power beyond this life i have no belief in  for heavens sake said the glover who was well nigh beside himself at perceiving at every new word the increasing extremity of his daughters danger beware of blaspheming the holy church whose arms are as prompt to strike as her ears are sharp to hear  to me said the maid of perth again looking up the terrors of the threatened denunciations would have been of little avail but when they spoke of involving thee my father in the charge against me i own i trembled and desired to compromise the abbess martha of elcho nunnery being my mothers kinswoman i told her my distresses and obtained her promise that she would receive me if renouncing worldly love and thoughts of wedlock i would take the veil in her sisterhood she had conversation on the topic i doubt not with the dominican francis and both joined in singing the same song  remain in the world said they and thy father and thou shall be brought to trial as heretics assume the veil and the errors of both shall be forgiven and cancelled they spoke not even of recantation of errors of doctrine all should be peace if i would but enter the convent  i doubt noti doubt not said simon the old glover is thought rich and his wealth would follow his daughter to the convent of elcho unless what the dominicans might claim as their own share so this was thy call to the veil these thy objections to henry wynd  indeed father the course was urged on all hands nor did my own mind recoil from it sir john ramorny threatened me with the powerful vengeance of the young prince if i continued to repel his wicked suit and as for poor henry it is but of late that i have discovered to my own surprisethatthat i love his virtues more than i dislike his faults alas the discovery has only been made to render my quitting the world more difficult than when i thought i had thee only to regret  she rested her head on her hand and wept bitterly  all this is folly said the glover never was there an extremity so pinching but what a wise man might find counsel if he was daring enough to act upon it this has never been the land or the people over whom priests could rule in the name of rome without their usurpation being controlled if they are to punish each honest burgher who says the monks love gold and that the lives of some of them cry shame upon the doctrines they teach why truly stephen smotherwell will not lack employment and if all foolish maidens are to be secluded from the world because they follow the erring doctrines of a popular preaching friar they must enlarge the nunneries and receive their inmates on slighter composition our privileges have been often defended against the pope himself by our good monarchs of yore and when he pretended to interfere with the temporal government of the kingdom there wanted not a scottish parliament who told him his duty in a letter that should have been written in letters of gold i have seen the epistle myself and though i could not read it the very sight of the seals of the right reverend prelates and noble and true barons which hung at it made my heart leap for joy thou shouldst not have kept this secret my childbut it is no time to tax thee with thy fault go down get me some food i will mount instantly and go to our lord provost and have his advice and as i trust his protection and that of other true hearted scottish nobles who will not see a true man trodden down for an idle word  alas my father said catharine it was even this impetuosity which i dreaded i knew if i made my plaint to you there would soon be fire and feud as if religion though sent to us by the father of peace were fit only to be the mother of discord and hence i could noweven nowgive up the world and retire with my sorrow among the sisters of elcho would you but let me be the sacrifice only fathercomfort poor henry when we are parted for ever and do notdo not let him think of me too harshly say catharine will never vex him more by her remonstrances but that she will never forget him in her prayers  the girl hath a tongue that would make a saracen weep said her father his own eyes sympathising with those of his daughter but i will not yield way to this combination between the nun and the priest to rob me of my only child away with you girl and let me don my clothes and prepare yourself to obey me in what i may have to recommend for your safety get a few clothes together and what valuables thou hast also take the keys of my iron box which poor henry smith gave me and divide what gold you find into two portions put the one into a purse for thyself and the other into the quilted girdle which i made on purpose to wear on journeys thus both shall be provided in case fate should sunder us in which event god send the whirlwind may take the withered leaf and spare the green one let them make ready my horse instantly and the white jennet that i bought for thee but a day since hoping to see thee ride to st johns kirk with maids and matrons as blythe a bride as ever crossed the holy threshold but it skills not talking away and remember that the saints help those who are willing to help themselves not a word in answer begone i sayno wilfullness now the pilot in calm weather will let a sea boy trifle with the rudder but by my soul when winds howl and waves arise he stands by the helm himself awayno reply  catharine left the room to execute as well as she might the commands of her father who gentle in disposition and devotedly attached to his child suffered her often as it seemed to guide and rule both herself and him yet who as she knew was wont to claim filial obedience and exercise parental authority with sufficient strictness when the occasion seemed to require an enforcement of domestic discipline  while the fair catharine was engaged in executing her fathers behests and the good old glover was hastily attiring himself as one who was about to take a journey a horses tramp was heard in the narrow street the horseman was wrapped in his riding cloak having the cape of it drawn up as if to hide the under part of his face while his bonnet was pulled over his brows and a broad plume obscured his upper features he sprung from the saddle and dorothy had scarce time to reply to his inquiries that the glover was in his bedroom ere the stranger had ascended the stair and entered the sleeping apartment simon astonished and alarmed and disposed to see in this early visitant an apparitor or sumner come to attach him and his daughter was much relieved when as the stranger doffed the bonnet and threw the skirt of the mantle from his face he recognised the knightly provost of the fair city a visit from whom at any time was a favour of no ordinary degree but being made at such an hour had something marvellous and connected with the circumstances of the times even alarming  sir patrick charteris said the glover this high honour done to your poor beadsman  hush said the knight there is no time for idle civilities i came hither because a man is in trying occasions his own safest page and i can remain no longer than to bid thee fly good glover since warrants are to be granted this day in council for the arrest of thy daughter and thee under charge of heresy and delay will cost you both your liberty for certain and perhaps your lives  i have heard something of such a matter said the glover and was this instant setting forth to kinfauns to plead my innocence of this scandalous charge to ask your lordships counsel and to implore your protection  thy innocence friend simon will avail thee but little before prejudiced judges my advice is in one word to fly and wait for happier times as for my protection we must tarry till the tide turns ere it will in any sort avail thee but if thou canst lie concealed for a few days or weeks i have little doubt that the churchmen who by siding with the duke of albany in court intrigue and by alleging the decay of the purity of catholic doctrine as the sole cause of the present national misfortunes have at least for the present hour an irresistible authority over the king will receive a check in the mean while however know that king robert hath not only given way to this general warrant for inquisition after heresy but hath confirmed the popes nomination of henry wardlaw to be archbishop of st andrews and primate of scotland thus yielding to rome those freedoms and immunities of the scottish church which his ancestors from the time of malcolm canmore have so boldly defended his brave fathers would have rather subscribed a covenant with the devil than yielded in such a matter to the pretensions of rome  alas and what remedy  none old man save in some sudden court change said sir patrick the king is but like a mirror which having no light itself reflects back with equal readiness any which is placed near to it for the time now although the douglas is banded with albany yet the earl is unfavourable to the high claims of those domineering priests having quarrelled with them about the exactions which his retinue hath raised on the abbot of arbroath he will come back again with a high hand for report says the earl of march hath fled before him when he returns we shall have a changed world for his presence will control albany especially as many nobles and i myself as i tell you in confidence are resolved to league with him to defend the general right thy exile therefore will end with his return to our court thou hast but to seek thee some temporary hiding place  for that my lord said the glover i can be at no loss since i have just title to the protection of the high highland chief gilchrist macian chief of the clan quhele  nay if thou canst take hold of his mantle thou needs no help of any one else neither lowland churchman nor layman finds a free course of justice beyond the highland frontier  but then my child noble sirmy catharine said the glover  let her go with thee man the graddan cake will keep her white teeth in order the goats whey will make the blood spring to her cheek again which these alarms have banished and even the fair maiden of perth may sleep soft enough on a bed of highland breckan  it is not from such idle respects my lord that i hesitate said the glover catharine is the daughter of a plain burgher and knows not nicety of food or lodging but the son of macian hath been for many years a guest in my house and i am obliged to say that i have observed him looking at my daughter who is as good as a betrothed bride in a manner that though i cared not for it in this lodging in curfew street would give me some fear of consequences in a highland glen where i have no friend and conachar many  the knightly provost replied by a long whistle whew whew nay in that case i advise thee to send her to the nunnery at elcho where the abbess if i forget not is some relation of yours indeed she said so herself adding that she loved her kinswoman well together with all that belongs to thee simon  truly my lord i do believe that the abbess hath so much regard for me that she would willingly receive the trust of my daughter and my whole goods and gear into her sisterhood marry her affection is something of a tenacious character and would be loth to unloose its hold either upon the wench or her tocher  whewwhew again whistled the knight of kinfauns by the thanes cross man but this is an ill favoured pirn to wind yet it shall never be said the fairest maid in the fair city was cooped up in a convent like a kain hen in a cavey and she about to be married to the bold burgess henry wynd that tale shall not be told while i wear belt and spurs and am called provost of perth  but what remede my lord asked the glover  we must all take our share of the risk come get you and your daughter presently to horse you shall ride with me and well see who dare gloom at you the summons is not yet served on thee and if they send an apparitor to kinfauns without a warrant under the kings own hand i make mine avow by the red rovers soul that he shall eat his writ both wax and wether skin to horseto horse and addressing catharine as she entered at the moment you too my pretty maid  to horse and fear not for your quarters they thrive in law that trust in charters  in a minute or two the father and daughter were on horseback both keeping an arrows flight before the provost by his direction that they might not seem to be of the same company they passed the eastern gate in some haste and rode forward roundly until they were out of sight sir patrick followed leisurely but when he was lost to the view of the warders he spurred his mettled horse and soon came up with the glover and catharine when a conversation ensued which throws light upon some previous passages of this history    chapter xxvi       hail land of bowmen seed of those who scornd      to stoop the neck to wide imperial rome      oh dearest half of albion sea walled       albania 1737   i have been devising a mode said the well meaning provost by which i may make you both secure for a week or two from the malice of your enemies when i have little doubt i may see a changed world at court but that i may the better judge what is to be done tell me frankly simon the nature of your connexion with gilchrist macian which leads you to repose such implicit confidence in him you are a close observer of the rules of the city and are aware of the severe penalties which they denounce against such burghers as have covine and alliance with the highland clans  true my lord but it is also known to you that our craft working in skins of cattle stags and every other description of hides have a privilege and are allowed to transact with those highlanders as with the men who can most readily supply us with the means of conducting our trade to the great profit of the burgh thus it hath chanced with me to have great dealings with these men and i can take it on my salvation that you nowhere find more just and honourable traffickers or by whom a man may more easily make an honest penny i have made in my day several distant journeys into the far highlands upon the faith of their chiefs nor did i ever meet with a people more true to their word when you can once prevail upon them to plight it in your behalf and as for the highland chief gilchrist macian saving that he is hasty in homicide and fire raising towards those with whom he hath deadly feud i have nowhere seen a man who walketh a more just and upright path  it is more than ever i heard before said sir patrick charteris yet i have known something of the highland runagates too  they show another favour and a very different one to their friends than to their enemies as your lordship shall understand said the glover however be that as it may it chanced me to serve gilchrist macian in a high matter it is now about eighteen years since that it chanced the clan quhele and clan chattan being at feud as indeed they are seldom at peace the former sustained such a defeat as well nigh extirpated the family of their chief macian seven of his sons were slain in battle and after it himself put to flight and his castle taken and given to the flames his wife then near the time of giving birth to an infant fled into the forest attended by one faithful servant and his daughter here in sorrow and care enough she gave birth to a boy and as the misery of the mothers condition rendered her little able to suckle the infant he was nursed with the milk of a doe which the forester who attended her contrived to take alive in a snare it was not many months afterwards that in a second encounter of these fierce clans macian defeated his enemies in his turn and regained possession of the district which he had lost it was with unexpected rapture that he found his wife and child were in existence having never expected to see more of them than the bleached bones from which the wolves and wildcats had eaten the flesh  but a strong and prevailing prejudice such as is often entertained by these wild people prevented their chief from enjoying the full happiness arising from having thus regained his only son in safety an ancient prophecy was current among them that the power of the tribe should fall by means of a boy born under a bush of holly and suckled by a white doe the circumstance unfortunately for the chief tallied exactly with the birth of the only child which remained to him and it was demanded of him by the elders of the clan that the boy should be either put to death or at least removed from the dominions of the tribe and brought up in obscurity gilchrist macian was obliged to consent and having made choice of the latter proposal the child under the name of conachar was brought up in my family with the purpose as was at first intended of concealing from him all knowledge who or what he was or of his pretensions to authority over a numerous and warlike people but as years rolled on the elders of the tribe who had exerted so much authority were removed by death or rendered incapable of interfering in the public affairs by age while on the other hand the influence of gilchrist macian was increased by his successful struggles against the clan chattan in which he restored the equality betwixt the two contending confederacies which had existed before the calamitous defeat of which i told your honour feeling himself thus firmly seated he naturally became desirous to bring home his only son to his bosom and family and for that purpose caused me to send the young conachar as he was called more than once to the highlands he was a youth expressly made by his form and gallantry of bearing to gain a fathers heart at length i suppose the lad either guessed the secret of his birth or something of it was communicated to him and the disgust which the paughty hieland varlet had always shown for my honest trade became more manifest so that i dared not so much as lay my staff over his costard for fear of receiving a stab with a dirk as an answer in gaelic to a saxon remark it was then that i wished to be well rid of him the rather that he showed so much devotion to catharine who forsooth set herself up to wash the ethiopian and teach a wild hielandmnan mercy and morals she knows herself how it ended  nay my father said catharine it was surely but a point of charity to snatch the brand from the burning  but a small point of wisdom said her father to risk the burning of your own fingers for such an end what says my lord to the matter  my lord would not offend the fair maid of perth said sir patrick and he knows well the purity and truth of her mind and yet i must needs say that had this nursling of the doe been shrivelled haggard cross made and red haired like some highlanders i have known i question if the fair maiden of perth would have bestowed so much zeal upon his conversion and if catharine had been as aged wrinkled and bent by years as the old woman that opened the door for me this morning i would wager my gold spurs against a pair of highland brogues that this wild roebuck would never have listened to a second lecture you laugh glover and catharine blushes a blush of anger let it pass it is the way of the world  the way in which the men of the world esteem their neighbours my lord answered catharine with some spirit  nay fair saint forgive a jest said the knight and thou simon tell us how this tale endedwith conachars escape to the highlands i suppose  with his return thither said the glover there was for some two or three years a fellow about perth a sort of messenger who came and went under divers pretences but was in fact the means of communication between gilchrist macian and his son young conachar or as he is now called hector from this gillie i learned in general that the banishment of the dault an neigh dheil or foster child of the white doe was again brought under consideration of the tribe his foster father torquil of the oak the old forester appeared with eight sons the finest men of the clan and demanded that the doom of banishment should be revoked he spoke with the greater authority as he was himself taishatar or a seer and supposed to have communication with the invisible world he affirmed that he had performed a magical ceremony termed tine egan by which he evoked a fiend from whom he extorted a confession that conachar now called eachin or hector macian was the only man in the approaching combat between the two hostile clans who should come off without blood or blemish hence torquil of the oak argued that the presence of the fated person was necessary to ensure the victory so much i am possessed of this said the forester that unless eachin fight in his place in the ranks of the clan quhele neither i his foster father nor any of my eight sons will lift a weapon in the quarrel  this speech was received with much alarm for the defection of nine men the stoutest of their tribe would be a serious blow more especially if the combat as begins to be rumoured should be decided by a small number from each side the ancient superstition concerning the foster son of the white doe was counterbalanced by a new and later prejudice and the father took the opportunity of presenting to the clan his long hidden son whose youthful but handsome and animated countenance haughty carriage and active limbs excited the admiration of the clansmen who joyfully received him as the heir and descendant of their chief notwithstanding the ominous presage attending his birth and nurture  from this tale my lord continued simon glover your lordship may easily conceive why i myself should be secure of a good reception among the clan quhele and you may also have reason to judge that it would be very rash in me to carry catharine thither and this noble lord is the heaviest of my troubles  we shall lighten the load then said sir patrick and good glover i will take risk for thee and this damsel my alliance with the douglas gives me some interest with marjory duchess of rothsay his daughter the neglected wife of our wilful prince rely on it good glover that in her retinue thy daughter will be as secure as in a fenced castle the duchess keeps house now at falkland a castle which the duke of albany to whom it belongs has lent to her for her accommodation i cannot promise you pleasure fair maiden for the duchess marjory of rothsay is unfortunate and therefore splenetic haughty and overbearing conscious of the want of attractive qualities therefore jealous of those women who possess them but she is firm in faith and noble in spirit and would fling pope or prelate into the ditch of her castle who should come to arrest any one under her protection you will therefore have absolute safety though you may lack comfort  i have no title to more said catharine and deeply do i feel the kindness that is willing to secure me such honourable protection if she be haughty i will remember she is a douglas and hath right as being such to entertain as much pride as may become a mortal if she be fretful i will recollect that she is unfortunate and if she be unreasonably captious i will not forget that she is my protectress heed no longer for me my lord when you have placed me under the noble ladys charge but my poor father to be exposed amongst these wild and dangerous people  think not of that catharine said the glover i am as familiar with brogues and bracken as if i had worn them myself i have only to fear that the decisive battle may be fought before i can leave this country and if the clan quhele lose the combat i may suffer by the ruin of my protectors  we must have that cared for said sir patrick rely on my looking out for your safety but which party will carry the day think you  frankly my lord provost i believe the clan chattan will have the worse these nine children of the forest form a third nearly of the band surrounding the chief of clan quhele and are redoubted champions  and your apprentice will he stand to it thinkest thou  he is hot as fire sir patrick answered the glover but he is also unstable as water nevertheless if he is spared he seems likely to be one day a brave man  but as now he has some of the white does milk still lurking about his liver ha simon  he has little experience my lord said the glover and i need not tell an honoured warrior like yourself that danger must be familiar to us ere we can dally with it like a mistress  this conversation brought them speedily to the castle of kinfauns where after a short refreshment it was necessary that the father and the daughter should part in order to seek their respective places of refuge it was then first as she saw that her fathers anxiety on her account had drowned all recollections of his friend that catharine dropped as if in a dream the name of henry gow  truemost true continued her father we must possess him of our purposes  leave that to me said sir patrick i will not trust to a messenger nor will i send a letter because if i could write one i think he could not read it he will suffer anxiety in the mean while but i will ride to perth tomorrow by times and acquaint him with your designs  the time of separation now approached it was a bitter moment but the manly character of the old burgher and the devout resignation of catharine to the will of providence made it lighter than might have been expected the good knight hurried the departure of the burgess but in the kindest manner and even went so far as to offer him some gold pieces in loan which might where specie was so scarce be considered as the ne plus ultra of regard the glover however assured him he was amply provided and departed on his journey in a northwesterly direction the hospitable protection of sir patrick charteris was no less manifested towards his fair guest she was placed under the charge of a duenna who managed the good knights household and was compelled to remain several days in kinfauns owing to the obstacles and delays interposed by a tay boatman named kitt henshaw to whose charge she was to be committed and whom the provost highly trusted  thus were severed the child and parent in a moment of great danger and difficulty much augmented by circumstances of which they were then ignorant and which seemed greatly to diminish any chance of safety that remained for them    chapter xxvii       this austin humbly did  did he quoth he      austin may do the same again for me       popes prologue to canterbury tales from chaucer   the course of our story will be best pursued by attending that of simon glover it is not our purpose to indicate the exact local boundaries of the two contending clans especially since they are not clearly pointed out by the historians who have transmitted accounts of this memorable feud it is sufficient to say that the territory of the clan chattan extended far and wide comprehending caithness and sutherland and having for their paramount chief the powerful earl of the latter shire thence called mohr ar chat in this general sense the keiths the sinclairs the guns and other families and clans of great power were included in the confederacy these however were not engaged in the present quarrel which was limited to that part of the clan chattan occupying the extensive mountainous districts of perthshire and inverness shire which form a large portion of what is called the northeastern highlands it is well known that two large septs unquestionably known to belong to the clan chattan the macphersons and the macintoshes dispute to this day which of their chieftains was at the head of this badenoch branch of the great confederacy and both have of later times assumed the title of captain of clan chattan non nostrum est but at all events badenoch must have been the centre of the confederacy so far as involved in the feud of which we treat  of the rival league of clan quhele we have a still less distinct account for reasons which will appear in the sequel some authors have identified them with the numerous and powerful sept of mackay if this is done on good authority which is to be doubted the mackays must have shifted their settlements greatly since the reign of robert iii since they are now to be found as a clan in the extreme northern parts of scotland in the counties of ross and sutherland we cannot therefore be so clear as we would wish in the geography of the story suffice it that directing his course in a northwesterly direction the glover travelled for a days journey in the direction of the breadalbane country from which he hoped to reach the castle where gilchrist macian the captain of the clan quhele and the father of his pupil conachar usually held his residence with a barbarous pomp of attendance and ceremonial suited to his lofty pretensions  we need not stop to describe the toil and terrors of such a journey where the path was to be traced among wastes and mountains now ascending precipitous ravines now plunging into inextricable bogs and often intersected with large brooks and even rivers but all these perils simon glover had before encountered in quest of honest gain and it was not to be supposed that he shunned or feared them where liberty and life itself were at stake  the danger from the warlike and uncivilised inhabitants of these wilds would have appeared to another at least as formidable as the perils of the journey but simons knowledge of the manners and language of the people assured him on this point also an appeal to the hospitality of the wildest gael was never unsuccessful and the kerne that in other circumstances would have taken a mans life for the silver button of his cloak would deprive himself of a meal to relieve the traveller who implored hospitality at the door of his bothy the art of travelling in the highlands was to appear as confident and defenceless as possible and accordingly the glover carried no arms whatever journeyed without the least appearance of precaution and took good care to exhibit nothing which might excite cupidity another rule which he deemed it prudent to observe was to avoid communication with any of the passengers whom he might chance to meet except in the interchange of the common civilities of salutation which the highlanders rarely omit few opportunities occurred of exchanging even such passing greetings the country always lonely seemed now entirely forsaken and even in the little straths or valleys which he had occasion to pass or traverse the hamlets were deserted and the inhabitants had betaken themselves to woods and caves this was easily accounted for considering the imminent dangers of a feud which all expected would become one of the most general signals for plunder and ravage that had ever distracted that unhappy country  simon began to be alarmed at this state of desolation he had made a halt since he left kinfauns to allow his nag some rest and now he began to be anxious how he was to pass the night he had reckoned upon spending it at the cottage of an old acquaintance called niel booshalloch or the cow herd because he had charge of numerous herds of cattle belonging to the captain of clan quhele for which purpose he had a settlement on the banks of the tay not far from the spot where it leaves the lake of the same name from this his old host and friend with whom he had transacted many bargains for hides and furs the old glover hoped to learn the present state of the country the prospect of peace or war and the best measures to be taken for his own safety it will be remembered that the news of the indentures of battle entered into for diminishing the extent of the feud had only been communicated to king robert the day before the glover left perth and did not become public till some time afterwards  if niel booshalloch hath left his dwelling like the rest of them i shall be finely holped up thought simon since i want not only the advantage of his good advice but also his interest with gilchrist macian and moreover a nights quarters and a supper  thus reflecting he reached the top of a swelling green hill and saw the splendid vision of loch tay lying beneath himan immense plate of polished silver its dark heathy mountains and leafless thickets of oak serving as an arabesque frame to a magnificent mirror  indifferent to natural beauty at any time simon glover was now particularly so and the only part of the splendid landscape on which he turned his eye was an angle or loop of meadow land where the river tay rushing in full swoln dignity from its parent lake and wheeling around a beautiful valley of about a mile in breadth begins his broad course to the southeastward like a conqueror and a legislator to subdue and to enrich remote districts upon the sequestered spot which is so beautifully situated between lake mountain and river arose afterwards the feudal castle of the ballough balloch is gaelic for the discharge of a lake into a river which in our time has been succeeded by the splendid palace of the earls of breadalbane  but the campbells though they had already attained very great power in argyleshire had not yet extended themselves so far eastward as loch tay the banks of which were either by right or by mere occupancy possessed for the present by the clan quhele whose choicest herds were fattened on the balloch margin of the lake in this valley therefore between the river and the lake amid extensive forests of oak wood hazel rowan tree and larches arose the humble cottage of niel booshalloch a village eumaeus whose hospitable chimneys were seen to smoke plentifully to the great encouragement of simon glover who might otherwise have been obliged to spend the night in the open air to his no small discomfort  he reached the door of the cottage whistled shouted and made his approach known there was a baying of hounds and collies and presently the master of the hut came forth there was much care on his brow and he seemed surprised at the sight of simon glover though the herdsman covered both as well as he might for nothing in that region could be reckoned more uncivil than for the landlord to suffer anything to escape him in look or gesture which might induce the visitor to think that his arrival was an unpleasing or even an unexpected incident the travellers horse was conducted to a stable which was almost too low to receive him and the glover himself was led into the mansion of the booshalloch where according to the custom of the country bread and cheese was placed before the wayfarer while more solid food was preparing simon who understood all their habits took no notice of the obvious marks of sadness on the brow of his entertainer and on those of the family until he had eaten somewhat for forms sake after which he asked the general question was there any news in the country  bad news as ever were told said the herdsman our father is no more  how said simon greatly alarmed is the captain of the clan quhele dead  the captain of the clan quhele never dies answered the booshalloch but gilchrist macian died twenty hours since and his son eachin macian is now captain  what eachinthat is conacharmy apprentice  as little of that subject as you list brother simon said the herdsman it is to be remembered friend that your craft which doth very well for a living in the douce city of perth is something too mechanical to be much esteemed at the foot of ben lawers and on the banks of loch tay we have not a gaelic word by which we can even name a maker of gloves  it would be strange if you had friend niel said simon drily having so few gloves to wear i think there be none in the whole clan quhele save those which i myself gave to gilchrist macian whom god assoilzie who esteemed them a choice propine most deeply do i regret his death for i was coming to him on express business  you had better turn the nags head southward with morning light said the herdsman the funeral is instantly to take place and it must be with short ceremony for there is a battle to be fought by the clan quhele and the clan chattan thirty champions on a side as soon as palm sunday next and we have brief time either to lament the dead or honour the living  yet are my affairs so pressing that i must needs see the young chief were it but for a quarter of an hour said the glover  hark thee friend replied his host i think thy business must be either to gather money or to make traffic now if the chief owe thee anything for upbringing or otherwise ask him not to pay it when all the treasures of the tribe are called in for making gallant preparation of arms and equipment for their combatants that we may meet these proud hill cats in a fashion to show ourselves their superiors but if thou comest to practise commerce with us thy time is still worse chosen thou knowest that thou art already envied of many of our tribe for having had the fosterage of the young chief which is a thing usually given to the best of the clan  but st mary man exclaimed the glover men should remember the office was not conferred on me as a favour which i courted but that it was accepted by me on importunity and entreaty to my no small prejudice this conachar or hector of yours or whatever you call him has destroyed me doe skins to the amount of many pounds scots  there again now said the booshalloch you have spoken word to cost your lifeany allusion to skins or hides or especially to deer and doesmay incur no less a forfeit the chief is young and jealous of his rank none knows the reason better than thou friend glover he will naturally wish that everything concerning the opposition to his succession and having reference to his exile should be totally forgotten and he will not hold him in affection who shall recall the recollection of his people or force back his own upon what they must both remember with pain think how at such a moment they will look on the old glover of perth to whom the chief was so long apprentice comecome old friend you have erred in this you are in over great haste to worship the rising sun while his beams are yet level with the horizon come thou when he has climbed higher in the heavens and thou shalt have thy share of the warmth of his noonday height  niel booshalloch said the glover we have been old friends as thou sayst and as i think thee a true one i will speak to thee freely though what i say might be perilous if spoken to others of thy clan thou thinkst i come hither to make my own profit of thy young chief and it is natural thou shouldst think so but i would not at my years quit my own chimney corner in curfew street to bask me in the beams of the brightest sun that ever shone upon highland heather the very truth is i come hither in extremity my foes have the advantage of me and have laid things to my charge whereof i am incapable even in thought nevertheless doom is like to go forth against me and there is no remedy but that i must up and fly or remain and perish i come to your young chief as one who had refuge with me in his distresswho ate of my bread and drank of my cup i ask of him refuge which as i trust i shall need but a short time  that makes a different case replied the herdsman so different that if you came at midnight to the gate of macian having the king of scotlands head in your hand and a thousand men in pursuit for the avenging of his blood i could not think it for his honour to refuse you protection and for your innocence or guilt it concerns not the case or rather he ought the more to shelter you if guilty seeing your necessity and his risk are both in that case the greater i must straightway to him that no hasty tongue tell him of your arriving hither without saying the cause  a pity of your trouble said the glover but where lies the chief  he is quartered about ten miles hence busied with the affairs of the funeral and with preparations for the combatthe dead to the grave and the living to battle  it is a long way and will take you all night to go and come said the glover and i am very sure that conachar when he knows it is i who  forget conachar said the herdsman placing his finger on his lips and as for the ten miles they are but a highland leap when one bears a message between his friend and his chief  so saying and committing the traveller to the charge of his eldest son and his daughter the active herdsman left his house two hours before midnight to which he returned long before sunrise he did not disturb his wearied guest but when the old man had arisen in the morning he acquainted him that the funeral of the late chieftain was to take place the same day and that although eachin macian could not invite a saxon to the funeral he would be glad to receive him at the entertainment which was to follow  his will must be obeyed said the glover half smiling at the change of relation between himself and his late apprentice the man is the master now and i trust he will remember that when matters were otherwise between us i did not use my authority ungraciously  troutsho friend exclaimed the booshalloch the less of that you say the better you will find yourself a right welcome guest to eachin and the deil a man dares stir you within his bounds but fare you well for i must go as beseems me to the burial of the best chief the clan ever had and the wisest captain that ever cocked the sweet gale bog myrtle in his bonnet farewell to you for a while and if you will go to the top of the tom an lonach behind the house you will see a gallant sight and hear such a coronach as will reach the top of ben lawers a boat will wait for you three hours hence at a wee bit creek about half a mile westward from the head of the tay  with these words he took his departure followed by his three sons to man the boat in which he was to join the rest of the mourners and two daughters whose voices were wanted to join in the lament which was chanted or rather screamed on such occasions of general affliction  simon glover finding himself alone resorted to the stable to look after his nag which he found had been well served with graddan or bread made of scorched barley of this kindness he was fully sensible knowing that probably the family had little of this delicacy left to themselves until the next harvest should bring them a scanty supply in animal food they were well provided and the lake found them abundance of fish for their lenten diet which they did not observe very strictly but bread was a delicacy very scanty in the highlands the bogs afforded a soft species of hay none of the best to be sure but scottish horses like their riders were then accustomed to hard fare  gauntlet for this was the name of the palfrey had his stall crammed full of dried fern for litter and was otherwise as well provided for as highland hospitality could contrive  simon glover being thus left to his own painful reflections nothing better remained after having seen after the comforts of the dumb companion of his journey than to follow the herdsmans advice and ascending towards the top of an eminence called tom an lonach or the knoll of yew trees after a walk of half an hour he reached the summit and could look down on the broad expanse of the lake of which the height commanded a noble view a few aged and scattered yew trees of great size still vindicated for the beautiful green hill the name attached to it but a far greater number had fallen a sacrifice to the general demand for bow staves in that warlike age the bow being a weapon much used by the mountaineers though those which they employed as well as their arrows were in shape and form and especially in efficacy far inferior to the archery of merry england the dark and shattered individual yews which remained were like the veterans of a broken host occupying in disorder some post of advantage with the stern purpose of resisting to the last behind this eminence but detached from it arose a higher hill partly covered with copsewood partly opening into glades of pasture where the cattle strayed finding at this season of the year a scanty sustenance among the spring heads and marshy places where the fresh grass began first to arise  the opposite or northern shore of the lake presented a far more alpine prospect than that upon which the glover was stationed woods and thickets ran up the sides of the mountains and disappeared among the sinuosities formed by the winding ravines which separated them from each other but far above these specimens of a tolerable natural soil arose the swart and bare mountains themselves in the dark grey desolation proper to the season  some were peaked some broad crested some rocky and precipitous others of a tamer outline and the clan of titans seemed to be commanded by their appropriate chieftainsthe frowning mountain of ben lawers and the still more lofty eminence of ben mohr arising high above the rest whose peaks retain a dazzling helmet of snow far into the summer season and sometimes during the whole year yet the borders of this wild and silvan region where the mountains descended upon the lake intimated even at that early period many traces of human habitation hamlets were seen especially on the northern margin of the lake half hid among the little glens that poured their tributary streams into loch tay which like many earthly things made a fair show at a distance but when more closely approached were disgustful and repulsive from their squalid want of the conveniences which attend even indian wigwams they were inhabited by a race who neither cultivated the earth nor cared for the enjoyments which industry procures the women although otherwise treated with affection and even delicacy of respect discharged all the absolutely necessary domestic labour the men excepting some reluctant use of an ill formed plough or more frequently a spade grudgingly gone through as a task infinitely beneath them took no other employment than the charge of the herds of black cattle in which their wealth consisted at all other times they hunted fished or marauded during the brief intervals of peace by way of pastime plundering with bolder license and fighting with embittered animosity in time of war which public or private upon a broader or more restricted scale formed the proper business of their lives and the only one which they esteemed worthy of them  the magnificent bosom of the lake itself was a scene to gaze on with delight its noble breadth with its termination in a full and beautiful run was rendered yet more picturesque by one of those islets which are often happily situated in the scottish lakes the ruins upon that isle now almost shapeless being overgrown with wood rose at the time we speak of into the towers and pinnacles of a priory where slumbered the remains of sibylla daughter of henry i of england and consort of alexander the first of scotland this holy place had been deemed of dignity sufficient to be the deposit of the remains of the captain of the clan quhele at least till times when the removal of the danger now so imminently pressing should permit of his body being conveyed to a distinguished convent in the north where he was destined ultimately to repose with all his ancestry  a number of boats pushed off from various points of the near and more distant shore many displaying sable banners and others having their several pipers in the bow who from time to time poured forth a few notes of a shrill plaintive and wailing character and intimated to the glover that the ceremony was about to take place these sounds of lamentation were but the tuning as it were of the instruments compared with the general wail which was speedily to be raised  a distant sound was heard from far up the lake even as it seemed from the remote and distant glens out of which the dochart and the lochy pour their streams into loch tay it was in a wild inaccessible spot where the campbells at a subsequent period founded their strong fortress of finlayrigg that the redoubted commander of the clan quhele drew his last breath and to give due pomp to his funeral his corpse was now to be brought down the loch to the island assigned for his temporary place of rest the funeral fleet led by the chieftains barge from which a huge black banner was displayed had made more than two thirds of its voyage ere it was visible from the eminence on which simon glover stood to overlook the ceremony the instant the distant wail of the coronach was heard proceeding from the attendants on the funeral barge all the subordinate sounds of lamentation were hushed at once as the raven ceases to croak and the hawk to whistle whenever the scream of the eagle is heard the boats which had floated hither and thither upon the lake like a flock of waterfowl dispersing themselves on its surface now drew together with an appearance of order that the funeral flotilla might pass onward and that they themselves might fall into their proper places in the mean while the piercing din of the war pipes became louder and louder and the cry from the numberless boats which followed that from which the black banner of the chief was displayed rose in wild unison up to the tom an lonach from which the glover viewed the spectacle the galley which headed the procession bore on its poop a species of scaffold upon which arrayed in white linen and with the face bare was displayed the corpse of the deceased chieftain his son and the nearest relatives filled the vessel while a great number of boats of every description that could be assembled either on loch tay itself or brought by land carriage from loch earn and otherwise followed in the rear some of them of very frail materials there were even curraghs composed of ox hides stretched over hoops of willow in the manner of the ancient british and some committed themselves to rafts formed for the occasion from the readiest materials that occurred and united in such a precarious manner as to render it probable that before the accomplishment of the voyage some of the clansmen of the deceased might be sent to attend their chieftain in the world of spirits  when the principal flotilla came in sight of the smaller group of boats collected towards the foot of the lake and bearing off from the little island they hailed each other with a shout so loud and general and terminating in a cadence so wildly prolonged that not only the deer started from their glens for miles around and sought the distant recesses of the mountains but even the domestic cattle accustomed to the voice of man felt the full panic which the human shout strikes into the wilder tribes and like them fled from their pasture into morasses and dingles  summoned forth from their convent by those sounds the monks who inhabited the little islet began to issue from their lowly portal with cross and banner and as much of ecclesiastical state as they had the means of displaying their bells at the same time of which the edifice possessed three pealing the death toll over the long lake which came to the ears of the now silent multitude mingled with the solemn chant of the catholic church raised by the monks in their procession various ceremonies were gone through while the kindred of the deceased carried the body ashore and placing it on a bank long consecrated to the purpose made the deasil around the departed when the corpse was uplifted to be borne into the church another united yell burst from the assembled multitude in which the deep shout of warriors and the shrill wail of females joined their notes with the tremulous voice of age and the babbling cry of childhood the coronach was again and for the last time shrieked as the body was carried into the interior of the church where only the nearest relatives of the deceased and the most distinguished of the leaders of the clan were permitted to enter the last yell of woe was so terribly loud and answered by so many hundred echoes that the glover instinctively raised his hands to his ears to shut out or deaden at least a sound so piercing he kept this attitude while the hawks owls and other birds scared by the wild scream had begun to settle in their retreats when as he withdrew his hands a voice close by him said  think you this simon glover the hymn of penitence and praise with which it becomes poor forlorn man cast out from his tenement of clay to be wafted into the presence of his maker  the glover turned and in the old man with a long white beard who stood close beside him had no difficulty from the clear mild eye and the benevolent cast of features to recognise the carthusian monk father clement no longer wearing his monastic habiliments but wrapped in a frieze mantle and having a highland cap on his head  it may be recollected that the glover regarded this man with a combined feeling of respect and dislikerespect which his judgment could not deny to the monks person and character and dislike which arose from father clements peculiar doctrines being the cause of his daughters exile and his own distress it was not therefore with sentiments of unmixed satisfaction that he returned the greetings of the father and replied to the reiterated question what he thought of the funeral rites which were discharged in so wild a manner i know not my good father but these men do their duty to their deceased chief according to the fashion of their ancestors they mean to express their regret for their friends loss and their prayers to heaven in his behalf and that which is done of goodwill must to my thinking be accepted favourably had it been otherwise methinks they had ere now been enlightened to do better  thou art deceived answered the monk god has sent his light amongst us all though in various proportions but man wilfully shuts his eyes and prefers darkness this benighted people mingle with the ritual of the roman church the old heathen ceremonies of their own fathers and thus unite with the abominations of a church corrupted by wealth and power the cruel and bloody ritual of savage paynims  father said simon abruptly methinks your presence were more useful in yonder chapel aiding your brethren in the discharge of their clerical duties than in troubling and unsettling the belief of an humble though ignorant christian like myself  and wherefore say good brother that i would unfix thy principles of belief answered clement so heaven deal with me as were my life blood necessary to cement the mind of any man to the holy religion he professeth it should be freely poured out for the purpose  your speech is fair father i grant you said the glover but if i am to judge the doctrine by the fruits heaven has punished me by the hand of the church for having hearkened thereto ere i heard you my confessor was little moved though i might have owned to have told a merry tale upon the ale bench even if a friar or a nun were the subject if at a time i had called father hubert a better hunter of hares than of souls i confessed me to the vicar vinesauf who laughed and made me pay a reckoning for penance or if i had said that the vicar vinesauf was more constant to his cup than to his breviary i confessed me to father hubert and a new hawking glove made all well again and thus i my conscience and mother church lived together on terms of peace friendship and mutual forbearance but since i have listened to you father clement this goodly union is broke to pieces and nothing is thundered in my ear but purgatory in the next world and fire and fagot in this therefore avoid you father clement or speak to those who can understand your doctrine i have no heart to be a martyr i have never in my whole life had courage enough so much as to snuff a candle with my fingers and to speak the truth i am minded to go back to perth sue out my pardon in the spiritual court carry my fagot to the gallows foot in token of recantation and purchase myself once more the name of a good catholic were it at the price of all the worldly wealth that remains to me  you are angry my dearest brother said clement and repent you on the pinch of a little worldly danger and a little worldly loss for the good thoughts which you once entertained  you speak at ease father clement since i think you have long forsworn the wealth and goods of the world and are prepared to yield up your life when it is demanded in exchange for the doctrine you preach and believe you are as ready to put on your pitched shirt and brimstone head gear as a naked man is to go to his bed and it would seem you have not much more reluctance to the ceremony but i still wear that which clings to me my wealth is still my own and i thank heaven it is a decent pittance whereon to live my life too is that of a hale old man of sixty who is in no haste to bring it to a close and if i were poor as job and on the edge of the grave must i not still cling to my daughter whom your doctrines have already cost so dear  thy daughter friend simon said the carmelite carthusian may be truly called an angel upon earth  ay and by listening to your doctrines father she is now like to be called on to be an angel in heaven and to be transported thither in a chariot of fire  nay my good brother said clement desist i pray you to speak of what you little understand since it is wasting time to show thee the light that thou chafest against yet listen to that which i have to say touching thy daughter whose temporal felicity though i weigh it not even for an instant in the scale against that which is spiritual is nevertheless in its order as dear to clement blair as to her own father  the tears stood in the old mans eyes as he spoke and simon glover was in some degree mollified as he again addressed him  one would think thee father clement the kindest and most amiable of men how comes it then that thy steps are haunted by general ill will wherever thou chancest to turn them i could lay my life thou hast contrived already to offend yonder half score of poor friars in their water girdled cage and that you have been prohibited from attendance on the funeral  even so my son said the carthusian and i doubt whether their malice will suffer me to remain in this country i did but speak a few sentences about the superstition and folly of frequenting st fillans church to detect theft by means of his bell of bathing mad patients in his pool to cure their infirmity of mind and lo the persecutors have cast me forth of their communion as they will speedily cast me out of this life  lo you there now said the glover see what it is for a man that cannot take a warning well father clement men will not cast me forth unless it were as a companion of yours i pray you therefore tell me what you have to say of my daughter and let us be less neighbours than we have been  this then brother simon i have to acquaint you with this young chief who is swoln with contemplation of his own power and glory loves one thing better than it all and that is thy daughter  he conachar exclaimed simon my runagate apprentice look up to my daughter  alas said clement how close sits our worldly pride even as ivy clings to the wall and cannot be separated look up to thy daughter good simon alas no the captain of clan quhele great as he is and greater as he soon expects to be looks down to the daughter of the perth burgess and considers himself demeaned in doing so but to use his own profane expression catharine is dearer to him than life here and heaven hereafter he cannot live without her  then he may die if he lists said simon glover for she is betrothed to an honest burgess of perth and i would not break my word to make my daughter bride to the prince of scotland  i thought it would be your answer replied the monk i would worthy friend thou couldst carry into thy spiritual concerns some part of that daring and resolved spirit with which thou canst direct thy temporal affairs  hush theehush father clement answered the glover when thou fallest into that vein of argument thy words savour of blazing tar and that is a scent i like not as to catharine i must manage as i can so as not to displease the young dignitary but well is it for me that she is far beyond his reach  she must then be distant indeed said the carmelite carthusian and now brother simon since you think it perilous to own me and my opinions i must walk alone with my own doctrines and the dangers they draw on me but should your eye less blinded than it now is by worldly hopes and fears ever turn a glance back on him who soon may be snatched from you remember that by nought save a deep sense of the truth and importance of the doctrine which he taught could clement blair have learned to encounter nay to provoke the animosity of the powerful and inveterate to alarm the fears of the jealous and timid to walk in the world as he belonged not to it and to be accounted mad of men that he might if possible win souls to god heaven be my witness that i would comply in all lawful things to conciliate the love and sympathy of my fellow creatures it is no light thing to be shunned by the worthy as an infected patient to be persecuted by the pharisees of the day as an unbelieving heretic to be regarded with horror at once and contempt by the multitude who consider me as a madman who may be expected to turn mischievous but were all those evils multiplied an hundredfold the fire within must not be stifled the voice which says within me speak must receive obedience woe unto me if i preach not the gospel even should i at length preach it from amidst the pile of flames  so spoke this bold witness one of those whom heaven raised up from time to time to preserve amidst the most ignorant ages and to carry down to those which succeed them a manifestation of unadulterated christianity from the time of the apostles to the age when favoured by the invention of printing the reformation broke out in full splendour the selfish policy of the glover was exposed in his own eyes and he felt himself contemptible as he saw the carthusian turn from him in all the hallowedness of resignation he was even conscious of a momentary inclination to follow the example of the preachers philanthropy and disinterested zeal but it glanced like a flash of lightning through a dark vault where there lies nothing to catch the blaze and he slowly descended the hill in a direction different from that of the carthusian forgetting him and his doctrines and buried in anxious thoughts about his childs fate and his own    chapter xxviii       what want these outlaws conquerors should have      but historys purchased page to call them great      a wider space an ornamented grave      their hopes were not less warm their souls were full as brave       byron   the funeral obsequies being over the same flotilla which had proceeded in solemn and sad array down the lake prepared to return with displayed banners and every demonstration of mirth and joy for there was but brief time to celebrate festivals when the awful conflict betwixt the clan quhele and their most formidable rivals so nearly approached it had been agreed therefore that the funeral feast should be blended with that usually given at the inauguration of the young chief  some objections were made to this arrangement as containing an evil omen but on the other hand it had a species of recommendation from the habits and feelings of the highlanders who to this day are wont to mingle a degree of solemn mirth with their mourning and something resembling melancholy with their mirth the usual aversion to speak or think of those who have been beloved and lost is less known to this grave and enthusiastic race than it is to others you hear not only the young mention as is everywhere usual the merits and the character of parents who have in the course of nature predeceased them but the widowed partner speaks in ordinary conversation of the lost spouse and what is still stranger the parents allude frequently to the beauty or valour of the child whom they have interred the scottish highlanders appear to regard the separation of friends by death as something less absolute and complete than it is generally esteemed in other countries and converse of the dear connexions who have sought the grave before them as if they had gone upon a long journey in which they themselves must soon follow the funeral feast therefore being a general custom throughout scotland was not in the opinion of those who were to share it unseemingly mingled on the present occasion with the festivities which hailed the succession to the chieftainship  the barge which had lately borne the dead to the grave now conveyed the young macian to his new command and the minstrels sent forth their gayest notes to gratulate eachins succession as they had lately sounded their most doleful dirges when carrying gilchrist to his grave from the attendant flotilla rang notes of triumph and jubilee instead of those yells of lamentation which had so lately disturbed the echoes of loch tay and a thousand voices hailed the youthful chieftain as he stood on the poop armed at all points in the flower of early manhood beauty and activity on the very spot where his fathers corpse had so lately been extended and surrounded by triumphant friends as that had been by desolate mourners  one boat kept closest of the flotilla to the honoured galley torquil of the oak a grizzled giant was steersman and his eight sons each exceeding the ordinary stature of mankind pulled the oars like some powerful and favourite wolf hound unloosed from his couples and frolicking around a liberal master the boat of the foster brethren passed the chieftains barge now on one side and now on another and even rowed around it as if in extravagance of joy while at the same time with the jealous vigilance of the animal we have compared it to they made it dangerous for any other of the flotilla to approach so near as themselves from the risk of being run down by their impetuous and reckless manoeuvres raised to an eminent rank in the clan by the succession of their foster brother to the command of the clan quhele this was the tumultuous and almost terrible mode in which they testified their peculiar share in their chiefs triumph  far behind and with different feelings on the part of one at least of the company came the small boat in which manned by the booshalloch and one of his sons simon glover was a passenger  if we are bound for the head of the lake said simon to his friend we shall hardly be there for hours  but as he spoke the crew of the boat of the foster brethren or leichtach on a signal from the chiefs galley lay on their oars until the booshallochs boat came up and throwing on board a rope of hides which niel made fast to the head of his skiff they stretched to their oars once more and notwithstanding they had the small boat in tow swept through the lake with almost the same rapidity as before the skiff was tugged on with a velocity which seemed to hazard the pulling her under water or the separation of her head from her other timbers  simon glover saw with anxiety the reckless fury of their course and the bows of the boat occasionally brought within an inch or two of the level of the water and though his friend niel booshalloch assured him it was all done in especial honour he heartily wished his voyage might have a safe termination it had so and much sooner than he apprehended for the place of festivity was not four miles distant from the sepulchral island being chosen to suit the chieftains course which lay to the southeast so soon as the banquet should be concluded a bay on the southern side of loch tay presented a beautiful beach of sparkling sand on which the boats might land with ease and a dry meadow covered with turf verdant considering the season behind and around which rose high banks fringed with copsewood and displaying the lavish preparations which had been made for the entertainment  the highlanders well known for ready hatchet men had constructed a long arbour or silvan banqueting room capable of receiving two hundred men while a number of smaller huts around seemed intended for sleeping apartments the uprights the couples and roof tree of the temporary hall were composed of mountain pine still covered with its bark the framework of the sides was of planks or spars of the same material closely interwoven with the leafy boughs of the fir and other evergreens which the neighbouring woods afforded while the hills had furnished plenty of heath to form the roof within this silvan palace the most important personages present were invited to hold high festival others of less note were to feast in various long sheds constructed with less care and tables of sod or rough planks placed in the open air were allotted to the numberless multitude at a distance were to be seen piles of glowing charcoal or blazing wood around which countless cooks toiled bustled and fretted like so many demons working in their native element pits wrought in the hillside and lined with heated stones served as ovens for stewing immense quantities of beef mutton and venison wooden spits supported sheep and goats which were roasted entire others were cut into joints and seethed in caldrons made of the animals own skins sewed hastily together and filled with water while huge quantities of pike trout salmon and char were broiled with more ceremony on glowing embers the glover had seen many a highland banquet but never one the preparations for which were on such a scale of barbarous profusion  he had little time however to admire the scene around him for as soon as they landed on the beach the booshalloch observed with some embarrassment that as they had not been bidden to the table of the dais to which he seemed to have expected an invitation they had best secure a place in one of the inferior bothies or booths and was leading the way in that direction when he was stopped by one of the bodyguards seeming to act as master of ceremonies who whispered something in his ear  i thought so said the herdsman much relievedi thought neither the stranger nor the man that has my charge would be left out at the high table  they were conducted accordingly into the ample lodge within which were long ranges of tables already mostly occupied by the guests while those who acted as domestics were placing upon them the abundant though rude materials of the festival the young chief although he certainly saw the glover and the herdsman enter did not address any personal salute to either and their places were assigned them in a distant corner far beneath the salt a huge piece of antique silver plate the only article of value that the table displayed and which was regarded by the clan as a species of palladium only produced and used on the most solemn occasions such as the present  the booshalloch somewhat discontented muttered to simon as he took his place these are changed days friend his father rest his soul would have spoken to us both but these are bad manners which he has learned among you sassenachs in the low country  to this remark the glover did not think it necessary to reply instead of which he adverted to the evergreens and particularly to the skins and other ornaments with which the interior of the bower was decorated the most remarkable part of these ornaments was a number of highland shirts of mail with steel bonnets battle axes and two handed swords to match which hung around the upper part of the room together with targets highly and richly embossed each mail shirt was hung over a well dressed stags hide which at once displayed the armour to advantage and saved it from suffering by damp  these whispered the booshalloch are the arms of the chosen champions of the clan quhele they are twentynine in number as you see eachin himself being the thirtieth who wears his armour today else had there been thirty and he has not got such a good hauberk after all as he should wear on palm sunday these nine suits of harness of such large size are for the leichtach from whom so much is expected  and these goodly deer hides said simon the spirit of his profession awakening at the sight of the goods in which he tradedthink you the chief will be disposed to chaffer for them they are in demand for the doublets which knights wear under their armour  did i not pray you said niel booshalloch to say nothing on that subject  it is the mail shirts i speak of said simonmay i ask if any of them were made by our celebrated perth armourer called henry of the wynd  thou art more unlucky than before said niel that mans name is to eachins temper like a whirlwind upon the lake yet no man knows for what cause  i can guess thought our glover but gave no utterance to the thought and having twice lighted on unpleasant subjects of conversation he prepared to apply himself like those around him to his food without starting another topic  we have said as much of the preparations as may lead the reader to conclude that the festival in respect of the quality of the food was of the most rude description consisting chiefly of huge joints of meat which were consumed with little respect to the fasting season although several of the friars of the island convent graced and hallowed the board by their presence the platters were of wood and so were the hooped cogues or cups out of which the guests quaffed their liquor as also the broth or juice of the meat which was held a delicacy there were also various preparations of milk which were highly esteemed and were eaten out of similar vessels bread was the scarcest article at the banquet but the glover and his patron niel were served with two small loaves expressly for their own use in eating as indeed was then the case all over britain the guests used their knives called skenes or the large poniards named dirks without troubling themselves by the reflection that they might occasionally have served different or more fatal purposes  at the upper end of the table stood a vacant seat elevated a step or two above the floor it was covered with a canopy of hollow boughs and ivy and there rested against it a sheathed sword and a folded banner this had been the seat of the deceased chieftain and was left vacant in honour of him eachin occupied a lower chair on the right hand of the place of honour  the reader would be greatly mistaken who should follow out this description by supposing that the guests behaved like a herd of hungry wolves rushing upon a feast rarely offered to them on the contrary the clan quhele conducted themselves with that species of courteous reserve and attention to the wants of others which is often found in primitive nations especially such as are always in arms because a general observance of the rules of courtesy is necessary to prevent quarrels bloodshed and death the guests took the places assigned them by torquil of the oak who acting as marischal taeh ie sewer of the mess touched with a white wand without speaking a word the place where each was to sit thus placed in order the company patiently waited for the portion assigned them which was distributed among them by the leichtach the bravest men or more distinguished warriors of the tribe being accommodated with a double mess emphatically called bieyfir or the portion of a man when the sewers themselves had seen every one served they resumed their places at the festival and were each served with one of these larger messes of food water was placed within each mans reach and a handful of soft moss served the purposes of a table napkin so that as at an eastern banquet the hands were washed as often as the mess was changed for amusement the bard recited the praises of the deceased chief and expressed the clans confidence in the blossoming virtues of his successor the seannachie recited the genealogy of the tribe which they traced to the race of the dalriads the harpers played within while the war pipes cheered the multitude without the conversation among the guests was grave subdued and civil no jest was attempted beyond the bounds of a very gentle pleasantry calculated only to excite a passing smile there were no raised voices no contentious arguments and simon glover had heard a hundred times more noise at a guild feast in perth than was made on this occasion by two hundred wild mountaineers  even the liquor itself did not seem to raise the festive party above the same tone of decorous gravity it was of various kinds wine appeared in very small quantities and was served out only to the principal guests among which honoured number simon glover was again included the wine and the two wheaten loaves were indeed the only marks of notice which he received during the feast but niel booshalloch jealous of his masters reputation for hospitality failed not to enlarge on them as proofs of high distinction distilled liquors since so generally used in the highlands were then comparatively unknown the usquebaugh was circulated in small quantities and was highly flavoured with a decoction of saffron and other herbs so as to resemble a medicinal potion rather than a festive cordial cider and mead were seen at the entertainment but ale brewed in great quantities for the purpose and flowing round without restriction was the liquor generally used and that was drunk with a moderation much less known among the more modern highlanders a cup to the memory of the deceased chieftain was the first pledge solemnly proclaimed after the banquet was finished and a low murmur of benedictions was heard from the company while the monks alone uplifting their united voices sung requiem eternam dona an unusual silence followed as if something extraordinary was expected when eachin arose with a bold and manly yet modest grace and ascended the vacant seat or throne saying with dignity and firmness  this seat and my fathers inheritance i claim as my rightso prosper me god and st barr  how will you rule your fathers children said an old man the uncle of the deceased  i will defend them with my fathers sword and distribute justice to them under my fathers banner  the old man with a trembling hand unsheathed the ponderous weapon and holding it by the blade offered the hilt to the young chieftains grasp at the same time torquil of the oak unfurled the pennon of the tribe and swung it repeatedly over eachins head who with singular grace and dexterity brandished the huge claymore as in its defence the guests raised a yelling shout to testify their acceptance of the patriarchal chief who claimed their allegiance nor was there any who in the graceful and agile youth before them was disposed to recollect the subject of sinister vaticinations as he stood in glittering mail resting on the long sword and acknowledging by gracious gestures the acclamations which rent the air within without and around simon glover was tempted to doubt whether this majestic figure was that of the same lad whom he had often treated with little ceremony and began to have some apprehension of the consequences of having done so a general burst of minstrelsy succeeded to the acclamations and rock and greenwood rang to harp and pipes as lately to shout and yell of woe  it would be tedious to pursue the progress of the inaugural feast or detail the pledges that were quaffed to former heroes of the clan and above all to the twentynine brave galloglasses who were to fight in the approaching conflict under the eye and leading of their young chief the bards assuming in old times the prophetic character combined with their own ventured to assure them of the most distinguished victory and to predict the fury with which the blue falcon the emblem of the clan quhele should rend to pieces the mountain cat the well known badge of the clan chattan  it was approaching sunset when a bowl called the grace cup made of oak hooped with silver was handed round the table as the signal of dispersion although it was left free to any who chose a longer carouse to retreat to any of the outer bothies as for simon glover the booshalloch conducted him to a small hut contrived it would seem for the use of a single individual where a bed of heath and moss was arranged as well as the season would permit and an ample supply of such delicacies as the late feast afforded showed that all care had been taken for the inhabitants accommodation  do not leave this hut said the booshalloch taking leave of his friend and protege this is your place of rest but apartments are lost on such a night of confusion and if the badger leaves his hole the toad will creep into it  to simon glover this arrangement was by no means disagreeable he had been wearied by the noise of the day and felt desirous of repose after eating therefore a morsel which his appetite scarce required and drinking a cup of wine to expel the cold he muttered his evening prayer wrapt himself in his cloak and lay down on a couch which old acquaintance had made familiar and easy to him the hum and murmur and even the occasional shouts of some of the festive multitude who continued revelling without did not long interrupt his repose and in about ten minutes he was as fast asleep as if he had lain in his own bed in curfew street    chapter xxix       still harping on my daughter       hamlet   two hours before the black cock crew simon glover was wakened by a well known voice which called him by name  what conachar he replied as he started from sleep is the morning so far advanced and raising his eyes the person of whom he was dreaming stood before him and at the same moment the events of yesterday rushing on his recollection he saw with surprise that the vision retained the form which sleep had assigned it and it was not the mail clad highland chief with claymore in hand as he had seen him the preceding night but conachar of curfew street in his humble apprentices garb holding in his hand a switch of oak an apparition would not more have surprised our perth burgher as he gazed with wonder the youth turned upon him a piece of lighted bog wood which he carried in a lantern and to his waking exclamation replied  even so father simon it is conachar come to renew our old acquaintance when our intercourse will attract least notice  so saying he sat down on a tressel which answered the purpose of a chair and placing the lantern beside him proceeded in the most friendly tone  i have tasted of thy good cheer many a day father simon i trust thou hast found no lack in my family  none whatever eachin macian answered the glover for the simplicity of the celtic language and manners rejects all honorary titles it was even too good for this fasting season and much too good for me since i must be ashamed to think how hard you fared in curfew street  even too well to use your own word said conachar for the deserts of an idle apprentice and for the wants of a young highlander but yesterday if there was as i trust enough of food found you not good glover some lack of courteous welcome excuse it noti know you did so but i am young in authority with my people and i must not too early draw their attention to the period of my residence in the lowlands which however i can never forget  i understand the cause entirely said simon and therefore it is unwillingly and as it were by force that i have made so early a visit hither  hush fatherhush it is well you are come to see some of my highland splendour while it yet sparkles return after palm sunday and who knows whom or what you may find in the territories we now possess the wildcat may have made his lodge where the banqueting bower of macian now stands  the young chief was silent and pressed the top of the rod to his lips as if to guard against uttering more  there is no fear of that eachin said simon in that vague way in which lukewarm comforters endeavour to turn the reflections of their friends from the consideration of inevitable danger  there is fear and there is peril of utter ruin answered eachin and there is positive certainty of great loss i marvel my father consented to this wily proposal of albany i would macgillie chattanach would agree with me and then instead of wasting our best blood against each other we would go down together to strathmore and kill and take possession i would rule at perth and he at dundee and all the great strath should be our own to the banks of the firth of tay such is the policy i have caught from your old grey head father simon when holding a trencher at thy back and listening to thy evening talk with bailie craigdallie  the tongue is well called an unruly member thought the glover here have i been holding a candle to the devil to show him the way to mischief  but he only said aloud these plans come too late  too late indeed answered eachin the indentures of battle are signed by our marks and seals the burning hate of the clan quhele and clan chattan is blown up to an inextinguishable flame by mutual insults and boasts yes the time is passed by but to thine own affairs father glover it is religion that has brought thee hither as i learn from niel booshalloch surely my experience of thy prudence did not lead me to suspect thee of any quarrel with mother church as for my old acquaintance father clement he is one of those who hunt after the crown of martyrdom and think a stake surrounded with blazing fagots better worth embracing than a willing bride he is a very knight errant in defence of his religious notions and does battle wherever he comes he hath already a quarrel with the monks of sibyls isle yonder about some point of doctrine hast seen him  i have answered simon but we spoke little together the time being pressing  he may have said that there is a third personone more likely i think to be a true fugitive for religion than either you a shrewd citizen or he a wrangling preacherwho would be right heartily welcome to share our protection thou art dull man and wilt not guess my meaningthy daughter catharine  these last words the young chief spoke in english and he continued the conversation in that language as if apprehensive of being overheard and indeed as if under the sense of some involuntary hesitation  my daughter catharine said the glover remembering what the carthusian had told him is well and safe  but where or with whom said the young chief and wherefore came she not with you think you the clan quhele have no cailliachs as active as old dorothy whose hand has warmed my haffits before now to wait upon the daughter of their chieftains master  again i thank you said the glover and doubt neither your power nor your will to protect my daughter as well as myself but an honourable lady the friend of sir patrick charteris hath offered her a safe place of refuge without the risk of a toilsome journey through a desolate and distracted country  oh ay sir patrick charteris said eachin in a more reserved and distant tone he must be preferred to all men without doubt he is your friend i think  simon glover longed to punish this affectation of a boy who had been scolded four times a day for running into the street to see sir patrick charteris ride past but he checked his spirit of repartee and simply said  sir patrick charteris has been provost of perth for seven years and it is likely is so still since the magistrates are elected not in lent but at st martinmas  ah father glover said the youth in his kinder and more familiar mode of address you are so used to see the sumptuous shows and pageants of perth that you would but little relish our barbarous festival in comparison what didst thou think of our ceremonial of yesterday  it was noble and touching said the glover and to me who knew your father most especially so when you rested on the sword and looked around you methought i saw mine old friend gilchrist macian arisen from the dead and renewed in years and in strength  i played my part there boldly i trust and showed little of that paltry apprentice boy whom you used touse just as he deserved  eachin resembles conachar said the glover no more than a salmon resembles a gar though men say they are the same fish in a different state or than a butterfly resembles a grub  thinkest thou that while i was taking upon me the power which all women love i would have been myself an object for a maidens eye to rest upon to speak plain what would catharine have thought of me in the ceremonial  we approach the shallows now thought simon glover and without nice pilotage we drive right on shore  most women like show eachin but i think my daughter catharine be an exception she would rejoice in the good fortune of her household friend and playmate but she would not value the splendid macian captain of clan quhele more than the orphan conachar  she is ever generous and disinterested replied the young chief but yourself father have seen the world for many more years than she has done and can better form a judgment what power and wealth do for those who enjoy them think and speak sincerely what would be your own thoughts if you saw your catharine standing under yonder canopy with the command over an hundred hills and the devoted obedience of ten thousand vassals and as the price of these advantages her hand in that of the man who loves her the best in the world  meaning in your own conachar said simon  ay conachar call me i love the name since it was by that i have been known to catharine  sincerely then said the glover endeavouring to give the least offensive turn to his reply my inmost thought would be the earnest wish that catharine and i were safe in our humble booth in curfew street with dorothy for our only vassal  and with poor conachar also i trust you would not leave him to pine away in solitary grandeur  i would not answered the glover wish so ill to the clan quhele mine ancient friends as to deprive them at the moment of emergency of a brave young chief and that chief of the fame which he is about to acquire at their head in the approaching conflict  eachin bit his lip to suppress his irritated feelings as he replied wordswordsempty words father simon you fear the clan quhele more than you love them and you suppose their indignation would be formidable should their chief marry the daughter of a burgess of perth  and if i do fear such an issue hector macian have i not reason how have ill assorted marriages had issue in the house of maccallanmore in that of the powerful macleansnay of the lords of the isles themselves what has ever come of them but divorce and exheredation sometimes worse fate to the ambitious intruder you could not marry my child before a priest and you could only wed her with your left hand and i he checked the strain of impetuosity which the subject inspired and concluded and i am an honest though humble burgher of perth who would rather my child were the lawful and undoubted spouse of a citizen in my own rank than the licensed concubine of a monarch  i will wed catharine before the priest and before the world before the altar and before the black stones of iona said the impetuous young man she is the love of my youth and there is not a tie in religion or honour but i will bind myself by them i have sounded my people if we do but win this combatand with the hope of gaining catharine we shall win itmy heart tells me soi shall be so much lord over their affections that were i to take a bride from the almshouse so it was my pleasure they would hail her as if she were a daughter of maccallanmore but you reject my suit said eachin sternly  you put words of offence in my mouth said the old man and may next punish me for them since i am wholly in your power but with my consent my daughter shall never wed save in her own degree her heart would break amid the constant wars and scenes of bloodshed which connect themselves with your lot if you really love her and recollect her dread of strife and combat you would not wish her to be subjected to the train of military horrors in which you like your father must needs be inevitably and eternally engaged choose a bride amongst the daughters of the mountain chiefs my son or fiery lowland nobles you are fair young rich high born and powerful and will not woo in vain you will readily find one who will rejoice in your conquests and cheer you under defeat to catharine the one would be as frightful as the other a warrior must wear a steel gauntlet a glove of kidskin would be torn to pieces in an hour  a dark cloud passed over the face of the young chief lately animated with so much fire  farewell he said the only hope which could have lighted me to fame or victory  he remained for a space silent and intensely thoughtful with downcast eyes a lowering brow and folded arms at length he raised his hands and said fatherfor such you have been to mei am about to tell you a secret reason and pride both advise me to be silent but fate urges me and must be obeyed i am about to lodge in you the deepest and dearest secret that man ever confided to man but bewareend this conference how it willbeware how you ever breathe a syllable of what i am now to trust to you for know that were you to do so in the most remote corner of scotland i have ears to hear it even there and a hand and poniard to reach a traitors bosom i ambut the word will not out  do not speak it then said the prudent glover a secret is no longer safe when it crosses the lips of him who owns it and i desire not a confidence so dangerous as you menace me with  ay but i must speak and you must hear said the youth in this age of battle father you have yourself been a combatant  once only replied simon when the southron assaulted the fair city i was summoned to take my part in the defence as my tenure required like that of other craftsmen who are bound to keep watch and ward  and how felt you upon that matter inquired the young chief  what can that import to the present business said simon in some surprise  much else i had not asked the question answered eachin in the tone of haughtiness which from time to time he assumed  an old man is easily brought to speak of olden times said simon not unwilling on an instants reflection to lead the conversation away from the subject of his daughter and i must needs confess my feelings were much short of the high cheerful confidence nay the pleasure with which i have seen other men go to battle my life and profession were peaceful and though i have not wanted the spirit of a man when the time demanded it yet i have seldom slept worse than the night before that onslaught my ideas were harrowed by the tales we were toldnothing short of the truthabout the saxon archers how they drew shafts of a cloth yard length and used bows a third longer than ours when i fell into a broken slumber if but a straw in the mattress pricked my side i started and waked thinking an english arrow was quivering in my body in the morning as i began for very weariness to sink into some repose i was waked by the tolling of the common bell which called us burghers to the walls i never heard its sound peal so like a passing knell before or since  go onwhat further chanced demanded eachin  i did on my harness said simon such as it was took my mothers blessing a high spirited woman who spoke of my fathers actions for the honour of the fair town this heartened me and i felt still bolder when i found myself ranked among the other crafts all bowmen for thou knowest the perth citizens have good skill in archery we were dispersed on the walls several knights and squires in armour of proof being mingled amongst us who kept a bold countenance confident perhaps in their harness and informed us for our encouragement that they would cut down with their swords and axes any of those who should attempt to quit their post i was kindly assured of this myself by the old kempe of kinfauns as he was called this good sir patricks father then our provost he was a grandson of the red rover tom of longueville and a likely man to keep his word which he addressed to me in especial because a night of much discomfort may have made me look paler than usual and besides i was but a lad  and did his exhortation add to your fear or your resolution said eachin who seemed very attentive  to my resolution answered simon for i think nothing can make a man so bold to face one danger at some distance in his front as the knowledge of another close behind him to push him forward well i mounted the walls in tolerable heart and was placed with others on the spey tower being accounted a good bowman but a very cold fit seized me as i saw the english in great order with their archers in front and their men at arms behind marching forward to the attack in strong columns three in number they came on steadily and some of us would fain have shot at them but it was strictly forbidden and we were obliged to remain motionless sheltering ourselves behind the battlement as we best might as the southron formed their long ranks into lines each man occupying his place as by magic and preparing to cover themselves by large shields called pavesses which they planted before them i again felt a strange breathlessness and some desire to go home for a glass of distilled waters but as i looked aside i saw the worthy kempe of kinfauns bending a large crossbow and i thought it pity he should waste the bolt on a true hearted scotsman when so many english were in presence so i een staid where i was being in a comfortable angle formed by two battlements the english then strode forward and drew their bowstringsnot to the breast as your highland kerne do but to the earand sent off their volleys of swallow tails before we could call on st andrew i winked when i saw them haul up their tackle and i believe i started as the shafts began to rattle against the parapet but looking round me and seeing none hurt but john squallit the town crier whose jaws were pierced through with a cloth yard shaft i took heart of grace and shot in my turn with good will and good aim a little man i shot at who had just peeped out from behind his target dropt with a shaft through his shoulder the provost cried well stitched simon glover st john for his own town my fellow craftsmen shouted i though i was then but an apprentice and if you will believe me in the rest of the skirmish which was ended by the foes drawing off i drew bowstring and loosed shaft as calmly as if i had been shooting at butts instead of mens breasts i gained some credit and i have ever afterwards thought that in case of necessityfor with me it had never been matter of choicei should not have lost it again and this is all i can tell of warlike experience in battle other dangers i have had which i have endeavoured to avoid like a wise man or when they were inevitable i have faced them like a true one upon other terms a man cannot live or hold up his head in scotland  i understand your tale said eachin but i shall find it difficult to make you credit mine knowing the race of which i am descended and especially that i am the son of him whom we have this day laid in the tombwell that he lies where he will never learn what you are now to hear look my father the light which i bear grows short and pale a few minutes will extinguish it but before it expires the hideous tale will be told father i ama coward it is said at last and the secret of my disgrace is in keeping of another  the young man sunk back in a species of syncope produced by the agony of his mind as he made the fatal communication the glover moved as well by fear as by compassion applied himself to recall him to life and succeeded in doing so but not in restoring him to composure he hid his face with his hands and his tears flowed plentifully and bitterly  for our ladys sake be composed said the old man and recall the vile word i know you better than yourself you are no coward but only too young and inexperienced ay and somewhat too quick of fancy to have the steady valour of a bearded man i would hear no other man say that of you conachar without giving him the lie you are no coward i have seen high sparks of spirit fly from you even on slight enough provocation  high sparks of pride and passion said the unfortunate youth but when saw you them supported by the resolution that should have backed them the sparks you speak of fell on my dastardly heart as on a piece of ice which could catch fire from nothing if my offended pride urged me to strike my weakness of mind prompted me the next moment to fly  want of habit said simon it is by clambering over walls that youths learn to scale precipices begin with slight feuds exercise daily the arms of your country in tourney with your followers  and what leisure is there for this exclaimed the young chief starting as if something horrid had occurred to his imagination how many days are there betwixt this hour and palm sunday and what is to chance then a list inclosed from which no man can stir more than the poor bear who is chained to his stake sixty living men the best and fiercestone alone exceptedwhich albyn can send down from her mountains all athirst for each others blood while a king and his nobles and shouting thousands besides attend as at a theatre to encourage their demoniac fury blows clang and blood flows thicker faster redder they rush on each other like madmen they tear each other like wild beasts the wounded are trodden to death amid the feet of their companions blood ebbs arms become weak but there must be no parley no truce no interruption while any of the maimed wretches remain alive here is no crouching behind battlements no fighting with missile weapons all is hand to hand till hands can no longer be raised to maintain the ghastly conflict if such a field is so horrible in idea what think you it will be in reality  the glover remained silent  i say again what think you  i can only pity you conachar said simon it is hard to be the descendant of a lofty linethe son of a noble fatherthe leader by birth of a gallant array and yet to want or think you want for still i trust the fault lies much in a quick fancy that over estimates dangerto want that dogged quality which is possessed by every game cock that is worth a handful of corn every hound that is worth a mess of offal but how chanced it that with such a consciousness of inability to fight in this battle you proffered even now to share your chiefdom with my daughter your power must depend on your fighting this combat and in that catharine cannot help you  you mistake old man replied eachin were catharine to look kindly on the earnest love i bear her it would carry me against the front of the enemies with the mettle of a war horse overwhelming as my sense of weakness is the feeling that catharine looked on would give me strength say yetoh say yetshe shall be mine if we gain the combat and not the gow chrom himself whose heart is of a piece with his anvil ever went to battle so light as i shall do one strong passion is conquered by another  this is folly conachar cannot the recollection of your interest your honour your kindred do as much to stir your courage as the thoughts of a brent browed lass fie upon you man  you tell me but what i have told myself but it is in vain replied eachin with a sigh it is only whilst the timid stag is paired with the doe that he is desperate and dangerous be it from constitution be it as our highland cailliachs will say from the milk of the white doe be it from my peaceful education and the experience of your strict restraint be it as you think from an overheated fancy which paints danger yet more dangerous and ghastly than it is in reality i cannot tell but i know my failing andyes it must be saidso sorely dread that i cannot conquer it that could i have your consent to my wishes on such terms i would even here make a pause renounce the rank i have assumed and retire into humble life  what turn glover at last conachar said simon this beats the legend of st crispin naynay your hand was not framed for that you shall spoil me no more doe skins  jest not said eachin i am serious if i cannot labour i will bring wealth enough to live without it they will proclaim me recreant with horn and war pipe let them do so catharine will love me the better that i have preferred the paths of peace to those of bloodshed and father clement shall teach us to pity and forgive the world which will load us with reproaches that wound not i shall be the happiest of men catharine will enjoy all that unbounded affection can confer upon her and will be freed from apprehension of the sights and sounds of horror which your ill assorted match would have prepared for her and you father glover shall occupy your chimney corner the happiest and most honoured man that ever  hold eachini prithee hold said the glover the fir light with which this discourse must terminate burns very low and i would speak a word in my turn and plain dealing is best though it may vex or perhaps enrage you let me end these visions by saying at once catharine can never be yours a glove is the emblem of faith and a man of my craft should therefore less than any other break his own catharines hand is promisedpromised to a man whom you may hate but whom you must honourto henry the armourer the match is fitting by degree agreeable to their mutual wishes and i have given my promise it is best to be plain at once resent my refusal as you willi am wholly in your power but nothing shall make me break my word  the glover spoke thus decidedly because he was aware from experience that the very irritable disposition of his former apprentice yielded in most cases to stern and decided resolution yet recollecting where he was it was with some feelings of fear that he saw the dying flame leap up and spread a flash of light on the visage of eachin which seemed pale as the grave while his eye rolled like that of a maniac in his fever fit the light instantly sunk down and died and simon felt a momentary terror lest he should have to dispute for his life with the youth whom he knew to be capable of violent actions when highly excited however short a period his nature could support the measures which his passion commenced he was relieved by the voice of eachin who muttered in a hoarse and altered tone  let what we have spoken this night rest in silence for ever if thou bringst it to light thou wert better dig thine own grave  thus speaking the door of the hut opened admitting a gleam of moonshine the form of the retiring chief crossed it for an instant the hurdle was then closed and the shieling left in darkness  simon glover felt relieved when a conversation fraught with offence and danger was thus peaceably terminated but he remained deeply affected by the condition of hector macian whom he had himself bred up  the poor child said he to be called up to a place of eminence only to be hurled from it with contempt what he told me i partly knew having often remarked that conachar was more prone to quarrel than to fight but this overpowering faint heartedness which neither shame nor necessity can overcome i though no sir william wallace cannot conceive and to propose himself for a husband to my daughter as if a bride were to find courage for herself and the bridegroom nono catharine must wed a man to whom she may say husband spare your enemynot one in whose behalf she must cry generous enemy spare my husband  tired out with these reflections the old man at length fell asleep in the morning he was awakened by his friend the booshalloch who with something of a blank visage proposed to him to return to his abode on the meadow at the ballough he apologised that the chief could not see simon glover that morning being busied with things about the expected combat and that eachin macian thought the residence at the ballough would be safest for simon glovers health and had given charge that every care should be taken for his protection and accommodation  niel booshalloch dilated on these circumstances to gloss over the neglect implied in the chiefs dismissing his visitor without a particular audience  his father knew better said the herdsman but where should he have learned manners poor thing and bred up among your perth burghers who excepting yourself neighbour glover who speak gaelic as well as i do are a race incapable of civility  simon glover it may be well believed felt none of the want of respect which his friend resented on his account on the contrary he greatly preferred the quiet residence of the good herdsman to the tumultuous hospitality of the daily festival of the chief even if there had not just passed an interview with eachin upon a subject which it would be most painful to revive  to the ballough therefore he quietly retreated where could he have been secure of catharines safety his leisure was spent pleasantly enough his amusement was sailing on the lake in a little skiff which a highland boy managed while the old man angled he frequently landed on the little island where he mused over the tomb of his old friend gilchrist macian and made friends with the monks presenting the prior with gloves of martens fur and the superior officers with each of them a pair made from the skin of the wildcat the cutting and stitching of these little presents served to beguile the time after sunset while the family of the herdsman crowded around admiring his address and listening to the tales and songs with which the old man had skill to pass away a heavy evening  it must be confessed that the cautious glover avoided the conversation of father clement whom he erroneously considered as rather the author of his misfortunes than the guiltless sharer of them i will not he thought to please his fancies lose the goodwill of these kind monks which may be one day useful to me i have suffered enough by his preachments already i trow little the wiser and much the poorer they have made me nono catharine and clement may think as they will but i will take the first opportunity to sneak back like a rated hound at the call of his master submit to a plentiful course of haircloth and whipcord disburse a lusty mulct and become whole with the church again  more than a fortnight had passed since the glover had arrived at ballough and he began to wonder that he had not heard news of catharine or of henry wynd to whom he concluded the provost had communicated the plan and place of his retreat he knew the stout smith dared not come up into the clan quhele country on account of various feuds with the inhabitants and with eachin himself while bearing the name of conachar but yet the glover thought henry might have found means to send him a message or a token by some one of the various couriers who passed and repassed between the court and the headquarters of the clan quhele in order to concert the terms of the impending combat the march of the parties to perth and other particulars requiring previous adjustment it was now the middle of march and the fatal palm sunday was fast approaching  whilst time was thus creeping on the exiled glover had not even once set eyes upon his former apprentice the care that was taken to attend to his wants and convenience in every respect showed that he was not forgotten but yet when he heard the chieftains horn ringing through the woods he usually made it a point to choose his walk in a different direction one morning however he found himself unexpectedly in eachins close neighbourhood with scarce leisure to avoid him and thus it happened  as simon strolled pensively through a little silvan glade surrounded on either side with tall forest trees mixed with underwood a white doe broke from the thicket closely pursued by two deer greyhounds one of which griped her haunch the other her throat and pulled her down within half a furlong of the glover who was something startled at the suddenness of the incident the ear and piercing blast of a horn and the baying of a slow hound made simon aware that the hunters were close behind and on the trace of the deer hallooing and the sound of men running through the copse were heard close at hand a moments recollection would have satisfied simon that his best way was to stand fast or retire slowly and leave it to eachin to acknowledge his presence or not as he should see cause but his desire of shunning the young man had grown into a kind of instinct and in the alarm of finding him so near simon hid himself in a bush of hazels mixed with holly which altogether concealed him he had hardly done so ere eachin rosy with exercise dashed from the thicket into the open glade accompanied by his foster father torquil of the oak the latter with equal strength and address turned the struggling hind on her back and holding her forefeet in his right hand while he knelt on her body offered his skene with the left to the young chief that he might cut the animals throat  it may not be torquil do thine office and take the assay thyself i must not kill the likeness of my foster  this was spoken with a melancholy smile while a tear at the same time stood in the speakers eye torquil stared at his young chief for an instant then drew his sharp wood knife across the creatures throat with a cut so swift and steady that the weapon reached the backbone then rising on his feet and again fixing a long piercing look on his chief he said as much as i have done to that hind would i do to any living man whose ears could have heard my dault foster son so much as name a white doe and couple the word with hectors name  if simon had no reason before to keep himself concealed this speech of torquil furnished him with a pressing one  it cannot be concealed father torquil said eachin it will all out to the broad day  what will out what will to broad day asked torquil in surprise  it is the fatal secret thought simon and now if this huge privy councillor cannot keep silence i shall be made answerable i suppose for eachins disgrace having been blown abroad  thinking thus anxiously he availed himself at the same time of his position to see as much as he could of what passed between the afflicted chieftain and his confidant impelled by that spirit of curiosity which prompts us in the most momentous as well as the most trivial occasions of life and which is sometimes found to exist in company with great personal fear  as torquil listened to what eachin communicated the young man sank into his arms and supporting himself on his shoulder concluded his confession by a whisper into his ear torquil seemed to listen with such amazement as to make him incapable of crediting his ears as if to be certain that it was eachin who spoke he gradually roused the youth from his reclining posture and holding him up in some measure by a grasp on his shoulder fixed on him an eye that seemed enlarged and at the same time turned to stone by the marvels he listened to and so wild waxed the old mans visage after he had heard the murmured communication that simon glover apprehended he would cast the youth from him as a dishonoured thing in which case he might have lighted among the very copse in which he lay concealed and occasioned his discovery in a manner equally painful and dangerous but the passions of torquil who entertained for his foster child even a double portion of that passionate fondness which always attends that connexion in the highlands took a different turn  i believe it not he exclaimed it is false of thy fathers child false of thy mothers son falsest of my dault i offer my gage to heaven and hell and will maintain the combat with him that shall call it true thou hast been spellbound by an evil eye my darling and the fainting which you call cowardice is the work of magic i remember the bat that struck the torch out on the hour that thou wert bornthat hour of grief and of joy cheer up my beloved thou shalt with me to iona and the good st columbus with the whole choir of blessed saints and angels who ever favoured thy race shall take from thee the heart of the white doe and return that which they have stolen from thee  eachin listened with a look as if he would fain have believed the words of the comforter  but torquil he said supposing this might avail us the fatal day approaches and if i go to the lists i dread me we shall be shamed  it cannot beit shall not said torquil hell shall not prevail so far we will steep thy sword in holy water place vervain st johns wort and rowan tree in thy crest we will surround thee i and thy eight brethren thou shalt be safe as in a castle  again the youth helplessly uttered something which from the dejected tone in which it was spoken simon could not understand while torquils deep tones in reply fell full and distinct upon his ear  yes there may be a chance of withdrawing thee from the conflict thou art the youngest who is to draw blade now hear me and thou shalt know what it is to have a foster fathers love and how far it exceeds the love even of kinsmen the youngest on the indenture of the clan chattan is ferquhard day his father slew mine and the red blood is seething hot between us i looked to palm sunday as the term that should cool it but mark thou wouldst have thought that the blood in the veins of this ferquhard day and in mine would not have mingled had they been put into the same vessel yet hath he cast the eyes of his love upon my only daughter eva the fairest of our maidens think with what feelings i heard the news it was as if a wolf from the skirts of farragon had said give me thy child in wedlock torquil my child thought not thus she loves ferquhard and weeps away her colour and strength in dread of the approaching battle let her give him but a sign of favour and well i know he will forget kith and kin forsake the field and fly with her to the desert  he the youngest of the champions of clan chattan being absent i the youngest of the clan quhele may be excused from combat said eachin blushing at the mean chance of safety thus opened to him  see now my chief said torquil and judge my thoughts towards thee others might give thee their own lives and that of their sonsi sacrifice to thee the honour of my house  my friendmy father repeated the chief folding torquil to his bosom what a base wretch am i that have a spirit dastardly enough to avail myself of your sacrifice  speak not of that green woods have ears let us back to the camp and send our gillies for the venison back dogs and follow at heel  the slowhound or lyme dog luckily for simon had drenched his nose in the blood of the deer else he might have found the glovers lair in the thicket but its more acute properties of scent being lost it followed tranquilly with the gazehounds  when the hunters were out of sight and hearing the glover arose greatly relieved by their departure and began to move off in the opposite direction as fast as his age permitted his first reflection was on the fidelity of the foster father  the wild mountain heart is faithful and true yonder man is more like the giants in romaunts than a man of mould like ourselves and yet christians might take an example from him for his lealty a simple contrivance this though to finger a man from off their enemies chequer as if there would not be twenty of the wildcats ready to supply his place  thus thought the glover not aware that the strictest proclamations were issued prohibiting any of the two contending clans their friends allies and dependants from coming within fifty miles of perth during a week before and a week after the combat which regulation was to be enforced by armed men  so soon as our friend simon arrived at the habitation of the herdsman he found other news awaiting him they were brought by father clement who came in a pilgrims cloak or dalmatic ready to commence his return to the southward and desirous to take leave of his companion in exile or to accept him as a travelling companion  but what said the citizen has so suddenly induced you to return within the reach of danger  have you not heard said father clement that march and his english allies having retired into england before the earl of douglas the good earl has applied himself to redress the evils of the commonwealth and hath written to the court letters desiring that the warrant for the high court of commission against heresy be withdrawn as a trouble to mens consciences that the nomination of henry of wardlaw to be prelate of st andrews be referred to the parliament with sundry other things pleasing to the commons now most of the nobles that are with the king at perth and with them sir patrick charteris your worthy provost have declared for the proposals of the douglas the duke of albany had agreed to themwhether from goodwill or policy i know not the good king is easily persuaded to mild and gentle courses and thus are the jaw teeth of the oppressors dashed to pieces in their sockets and the prey snatched from their ravening talons will you with me to the lowlands or do you abide here a little space  neil booshalloch saved his friend the trouble of reply  he had the chiefs authority he said for saying that simon glover should abide until the champions went down to the battle  in this answer the citizen saw something not quite consistent with his own perfect freedom of volition but he cared little for it at the time as it furnished a good apology for not travelling along with the clergyman  an exemplary man he said to his friend niel booshalloch as soon as father clement had taken leavea great scholar and a great saint it is a pity almost he is no longer in danger to be burned as his sermon at the stake would convert thousands o niel booshalloch father clements pile would be a sweet savouring sacrifice and a beacon to all decent christians but what would the burning of a borrel ignorant burgess like me serve men offer not up old glove leather for incense nor are beacons fed with undressed hides i trow sooth to speak i have too little learning and too much fear to get credit by the affair and therefore i should in our homely phrase have both the scathe and the scorn  true for you answered the herdsman    chapter xxx        we must return to the characters of our dramatic narrative whom we      left at perth when we accompanied the glover and his fair daughter      to kinfauns and from that hospitable mansion traced the course of      simon to loch tay and the prince as the highest personage claims      our immediate attention  this rash and inconsiderate young man endured with some impatience his sequestered residence with the lord high constable with whose company otherwise in every respect satisfactory he became dissatisfied from no other reason than that he held in some degree the character of his warder incensed against his uncle and displeased with his father he longed not unnaturally for the society of sir john ramorny on whom he had been so long accustomed to throw himself for amusement and though he would have resented the imputation as an insult for guidance and direction he therefore sent him a summons to attend him providing his health permitted and directed him to come by water to a little pavilion in the high constables garden which like that of sir johns own lodgings ran down to the tay in renewing an intimacy so dangerous rothsay only remembered that he had been sir join ramornys munificent friend while sir john on receiving the invitation only recollected on his part the capricious insults he had sustained from his patron the loss of his hand and the lightness with which he had treated the subject and the readiness with which rothsay had abandoned his cause in the matter of the bonnet makers slaughter he laughed bitterly when he read the princes billet  eviot he said man a stout boat with six trusty mentrusty men mark melose not a moment and bid dwining instantly come hither  heaven smiles on us my trusty friend he said to the mediciner i was but beating my brains how to get access to this fickle boy and here he sends to invite me  hem i see the matter very clearly said dwining heaven smiles on some untoward consequenceshe he he  no matter the trap is ready and it is baited too my friend with what would lure the boy from a sanctuary though a troop with drawn weapons waited him in the churchyard yet is it scarce necessary his own weariness of himself would have done the job get thy matters readythou goest with us write to him as i cannot that we come instantly to attend his commands and do it clerkly he reads well and that he owes to me  he will be your valiancies debtor for more knowledge before he dieshe he he but is your bargain sure with the duke of albany  enough to gratify my ambition thy avarice and the revenge of both aboardaboard and speedily let eviot throw in a few flasks of the choicest wine and some cold baked meats  but your arm my lord sir john does it not pain you  the throbbing of my heart silences the pain of my wound it beats as it would burst my bosom  heaven forbid said dwining adding in a low voiceit would be a strange sight if it should i should like to dissect it save that its stony case would spoil my best instruments  in a few minutes they were in the boat while a speedy messenger carried the note to the prince  rothsay was seated with the constable after their noontide repast he was sullen and silent and the earl had just asked whether it was his pleasure that the table should be cleared when a note delivered to the prince changed at once his aspect  as you will he said i go to the pavilion in the gardenalways with permission of my lord constableto receive my late master of the horse  my lord said lord errol  ay my lord must i ask permission twice  no surely my lord answered the constable but has your royal highness recollected that sir john ramorny  has not the plague i hope replied the duke of rothsay come errol you would play the surly turnkey but it is not in your nature farewell for half an hour  a new folly said errol as the prince flinging open a lattice of the ground parlour in which they sat stept out into the gardena new folly to call back that villain to his counsels but he is infatuated  the prince in the mean time looked back and said hastily  your lordships good housekeeping will afford us a flask or two of wine and a slight collation in the pavilion i love the al fresco of the river  the constable bowed and gave the necessary orders so that sir john found the materials of good cheer ready displayed when landing from his barge he entered the pavilion  it grieves my heart to see your highness under restraint said ramorny with a well executed appearance of sympathy  that grief of thine will grieve mine said the prince i am sure here has errol and a right true hearted lord he is so tired me with grave looks and something like grave lessons that he has driven me back to thee thou reprobate from whom as i expect nothing good i may perhaps obtain something entertaining yet ere we say more it was foul work that upon the fasterns even ramorny i well hope thou gavest not aim to it  on my honour my lord a simple mistake of the brute bonthron i did hint to him that a dry beating would be due to the fellow by whom i had lost a hand and lo you my knave makes a double mistake he takes one man for another and instead of the baton he uses the axe  it is well that it went no farther small matter for the bonnet maker but i had never forgiven you had the armourer fallenthere is not his match in britain but i hope they hanged the villain high enough  if thirty feet might serve replied ramorny  pah no more of him said rothsay his wretched name makes the good wine taste of blood and what are the news in perth ramorny how stands it with the bona robas and the galliards  little galliardise stirring my lord answered the knight all eyes are turned to the motions of the black douglas who comes with five thousand chosen men to put us all to rights as if he were bound for another otterburn it is said he is to be lieutenant again it is certain many have declared for his faction  it is time then my feet were free said rothsay otherwise i may find a worse warder than errol  ah my lord were you once away from this place you might make as bold a head as douglas  ramorny said the prince gravely i have but a confused remembrance of your once having proposed something horrible to me beware of such counsel i would be freei would have my person at my own disposal but i will never levy arms against my father nor those it pleases him to trust  it was only for your royal highnesss personal freedom that i was presuming to speak answered ramorny were i in your graces place i would get me into that good boat which hovers on the tay and drop quietly down to fife where you have many friends and make free to take possession of falkland it is a royal castle and though the king has bestowed it in gift on your uncle yet surely even if the grant were not subject to challenge your grace might make free with the residence of so near a relative  he hath made free with mine said the duke as the stewartry of renfrew can tell but stay ramornyhold did i not hear errol say that the lady marjory douglas whom they call duchess of rothsay is at falkland i would neither dwell with that lady nor insult her by dislodging her  the lady was there my lord replied ramorny i have sure advice that she is gone to meet her father  ha to animate the douglas against me or perhaps to beg him to spare me providing i come on my knees to her bed as pilgrims say the emirs and amirals upon whom a saracen soldan bestows a daughter in marriage are bound to do ramorny i will act by the douglass own saying it is better to hear the lark sing than the mouse squeak i will keep both foot and hand from fetters  no place fitter than falkland replied ramorny i have enough of good yeomen to keep the place and should your highness wish to leave it a brief ride reaches the sea in three directions  you speak well but we shall die of gloom yonder neither mirth music nor maidensha said the heedless prince  pardon me noble duke but though the lady marjory douglas be departed like an errant dame in romance to implore succour of her doughty sire there is i may say a lovelier i am sure a younger maiden either presently at falkland or who will soon be on the road thither your highness has not forgotten the fair maid of perth  forget the prettiest wench in scotland noany more than thou hast forgotten the hand that thou hadst in the curfew street onslaught on st valentines eve  the hand that i had your highness would say the hand that i lost as certain as i shall never regain it catharine glover is or will soon be at falkland i will not flatter your highness by saying she expects to meet you in truth she proposes to place herself under the protection of the lady marjory  the little traitress said the princeshe too to turn against me she deserves punishment ramorny  i trust your grace will make her penance a gentle one replied the knight  faith i would have been her father confessor long ago but i have ever found her coy  opportunity was lacking my lord replied ramorny and time presses even now  nay i am but too apt for a frolic but my father  he is personally safe said ramorny and as much at freedom as ever he can be while your highness  must brook fetters conjugal or literali know it yonder comes douglas with his daughter in his hand as haughty and as harsh featured as himself bating touches of age  and at falkland sits in solitude the fairest wench in scotland said ramorny here is penance and restraint yonder is joy and freedom  thou hast prevailed most sage counsellor replied rothsay but mark you it shall be the last of my frolics  i trust so replied ramorny for when at liberty you may make a good accommodation with your royal father  i will write to him ramorny get the writing materials no i cannot put my thoughts in wordsdo thou write  your royal highness forgets said ramorny pointing to his mutilated arm  ah that cursed hand of yours what can we do  so please your highness answered his counsellor if you would use the hand of the mediciner dwininghe writes like a clerk  hath he a hint of the circumstances is he possessed of them  fully said ramorny and stepping to the window he called dwining from the boat  he entered the presence of the prince of scotland creeping as if he trode upon eggs with downcast eyes and a frame that seemed shrunk up by a sense of awe produced by the occasion  there fellow are writing materials i will make trial of you thou knowst the caseplace my conduct to my father in a fair light  dwining sat down and in a few minutes wrote a letter which he handed to sir john ramorny  why the devil has aided thee dwining said the knight listen my dear lord respected father and liege sovereignknow that important considerations induce me to take my departure from this your court purposing to make my abode at falkland both as the seat of my dearest uncle albany with whom i know your majesty would desire me to use all familiarity and as the residence of one from whom i have been too long estranged and with whom i haste to exchange vows of the closest affection from henceforward  the duke of rothsay and ramorny laughed aloud and the physician who had listened to his own scroll as if it were a sentence of death encouraged by their applause raised his eyes uttered faintly his chuckling note of he he and was again grave and silent as if afraid he had transgressed the bounds of reverent respect  admirable said the princeadmirable the old man will apply all this to the duchess as they call her of rothsay dwining thou shouldst be a secretis to his holiness the pope who sometimes it is said wants a scribe that can make one word record two meanings i will subscribe it and have the praise of the device  and now my lord said ramorny sealing the letter and leaving it behind will you not to boat  not till my chamberlain attends with some clothes and necessaries and you may call my sewer also  my lord said ramorny time presses and preparation will but excite suspicion your officers will follow with the mails tomorrow for tonight i trust my poor service may suffice to wait on you at table and chamber  nay this time it is thou who forgets said the prince touching the wounded arm with his walking rod recollect man thou canst neither carve a capon nor tie a pointa goodly sewer or valet of the mouth  ramorny grinned with rage and pain for his wound though in a way of healing was still highly sensitive and even the pointing a finger towards it made him tremble  will your highness now be pleased to take boat  not till i take leave of the lord constable rothsay must not slip away like a thief from a prison from the house of errol summon him hither  my lord duke said ramorny it may be dangerous to our plan  to the devil with danger thy plan and thyself i must and will act to errol as becomes us both  the earl entered agreeable to the princes summons  i gave you this trouble my lord said rothsay with the dignified courtesy which he knew so well how to assume to thank you for your hospitality and your good company i can enjoy them no longer as pressing affairs call me to falkland  my lord said the lord high constable i trust your grace remembers that you areunder ward  howunder ward if i am a prisoner speak plainly if not i will take my freedom to depart  i would my lord your highness would request his majestys permission for this journey there will be much displeasure  mean you displeasure against yourself my lord or against me  i have already said your highness lies in ward here but if you determine to break it i have no warrantgod forbidto put force on your inclinations i can but entreat your highness for your own sake  of my own interest i am the best judge good evening to you my lord  the wilful prince stepped into the boat with dwining and ramorny and waiting for no other attendance eviot pushed off the vessel which descended the tay rapidly by the assistance of sail and oar and of the ebb tide  for some space the duke of rothsay appeared silent and moody nor did his companions interrupt his reflections he raised his head at length and said my father loves a jest and when all is over he will take this frolic at no more serious rate than it deservesa fit of youth with which he will deal as he has with others yonder my masters shows the old hold of kinfauns frowning above the tay now tell me john ramorny how thou hast dealt to get the fair maid of perth out of the hands of yonder bull headed provost for errol told me it was rumoured that she was under his protection  truly she was my lord with the purpose of being transferred to the patronage of the duchessi mean of the lady marjory of douglas now this beetle headed provost who is after all but a piece of blundering valiancy has like most such a retainer of some slyness and cunning whom he uses in all his dealings and whose suggestions he generally considers as his own ideas whenever i would possess myself of a landward baron i address myself to such a confidant who in the present case is called kitt henshaw an old skipper upon the tay and who having in his time sailed as far as campvere holds with sir patrick charteris the respect due to one who has seen foreign countries this his agent i have made my own and by his means have insinuated various apologies in order to postpone the departure of catharine for falkland  but to what good purpose  i know not if it is wise to tell your highness lest you should disapprove of my views i meant the officers of the commission for inquiry into heretical opinions should have found the fair maid at kinfauns for our beauty is a peevish self willed swerver from the church and certes i designed that the knight should have come in for his share of the fines and confiscations that were about to be inflicted the monks were eager enough to be at him seeing he hath had frequent disputes with them about the salmon tithe  but wherefore wouldst thou have ruined the knights fortunes and brought the beautiful young woman to the stake perchance  pshaw my lord duke monks never burn pretty maidens an old woman might have been in some danger and as for my lord provost as they call him if they had clipped off some of his fat acres it would have been some atonement for the needless brave he put on me in st johns church  methinks john it was but a base revenge said rothsay  rest ye contented my lord he that cannot right himself by the hand must use his head well that chance was over by the tender hearted douglass declaring in favour of tender conscience and then my lord old henshaw found no further objections to carrying the fair maid of perth to falkland not to share the dulness of the lady marjorys society as sir patrick charteris and she herself doth opine but to keep your highness from tiring when we return from hunting in the park  there was again a long pause in which the prince seemed to muse deeply at length he spoke ramorny i have a scruple in this matter but if i name it to thee the devil of sophistry with which thou art possessed will argue it out of me as it has done many others this girl is the most beautiful one excepted whom i ever saw or knew and i like her the more that she bears some features ofelizabeth of dunbar but she i mean catharine glover is contracted and presently to be wedded to henry the armourer a craftsman unequalled for skill and a man at arms yet unmatched in the barrace to follow out this intrigue would do a good fellow too much wrong  your highness will not expect me to be very solicitous of henry smiths interest said ramorny looking at his wounded arm  by st andrew with his shored cross this disaster of thine is too much harped upon john ramorny others are content with putting a finger into every mans pie but thou must thrust in thy whole gory hand it is done and cannot be undone let it be forgotten  nay my lord you allude to it more frequently than i answered the knightin derision it is true while ibut i can be silent on the subject if i cannot forget it  well then i tell thee that i have scruple about this intrigue dost thou remember when we went in a frolic to hear father clement preach or rather to see this fair heretic that he spoke as touchingly as a minstrel about the rich man taking away the poor mans only ewe lamb  a great matter indeed answered sir john that this churls wifes eldest son should be fathered by the prince of scotland how many earls would covet the like fate for their fair countesses and how many that have had such good luck sleep not a grain the worse for it  and if i might presume to speak said the mediciner the ancient laws of scotland assigned such a privilege to every feudal lord over his female vassals though lack of spirit and love of money hath made many exchange it for gold  i require no argument to urge me to be kind to a pretty woman but this catharine has been ever cold to me said the prince  nay my lord said ramorny if young handsome and a prince you know not how to make yourself acceptable to a fine woman it is not for me to say more  and if it were not far too great audacity in me to speak again i would say quoth the leech that all perth knows that the gow chrom never was the maidens choice but fairly forced upon her by her father i know for certain that she refused him repeatedly  nay if thou canst assure us of that the case is much altered said rothsay vulcan was a smith as well as harry wynd he would needs wed venus and our chronicles tell us what came of it  then long may lady venus live and be worshipped said sir john ramorny and success to the gallant knight mars who goes awooing to her goddessship  the discourse took a gay and idle turn for a few minutes but the duke of rothsay soon dropped it i have left he said yonder air of the prison house behind me and yet my spirits scarce revive i feel that drowsy not unpleasing yet melancholy mood that comes over us when exhausted by exercise or satiated with pleasure some music now stealing on the ear yet not loud enough to make us lift the eye were a treat for the gods  your grace has but to speak your wishes and the nymphs of the tay are as favourable as the fair ones upon the shore hark it is a lute  a lute said the duke of rothsay listening it is and rarely touched i should remember that dying fall steer towards the boat from whence the music comes  it is old henshaw said ramorny working up the stream how skipper  the boatman answered the hail and drew up alongside of the princes barge  oh ho my old friend said the prince recognising the figure as well as the appointments of the french glee woman louise i think i owe thee something for being the means of thy having a fright at least upon st valentines day into this boat with thee lute puppy dog scrip and all i will prefer thee to a ladys service who shall feed thy very cur on capons and canary  i trust your highness will consider said ramorny  i will consider nothing but my pleasure john pray do thou be so complying as to consider it also  is it indeed to a ladys service you would promote me said the glee maiden and where does she dwell  at falkland answered the prince  oh i have heard of that great lady said louise and will you indeed prefer me to your right royal consorts service  i will by my honourwhenever i receive her as such mark that reservation john said he aside to ramorny  the persons who were in the boat caught up the tidings and concluding a reconciliation was about to take place betwixt the royal couple exhorted louise to profit by her good fortune and add herself to the duchess of rothsays train several offered her some acknowledgment for the exercise of her talents  during this moment of delay ramorny whispered to dwining make in knave with some objection this addition is one too many rouse thy wits while i speak a word with henshaw  if i might presume to speak said dwining as one who have made my studies both in spain and arabia i would say my lord that the sickness has appeared in edinburgh and that there may be risk in admitting this young wanderer into your highnesss vicinity  ah and what is it to thee said rothsay whether i choose to be poisoned by the pestilence or the pothecary must thou too needs thwart my humour  while the prince thus silenced the remonstrances of dwining sir john ramorny had snatched a moment to learn from henshaw that the removal of the duchess of rothsay from falkland was still kept profoundly secret and that catharine glover would arrive there that evening or the next morning in expectation of being taken under the noble ladys protection  the duke of rothsay deeply plunged in thought received this intimation so coldly that ramorny took the liberty of remonstrating this my lord he said is playing the spoiled child of fortune you wish for liberty it comes you wish for beauty it awaits you with just so much delay as to render the boon more precious even your slightest desires seem a law to the fates for you desire music when it seems most distant and the lute and song are at your hand these things so sent should be enjoyed else we are but like petted children who break and throw from them the toys they have wept themselves sick for  to enjoy pleasure ramorny said the prince a man should have suffered pain as it requires fasting to gain a good appetite we who can have all for a wish little enjoy that all when we have possessed it seest thou yonder thick cloud which is about to burst to rain it seems to stifle methe waters look dark and luridthe shores have lost their beautiful form  my lord forgive your servant said ramorny you indulge a powerful imagination as an unskilful horseman permits a fiery steed to rear until he falls back on his master and crushes him i pray you shake off this lethargy shall the glee maiden make some music  let her but it must be melancholy all mirth would at this moment jar on my ear  the maiden sung a melancholy dirge in norman french the words of which the following is an imitation were united to a tune as doleful as they are themselves       yes thou mayst sigh      and look once more at all around      at stream and bank and sky and ground      thy life its final course has found      and thou must die       yes lay thee down      and while thy struggling pulses flutter      bid the grey monk his soul mass mutter      and the deep bell its death tone utter      thy life is gone       be not afraid      tis but a pang and then a thrill      a fever fit and then a chill      and then an end of human ill      for thou art dead  the prince made no observation on the music and the maiden at ramornys beck went on from time to time with her minstrel craft until the evening sunk down into rain first soft and gentle at length in great quantities and accompanied by a cold wind there was neither cloak nor covering for the prince and he sullenly rejected that which ramorny offered  it is not for rothsay to wear your cast garments sir john this melted snow which i feel pierce me to the very marrow i am now encountering by your fault why did you presume to put off the boat without my servants and apparel  ramorny did not attempt an exculpation for he knew the prince was in one of those humours when to enlarge upon a grievance was more pleasing to him than to have his mouth stopped by any reasonable apology in sullen silence or amid unsuppressed chiding the boat arrived at the fishing village of newburgh the party landed and found horses in readiness which indeed ramorny had long since provided for the occasion their quality underwent the princes bitter sarcasm expressed to ramorny sometimes by direct words oftener by bitter gibes at length they were mounted and rode on through the closing night and the falling rain the prince leading the way with reckless haste the glee maiden mounted by his express order attended them and well for her that accustomed to severe weather and exercise both on foot and horseback she supported as firmly as the men the fatigues of the nocturnal ride ramorny was compelled to keep at the princes rein being under no small anxiety lest in his wayward fit he might ride off from him entirely and taking refuge in the house of some loyal baron escape the snare which was spread for him he therefore suffered inexpressibly during the ride both in mind and in body  at length the forest of falkland received them and a glimpse of the moon showed the dark and huge tower an appendage of royalty itself though granted for a season to the duke of albany on a signal given the drawbridge fell torches glared in the courtyard menials attended and the prince assisted from horseback was ushered into an apartment where ramorny waited on him together with dwining and entreated him to take the leechs advice the duke of rothsay repulsed the proposal haughtily ordered his bed to be prepared and having stood for some time shivering in his dank garments beside a large blazing fire he retired to his apartment without taking leave of anyone  you see the peevish humour of this childish boy now said ramorny to dwining can you wonder that a servant who has done so much for him as i have should be tired of such a master  no truly said dwining that and the promised earldom of lindores would shake any mans fidelity but shall we commence with him this evening he has if eye and cheek speak true the foundation of a fever within him which will make our work easy while it will seem the effect of nature  it is an opportunity lost said ramorny but we must delay our blow till he has seen this beauty catharine glover she may be hereafter a witness that she saw him in good health and master of his own motions a brief space beforeyou understand me  dwining nodded assent and added  there is no time lost for there is little difficulty in blighting a flower exhausted from having been made to bloom too soon    chapter xxxi       ah me in sooth he was a shameless wight      sore given to revel and ungodly glee      few earthly things found favour in his sight      save concubines and carnal companie      and flaunting wassailers of high and low degree       byron   with the next morning the humour of the duke of rothsay was changed he complained indeed of pain and fever but they rather seemed to stimulate than to overwhelm him he was familiar with ramorny and though he said nothing on the subject of the preceding night it was plain he remembered what he desired to obliterate from the memory of his followersthe ill humour he had then displayed he was civil to every one and jested with ramorny on the subject of catharines arrival  how surprised will the pretty prude be at seeing herself in a family of men when she expects to be admitted amongst the hoods and pinners of dame marjorys waiting women thou hast not many of the tender sex in thy household i take it ramorny  faith none except the minstrel wench but a household drudge or two whom we may not dispense with by the way she is anxiously inquiring after the mistress your highness promised to prefer her to shall i dismiss her to hunt for her new mistress at leisure  by no means she will serve to amuse catharine and hark you were it not well to receive that coy jillet with something of a mumming  how mean you my lord  thou art dull man we will not disappoint her since she expects to find the duchess of rothsay i will be duke and duchess in my own person  still i do not comprehend  no one so dull as a wit said the prince when he does not hit off the scent at once my duchess as they call her has been in as great a hurry to run away from falkland as i to come hither we have both left our apparel behind there is as much female trumpery in the wardrobe adjoining to my sleeping room as would equip a whole carnival look you i will play dame marjory disposed on this day bed here with a mourning veil and a wreath of willow to show my forsaken plight thou john wilt look starch and stiff enough for her galwegian maid of honour the countess hermigild and dwining shall present the old hecate her nurseonly she hath more beard on her upper lip than dwining on his whole face and skull to boot he should have the commodity of a beard to set her forth conformably get thy kitchen drudges and what passable pages thou hast with thee to make my women of the bedroom hearest thou about it instantly  ramorny hasted into the anteroom and told dwining the princes device  do thou look to humour the fool he said i care not how little i see him knowing what is to be done  trust all to me said the physician shrugging his shoulders what sort of a butcher is he that can cut the lambs throat yet is afraid to hear it bleat  tush fear not my constancy i cannot forget that he would have cast me into the cloister with as little regard as if he threw away the truncheon of a broken lance begoneyet stay ere you go to arrange this silly pageant something must be settled to impose on the thick witted charteris he is like enough should he be left in the belief that the duchess of rothsay is still here and catharine glover in attendance on her to come down with offers of service and the like when as i need scarce tell thee his presence would be inconvenient indeed this is the more likely that some folks have given a warmer name to the iron headed knights great and tender patronage of this damsel  with that hint let me alone to deal with him i will send him such a letter that for this month he shall hold himself as ready for a journey to hell as to falkland can you tell me the name of the duchesss confessor  waltheof a grey friar  enoughthen here i start  in a few minutes for he was a clerk of rare celerity dwining finished a letter which he placed in ramornys hand  this is admirable and would have made thy fortune with rothsay i think i should have been too jealous to trust thee in his household save that his day is closed  read it aloud said dwining that we may judge if it goes trippingly off  and ramorny read as follows by command of our high and mighty princess marjory duchess of rothsay and so forth we waltheof unworthy brother of the order of st francis do thee sir patrick charteris knight of kinfauns to know that her highness marvels much at the temerity with which you have sent to her presence a woman of whose fame she can judge but lightly seeing she hath made her abode without any necessity for more than a week in thine own castle without company of any other female saving menials of which foul cohabitation the savour is gone up through fife angus and perthshire nevertheless her highness considering the ease as one of human frailty hath not caused this wanton one to be scourged with nettles or otherwise to dree penance but as two good brethren of the convent of lindores the fathers thickskull and dundermore have been summoned up to the highlands upon an especial call her highness hath committed to their care this maiden catharine with charge to convey her to her father whom she states to be residing beside loch tay under whose protection she will find a situation more fitting her qualities and habits than the castle of falkland while her highness the duchess of rothsay abides there she hath charged the said reverend brothers so to deal with the young woman as may give her a sense of the sin of incontinence and she commendeth thee to confession and penitencesigned waltheof by command of an high and mighty princess and so forth  when he had finished excellentexcellent ramorny exclaimed this unexpected rebuff will drive charteris mad he hath been long making a sort of homage to this lady and to find himself suspected of incontinence when he was expecting the full credit of a charitable action will altogether confound him and as thou sayst it will be long enough ere he come hither to look after the damsel or do honour to the dame but away to thy pageant while i prepare that which shall close the pageant for ever  it was an hour before noon when catharine escorted by old henshaw and a groom of the knight of kinfauns arrived before the lordly tower of falkland the broad banner which was displayed from it bore the arms of rothsay the servants who appeared wore the colours of the princes household all confirming the general belief that the duchess still resided there catharines heart throbbed for she had heard that the duchess had the pride as well as the high courage of the house of douglas and felt uncertain touching the reception she was to experience on entering the castle she observed that the train was smaller than she had expected but as the duchess lived in close retirement she was little surprised at this in a species of anteroom she was met by a little old woman who seemed bent double with age and supported herself upon an ebony staff  truly thou art welcome fair daughter said she saluting catharine and as i may say to an afflicted house and i trust once more saluting her thou wilt be a consolation to my precious and right royal daughter the duchess sit thee down my child till i see whether my lady be at leisure to receive thee ah my child thou art very lovely indeed if our lady hath given to thee a soul to match with so fair a body  with that the counterfeit old woman crept into the next apartment where she found rothsay in the masquerading habit he had prepared and ramorny who had evaded taking part in the pageant in his ordinary attire  thou art a precious rascal sir doctor said the prince by my honour i think thou couldst find in thy heart to play out the whole play thyself lovers part and all  if it were to save your highness trouble said the leech with his usual subdued laugh  nono said rothsay i never need thy help man and tell me now how look i thus disposed on the couchlanguishing and ladylike ha  something too fine complexioned and soft featured for the lady marjory of douglas if i may presume to say so said the leech  away villain and marshal in this fair frost piecefear not she will complain of my effeminacy and thou ramorny away also  as the knight left the apartment by one door the fictitious old woman ushered in catharine glover by another the room had been carefully darkened to twilight so that catharine saw the apparently female figure stretched on the couch without the least suspicion  is that the maiden asked rothsay in a voice naturally sweet and now carefully modulated to a whispering tone let her approach griselda and kiss our hand  the supposed nurse led the trembling maiden forward to the side of the couch and signed to her to kneel catharine did so and kissed with much devotion and simplicity the gloved hand which the counterfeit duchess extended to her  be not afraid said the same musical voice in me you only see a melancholy example of the vanity of human greatness happy those my child whose rank places them beneath the storms of state  while he spoke he put his arms around her neck and drew her towards him as if to salute her in token of welcome but the kiss was bestowed with an earnestness which so much overacted the part of the fair patroness that catharine concluding the duchess had lost her senses screamed aloud  peace fool it is idavid of rothsay  catharine looked around her the nurse was gone and the duke tearing off his veil she saw herself in the power of a daring young libertine  now be present with me heaven she said and thou wilt if i forsake not myself  as this resolution darted through her mind she repressed her disposition to scream and as far as she might strove to conceal her fear  the jest hath been played she said with as much firmness as she could assume may i entreat that your highness will now unhand me for he still kept hold of her arm  nay my pretty captive struggle notwhy should you fear  i do not struggle my lord as you are pleased to detain me i will not by striving provoke you to use me ill and give pain to yourself when you have time to think  why thou traitress thou hast held me captive for months said the prince and wilt thou not let me hold thee for a moment  this were gallantry my lord were it in the streets of perth where i might listen or escape as i listed it is tyranny here  and if i did let thee go whither wouldst thou fly said rothsay the bridges are up the portcullis down and the men who follow me are strangely deaf to a peevish maidens squalls be kind therefore and you shall know what it is to oblige a prince  unloose me then my lord and hear me appeal from thyself to thyself from rothsay to the prince of scotland i am the daughter of an humble but honest citizen i am i may well nigh say the spouse of a brave and honest man if i have given your highness any encouragement for what you have done it has been unintentional thus forewarned i entreat you to forego your power over me and suffer me to depart your highness can obtain nothing from me save by means equally unworthy of knighthood or manhood  you are bold catharine said the prince but neither as a knight nor a man can i avoid accepting a defiance i must teach you the risk of such challenges  while he spoke he attempted to throw his arms again around her but she eluded his grasp and proceeded in the same tone of firm decision  my strength my lord is as great to defend myself in an honourable strife as yours can be to assail me with a most dishonourable purpose do not shame yourself and me by putting it to the combat you may stun me with blows or you may call aid to overpower me but otherwise you will fail of your purpose  what a brute you would make me said the prince the force i would use is no more than excuses women in yielding to their own weakness  he sat down in some emotion  then keep it said catharine for those women who desire such an excuse my resistance is that of the most determined mind which love of honour and fear of shame ever inspired alas my lord could you succeed you would but break every bond between me and life between yourself and honour i have been trained fraudulently here by what decoys i know not but were i to go dishonoured hence it would be to denounce the destroyer of my happiness to every quarter of europe i would take the palmers staff in my hand and wherever chivalry is honoured or the word scotland has been heard i would proclaim the heir of a hundred kings the son of the godly robert stuart the heir of the heroic bruce a truthless faithless man unworthy of the crown he expects and of the spurs he wears every lady in wide europe would hold your name too foul for her lips every worthy knight would hold you a baffled forsworn caitiff false to the first vow of arms the protection of woman and the defence of the feeble  rothsay resumed his seat and looked at her with a countenance in which resentment was mingled with admiration you forget to whom you speak maiden know the distinction i have offered you is one for which hundreds whose trains you are born to bear would feel gratitude  once more my lord resumed catharine keep these favours for those by whom they are prized or rather reserve your time and your health for other and nobler pursuitsfor the defence of your country and the happiness of your subjects alas my lord how willingly would an exulting people receive you for their chief how gladly would they close around you did you show desire to head them against the oppression of the mighty the violence of the lawless the seduction of the vicious and the tyranny of the hypocrite  the duke of rothsay whose virtuous feelings were as easily excited as they were evanescent was affected by the enthusiasm with which she spoke forgive me if i have alarmed you maiden he said thou art too noble minded to be the toy of passing pleasure for which my mistake destined thee and i even were thy birth worthy of thy noble spirit and transcendent beauty have no heart to give thee for by the homage of the heart only should such as thou be wooed but my hopes have been blighted catharine the only woman i ever loved has been torn from me in the very wantonness of policy and a wife imposed on me whom i must ever detest even had she the loveliness and softness which alone can render a woman amiable in my eyes my health is fading even in early youth and all that is left for me is to snatch such flowers as the short passage from life to the grave will now present look at my hectic cheek feel if you will my intermitting pulse and pity me and excuse me if i whose rights as a prince and as a man have been trampled upon and usurped feel occasional indifference towards the rights of others and indulge a selfish desire to gratify the wish of the passing moment  oh my lord exclaimed catharine with the enthusiasm which belonged to her characteri will call you my dear lord for dear must the heir of bruce be to every child of scotlandlet me not i pray hear you speak thus your glorious ancestor endured exile persecution the night of famine and the day of unequal combat to free his country do you practise the like self denial to free yourself tear yourself from those who find their own way to greatness smoothed by feeding your follies distrust yon dark ramorny you know it not i am sureyou could not know but the wretch who could urge the daughter to courses of shame by threatening the life of the aged father is capable of all that is vile all that is treacherous  did ramorny do this said the prince  he did indeed my lord and he dares not deny it  it shall be looked to answered the duke of rothsay i have ceased to love him but he has suffered much for my sake and i must see his services honourably requited  his services oh my lord if chronicles speak true such services brought troy to ruins and gave the infidels possession of spain  hush maidenspeak within compass i pray you said the prince rising up our conference ends here  yet one word my lord duke of rothsay said catharine with animation while her beautiful countenance resembled that of an admonitory angel i cannot tell what impels me to speak thus boldly but the fire burns within me and will break out leave this castle without an hours delay the air is unwholesome for you dismiss this ramorny before the day is ten minutes older his company is most dangerous  what reason have you for saying this  none in especial answered catharine abashed at her own eagernessnone perhaps excepting my fears for your safety  to vague fears the heir of bruce must not listen what ho who waits without  ramorny entered and bowed low to the duke and to the maiden whom perhaps he considered as likely to be preferred to the post of favourite sultana and therefore entitled to a courteous obeisance  ramorny said the prince is there in the household any female of reputation who is fit to wait on this young woman till we can send her where she may desire to go  i fear replied ramorny if it displease not your highness to hear the truth your household is indifferently provided in that way and that to speak the very verity the glee maiden is the most decorous amongst us  let her wait upon this young person then since better may not be and take patience maiden for a few hours  catharine retired  so my lord part you so soon from the fair maid of perth this is indeed the very wantonness of victory  there is neither victory nor defeat in the case returned the prince drily the girl loves me not nor do i love her well enough to torment myself concerning her scruples  the chaste malcolm the maiden revived in one of his descendants said ramorny  favour me sir by a truce to your wit or by choosing a different subject for its career it is noon i believe and you will oblige me by commanding them to serve up dinner  ramorny left the room but rothsay thought he discovered a smile upon his countenance and to be the subject of this mans satire gave him no ordinary degree of pain he summoned however the knight to his table and even admitted dwining to the same honour the conversation was of a lively and dissolute cast a tone encouraged by the prince as if designing to counterbalance the gravity of his morals in the morning which ramorny who was read in old chronicles had the boldness to liken to the continence of scipio  the banquet nothwithstanding the dukes indifferent health was protracted in idle wantonness far beyond the rules of temperance and whether owing simply to the strength of the wine which he drank or the weakness of his constitution or as it is probable because the last wine which he quaffed had been adulterated by dwining it so happened that the prince towards the end of the repast fell into a lethargic sleep from which it seemed impossible to rouse him sir john ramorny and dwining carried him to his chamber accepting no other assistance than that of another person whom we will afterwards give name to  next morning it was announced that the prince was taken ill of an infectious disorder and to prevent its spreading through the household no one was admitted to wait on him save his late master of horse the physician dwining and the domestic already mentioned one of whom seemed always to remain in the apartment while the others observed a degree of precaution respecting their intercourse with the rest of the family so strict as to maintain the belief that he was dangerously ill of an infectious disorder    chapter xxxii       in winters tedious nights sit by the fire      with good old folks and let them tell thee tales      of woeful ages long ago betid      and ere thou bid goodnight to quit their grief      tell thou the lamentable fall of me       king richard ii act v scene i   far different had been the fate of the misguided heir of scotland from that which was publicly given out in the town of falkland his ambitious uncle had determined on his death as the means of removing the first and most formidable barrier betwixt his own family and the throne james the younger son of the king was a mere boy who might at more leisure be easily set aside ramornys views of aggrandisement and the resentment which he had latterly entertained against his masters made him a willing agent in young rothsays destruction dwinings love of gold and his native malignity of disposition rendered him equally forward it had been resolved with the most calculating cruelty that all means which might leave behind marks of violence were to be carefully avoided and the extinction of life suffered to take place of itself by privation of every kind acting upon a frail and impaired constitution the prince of scotland was not to be murdered as ramorny had expressed himself on another occasion he was only to cease to exist rothsays bedchamber in the tower of falkland was well adapted for the execution of such a horrible project a small narrow staircase scarce known to exist opened from thence by a trapdoor to the subterranean dungeons of the castle through a passage by which the feudal lord was wont to visit in private and in disguise the inhabitants of those miserable regions by this staircase the villains conveyed the insensible prince to the lowest dungeon of the castle so deep in the bowels of the earth that no cries or groans it was supposed could possibly be heard while the strength of its door and fastenings must for a long time have defied force even if the entrance could have been discovered bonthron who had been saved from the gallows for the purpose was the willing agent of ramornys unparalleled cruelty to his misled and betrayed patron  this wretch revisited the dungeon at the time when the princes lethargy began to wear off and when awaking to sensation he felt himself deadly cold unable to move and oppressed with fetters which scarce permitted him to stir from the dank straw on which he was laid his first idea was that he was in a fearful dream his next brought a confused augury of the truth he called shouted yelled at length in frenzy but no assistance came and he was only answered by the vaulted roof of the dungeon the agent of hell heard these agonizing screams and deliberately reckoned them against the taunts and reproaches with which rothsay had expressed his instinctive aversion to him when exhausted and hopeless the unhappy youth remained silent the savage resolved to present himself before the eyes of his prisoner the locks were drawn the chain fell the prince raised himself as high as his fetters permitted a red glare against which he was fain to shut his eyes streamed through the vault and when he opened them again it was on the ghastly form of one whom he had reason to think dead he sunk back in horror  i am judged and condemned he exclaimed and the most abhorred fiend in the infernal regions is sent to torment me  i live my lord said bonthron and that you may live and enjoy life be pleased to sit up and eat your victuals  free me from these irons said the prince release me from this dungeon and dog as thou art thou shalt be the richest man in scotland  if you would give me the weight of your shackles in gold said bonthron i would rather see the iron on you than have the treasure myself but look up you were wont to love delicate farebehold how i have catered for you  the wretch with fiendish glee unfolded a piece of rawhide covering the bundle which he bore under his arm and passing the light to and fro before it showed the unhappy prince a bulls head recently hewn from the trunk and known in scotland as the certain signal of death he placed it at the foot of the bed or rather lair on which the prince lay  be moderate in your food he said it is like to be long ere thou getst another meal  tell me but one thing wretch said the prince does ramorny know of this practice  how else hadst thou been decoyed hither poor woodcock thou art snared answered the murderer  with these words the door shut the bolts resounded and the unhappy prince was left to darkness solitude and misery oh my fathermy prophetic father the staff i leaned on has indeed proved a spear  we will not dwell on the subsequent hours nay days of bodily agony and mental despair  but it was not the pleasure of heaven that so great a crime should be perpetrated with impunity  catharine glover and the glee woman neglected by the other inmates who seemed to be engaged with the tidings of the princes illness were however refused permission to leave the castle until it should be seen how this alarming disease was to terminate and whether it was actually an infectious sickness forced on each others society the two desolate women became companions if not friends and the union drew somewhat closer when catharine discovered that this was the same female minstrel on whose account henry wynd had fallen under her displeasure she now heard his complete vindication and listened with ardour to the praises which louise heaped on her gallant protector on the other hand the minstrel who felt the superiority of catharines station and character willingly dwelt upon a theme which seemed to please her and recorded her gratitude to the stout smith in the little song of bold and true which was long a favourite in scotland       oh bold and true      in bonnet blue      that fear or falsehood never knew      whose heart was loyal to his word      whose hand was faithful to his sword      seek europe wide from sea to sea      but bonny blue cap still for me       ive seen almains proud champions prance      have seen the gallant knights of france      unrivalld with the sword and lance      have seen the sons of england true      wield the brown bill and bend the yew      search france the fair and england free      but bonny blue cap still for me  in short though louises disreputable occupation would have been in other circumstances an objection to catharines voluntarily frequenting her company yet forced together as they now were she found her a humble and accommodating companion  they lived in this manner for four or five days and in order to avoid as much as possible the gaze and perhaps the incivility of the menials in the offices they prepared their food in their own apartment in the absolutely necessary intercourse with domestics louise more accustomed to expedients bolder by habit and desirous to please catharine willingly took on herself the trouble of getting from the pantler the materials of their slender meal and of arranging it with the dexterity of her country  the glee woman had been abroad for this purpose upon the sixth day a little before noon and the desire of fresh air or the hope to find some sallad or pot herbs or at least an early flower or two with which to deck their board had carried her into the small garden appertaining to the castle she reentered her apartment in the tower with a countenance pale as ashes and a frame which trembled like an aspen leaf her terror instantly extended itself to catharine who could hardly find words to ask what new misfortune had occurred  is the duke of rothsay dead  worse they are starving him alive  madness woman  nononono said louise speaking under her breath and huddling her words so thick upon each other that catharine could hardly catch the sense i was seeking for flowers to dress your pottage because you said you loved them yesterday my poor little dog thrusting himself into a thicket of yew and holly bushes that grow out of some old ruins close to the castle wall came back whining and howling i crept forward to see what might be the causeand oh i heard a groaning as of one in extreme pain but so faint that it seemed to arise out of the very depth of the earth at length i found it proceeded from a small rent in the wall covered with ivy and when i laid my ear close to the opening i could hear the princes voice distinctly say it cannot now last longand then it sunk away in something like a prayer  gracious heaven did you speak to him  i said is it you my lord and the answer was who mocks me with that title i asked him if i could help him and he answered with a voice i shall never forget foodfood i die of famine so i came hither to tell you what is to be done shall we alarm the house  alas that were more likely to destroy than to aid said catharine  and what then shall we do said louise  i know not yet said catharine prompt and bold on occasions of moment though yielding to her companion in ingenuity of resource on ordinary occasions i know not yet but something we will do the blood of bruce shall not die unaided  so saying she seized the small cruise which contained their soup and the meat of which it was made wrapped some thin cakes which she had baked into the fold of her plaid and beckoning her companion to follow with a vessel of milk also part of their provisions she hastened towards the garden  so our fair vestal is stirring abroad said the only man she met who was one of the menials but catharine passed on without notice or reply and gained the little garden without farther interruption  louise indicated to her a heap of ruins which covered with underwood was close to the castle wall it had probably been originally a projection from the building and the small fissure which communicated with the dungeon contrived for air had terminated within it but the aperture had been a little enlarged by decay and admitted a dim ray of light to its recesses although it could not be observed by those who visited the place with torchlight aids  here is dead silence said catharine after she had listened attentively for a moment heaven and earth he is gone  we must risk something said her companion and ran her fingers over the strings of her guitar  a sigh was the only answer from the depth of the dungeon catharine then ventured to speak i am here my lordi am here with food and drink  ha ramorny the jest comes too late i am dying was the answer  his brain is turned and no wonder thought catharine but whilst there is life there may be hope  it is i my lord catharine glover i have food if i could pass it safely to you  heaven bless thee maiden i thought the pain was over but it glows again within me at the name of food  the food is here but howah how can i pass it to you the chink is so narrow the wall is so thick yet there is a remedyi have it quick louise cut me a willow bough the tallest you can find  the glee maiden obeyed and by means of a cleft in the top of the wand catharine transmitted several morsels of the soft cakes soaked in broth which served at once for food and for drink  the unfortunate young man ate little and with difficulty but prayed for a thousand blessings on the head of his comforter i had destined thee to be the slave of my vices he said and yet thou triest to become the preserver of my life but away and save thyself  i will return with food as i shall see opportunity said catharine just as the glee maiden plucked her sleeve and desired her to be silent and stand close  both crouched among the ruins and they heard the voices of ramorny and the mediciner in close conversation  he is stronger than i thought said the former in a low croaking tone how long held out dalwolsy when the knight of liddesdale prisoned him in his castle of hermitage  for a fortnight answered dwining but he was a strong man and had some assistance by grain which fell from a granary above his prison house  were it not better end the matter more speedily the black douglas comes this way he is not in albanys secret he will demand to see the prince and all must be over ere he comes  they passed on in their dark and fatal conversation  now gain we the tower said catharine to her companion when she saw they had left the garden i had a plan of escape for myself i will turn it into one of rescue for the prince the dey woman enters the castle about vesper time and usually leaves her cloak in the passage as she goes into the pantlers office with the milk take thou the cloak muffle thyself close and pass the warder boldly he is usually drunken at that hour and thou wilt go as the dey woman unchallenged through gate and along bridge if thou bear thyself with confidence then away to meet the black douglas he is our nearest and only aid  but said louise is he not that terrible lord who threatened me with shame and punishment  believe it said catharine such as thou or i never dwelt an hour in the douglass memory either for good or evil tell him that his son in law the prince of scotland diestreacherously famishedin falkland castle and thou wilt merit not pardon only but reward  i care not for reward said louise the deed will reward itself but methinks to stay is more dangerous than to go let me stay then and nourish the unhappy prince and do you depart to bring help if they kill me before you return i leave you my poor lute and pray you to be kind to my poor charlot  no louise replied catharine you are a more privileged and experienced wanderer than ido you go and if you find me dead on your return as may well chance give my poor father this ring and a lock of my hair and say catharine died in endeavouring to save the blood of bruce and give this other lock to henry say catharine thought of him to the last and that if he has judged her too scrupulous touching the blood of others he will then know it was not because she valued her own  they sobbed in each others arms and the intervening hours till evening were spent in endeavouring to devise some better mode of supplying the captive with nourishment and in the construction of a tube composed of hollow reeds slipping into each other by which liquids might be conveyed to him the bell of the village church of falkland tolled to vespers the dey or farm woman entered with her pitchers to deliver the milk for the family and to hear and tell the news stirring she had scarcely entered the kitchen when the female minstrel again throwing herself in catharines arms and assuring her of her unalterable fidelity crept in silence downstairs the little dog under her arm a moment after she was seen by the breathless catharine wrapt in the dey womans cloak and walking composedly across the drawbridge  so said the warder you return early tonight may bridget small mirth towards in the hallha wench sick times are sad times  i have forgotten my tallies said the ready witted french woman and will return in the skimming of a bowie  she went onward avoiding the village of falkland and took a footpath which led through the park catharine breathed freely and blessed god when she saw her lost in the distance it was another anxious hour for catharine which occurred before the escape of the fugitive was discovered this happened so soon as the dey girl having taken an hour to perform a task which ten minutes might have accomplished was about to return and discovered that some one had taken away her grey frieze cloak a strict search was set on foot at length the women of the house remembered the glee maiden and ventured to suggest her as one not unlikely to exchange an old cloak for a new one the warder strictly questioned averred he saw the dey woman depart immediately after vespers and on this being contradicted by the party herself he could suggest as the only alternative that it must needs have been the devil  as however the glee woman could not be found the real circumstances of the case were easily guessed at and the steward went to inform sir john ramorny and dwining who were now scarcely ever separate of the escape of one of their female captives everything awakens the suspicions of the guilty they looked on each other with faces of dismay and then went together to the humble apartment of catharine that they might take her as much as possible by surprise while they inquired into the facts attending louises disappearance  where is your companion young woman said ramorny in a tone of austere gravity  i have no companion here answered catharine  trifle not replied the knight i mean the glee maiden who lately dwelt in this chamber with you  she is gone they tell me said catharinegone about an hour since  and whither said dwining  how answered catharine should i know which way a professed wanderer may choose to travel she was tired no doubt of a solitary life so different from the scenes of feasting and dancing which her trade leads her to frequent she is gone and the only wonder is that she should have stayed so long  this then said ramorny is all you have to tell us  all that i have to tell you sir john answered catharine firmly and if the prince himself inquire i can tell him no more  there is little danger of his again doing you the honour to speak to you in person said ramorny even if scotland should escape being rendered miserable by the sad event of his decease  is the duke of rothsay so very ill asked catharine  no help save in heaven answered ramorny looking upward  then may there yet be help there said catharine if human aid prove unavailing  amen said ramorny with the most determined gravity while dwining adopted a face fit to echo the feeling though it seemed to cost him a painful struggle to suppress his sneering yet soft laugh of triumph which was peculiarly excited by anything having a religious tendency  and it is menearthly men and not incarnate devils who thus appeal to heaven while they are devouring by inches the life blood of their hapless master muttered catharine as her two baffled inquisitors left the apartment why sleeps the thunder but it will roll ere long and oh may it be to preserve as well as to punish  the hour of dinner alone afforded a space when all in the castle being occupied with that meal catharine thought she had the best opportunity of venturing to the breach in the wall with the least chance of being observed in waiting for the hour she observed some stir in the castle which had been silent as the grave ever since the seclusion of the duke of rothsay the portcullis was lowered and raised and the creaking of the machinery was intermingled with the tramp of horse as men at arms went out and returned with steeds hard ridden and covered with foam she observed too that such domestics as she casually saw from her window were in arms all this made her heart throb high for it augured the approach of rescue and besides the bustle left the little garden more lonely than ever at length the hour of noon arrived she had taken care to provide under pretence of her own wishes which the pantler seemed disposed to indulge such articles of food as could be the most easily conveyed to the unhappy captive she whispered to intimate her presence there was no answer she spoke louder still there was silence  he sleeps she muttered these words half aloud and with a shuddering which was succeeded by a start and a scream when a voice replied behind her  yes he sleeps but it is for ever  she looked round sir john ramorny stood behind her in complete armour but the visor of his helmet was up and displayed a countenance more resembling one about to die than to fight he spoke with a grave tone something between that of a calm observer of an interesting event and of one who is an agent and partaker in it  catharine he said all is true which i tell you he is dead you have done your best for him you can do no more  i will noti cannot believe it said catharine heaven be merciful to me it would make one doubt of providence to think so great a crime has been accomplished  doubt not of providence catharine though it has suffered the profligate to fall by his own devices follow me i have that to say which concerns you i say follow for she hesitated unless you prefer being left to the mercies of the brute bonthron and the mediciner henbane dwining  i will follow you said catharine you cannot do more to me than you are permitted  he led the way into the tower and mounted staircase after staircase and ladder after ladder  catharines resolution failed her i will follow no farther she said whither would you lead me if to my death i can die here  only to the battlements of the castle fool said ramorny throwing wide a barred door which opened upon the vaulted roof of the castle where men were bending mangonels as they called them military engines that is for throwing arrows or stones getting ready crossbows and piling stones together but the defenders did not exceed twenty in number and catharine thought she could observe doubt and irresolution amongst them  catharine said ramorny i must not quit this station which is necessary for my defence but i can speak with you here as well as elsewhere  say on answered catharine i am prepared to hear you  you have thrust yourself catharine into a bloody secret have you the firmness to keep it  i do not understand you sir john answered the maiden  look you i have slainmurdered if you willmy late master the duke of rothsay the spark of life which your kindness would have fed was easily smothered his last words called on his father you are faintbear upyou have more to hear you know the crime but you know not the provocation see this gauntlet is empty i lost my right hand in his cause and when i was no longer fit to serve him i was cast off like a worn out hound my loss ridiculed and a cloister recommended instead of the halls and palaces in which i had my natural sphere think on thispity and assist me  in what manner can you require my assistance said the trembling maiden i can neither repair your loss nor cancel your crime  thou canst be silent catharine on what thou hast seen and heard in yonder thicket it is but a brief oblivion i ask of you whose word will i know be listened to whether you say such things were or were not that of your mountebank companion the foreigner none will hold to be of a pin points value if you grant me this i will take your promise for my security and throw the gate open to those who now approach it if you will not promise silence i defend this castle till every one perishes and i fling you headlong from these battlements ay look at themit is not a leap to be rashly braved seven courses of stairs brought you up hither with fatigue and shortened breath but you shall go from the top to the bottom in briefer time than you can breathe a sigh speak the word fair maid for you speak to one unwilling to harm you but determined in his purpose  catharine stood terrified and without power of answering a man who seemed so desperate but she was saved the necessity of reply by the approach of dwining he spoke with the same humble conges which at all times distinguished his manner and with his usual suppressed ironical sneer which gave that manner the lie  i do you wrong noble sir to intrude on your valiancie when engaged with a fair damsel but i come to ask a trifling question  speak tormentor said ramorny ill news are sport to thee even when they affect thyself so that they concern others also  hemhe hei only desired to know if your knighthood proposed the chivalrous task of defending the castle with your single handi crave pardon i meant your single arm the question is worth asking for i am good for little to aid the defence unless you could prevail on the besiegers to take physiche he heand bonthron is as drunk as ale and strong waters can make him and you he and i make up the whole garrison who are disposed for resistance  how will the other dogs not fight said ramorny  never saw men who showed less stomach to the work answered dwiningnever but here come a brace of them venit extrema dies he he he  eviot and his companion buncle now approached with sullen resolution in their faces like men who had made their minds up to resist that authority which they had so long obeyed  how now said ramorny stepping forward to meet them wherefore from your posts why have you left the barbican eviot and you other fellow did i not charge you to look to the mangonels  we have something to tell you sir john ramorny answered eviot we will not fight in this quarrel  howmy own squires control me exclaimed ramorny  we were your squires and pages my lord while you were master of the duke of rothsays household it is bruited about the duke no longer lives we desire to know the truth  what traitor dares spread such falsehoods said ramorny  all who have gone out to skirt the forest my lord and i myself among others bring back the same news the minstrel woman who left the castle yesterday has spread the report everywhere that the duke of rothsay is murdered or at deaths door the douglas comes on us with a strong force  and you cowards take advantage of an idle report to forsake your master said ramorny indignantly  my lord said eviot let buncle and myself see the duke of rothsay and receive his personal orders for defence of this castle and if we do not fight to the death in that quarrel i will consent to be hanged on its highest turret but if he be gone by natural disease we will yield up the castle to the earl of douglas who is they say the kings lieutenant or ifwhich heaven forefendthe noble prince has had foul play we will not involve ourselves in the guilt of using arms in defence of the murderers be they who they will  eviot said ramorny raising his mutilated arm had not that glove been empty thou hadst not lived to utter two words of this insolence  it is as it is answered evict and we do but our duty i have followed you long my lord but here i draw bridle  farewell then and a curse light on all of you exclaimed the incensed baron let my horse be brought forth  our valiancie is about to run away said the mediciner who had crept close to catharines side before she was aware catharine thou art a superstitious fool like most women nevertheless thou hast some mind and i speak to thee as one of more understanding than the buffaloes which are herding about us these haughty barons who overstride the world what are they in the day of adversity chaff before the wind let their sledge hammer hands or their column resembling legs have injury and bah the men at arms are gone heart and courage is nothing to them lith and limb everything give them animal strength what are they better than furious bulls take that away and your hero of chivalry lies grovelling like the brute when he is hamstrung not so the sage while a grain of sense remains in a crushed or mutilated frame his mind shall be strong as ever catharine this morning i was practising your death but methinks i now rejoice that you may survive to tell how the poor mediciner the pill gilder the mortar pounder the poison vender met his fate in company with the gallant knight of ramorny baron in possession and earl of lindores in expectationgod save his lordship  old man said catharine if thou be indeed so near the day of thy deserved doom other thoughts were far wholesomer than the vainglorious ravings of a vain philosophy ask to see a holy man  yes said dwining scornfully refer myself to a greasy monk who does nothe he heunderstand the barbarous latin he repeats by rote such would be a fitting counsellor to one who has studied both in spain and arabia no catharine i will choose a confessor that is pleasant to look upon and you shall be honoured with the office now look yonder at his valiancie his eyebrow drops with moisture his lip trembles with agony for his valianciehe he heis pleading for his life with his late domestics and has not eloquence enough to persuade them to let him slip see how the fibres of his face work as he implores the ungrateful brutes whom he has heaped with obligations to permit him to get such a start for his life as the hare has from the greyhounds when men course her fairly look also at the sullen downcast dogged faces with which fluctuating between fear and shame the domestic traitors deny their lord this poor chance for his life these things thought themselves the superior of a man like me and you foolish wench think so meanly of your deity as to suppose wretches like them are the work of omnipotence  no man of evilno said catharine warmly the god i worship created these men with the attributes to know and adore him to guard and defend their fellow creatures to practise holiness and virtue their own vices and the temptations of the evil one have made them such as they now are oh take the lesson home to thine own heart of adamant heaven made thee wiser than thy fellows gave thee eyes to look into the secrets of nature a sagacious heart and a skilful hand but thy pride has poisoned all these fair gifts and made an ungodly atheist of one who might have been a christian sage  atheist sayst thou answered dwining perhaps i have doubts on that matterbut they will be soon solved yonder comes one who will send me as he has done thousands to the place where all mysteries shall be cleared  catharine followed the mediciners eye up one of the forest glades and beheld it occupied by a body of horsemen advancing at full gallop in the midst was a pennon displayed which though its bearings were not visible to catharine was by a murmur around acknowledged as that of the black douglas they halted within arrow shot of the castle and a herald with two trumpets advanced up to the main portal where after a loud flourish he demanded admittance for the high and dreaded archibald earl of douglas lord lieutenant of the king and acting for the time with the plenary authority of his majesty commanding at the same time that the inmates of the castle should lay down their arms all under penalty of high treason  you hear said eviot to ramorny who stood sullen and undecided will you give orders to render the castle or must i  no villain interrupted the knight to the last i will command you open the gates drop the bridge and render the castle to the douglas  now thats what may be called a gallant exertion of free will said dwining just as if the pieces of brass that were screaming a minute since should pretend to call those notes their own which are breathed through them by a frowsy trumpeter  wretched man said catharine either be silent or turn thy thoughts to the eternity on the brink of which thou art standing  and what is that to thee answered dwining thou canst not wench help hearing what i say to thee and thou wilt tell it again for thy sex cannot help that either perth and all scotland shall know what a man they have lost in henbane dwining  the clash of armour now announced that the newcomers had dismounted and entered the castle and were in the act of disarming the small garrison earl douglas himself appeared on the battlements with a few of his followers and signed to them to take ramorny and dwining into custody others dragged from some nook the stupefied bonthron  it was to these three that the custody of the prince was solely committed daring his alleged illness said the douglas prosecuting an inquiry which he had commenced in the hall of the castle  no other saw him my lord said eviot though i offered my services  conduct us to the dukes apartment and bring the prisoners with us also should there be a female in the castle if she hath not been murdered or spirited awaythe companion of the glee maiden who brought the first alarm  she is here my lord said eviot bringing catharine forward  her beauty and her agitation made some impression even upon the impassible earl  fear nothing maiden he said thou hast deserved both praise and reward tell to me as thou wouldst confess to heaven the things thou hast witnessed in this castle  few words served catharine to unfold the dreadful story  it agrees said the douglas with the tale of the glee maiden from point to point now show us the princes apartment  they passed to the room which the unhappy duke of rothsay had been supposed to inhabit but the key was not to be found and the earl could only obtain entrance by forcing the door on entering the wasted and squalid remains of the unhappy prince were discovered flung on the bed as if in haste the intention of the murderers had apparently been to arrange the dead body so as to resemble a timely parted corpse but they had been disconcerted by the alarm occasioned by the escape of louise douglas looked on the body of the misguided youth whose wild passions and caprices had brought him to this fatal and premature catastrophe  i had wrongs to be redressed he said but to see such a sight as this banishes all remembrance of injury  he he it should have been arranged said dwining more to your omnipotences pleasure but you came suddenly on us and hasty masters make slovenly service  douglas seemed not to hear what his prisoner said so closely did he examine the wan and wasted features and stiffened limbs of the dead body before him catharine overcome by sickness and fainting at length obtained permission to retire from the dreadful scene and through confusion of every description found her way to her former apartment where she was locked in the arms of louise who had returned in the interval  the investigations of douglas proceeded the dying hand of the prince was found to be clenched upon a lock of hair resembling in colour and texture the coal black bristles of bonthron thus though famine had begun the work it would seem that rothsays death had been finally accomplished by violence the private stair to the dungeon the keys of which were found at the subaltern assassins belt the situation of the vault its communication with the external air by the fissure in the walls and the wretched lair of straw with the fetters which remained there fully confirmed the story of catharine and of the glee woman  we will not hesitate an instant said the douglas to his near kinsman the lord balveny as soon as they returned from the dungeon away with the murderers hang them over the battlements  but my lord some trial may be fitting answered balveny  to what purpose answered douglas i have taken them red hand my authority will stretch to instant execution yet stayhave we not some jedwood men in our troop  plenty of turnbulls rutherfords ainslies and so forth said balveny  call me an inquest of these together they are all good men and true saving a little shifting for their living do you see to the execution of these felons while i hold a court in the great hall and well try whether the jury or the provost marshal do their work first we will have jedwood justicehang in haste and try at leisure  yet stay my lord said ramorny you may rue your hastewill you grant me a word out of earshot  not for worlds said douglas speak out what thou hast to say before all that are here present  know all then said ramorny aloud that this noble earl had letters from the duke of albany and myself sent him by the hand of yon cowardly deserter bunclelet him deny it if he darecounselling the removal of the duke for a space from court and his seclusion in this castle of falkland  but not a word replied douglas sternly smiling of his being flung into a dungeonfamishedstrangled away with the wretches balveny they pollute gods air too long  the prisoners were dragged off to the battlements but while the means of execution were in the act of being prepared the apothecary expressed so ardent a desire to see catharine once more and as he said for the good of his soul that the maiden in hopes his obduracy might have undergone some change even at the last hour consented again to go to the battlements and face a scene which her heart recoiled from a single glance showed her bonthron sunk in total and drunken insensibility ramorny stripped of his armour endeavouring in vain to conceal fear while he spoke with a priest whose good offices he had solicited and dwining the same humble obsequious looking crouching individual she had always known him he held in his hand a little silver pen with which he had been writing on a scrap of parchment  catharine he saidhe he hei wish to speak to thee on the nature of my religious faith  if such be thy intention why lose time with me speak with this good father  the good father said dwining ishe healready a worshipper of the deity whom i have served i therefore prefer to give the altar of mine idol a new worshipper in thee catharine this scrap of parchment will tell thee how to make your way into my chapel where i have worshipped so often in safety i leave the images which it contains to thee as a legacy simply because i hate and contemn thee something less than any of the absurd wretches whom i have hitherto been obliged to call fellow creatures and now awayor remain and see if the end of the quacksalver belies his life  our lady forbid said catharine  nay said the mediciner i have but a single word to say and yonder noblemans valiancie may hear it if he will  lord balveny approached with some curiosity for the undaunted resolution of a man who never wielded sword or bore armour and was in person a poor dwindled dwarf had to him an air of something resembling sorcery  you see this trifling implement said the criminal showing the silver pen by means of this i can escape the power even of the black douglas  give him no ink nor paper said balveny hastily he will draw a spell  not so please your wisdom and valianciehe he he said dwining with his usual chuckle as he unscrewed the top of the pen within which was a piece of sponge or some such substance no bigger than a pea  now mark this said the prisoner and drew it between his lips the effect was instantaneous he lay a dead corpse before them the contemptuous sneer still on his countenance  catharine shrieked and fled seeking by a hasty descent an escape from a sight so appalling lord balveny was for a moment stupified and then exclaimed this may be glamour hang him over the battlements quick or dead if his foul spirit hath only withdrawn for a space it shall return to a body with a dislocated neck  his commands were obeyed ramorny and bonthron were then ordered for execution the last was hanged before he seemed quite to comprehend what was designed to be done with him ramorny pale as death yet with the same spirit of pride which had occasioned his ruin pleaded his knighthood and demanded the privilege of dying by decapitation by the sword and not by the noose  the douglas never alters his doom said balveny but thou shalt have all thy rights send the cook hither with a cleaver  the menial whom he called appeared at his summons  what shakest thou for fellow said balveny here strike me this mans gilt spurs from his heels with thy cleaver and now john ramorny thou art no longer a knight but a knave to the halter with him provost marshal hang him betwixt his companions and higher than them if it may be  in a quarter of an hour afterwards balveny descended to tell the douglas that the criminals were executed  then there is no further use in the trial said the earl how say you good men of inquest were these men guilty of high treasonay or no  guilty exclaimed the obsequious inquest with edifying unanimity we need no farther evidence  sound trumpets and to horse then with our own train only and let each man keep silence on what has chanced here until the proceedings shall be laid before the king which cannot conveniently be till the battle of palm sunday shall be fought and ended select our attendants and tell each man who either goes with us or remains behind that he who prates dies  in a few minutes the douglas was on horseback with the followers selected to attend his person expresses were sent to his daughter the widowed duchess of rothsay directing her to take her course to perth by the shores of lochleven without approaching falkland and committing to her charge catharine glover and the glee woman as persons whose safety he tendered  as they rode through the forest they looked back and beheld the three bodies hanging like specks darkening the walls of the old castle  the hand is punished said douglas but who shall arraign the head by whose direction the act was done  you mean the duke of albany said balveny  i do kinsman and were i to listen to the dictates of my heart i would charge him with the deed which i am certain he has authorised but there is no proof of it beyond strong suspicion and albany has attached to himself the numerous friends of the house of stuart to whom indeed the imbecility of the king and the ill regulated habits of rothsay left no other choice of a leader were i therefore to break the bond which i have so lately formed with albany the consequence must be civil war an event ruinous to poor scotland while threatened by invasion from the activity of the percy backed by the treachery of march no balveny the punishment of albany must rest with heaven which in its own good time will execute judgment on him and on his house    chapter xxxiii       the hour is nigh now hearts beat high      each sword is sharpend well      and who dares die who stoops to fly      tomorrows light shall tell       sir edwald   we are now to recall to our readers recollection that simon glover and his fair daughter had been hurried from their residence without having time to announce to henry smith either their departure or the alarming cause of it when therefore the lover appeared in curfew street on the morning of their flight instead of the hearty welcome of the honest burgher and the april reception half joy half censure which he had been promised on the part of his lovely daughter he received only the astounding intelligence that her father and she had set off early on the summons of a stranger who had kept himself carefully muffled from observation to this dorothy whose talents for forestalling evil and communicating her views of it are known to the reader chose to add that she had no doubt her master and young mistress were bound for the highlands to avoid a visit which had been made since their departure by two or three apparitors who in the name of a commission appointed by the king had searched the house put seals upon such places as were supposed to contain papers and left citations for father and daughter to appear before the court of commission on a day certain under pain of outlawry all these alarming particulars dorothy took care to state in the gloomiest colours and the only consolation which she afforded the alarmed lover was that her master had charged her to tell him to reside quietly at perth and that he should soon hear news of them this checked the smiths first resolve which was to follow them instantly to the highlands and partake the fate which they might encounter  but when he recollected his repeated feuds with divers of the clan quhele and particularly his personal quarrel with conachar who was now raised to be a high chief he could not but think on reflection that his intrusion on their place of retirement was more likely to disturb the safety which they might otherwise enjoy there than be of any service to them he was well acquainted with simons habitual intimacy with the chief of the clan quhele and justly augured that the glover would obtain protection which his own arrival might be likely to disturb while his personal prowess could little avail him in a quarrel with a whole tribe of vindictive mountaineers at the same time his heart throbbed with indignation when he thought of catharine being within the absolute power of young conachar whose rivalry he could not doubt and who had now so many means of urging his suit what if the young chief should make the safety of the father depend on the favour of the daughter he distrusted not catharines affections but then her mode of thinking was so disinterested and her attachment to her father so tender that if the love she bore her suitor was weighed against his security or perhaps his life it was matter of deep and awful doubt whether it might not be found light in the balance tormented by thoughts on which we need not dwell he resolved nevertheless to remain at home stifle his anxiety as he might and await the promised intelligence from the old man it came but it did not relieve his concern  sir patrick charteris had not forgotten his promise to communicate to the smith the plans of the fugitives but amid the bustle occasioned by the movement of troops he could not himself convey the intelligence he therefore entrusted to his agent kitt henshaw the task of making it known but this worthy person as the reader knows was in the interest of ramorny whose business it was to conceal from every one but especially from a lover so active and daring as henry the real place of catharines residence henshaw therefore announced to the anxious smith that his friend the glover was secure in the highlands and though he affected to be more reserved on the subject of catharine he said little to contradict the belief that she as well as simon shared the protection of the clan quhele but he reiterated in the name of sir patrick assurances that father and daughter were both well and that henry would best consult his own interest and their safety by remaining quiet and waiting the course of events  with an agonized heart therefore henry gow determined to remain quiet till he had more certain intelligence and employed himself in finishing a shirt of mail which he intended should be the best tempered and the most finely polished that his skilful hands had ever executed this exercise of his craft pleased him better than any other occupation which he could have adopted and served as an apology for secluding himself in his workshop and shunning society where the idle reports which were daily circulated served only to perplex and disturb him he resolved to trust in the warm regard of simon the faith of his daughter and the friendship of the provost who having so highly commended his valour in the combat with bonthron would never he thought desert him at this extremity of his fortunes time however passed on day by day and it was not till palm sunday was near approaching that sir patrick charteris having entered the city to make some arrangements for the ensuing combat bethought himself of making a visit to the smith of the wynd  he entered his workshop with an air of sympathy unusual to him and which made henry instantly augur that he brought bad news the smith caught the alarm and the uplifted hammer was arrested in its descent upon the heated iron while the agitated arm that wielded it strong before as that of a giant became so powerless that it was with difficulty henry was able to place the weapon on the ground instead of dropping it from his hand  my poor henry said sir patrick i bring you but cold news they are uncertain however and if true they are such as a brave man like you should not take too deeply to heart  in gods name my lord said henry i trust you bring no evil news of simon glover or his daughter  touching themselves said sir patrick no they are safe and well but as to thee henry my tidings are more cold kitt henshaw has i think apprised thee that i had endeavoured to provide catharine glover with a safe protection in the house of an honourable lady the duchess of rothsay but she hath declined the charge and catharine hath been sent to her father in the highlands what is worst is to come thou mayest have heard that gilchrist macian is dead and that his son eachin who was known in perth as the apprentice of old simon by the name of conachar is now the chief of clan quhele and i heard from one of my domestics that there is a strong rumour among the macians that the young chief seeks the hand of catharine in marriage my domestic learned thisas a secret howeverwhile in the breadalbane country on some arrangements touching the ensuing combat the thing is uncertain but henry it wears a face of likelihood  did your lordships servant see simon glover and his daughter said henry struggling for breath and coughing to conceal from the provost the excess of his agitation  he did not said sir patrick the highlanders seemed jealous and refused to permit him to speak to the old man and he feared to alarm them by asking to see catharine besides he talks no gaelic nor had his informer much english so there may be some mistake in the matter nevertheless there is such a report and i thought it best to tell it you but you may be well assured that the wedding cannot go on till the affair of palm sunday be over and i advise you to take no step till we learn the circumstances of the matter for certainty is most desirable even when it is painful go you to the council house he added after a pause to speak about the preparations for the lists in the north inch you will be welcome there  no my good lord  well smith i judge by your brief answer that you are discomposed with this matter but after all women are weathercocks that is the truth ont solomon and others have proved it before you  and so sir patrick charteris retired fully convinced he had discharged the office of a comforter in the most satisfactory manner  with very different impressions did the unfortunate lover regard the tidings and listen to the consoling commentary  the provost he said bitterly to himself is an excellent man marry he holds his knighthood so high that if he speaks nonsense a poor man must hold it sense as he must praise dead ale if it be handed to him in his lordships silver flagon how would all this sound in another situation suppose i were rolling down the steep descent of the corrichie dhu and before i came to the edge of the rock comes my lord provost and cries henry there is a deep precipice and i grieve to say you are in the fair way of rolling over it but be not downcast for heaven may send a stone or a bush to stop your progress however i thought it would be comfort to you to know the worst which you will be presently aware of i do not know how many hundred feet deep the precipice descends but you may form a judgment when you are at the bottom for certainty is certainty and hark ye when come you to take a game at bowls and this gossip is to serve instead of any friendly attempt to save the poor wights neck when i think of this i could go mad seize my hammer and break and destroy all around me but i will be calm and if this highland kite who calls himself a falcon should stoop at my turtle dove he shall know whether a burgess of perth can draw a bow or not  it was now the thursday before the fated palm sunday and the champions on either side were expected to arrive the next day that they might have the interval of saturday to rest refresh themselves and prepare for the combat two or three of each of the contending parties were detached to receive directions about the encampment of their little band and such other instructions as might be necessary to the proper ordering of the field henry was not therefore surprised at seeing a tall and powerful highlander peering anxiously about the wynd in which he lived in the manner in which the natives of a wild country examine the curiosities of one that is more civilized the smiths heart rose against the man on account of his country to which our perth burgher bore a natural prejudice and more especially as he observed the individual wear the plaid peculiar to the clan quhele the sprig of oak leaves worked in silk intimated also that the individual was one of those personal guards of young eachin upon whose exertions in the future battle so much reliance was placed by those of their clan  having observed so much henry withdrew into his smithy for the sight of the man raised his passion and knowing that the highlander came plighted to a solemn combat and could not be the subject of any inferior quarrel he was resolved at least to avoid friendly intercourse with him in a few minutes however the door of the smithy flew open and flattering in his tartans which greatly magnified his actual size the gael entered with the haughty step of a man conscious of a personal dignity superior to anything which he is likely to meet with he stood looking around him and seemed to expect to be received with courtesy and regarded with wonder but henry had no sort of inclination to indulge his vanity and kept hammering away at a breastplate which was lying upon his anvil as if he were not aware of his visitors presence  you are the gow chrom the bandy legged smith said the highlander  those that wish to be crook backed call me so answered henry  no offence meant said the highlander but her own self comes to buy an armour  her own selfs bare shanks may trot hence with her answered henry i have none to sell  if it was not within two days of palm sunday herself would make you sing another song retorted the gael  and being the day it is said henry with the same contemptuous indifference i pray you to stand out of my light  you are an uncivil person but her own self is fir nan ord too and she knows the smith is fiery when the iron is hot  if her nainsell be hammer man herself her nainsell may make her nain harness replied henry  and so her nainsell would and never fash you for the matter but it is said gow chrom that you sing and whistle tunes over the swords and harnishes that you work that have power to make the blades cut steel links as if they were paper and the plate and mail turn back steel lances as if they were boddle prins  they tell your ignorance any nonsense that christian men refuse to believe said henry i whistle at my work whatever comes uppermost like an honest craftsman and commonly it is the highlandmans och hone for houghman stares my hammer goes naturally to that tune  friend it is but idle to spur a horse when his legs are ham shackled said the highlander haughtily her own self cannot fight even now and there is little gallantry in taunting her thus  by nails and hammer you are right there said the smith altering his tone but speak out at once friend what is it thou wouldst have of me i am in no humour for dallying  a hauberk for her chief eachin macian said the highlander  you are a hammer man you say are you a judge of this said our smith producing from a chest the mail shirt on which he had been lately employed  the gael handled it with a degree of admiration which had something of envy in it he looked curiously at every part of its texture and at length declared it the very best piece of armour that he had ever seen  a hundred cows and bullocks and a good drift of sheep would be een ower cheap an offer said the highlandman by way of tentative but her nainsell will never bid thee less come by them how she can  it is a fair proffer replied henry but gold nor gear will never buy that harness i want to try my own sword on my own armour and i will not give that mail coat to any one but who will face me for the best of three blows and a thrust in the fair field and it is your chiefs upon these terms  hut prut mantake a drink and go to bed said the highlander in great scorn are ye mad think ye the captain of the clan quhele will be brawling and battling with a bit perth burgess body like you whisht man and hearken her nainsell will do ye mair credit than ever belonged to your kin she will fight you for the fair harness hersell  she must first show that she is my match said henry with a grim smile  how i one of eachin macians leichtach and not your match  you may try me if you will you say you are a fir nan ord do you know how to cast a sledge hammer  ay trulyask the eagle if he can fly over farragon  but before you strive with me you must first try a cast with one of my leichtach here dunter stand forth for the honour of perth and now highlandman there stands a row of hammers choose which you will and let us to the garden  the highlander whose name was norman nan ord or norman of the hammer showed his title to the epithet by selecting the largest hammer of the set at which henry smiled dunter the stout journeyman of the smith made what was called a prodigious cast but the highlander making a desperate effort threw beyond it by two or three feet and looked with an air of triumph to henry who again smiled in reply  will you mend that said the gael offering our smith the hammer  not with that childs toy said henry which has scarce weight to fly against the wind jannekin fetch me sampson or one of you help the boy for sampson is somewhat ponderous  the hammer now produced was half as heavy again as that which the highlander had selected as one of unusual weight norman stood astonished but he was still more so when henry taking his position swung the ponderous implement far behind his right haunch joint and dismissed it from his hand as if it had flown from a warlike engine the air groaned and whistled as the mass flew through it down at length it came and the iron head sunk a foot into the earth a full yard beyond the cast of norman  the highlander defeated and mortified went to the spot where the weapon lay lifted it poised it in his hand with great wonder and examined it closely as if he expected to discover more in it than a common hammer he at length returned it to the owner with a melancholy smile shrugging his shoulders and shaking his head as the smith asked him whether he would not mend his cast  norman has lost too much at the sport already he replied she has lost her own name of the hammerer but does her own self the gow chrom work at the anvil with that horses load of iron  you shall see brother said henry leading the way to the smithy dunter he said rax me that bar from the furnace and uplifting sampson as he called the monstrous hammer he plied the metal with a hundred strokes from right to leftnow with the right hand now with the left now with both with so much strength at once and dexterity that he worked off a small but beautifully proportioned horseshoe in half the time that an ordinary smith would have taken for the same purpose using a more manageable implement  oighoigh said the highlander and what for would you be fighting with our young chief who is far above your standard though you were the best smith ever wrought with wind and fire  hark you said henry you seem a good fellow and ill tell you the truth your master has wronged me and i give him this harness freely for the chance of fighting him myself  nay if he hath wronged you he must meet you said the life guardsman to do a man wrong takes the eagles feather out of the chiefs bonnet and were he the first in the highlands and to be sure so is eachin he must fight the man he has wronged or else a rose falls from his chaplet  will you move him to this said henry after the fight on sunday  oh her nainsell will do her best if the hawks have not got her nainsells bones to pick for you must know brother that clan chattans claws pierce rather deep  the armour is your chiefs on that condition said henry but i will disgrace him before king and court if he does not pay me the price  deil a feardeil a fear i will bring him in to the barrace myself said norman assuredly  you will do me a pleasure replied henry and that you may remember your promise i will bestow on you this dirk lookif you hold it truly and can strike between the mail hood and the collar of your enemy the surgeon will be needless  the highlander was lavish in his expressions of gratitude and took his leave  i have given him the best mail harness i ever wrought said the smith to himself rather repenting his liberality for the poor chance that he will bring his chief into a fair field with me and then let catharine be his who can win her fairly but much i dread the youth will find some evasion unless he have such luck on palm sunday as may induce him to try another combat that is some hope however for i have often ere now seen a raw young fellow shoot up after his first fight from a dwarf into a giant queller  thus with little hope but with the most determined resolution henry smith awaited the time that should decide his fate what made him augur the worst was the silence both of the glover and of his daughter  they are ashamed he said to confess the truth to me and therefore they are silent  upon the friday at noon the two bands of thirty men each representing the contending clans arrived at the several points where they were to halt for refreshments  the clan quhele was entertained hospitably at the rich abbey of scone while the provost regaled their rivals at his castle of kinfauns the utmost care being taken to treat both parties with the most punctilious attention and to afford neither an opportunity of complaining of partiality all points of etiquette were in the mean while discussed and settled by the lord high constable errol and the young earl of crawford the former acting on the part of the clan chattan and the latter patronising the clan quhele messengers were passing continually from the one earl to the other and they held more than six meetings within thirty hours before the ceremonial of the field could be exactly arranged  meanwhile in case of revival of ancient quarrel many seeds of which existed betwixt the burghers and their mountain neighbours a proclamation commanded the citizens not to approach within half a mile of the place where the highlanders were quartered while on their part the intended combatants were prohibited from approaching perth without special license troops were stationed to enforce this order who did their charge so scrupulously as to prevent simon glover himself burgess and citizen of perth from approaching the town because he owned having come thither at the same time with the champions of eachin macian and wore a plaid around him of their check or pattern this interruption prevented simon from seeking out henry wynd and possessing him with a true knowledge of all that had happened since their separation which intercourse had it taken place must have materially altered the catastrophe of our narrative  on saturday afternoon another arrival took place which interested the city almost as much as the preparations for the expected combat this was the approach of the earl douglas who rode through the town with a troop of only thirty horse but all of whom were knights and gentlemen of the first consequence mens eyes followed this dreaded peer as they pursue the flight of an eagle through the clouds unable to ken the course of the bird of jove yet silent attentive and as earnest in observing him as if they could guess the object for which he sweeps through the firmament he rode slowly through the city and passed out at the northern gate he next alighted at the dominican convent and desired to see the duke of albany the earl was introduced instantly and received by the duke with a manner which was meant to be graceful and conciliatory but which could not conceal both art and inquietude when the first greetings were over the earl said with great gravity i bring you melancholy news your graces royal nephew the duke of rothsay is no more and i fear hath perished by some foul practices  practices said the duke in confusionwhat practices who dared practise on the heir of the scottish throne  tis not for me to state how these doubts arise said douglas but men say the eagle was killed with an arrow fledged from his own wing and the oak trunk rent by a wedge of the same wood  earl of douglas said the duke of albany i am no reader of riddles  nor am i a propounder of them said douglas haughtily your grace will find particulars in these papers worthy of perusal i will go for half an hour to the cloister garden and then rejoin you  you go not to the king my lord said albany  no answered douglas i trust your grace will agree with me that we should conceal this great family misfortune from our sovereign till the business of tomorrow be decided  i willingly agree said albany if the king heard of this loss he could not witness the combat and if he appear not in person these men are likely to refuse to fight and the whole work is cast loose but i pray you sit down my lord while i read these melancholy papers respecting poor rothsay  he passed the papers through his hands turning some over with a hasty glance and dwelling on others as if their contents had been of the last importance when he had spent nearly a quarter of an hour in this manner he raised his eyes and said very gravely my lord in these most melancholy documents it is yet a comfort to see nothing which can renew the divisions in the kings councils which were settled by the last solemn agreement between your lordship and myself my unhappy nephew was by that agreement to be set aside until time should send him a graver judgment he is now removed by fate and our purpose in that matter is anticipated and rendered unnecessary  if your grace replied the earl sees nothing to disturb the good understanding which the tranquillity and safety of scotland require should exist between us i am not so ill a friend of my country as to look closely for such  i understand you my lord of douglas said albany eagerly you hastily judged that i should be offended with your lordship for exercising your powers of lieutenancy and punishing the detestable murderers within my territory of falkland credit me on the contrary i am obliged to your lordship for taking out of my hands the punishment of these wretches as it would have broken my heart even to have looked on them the scottish parliament will inquire doubtless into this sacrilegious deed and happy am i that the avenging sword has been in the hand of a man so important as your lordship our communication together as your lordship must well recollect bore only concerning a proposed restraint of my unfortunate nephew until the advance of a year or two had taught him discretion  such was certainly your graces purpose as expressed to me said the earl i can safely avouch it  why then noble earl we cannot be censured because villains for their own revengeful ends appear to have engrafted a bloody termination on our honest purpose  the parliament will judge it after their wisdom said douglas for my part my conscience acquits me  and mine assoilzies me said the duke with solemnity now my lord touching the custody of the boy james who succeeds to his fathers claims of inheritance  the king must decide it said douglas impatient of the conference i will consent to his residence anywhere save at stirling doune or falkland  with that he left the apartment abruptly  he is gone muttered the crafty albany and he must be my ally yet feels himself disposed to be my mortal foe no matter rothsay sleeps with his fathers james may follow in time and thena crown is the recompense of my perplexities    chapter xxxiv       thretty for thretty faucht in barreris      at sanct johnstoun on a day besyde the black freris       wyntoun   palm sunday now dawned at an earlier period of the christian church the use of any of the days of passion week for the purpose of combat would have been accounted a profanity worthy of excommunication the church of rome to her infinite honour had decided that during the holy season of easter when the redemption of man from his fallen state was accomplished the sword of war should be sheathed and angry monarchs should respect the season termed the truce of god the ferocious violence of the latter wars betwixt scotland and england had destroyed all observance of this decent and religious ordinance very often the most solemn occasions were chosen by one party for an attack because they hoped to find the other engaged in religious duties and unprovided for defence thus the truce once considered as proper to the season had been discontinued and it became not unusual even to select the sacred festivals of the church for decision of the trial by combat to which this intended contest bore a considerable resemblance  on the present occasion however the duties of the day were observed with the usual solemnity and the combatants themselves took share in them bearing branches of yew in their hands as the readiest substitute for palm boughs they marched respectively to the dominican and carthusian convents to hear high mass and by a show at least of devotion to prepare themselves for the bloody strife of the day great care had of course been taken that during this march they should not even come within the sound of each others bagpipes for it was certain that like game cocks exchanging mutual notes of defiance they would have sought out and attacked each other before they arrived at the place of combat  the citizens of perth crowded to see the unusual procession on the streets and thronged the churches where the two clans attended their devotions to witness their behaviour and to form a judgment from their appearance which was most likely to obtain the advantage in the approaching conflict their demeanour in the church although not habitual frequenters of places of devotion was perfectly decorous and notwithstanding their wild and untamed dispositions there were few of the mountaineers who seemed affected either with curiosity or wonder they appeared to think it beneath their dignity of character to testify either curiosity or surprise at many things which were probably then presented to them for the first time  on the issue of the combat few even of the most competent judges dared venture a prediction although the great size of torquil and his eight stalwart sons induced some who professed themselves judges of the thewes and sinews of men to incline to ascribe the advantage to the party of the clan quhele the opinion of the female sex was much decided by the handsome form noble countenance and gallant demeanour of eachin macian there were more than one who imagined they had recollection of his features but his splendid military attire rendered the humble glovers apprentice unrecognisable in the young highland chief saving by one person  that person as may well be supposed was the smith of the wynd who had been the foremost in the crowd that thronged to see the gallant champions of clan quhele it was with mingled feelings of dislike jealousy and something approaching to admiration that he saw the glovers apprentice stripped of his mean slough and blazing forth as a chieftain who by his quick eye and gallant demeanour the noble shape of his brow and throat his splendid arms and well proportioned limbs seemed well worthy to hold the foremost rank among men selected to live or die for the honour of their race the smith could hardly think that he looked upon the same passionate boy whom he had brushed off as he might a wasp that stung him and in mere compassion forebore to despatch by treading on him  he looks it gallantly with my noble hauberk thus muttered henry to himself the best i ever wrought yet if he and i stood together where there was neither hand to help nor eye to see by all that is blessed in this holy church the good harness should return to its owner all that i am worth would i give for three fair blows on his shoulders to undo my own best work but such happiness will never be mine if he escape from the conflict it will be with so high a character for courage that he may well disdain to put his fortune in its freshness to the risk of an encounter with a poor burgess like myself he will fight by his champion and turn me over to my fellow craftsman the hammerer when all i can reap will be the pleasure of knocking a highland bullock on the head if i could but see simon glover i will to the other church in quest of him since for sure he must have come down from the highlands  the congregation was moving from the church of the dominicans when the smith formed this determination which he endeavoured to carry into speedy execution by thrusting through the crowd as hastily as the solemnity of the place and occasion would permit in making his way through the press he was at one instant carried so close to eachin that their eyes encountered the smiths hardy and embrowned countenance coloured up like the heated iron on which he wrought and retained its dark red hue for several minutes eachins features glowed with a brighter blush of indignation and a glance of fiery hatred was shot from his eyes but the sudden flush died away in ashy paleness and his gaze instantly avoided the unfriendly but steady look with which it was encountered  torquil whose eye never quitted his foster son saw his emotion and looked anxiously around to discover the cause but henry was already at a distance and hastening on his way to the carthusian convent here also the religious service of the day was ended and those who had so lately borne palms in honour of the great event which brought peace on earth and goodwill to the children of men were now streaming to the place of combatsome prepared to take the lives of their fellow creatures or to lose their own others to view the deadly strife with the savage delight which the heathens took in the contests of their gladiators  the crowd was so great that any other person might well have despaired of making way through it but the general deference entertained for henry of the wynd as the champion of perth and the universal sense of his ability to force a passage induced all to unite in yielding room for him so that he was presently quite close to the warriors of the clan chattan their pipers marched at the head of their column next followed the well known banner displaying a mountain cat rampant with the appropriate caution touch not the cat but ie without the glove the chief followed with his two handed sword advanced as if to protect the emblem of the tribe he was a man of middle stature more than fifty years old but betraying neither in features nor form any decay of strength or symptoms of age his dark red close curled locks were in part chequered by a few grizzled hairs but his step and gesture were as light in the dance in the chase or in the battle as if he had not passed his thirtieth year his grey eye gleamed with a wild light expressive of valour and ferocity mingled but wisdom and experience dwelt on the expression of his forehead eyebrows and lips the chosen champions followed by two and two there was a cast of anxiety on several of their faces for they had that morning discovered the absence of one of their appointed number and in a contest so desperate as was expected the loss seemed a matter of importance to all save to their high mettled chief macgillie chattanach  say nothing to the saxons of his absence said this bold leader when the diminution of his force was reported to him the false lowland tongues might say that one of clan chattan was a coward and perhaps that the rest favoured his escape in order to have a pretence to avoid the battle i am sure that ferquhard day will be found in the ranks ere we are ready for battle or if he should not am not i man enough for two of the clan quhele or would we not fight them fifteen to thirty rather than lose the renown that this day will bring us  the tribe received the brave speech of their leader with applause yet there were anxious looks thrown out in hopes of espying the return of the deserter and perhaps the chief himself was the only one of the determined band who was totally indifferent on the subject  they marched on through the streets without seeing anything of ferquhard day who many a mile beyond the mountains was busied in receiving such indemnification as successful love could bestow for the loss of honour macgillie chattanach marched on without seeming to observe the absence of the deserter and entered upon the north inch a beautiful and level plain closely adjacent to the city and appropriated to the martial exercises of the inhabitants  the plain is washed on one side by the deep and swelling tay there was erected within it a strong palisade inclosing on three sides a space of one hundred and fifty yards in length and seventyfour yards in width the fourth side of the lists was considered as sufficiently fenced by the river an amphitheatre for the accommodation of spectators surrounded the palisade leaving a large space free to be occupied by armed men on foot and horseback and for the more ordinary class of spectators at the extremity of the lists which was nearest to the city there was a range of elevated galleries for the king and his courtiers so highly decorated with rustic treillage intermingled with gilded ornaments that the spot retains to this day the name of the golden or gilded arbour  the mountain minstrelsy which sounded the appropriate pibrochs or battle tunes of the rival confederacies was silent when they entered on the inch for such was the order which had been given two stately but aged warriors each bearing the banner of his tribe advanced to the opposite extremities of the lists and pitching their standards into the earth prepared to be spectators of a fight in which they were not to join the pipers who were also to be neutral in the strife took their places by their respective brattachs  the multitude received both bands with the same general shout with which on similar occasions they welcome those from whose exertion they expect amusement or what they term sport the destined combatants returned no answer to this greeting but each party advanced to the opposite extremities of the lists where were entrances by which they were to be admitted to the interior a strong body of men at arms guarded either access and the earl marshal at the one and the lord high constable at the other carefully examined each individual to see whether he had the appropriate arms being steel cap mail shirt two handed sword and dagger they also examined the numbers of each party and great was the alarm among the multitude when the earl of errol held up his hand and cried ho the combat cannot proceed for the clan chattan lack one of their number  what reek of that said the young earl of crawford they should have counted better ere they left home  the earl marshal however agreed with the constable that the fight could not proceed until the inequality should be removed and a general apprehension was excited in the assembled multitude that after all the preparation there would be no battle  of all present there were only two perhaps who rejoiced at the prospect of the combat being adjourned and these were the captain of the clan quhele and the tender hearted king robert meanwhile the two chiefs each attended by a special friend and adviser met in the midst of the lists having to assist them in determining what was to be done the earl marshal the lord high constable the earl of crawford and sir patrick charteris the chief of the clan chattan declared himself willing and desirous of fighting upon the spot without regard to the disparity of numbers  that said torquil of the oak clan quhele will never consent to you can never win honour from us with the sword and you seek but a subterfuge that you may say when you are defeated as you know you will be that it was for want of the number of your band fully counted out but i make a proposal ferquhard day was the youngest of your band eachin macian is the youngest of ours we will set him aside in place of the man who has fled from the combat  a most unjust and unequal proposal exclaimed toshach beg the second as he might be termed of macgillie chattanach the life of the chief is to the clan the breath of our nostrils nor will we ever consent that our chief shall be exposed to dangers which the captain of clan quhele does not share  torquil saw with deep anxiety that his plan was about to fail when the objection was made to hectors being withdrawn from the battle and he was meditating how to support his proposal when eachin himself interfered his timidity it must be observed was not of that sordid and selfish nature which induces those who are infected by it calmly to submit to dishonour rather than risk danger on the contrary he was morally brave though constitutionally timid and the shame of avoiding the combat became at the moment more powerful than the fear of facing it  i will not hear he said of a scheme which will leave my sword sheathed during this days glorious combat if i am young in arms there are enough of brave men around me whom i may imitate if i cannot equal  he spoke these words in a spirit which imposed on torquil and perhaps on the young chief himself  now god bless his noble heart said the foster father to himself i was sure the foul spell would be broken through and that the tardy spirit which besieged him would fly at the sound of the pipe and the first flutter of the brattach  hear me lord marshal said the constable the hour of combat may not be much longer postponed for the day approaches to high noon let the chief of clan chattan take the half hour which remains to find if he can a substitute for this deserter if he cannot let them fight as they stand  content i am said the marshal though as none of his own clan are nearer than fifty miles i see not how macgillis chattanach is to find an auxiliary  that is his business said the high constable but if he offers a high reward there are enough of stout yeomen surrounding the lists who will be glad enough to stretch their limbs in such a game as is expected i myself did my quality and charge permit would blythely take a turn of work amongst these wild fellows and think it fame won  they communicated their decision to the highlanders and the chief of the clan chattan replied you have judged unpartially and nobly my lords and i deem myself obliged to follow your direction so make proclamation heralds that if any one will take his share with clan chattan of the honours and chances of this day he shall have present payment of a gold crown and liberty to fight to the death in my ranks  you are something chary of your treasure chief said the earl marshal a gold crown is poor payment for such a campaign as is before you  if there be any man willing to fight for honour replied macgillis chattanach the price will be enough and i want not the service of a fellow who draws his sword for gold alone  the heralds had made their progress moving half way round the lists stopping from time to time to make proclamation as they had been directed without the least apparent disposition on the part of any one to accept of the proffered enlistment some sneered at the poverty of the highlanders who set so mean a price upon such a desperate service others affected resentment that they should esteem the blood of citizens so lightly none showed the slightest intention to undertake the task proposed until the sound of the proclamation reached henry of the wynd as he stood without the barrier speaking from time to time with baillie craigdallie or rather listening vaguely to what the magistrate was saying to him  ha what proclaim they he cried out  a liberal offer on the part of macgillie chattanach said the host of the griffin who proposes a gold crown to any one who will turn wildcat for the day and be killed a little in his service thats all  how exclaimed the smith eagerly do they make proclamation for a man to fight against the clan quhele  ay marry do they said griffin but i think they will find no such fools in perth  he had hardly said the word when he beheld the smith clear the barriers at a single bound and alight in the lists saying here am i sir herald henry of the wynd willing to battle on the part of the clan chattan  a cry of admiration ran through the multitude while the grave burghers not being able to conceive the slightest reason for henrys behaviour concluded that his head must be absolutely turned with the love of fighting the provost was especially shocked  thou art mad he said henry thou hast neither two handed sword nor shirt of mail  truly no said henry for i parted with a mail shirt which i had made for myself to yonder gay chief of the clan quhele who will soon find on his shoulders with what sort of blows i clink my rivets as for two handed sword why this boys brand will serve my turn till i can master a heavier one  this must not be said errol hark thee armourer by st mary thou shalt have my milan hauberk and good spanish sword  i thank your noble earlship sir gilbert hay but the yoke with which your brave ancestor turned the battle at loncarty would serve my turn well enough i am little used to sword or harness that i have not wrought myself because i do not well know what blows the one will bear out without being cracked or the other lay on without snapping  the cry had in the mean while run through the multitude and passed into the town that the dauntless smith was about to fight without armour when just as the fated hour was approaching the shrill voice of a female was heard screaming for passage through the crowd the multitude gave place to her importunity and she advanced breathless with haste under the burden of a mail hauberk and a large two handed sword the widow of oliver proudfute was soon recognised and the arms which she bore were those of the smith himself which occupied by her husband on the fatal evening when he was murdered had been naturally conveyed to his house with the dead body and were now by the exertions of his grateful widow brought to the lists at a moment when such proved weapons were of the last consequence to their owner henry joyfully received the well known arms and the widow with trembling haste assisted in putting them on and then took leave of him saying god for the champion of the widow and orphan and ill luck to all who come before him  confident at feeling himself in his well proved armour henry shook himself as if to settle the steel shirt around him and unsheathing the two handed sword made it flourish over his head cutting the air through which it whistled in the form of the figure eight with an ease and sleight of hand that proved how powerfully and skilfully he could wield the ponderous weapon the champions were now ordered to march in their turns around the lists crossing so as to avoid meeting each other and making obeisance as they passed the golden arbour where the king was seated  while this course was performing most of the spectators were again curiously comparing the stature limbs and sinews of the two parties and endeavouring to form a conjecture an to the probable issue of the combat the feud of a hundred years with all its acts of aggression and retaliation was concentrated in the bosom of each combatant their countenances seemed fiercely writhen into the wildest expression of pride hate and a desperate purpose of fighting to the very last  the spectators murmured a joyful applause in high wrought expectation of the bloody game wagers were offered and accepted both on the general issue of the conflict and on the feats of particular champions the clear frank and elated look of henry smith rendered him a general favourite among the spectators and odds to use the modern expression were taken that he would kill three of his opponents before he himself fell  scarcely was the smith equipped for the combat when the commands of the chiefs ordered the champions into their places and at the same moment henry heard the voice of simon glover issuing from the crowd who were now silent with expectation and calling on him harry smithharry smith what madness hath possessed thee  ay he wishes to save his hopeful son in law that is or is to be from the smiths handling was henrys first thought his second was to turn and speak with him and his third that he could on no pretext desert the band which he had joined or even seem desirous to delay the fight consistently with honour  he turned himself therefore to the business of the hour both parties were disposed by the respective chiefs in three lines each containing ten men they were arranged with such intervals between each individual as offered him scope to wield his sword the blade of which was five feet long not including the handle the second and third lines were to come up as reserves in case the first experienced disaster on the right of the array of clan quhele the chief eachin macian placed himself in the second line betwixt two of his foster brothers four of them occupied the right of the first line whilst the father and two others protected the rear of the beloved chieftain torquil in particular kept close behind for the purpose of covering him thus eachin stood in the centre of nine of the strongest men of his band having four especial defenders in front one on each hand and three in his rear  the line of the clan chattan was arranged in precisely the same order only that the chief occupied the centre of the middle rank instead of being on the extreme right this induced henry smith who saw in the opposing bands only one enemy and that was the unhappy eachin to propose placing himself on the left of the front rank of the clan chattan but the leader disapproved of this arrangement and having reminded henry that he owed him obedience as having taken wages at his hand he commanded him to occupy the space in the third line immediately behind himselfa post of honour certainly which henry could not decline though he accepted of it with reluctance  when the clans were thus drawn up opposed to each other they intimated their feudal animosity and their eagerness to engage by a wild scream which uttered by the clan quhele was answered and echoed back by the clan chattan the whole at the same time shaking their swords and menacing each other as if they meant to conquer the imagination of their opponents ere they mingled in the actual strife  at this trying moment torquil who had never feared for himself was agitated with alarm on the part of his dault yet consoled by observing that he kept a determined posture and that the few words which he spoke to his clan were delivered boldly and well calculated to animate them to combat as expressing his resolution to partake their fate in death or victory but there was no time for further observation the trumpets of the king sounded a charge the bagpipes blew up their screaming and maddening notes and the combatants starting forward in regular order and increasing their pace till they came to a smart run met together in the centre of the ground as a furious land torrent encounters an advancing tide  for an instant or two the front lines hewing at each other with their long swords seemed engaged in a succession of single combats but the second and third ranks soon came up on either side actuated alike by the eagerness of hatred and the thirst of honour pressed through the intervals and rendered the scene a tumultuous chaos over which the huge swords rose and sunk some still glittering others streaming with blood appearing from the wild rapidity with which they were swayed rather to be put in motion by some complicated machinery than to be wielded by human hands some of the combatants too much crowded together to use those long weapons had already betaken themselves to their poniards and endeavoured to get within the sword sweep of those opposed to them in the mean time blood flowed fast and the groans of those who fell began to mingle with the cries of those who fought for according to the manner of the highlanders at all times they could hardly be said to shout but to yell those of the spectators whose eyes were best accustomed to such scenes of blood and confusion could nevertheless discover no advantage yet acquired by either party the conflict swayed indeed at different intervals forwards or backwards but it was only in momentary superiority which the party who acquired it almost instantly lost by a corresponding exertion on the other side the wild notes of the pipers were still heard above the tumult and stimulated to farther exertions the fury of the combatants  at once however and as if by mutual agreement the instruments sounded a retreat it was expressed in wailing notes which seemed to imply a dirge for the fallen the two parties disengaged themselves from each other to take breath for a few minutes the eyes of the spectators greedily surveyed the shattered array of the combatants as they drew off from the contest but found it still impossible to decide which had sustained the greater loss it seemed as if the clan chattan had lost rather fewer men than their antagonists but in compensation the bloody plaids and skirts of their party for several on both sides had thrown their mantles away showed more wounded men than the clan quhele about twenty of both sides lay on the field dead or dying and arms and legs lopped off heads cleft to the chin slashes deep through the shoulder into the breast showed at once the fury of the combat the ghastly character of the weapons used and the fatal strength of the arms which wielded them the chief of the clan chattan had behaved himself with the most determined courage and was slightly wounded eachin also had fought with spirit surrounded by his bodyguard his sword was bloody his bearing bold and warlike and he smiled when old torquil folding him in his arms loaded him with praises and with blessings  the two chiefs after allowing their followers to breathe for the space of about ten minutes again drew up in their files diminished by nearly one third of their original number they now chose their ground nearer to the river than that on which they had formerly encountered which was encumbered with the wounded and the slain some of the former were observed from time to time to raise themselves to gain a glimpse of the field and sink back most of them to die from the effusion of blood which poured from the terrific gashes inflicted by the claymore  harry smith was easily distinguished by his lowland habit as well as his remaining on the spot where they had first encountered where he stood leaning on a sword beside a corpse whose bonneted head carried to ten yards distance from the body by the force of the blow which had swept it off exhibited the oak leaf the appropriate ornament of the bodyguard of eachin macian since he slew this man henry had not struck a blow but had contented himself with warding off many that were dealt at himself and some which were aimed at the chief macgillie chattanach became alarmed when having given the signal that his men should again draw together he observed that his powerful recruit remained at a distance from the ranks and showed little disposition to join them  what ails thee man said the chief can so strong a body have a mean and cowardly spirit come and make in to the combat  you as good as called me hireling but now replied henry if i am such pointing to the headless corpse i have done enough for my days wage  he that serves me without counting his hours replied the chief i reward him without reckoning wages  then said the smith i fight as a volunteer and in the post which best likes me  all that is at your own discretion replied macgillis chattanach who saw the prudence of humouring an auxiliary of such promise  it is enough said henry and shouldering his heavy weapon he joined the rest of the combatants with alacrity and placed himself opposite to the chief of the clan quhele  it was then for the first time that eachin showed some uncertainty he had long looked up to henry as the best combatant which perth and its neighbourhood could bring into the lists his hatred to him as a rival was mingled with recollection of the ease with which he had once though unarmed foiled his own sudden and desperate attack and when he beheld him with his eyes fixed in his direction the dripping sword in his hand and obviously meditating an attack on him individually his courage fell and he gave symptoms of wavering which did not escape his foster father  it was lucky for eachin that torquil was incapable from the formation of his own temper and that of those with whom he had lived to conceive the idea of one of his own tribe much less of his chief and foster son being deficient in animal courage could he have imagined this his grief and rage might have driven him to the fierce extremity of taking eachins life to save him from staining his honour but his mind rejected the idea that his dault was a personal coward as something which was monstrous and unnatural that he was under the influence of enchantment was a solution which superstition had suggested and he now anxiously but in a whisper demanded of hector does the spell now darken thy spirit eachin  yes wretch that i am answered the unhappy youth and yonder stands the fell enchanter  what exclaimed torquil and you wear harness of his making norman miserable boy why brought you that accursed mail  if my arrow has flown astray i can but shoot my life after it answered norman nan ord stand firm you shall see me break the spell  yes stand firm said torquil he may be a fell enchanter but my own ear has heard and my own tongue has told that eachin shall leave the battle whole free and unwounded let us see the saxon wizard who can gainsay that he may be a strong man but the fair forest of the oak shall fall stock and bough ere he lay a finger on my dault ring around him my sons bas air son eachin  the sons of torquil shouted back the words which signify death for hector  encouraged by their devotion eachin renewed his spirit and called boldly to the minstrels of his clan seid suas that is strike up  the wild pibroch again sounded the onset but the two parties approached each other more slowly than at first as men who knew and respected each others valour henry wynd in his impatience to begin the contest advanced before the clan chattan and signed to eachin to come on norman however sprang forward to cover his foster brother and there was a general though momentary pause as if both parties were willing to obtain an omen of the fate of the day from the event of this duel the highlander advanced with his large sword uplifted as in act to strike but just as he came within swords length he dropt the long and cumbrous weapon leapt lightly over the smiths sword as he fetched a cut at him drew his dagger and being thus within henrys guard struck him with the weapon his own gift on the side of the throat directing the blow downwards into the chest and calling aloud at the same time you taught me the stab  but henry wynd wore his own good hauberk doubly defended with a lining of tempered steel had he been less surely armed his combats had been ended for ever even as it was he was slightly wounded  fool he replied striking norman a blow with the pommel of his long sword which made him stagger backwards you were taught the thrust but not the parry and fetching a blow at his antagonist which cleft his skull through the steel cap he strode over the lifeless body to engage the young chief who now stood open before him  but the sonorous voice of torquil thundered out far eil air son eachin another for hector and the two brethren who flanked their chief on each side thrust forward upon henry and striking both at once compelled him to keep the defensive  forward race of the tiger cat cried macgillie chattanach save the brave saxon let these kites feel your talons  already much wounded the chief dragged himself up to the smiths assistance and cut down one of the leichtach by whom he was assailed henrys own good sword rid him of the other  reist air son eachin again for hector shouted the faithful foster father  bas air son eachin death for hector answered two more of his devoted sons and opposed themselves to the fury of the smith and those who had come to his aid while eachin moving towards the left wing of the battle sought less formidable adversaries and again by some show of valour revived the sinking hopes of his followers the two children of the oak who had covered this movement shared the fate of their brethren for the cry of the clan chattan chief had drawn to that part of the field some of his bravest warriors the sons of torquil did not fall unavenged but left dreadful marks of their swords on the persons of the dead and living but the necessity of keeping their most distinguished soldiers around the person of their chief told to disadvantage on the general event of the combat and so few were now the number who remained fighting that it was easy to see that the clan chattan had fifteen of their number left though most of them wounded and that of the clan quhele only about ten remained of whom there were four of the chiefs bodyguard including torquil himself  they fought and struggled on however and as their strength decayed their fury seemed to increase henry wynd now wounded in many places was still bent on breaking through or exterminating the band of bold hearts who continued to fight around the object of his animosity but still the fathers shout of another for hector was cheerfully answered by the fatal countersign death for hector and though the clan quhele were now outnumbered the combat seemed still dubious it was bodily lassitude alone that again compelled them to another pause  the clan chattan were then observed to be twelve in number but two or three were scarce able to stand without leaning on their swords five were left of the clan quhele torquil and his youngest son were of the number both slightly wounded eachin alone had from the vigilance used to intercept all blows levelled against his person escaped without injury the rage of both parties had sunk through exhaustion into sullen desperation they walked staggering as if in their sleep through the carcasses of the slain and gazed on them as if again to animate their hatred towards their surviving enemies by viewing the friends they had lost  the multitude soon after beheld the survivors of the desperate conflict drawing together to renew the exterminating feud on the banks of the river as the spot least slippery with blood and less encumbered with the bodies of the slain  for gods sakefor the sake of the mercy which we daily pray for said the kind hearted old king to the duke of albany let this be ended wherefore should these wretched rags and remnants of humanity be suffered to complete their butchery surely they will now be ruled and accept of peace on moderate terms  compose yourself my liege said his brother these men are the pest of the lowlands both chiefs are still living if they go back unharmed the whole days work is cast away remember your promise to the council that you would not cry hold  you compel me to a great crime albany both as a king who should protect his subjects and as a christian man who respects the brother of his faith  you judge wrong my lord said the duke these are not loving subjects but disobedient rebels as my lord of crawford can bear witness and they are still less christian men for the prior of the dominicans will vouch for me that they are more than half heathen  the king sighed deeply you must work your pleasure and are too wise for me to contend with i can but turn away and shut my eyes from the sights and sounds of a carnage which makes me sicken but well i know that god will punish me even for witnessing this waste of human life  sound trumpets said albany their wounds will stiffen if they dally longer  while this was passing torquil was embracing and encouraging his young chief  resist the witchcraft but a few minutes longer be of good cheer you will come off without either scar or scratch wem or wound be of good cheer  how can i be of good cheer said eachin while my brave kinsmen have one by one died at my feetdied all for me who could never deserve the least of their kindness  and for what were they born save to die for their chief said torquil composedly why lament that the arrow returns not to the quiver providing it hit the mark cheer up yet here are tormot and i but little hurt while the wildcats drag themselves through the plain as if they were half throttled by the terriers yet one brave stand and the day shall be your own though it may well be that you alone remain alive minstrels sound the gathering  the pipers on both sides blew their charge and the combatants again mingled in battle not indeed with the same strength but with unabated inveteracy they were joined by those whose duty it was to have remained neuter but who now found themselves unable to do so the two old champions who bore the standards had gradually advanced from the extremity of the lists and now approached close to the immediate scene of action when they beheld the carnage more nearly they were mutually impelled by the desire to revenge their brethren or not to survive them they attacked each other furiously with the lances to which the standards were attached closed after exchanging several deadly thrusts then grappled in close strife still holding their banners until at length in the eagerness of their conflict they fell together into the tay and were found drowned after the combat closely locked in each others arms the fury of battle the frenzy of rage and despair infected next the minstrels the two pipers who during the conflict had done their utmost to keep up the spirits of their brethren now saw the dispute well nigh terminated for want of men to support it they threw down their instruments rushed desperately upon each other with their daggers and each being more intent on despatching his opponent than in defending himself the piper of clan quhele was almost instantly slain and he of clan chattan mortally wounded the last nevertheless again grasped his instrument and the pibroch of the clan yet poured its expiring notes over the clan chattan while the dying minstrel had breath to inspire it the instrument which he used or at least that part of it called the chanter is preserved in the family of a highland chief to this day and is much honoured under the name of the federan dhu or black chanter  meanwhile in the final charge young tormot devoted like his brethren by his father torquil to the protection of his chief had been mortally wounded by the unsparing sword of the smith the other two remaining of the clan quhele had also fallen and torquil with his foster son and the wounded tormot forced to retreat before eight or ten of the clan chattan made a stand on the bank of the river while their enemies were making such exertions as their wounds would permit to come up with them torquil had just reached the spot where he had resolved to make the stand when the young tormot dropped and expired his death drew from his father the first and only sigh which he had breathed throughout the eventful day  my son tormot he said my youngest and dearest but if i save hector i save all now my darling dault i have done for thee all that man may excepting the last let me undo the clasps of that ill omened armour and do thou put on that of tormot it is light and will fit thee well while you do so i will rush on these crippled men and make what play with them i can i trust i shall have but little to do for they are following each other like disabled steers at least darling of my soul if i am unable to save thee i can show thee how a man should die  while torquil thus spoke he unloosed the clasps of the young chiefs hauberk in the simple belief that he could thus break the meshes which fear and necromancy had twined about his heart  my fathermy fathermy more than parent said the unhappy eachin stay with me with you by my side i feel i can fight to the last  it is impossible said torquil i will stop them coming up while you put on the hauberk god eternally bless thee beloved of my soul  and then brandishing his sword torquil of the oak rushed forward with the same fatal war cry which had so often sounded over that bloody field bas air son eachin the words rung three times in a voice of thunder and each time that he cried his war shout he struck down one of the clan chattan as he met them successively straggling towards him  brave battle hawkwell flown falcon exclaimed the multitude as they witnessed exertions which seemed even at this last hour to threaten a change of the fortunes of the day suddenly these cries were hushed into silence and succeeded by a clashing of swords so dreadful as if the whole conflict had recommenced in the person of henry wynd and torquil of the oak they cut foined hewed and thrust as if they had drawn their blades for the first time that day and their inveteracy was mutual for torquil recognised the foul wizard who as he supposed had cast a spell over his child and henry saw before him the giant who during the whole conflict had interrupted the purpose for which alone he had joined the combatantsthat of engaging in single combat with hector they fought with an equality which perhaps would not have existed had not henry more wounded than his antagonist been somewhat deprived of his usual agility  meanwhile eachin finding himself alone after a disorderly and vain attempt to put on his foster brothers harness became animated by an emotion of shame and despair and hurried forward to support his foster father in the terrible struggle ere some other of the clan chattan should come up when he was within five yards and sternly determined to take his share in the death fight his foster father fell cleft from the collarbone well nigh to the heart and murmuring with his last breath bas air son eachin the unfortunate youth saw the fall of his last friend and at the same moment beheld the deadly enemy who had hunted him through the whole field standing within swords point of him and brandishing the huge weapon which had hewed its way to his life through so many obstacles perhaps this was enough to bring his constitutional timidity to its highest point or perhaps he recollected at the same moment that he was without defensive armour and that a line of enemies halting indeed and crippled but eager for revenge and blood were closely approaching it is enough to say that his heart sickened his eyes darkened his ears tingled his brain turned giddy all other considerations were lost in the apprehension of instant death and drawing one ineffectual blow at the smith he avoided that which was aimed at him in return by bounding backward and ere the former could recover his weapon eachin had plunged into the stream of the tay a roar of contumely pursued him as he swam across the river although perhaps not a dozen of those who joined in it would have behaved otherwise in the like circumstances henry looked after the fugitive in silence and surprise but could not speculate on the consequences of his flight on account of the faintness which seemed to overpower him as soon as the animation of the contest had subsided he sat down on the grassy bank and endeavoured to stanch such of his wounds as were pouring fastest  the victors had the general meed of gratulation the duke of albany and others went down to survey the field and henry wynd was honoured with particular notice  if thou wilt follow me good fellow said the black douglas i will change thy leathern apron for a knights girdle and thy burgage tenement for an hundred pound land to maintain thy rank withal  i thank you humbly my lord said the smith dejectedly but i have shed blood enough already and heaven has punished me by foiling the only purpose for which i entered the combat  how friend said douglas didst thou not fight for the clan chattan and have they not gained a glorious conquest  i fought for my own hand meaning i did such a thing for my own pleasure not for your profit said the smith indifferently and the expression is still proverbial in scotland  the good king robert now came up on an ambling palfrey having entered the barriers for the purpose of causing the wounded to be looked after  my lord of douglas he said you vex the poor man with temporal matters when it seems he may have short timer to consider those that are spiritual has he no friends here who will bear him where his bodily wounds and the health of his soul may be both cared for  he hath as many friends as there are good men in perth said sir patrick charteris and i esteem myself one of the closest  a churl will savour of churls kind said the haughty douglas turning his horse aside the proffer of knighthood from the sword of douglas had recalled him from deaths door had there been a drop of gentle blood in his body  disregarding the taunt of the mighty earl the knight of kinfauns dismounted to take henry in his arms as he now sunk back from very faintness but he was prevented by simon glover who with other burgesses of consideration had now entered the barrace  henry my beloved son henry said the old man oh what tempted you to this fatal affray dyingspeechless  nonot speechless said henry catharine he could utter no more  catharine is well i trust and shall be thinethat is if  if she be safe thou wouldst say old man said the douglas who though something affronted at henrys rejection of his offer was too magnanimous not to interest himself in what was passing she is safe if douglass banner can protect hersafe and shall be rich douglas can give wealth to those who value it more than honour  for her safety my lord let the heartfelt thanks and blessings of a father go with the noble douglas for wealth we are rich enough gold cannot restore my beloved son  a marvel said the earl a churl refuses nobility a citizen despises gold  under your lordships favour said sir patrick i who am knight and noble take license to say that such a brave man as henry wynd may reject honourable titles such an honest man as this reverend citizen may dispense with gold  you do well sir patrick to speak for your town and i take no offence said the douglas i force my bounty on no one but he added in a whisper to albany your grace must withdraw the king from this bloody sight for he must know that tonight which will ring over broad scotland when tomorrow dawns this feud is ended yet even i grieve that so many brave scottishmen lie here slain whose brands might have decided a pitched field in their countrys cause  with dignity king robert was withdrawn from the field the tears running down his aged cheeks and white beard as he conjured all around him nobles and priests that care should be taken for the bodies and souls of the few wounded survivors and honourable burial rendered to the slain the priests who were present answered zealously for both services and redeemed their pledge faithfully and piously  thus ended this celebrated conflict of the north inch of perth of sixtyfour brave men the minstrels and standard bearers included who strode manfully to the fatal field seven alone survived who were conveyed from thence in litters in a case little different from the dead and dying around them and mingled with them in the sad procession which conveyed them from the scene of their strife eachin alone had left it void of wounds and void of honour  it remains but to say that not a man of the clan quhele survived the bloody combat except the fugitive chief and the consequence of the defeat was the dissolution of their confederacy the clans of which it consisted are now only matter of conjecture to the antiquary for after this eventful contest they never assembled under the same banner the clan chattan on the other hand continued to increase and flourish and the best families of the northern highlands boast their descent from the race of the cat a mountain    chapter xxxv   while the king rode slowly back to the convent which he then occupied albany with a discomposed aspect and faltering voice asked the earl of douglas will not your lordship who saw this most melancholy scene at falkland communicate the tidings to my unhappy brother  not for broad scotland said the douglas i would sooner bare my breast within flight shot as a butt to an hundred tynedale bowmen no by st bride of douglas i could but say i saw the ill fated youth dead how he came by his death your grace can perhaps better explain were it not for the rebellion of march and the english war i would speak my own mind of it  so saying and making his obeisance to the king the earl rode off to his own lodgings leaving albany to tell his tale as he best could  the rebellion and the english war said the duke to himself ay and thine own interest haughty earl which imperious as thou art thou darest not separate from mine well since the task falls on me i must and will discharge it  he followed the king into his apartment the king looked at him with surprise after he had assumed his usual seat  thy countenance is ghastly robin said the king i would thou wouldst think more deeply when blood is to be spilled since its consequences affect thee so powerfully and yet robin i love thee the better that thy kind nature will sometimes show itself even through thy reflecting policy  i would to heaven my royal brother said albany with a voice half choked that the bloody field we have seen were the worst we had to see or hear of this day i should waste little sorrow on the wild kerne who lie piled on it like carrion but he paused  how exclaimed the king in terror what new evil rothsay it must beit is rothsay speak out what new folly has been done what fresh mischance  my lordmy liege folly and mischance are now ended with my hapless nephew  he is deadhe is dead screamed the agonized parent albany as thy brother i conjure thee but no i am thy brother no longer as thy king dark and subtle man i charge thee to tell the worst  albany faltered out the details are but imperfectly known to me but the certainty is that my unhappy nephew was found dead in his apartment last night from sudden illnessas i have heard  oh rothsayoh my beloved david would to god i had died for thee my sonmy son  so spoke in the emphatic words of scripture the helpless and bereft father tearing his grey beard and hoary hair while albany speechless and conscience struck did not venture to interrupt the tempest of his grief but the agony of the kings sorrow almost instantly changed to furya mood so contrary to the gentleness and timidity of his nature that the remorse of albany was drowned in his fear  and this is the end said the king of thy moral saws and religious maxims but the besotted father who gave the son into thy handswho gave the innocent lamb to the butcheris a king and thou shalt know it to thy cost shall the murderer stand in presence of his brotherstained with the blood of that brothers son no what ho without theremaclouisbrandanes treachery murder take arms if you love the stuart  maclouis with several of the guards rushed into the apartment  murder and treason exclaimed the miserable king brandanes your noble prince here his grief and agitation interrupted for a moment the fatal information it was his object to convey at length he resumed his broken speech an axe and a block instantly into the courtyard arrest the word choked his utterance  arrest whom my noble liege said maclouis who observing the king influenced by a tide of passion so different from the gentleness of his ordinary demeanour almost conjectured that his brain had been disturbed by the unusual horrors of the combat he had witnessed  whom shall i arrest my liege he replied here is none but your graces royal brother of albany  most true said the king his brief fit of vindictive passion soon dying away most truenone but albanynone but my parents childnone but my brother o god enable me to quell the sinful passion which glows in this bosom sancta maria ora pro nobis  maclouis cast a look of wonder towards the duke of albany who endeavoured to hide his confusion under an affectation of deep sympathy and muttered to the officer the great misfortune has been too much for his understanding  what misfortune please your grace replied maclouis i have heard of none  how not heard of the death of my nephew rothsay  the duke of rothsay dead my lord of albany exclaimed the faithful brandane with the utmost horror and astonishment when how and where  two days sincethe manner as yet unknownat falkland  maclouis gazed at the duke for an instant then with a kindling eye and determined look said to the king who seemed deeply engaged in his mental devotion my liege a minute or two since you left a wordone wordunspoken let it pass your lips and your pleasure is law to your brandanes  i was praying against temptation maclouis said the heart broken king and you bring it to me would you arm a madman with a drawn weapon but oh albany my friendmy brothermy bosom counsellorhowhow camest thou by the heart to do this  albany seeing that the kings mood was softening replied with more firmness than before my castle has no barrier against the power of death i have not deserved the foul suspicions which your majestys words imply i pardon them from the distraction of a bereaved father but i am willing to swear by cross and altar by my share in salvation by the souls of our royal parents  be silent robert said the king add not perjury to murder and was this all done to gain a step nearer to a crown and sceptre take them to thee at once man and mayst thou feel as i have done that they are both of red hot iron oh rothsayrothsay thou hast at least escaped being a king  my liege said maclouis let me remind you that the crown and sceptre of scotland are when your majesty ceases to bear them the right of prince james who succeeds to his brothers rights  true maclouis said the king eagerly and will succeed poor child to his brothers perils thanks maclouisthanks you have reminded me that i have still work upon earth get thy brandanes under arms with what speed thou canst let no man go with us whose truth is not known to thee none in especial who has trafficked with the duke of albanythat man i mean who calls himself my brotherand order my litter to be instantly prepared we will to dunbarton maclouis or to bute precipices and tides and my brandanes hearts shall defend the child till we can put oceans betwixt him and his cruel uncles ambition farewell robert of albanyfarewell for ever thou hard hearted bloody man enjoy such share of power as the douglas may permit thee but seek not to see my face again far less to approach my remaining child for that hour thou dost my guards shall have orders to stab thee down with their partizans maclouis look it be so directed  the duke of albany left the presence without attempting further justification or reply  what followed is matter of history in the ensuing parliament the duke of albany prevailed on that body to declare him innocent of the death of rothsay while at the same time he showed his own sense of guilt by taking out a remission or pardon for the offence the unhappy and aged monarch secluded himself in his castle of rothsay in bute to mourn over the son he had lost and watch with feverish anxiety over the life of him who remained as the best step for the youthful jamess security he sent him to france to receive his education at the court of the reigning sovereign but the vessel in which the prince of scotland sailed was taken by an english cruiser and although there was a truce for the moment betwixt the kingdoms henry iv ungenerously detained him a prisoner this last blow completely broke the heart of the unhappy king robert iii vengeance followed though with a slow pace the treachery and cruelty of his brother robert of albanys own grey hairs went indeed in peace to the grave and he transferred the regency which he had so foully acquired to his son murdoch but nineteen years after the death of the old king james i returned to scotland and duke murdoch of albany with his sons was brought to the scaffold in expiation of his fathers guilt and his own    chapter xxxvi       the honest heart thats free frae a      intended fraud or guile      however fortune kick the ba      has aye some cause to smile       burns   we now return to the fair maid of perth who had been sent from the horrible scene at falkland by order of the douglas to be placed under the protection of his daughter the now widowed duchess of rothsay that ladys temporary residence was a religious house called campsie the ruins of which still occupy a striking situation on the tay it arose on the summit of a precipitous rock which descends on the princely river there rendered peculiarly remarkable by the cataract called campsie linn where its waters rush tumultuously over a range of basaltic rock which intercepts the current like a dike erected by human hands delighted with a site so romantic the monks of the abbey of cupar reared a structure there dedicated to an obscure saint named st hunnand and hither they were wont themselves to retire for pleasure or devotion it had readily opened its gates to admit the noble lady who was its present inmate as the country was under the influence of the powerful lord drummond the ally of the douglas there the earls letters were presented to the duchess by the leader of the escort which conducted catharine and the glee maiden to campsie whatever reason she might have to complain of rothsay his horrible and unexpected end greatly shocked the noble lady and she spent the greater part of the night in indulging her grief and in devotional exercises  on the next morning which was that of the memorable palm sunday she ordered catharine glover and the minstrel into her presence the spirits of both the young women had been much sunk and shaken by the dreadful scenes in which they had so lately been engaged and the outward appearance of the duchess marjory was like that of her father more calculated to inspire awe than confidence she spoke with kindness however though apparently in deep affliction and learned from them all which they had to tell concerning the fate of her erring and inconsiderate husband she appeared grateful for the efforts which catharine and the glee maiden had made at their own extreme peril to save rothsay from his horrible fate she invited them to join in her devotions and at the hour of dinner gave them her hand to kiss and dismissed them to their own refection assuring both and catharine in particular of her efficient protection which should include she said her fathers and be a wall around them both so long as she herself lived  they retired from the presence of the widowed princess and partook of a repast with her duennas and ladies all of whom amid their profound sorrow showed a character of stateliness which chilled the light heart of the frenchwoman and imposed restraint even on the more serious character of catharine glover the friends for so we may now term them were fain therefore to escape from the society of these persons all of them born gentlewomen who thought themselves but ill assorted with a burghers daughter and a strolling glee maiden and saw them with pleasure go out to walk in the neighbourhood of the convent a little garden with its bushes and fruit trees advanced on one side of the convent so as to skirt the precipice from which it was only separated by a parapet built on the ledge of the rock so low that the eye might easily measure the depth of the crag and gaze on the conflicting waters which foamed struggled and chafed over the reef below  the fair maiden of perth and her companion walked slowly on a path that ran within this parapet looked at the romantic prospect and judged what it must be when the advancing summer should clothe the grove with leaves they observed for some time a deep silence at length the gay and bold spirit of the glee maiden rose above the circumstances in which she had been and was now placed  do the horrors of falkland fair may still weigh down your spirits strive to forget them as i do we cannot tread lifes path lightly if we shake not from our mantles the raindrops as they fall  these horrors are not to be forgotten answered catharine yet my mind is at present anxious respecting my fathers safety and i cannot but think how many brave men may be at this instant leaving the world even within six miles of us or little farther  you mean the combat betwixt sixty champions of which the douglass equerry told us yesterday it were a sight for a minstrel to witness but out upon these womanish eyes of minethey could never see swords cross each other without being dazzled but seelook yonder may catharinelook yonder that flying messenger certainly brings news of the battle  methinks i should know him who runs so wildly said catharine but if it be he i think of some wild thoughts are urging his speed  as she spoke the runner directed his course to the garden louises little dog ran to meet him barking furiously but came back to cower creep and growl behind its mistress for even dumb animals can distinguish when men are driven on by the furious energy of irresistible passion and dread to cross or encounter them in their career the fugitive rushed into the garden at the same reckless pace his head was bare his hair dishevelled his rich acton and all his other vestments looked as if they had been lately drenched in water his leathern buskins were cut and torn and his feet marked the sod with blood his countenance was wild haggard and highly excited or as the scottish phrase expresses it much raised  conachar said catharine as he advanced apparently without seeing what was before him as hares are said to do when severely pressed by the greyhounds but he stopped short when he heard his own name  conachar said catharine or rather eachin macian what means all this have the clan quhele sustained a defeat  i have borne such names as this maiden gives me said the fugitive after a moments recollection yes i was called conachar when i was happy and eachin when i was powerful but now i have no name and there is no such clan as thou speakst of and thou art a foolish maid to speak of that which is not to one who has no existence  alas unfortunate  and why unfortunate i pray you exclaimed the youth if i am coward and villain have not villainy and cowardice command over the elements have i not braved the water without its choking me and trod the firm earth without its opening to devour me and shall a mortal oppose my purpose  he raves alas said catharine haste to call some help he will not harm me but i fear he will do evil to himself see how he stares down on the roaring waterfall  the glee woman hastened to do as she was ordered and conachars half frenzied spirit seemed relieved by her absence  catharine he said now she is gone i will say i know theei know thy love of peace and hatred of war but hearken i have rather than strike a blow at my enemy given up all that a man calls dearest i have lost honour fame and friends and such friends he placed his hands before his face oh their love surpassed the love of woman why should i hide my tears all know my shame all should see my sorrow yes all might see but who would pity it catharine as i ran like a madman down the strath man and woman called shame on me the beggar to whom i flung an alms that i might purchase one blessing threw it back in disgust and with a curse upon the coward each bell that tolled rung out shame on the recreant caitiff the brute beasts in their lowing and bleating the wild winds in their rustling and howling the hoarse waters in their dash and roar cried out upon the dastard the faithful nine are still pursuing me they cry with feeble voice strike but one blow in our revenge we all died for you  while the unhappy youth thus raved a rustling was heard in the bushes  there is but one way he exclaimed springing upon the parapet but with a terrified glance towards the thicket through which one or two attendants were stealing with the purpose of surprising him but the instant he saw a human form emerge from the cover of the bushes he waved his hands wildly over his head and shrieking out bas air eachin plunged down the precipice into the raging cataract beneath  it is needless to say that aught save thistledown must have been dashed to pieces in such a fall but the river was swelled and the remains of the unhappy youth were never seen a varying tradition has assigned more than one supplement to the history it is said by one account that the young captain of clan quhele swam safe to shore far below the linns of campsie and that wandering disconsolately in the deserts of rannoch he met with father clement who had taken up his abode in the wilderness as a hermit on the principle of the old culdees he converted it is said the heart broken and penitent conachar who lived with him in his cell sharing his devotion and privations till death removed them in succession  another wilder legend supposes that he was snatched from death by the daione shie or fairy folk and that he continues to wander through wood and wild armed like an ancient highlander but carrying his sword in his left hand the phantom appears always in deep grief sometimes he seems about to attack the traveller but when resisted with courage always flies these legends are founded on two peculiar points in his storyhis evincing timidity and his committing suicideboth of them circumstances almost unexampled in the history of a mountain chief  when simon glover having seen his friend henry duly taken care of in his own house in curfew street arrived that evening at the place of campsie he found his daughter extremely ill of a fever in consequence of the scenes to which she had lately been a witness and particularly the catastrophe of her late playmate the affection of the glee maiden rendered her so attentive and careful a nurse that the glover said it should not be his fault if she ever touched lute again save for her own amusement  it was some time ere simon ventured to tell his daughter of henrys late exploits and his severe wounds and he took care to make the most of the encouraging circumstance that her faithful lover had refused both honour and wealth rather than become a professed soldier and follow the douglas catharine sighed deeply and shook her head at the history of bloody palm sunday on the north inch but apparently she had reflected that men rarely advance in civilisation or refinement beyond the ideas of their own age and that a headlong and exuberant courage like that of henry smith was in the iron days in which they lived preferable to the deficiency which had led to conachars catastrophe if she had any doubts on the subject they were removed in due time by henrys protestations so soon as restored health enabled him to plead his own cause  i should blush to say catharine that i am even sick of the thoughts of doing battle yonder last field showed carnage enough to glut a tiger i am therefore resolved to hang up my broadsword never to be drawn more unless against the enemies of scotland  and should scotland call for it said catharine i will buckle it round you  and catharine said the joyful glover we will pay largely for soul masses for those who have fallen by henrys sword and that will not only cure spiritual flaws but make us friends with the church again  for that purpose father said catharine the hoards of the wretched dwining may be applied he bequeathed them to me but i think you would not mix his base blood money with your honest gains  i would bring the plague into my house as soon said the resolute glover  the treasures of the wicked apothecary were distributed accordingly among the four monasteries nor was there ever after a breath of suspicion concerning the orthodoxy of old simon or his daughter  henry and catharine were married within four months after the battle of the north inch and never did the corporations of the glovers and hammermen trip their sword dance so featly as at the wedding of the boldest burgess and brightest maiden in perth ten months after a gallant infant filled the well spread cradle and was rocked by louise to the tune of       bold and true      in bonnet blue  the names of the boys sponsors are recorded as ane hie and michty lord archibald erl of douglas ane honorabil and gude knicht schir patrick charteris of kinfauns and ane gracious princess marjory dowaire of his serene highness david umquhile duke of rothsay  under such patronage a family rises fast and several of the most respected houses in scotland but especially in perthshire and many individuals distinguished
