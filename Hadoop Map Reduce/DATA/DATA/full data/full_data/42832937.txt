42832937	the rivals a comedy  by richard brinsley sheridan           preface  a preface to a play seems generally to be considered as a kind of closetprologue in whichif his piece has been successfulthe author solicits that indulgence from the reader which he had before experienced from the audience but as the scope and immediate object of a play is to please a mixed assembly in representation whose judgment in the theatre at least is decisive its degree of reputation is usually as determined as public before it can be prepared for the cooler tribunal of the study thus any farther solicitude on the part of the writer becomes unnecessary at least if not an intrusion and if the piece has been condemned in the performance i fear an address to the closet like an appeal to posterity is constantly regarded as the procrastination of a suit from a consciousness of the weakness of the cause from these considerations the following comedy would certainly have been submitted to the reader without any farther introduction than what it had in the representation but that its success has probably been founded on a circumstance which the author is informed has not before attended a theatrical trial and which consequently ought not to pass unnoticed  i need scarcely add that the circumstance alluded to was the withdrawing of the piece to remove those imperfections in the first representation which were too obvious to escape reprehension and too numerous to admit of a hasty correction there are few writers i believe who even in the fullest consciousness of error do not wish to palliate the faults which they acknowledge and however trifling the performance to second their confession of its deficiencies by whatever plea seems least disgraceful to their ability in the present instance it cannot be said to amount either to candour or modesty in me to acknowledge an extreme inexperience and want of judgment on matters in which without guidance from practice or spur from success a young man should scarcely boast of being an adept if it be said that under such disadvantages no one should attempt to write a play i must beg leave to dissent from the position while the first point of experience that i have gained on the subject is a knowledge of the candour and judgment with which an impartial public distinguishes between the errors of inexperience and incapacity and the indulgence which it shows even to a disposition to remedy the defects of either  it were unnecessary to enter into any further extenuation of what was thought exceptionable in this play but that it has been said that the managers should have prevented some of the defects before its appearance to the publicand in particular the uncommon length of the piece as represented the first night it were an ill return for the most liberal and gentlemanly conduct on their side to suffer any censure to rest where none was deserved hurry in writing has long been exploded as an excuse for an authorhowever in the dramatic line it may happen that both an author and a manager may wish to fill a chasm in the entertainment of the public with a hastiness not altogether culpable the season was advanced when i first put the play into mr harriss hands it was at that time at least double the length of any acting comedy i profited by his judgment and experience in the curtailing of ittill i believe his feeling for the vanity of a young author got the better of his desire for correctness and he left many excrescences remaining because he had assisted in pruning so many more hence though i was not uninformed that the acts were still too long i flattered myself that after the first trial i might with safer judgment proceed to remove what should appear to have been most dissatisfactory many other errors there were which might in part have arisen from my being by no means conversant with plays in general either in reading or at the theatre yet i own that in one respect i did not regret my ignorance for as my first wish in attempting a play was to avoid every appearance of plagiary i thought i should stand a better chance of effecting this from being in a walk which i had not frequented and where consequently the progress of invention was less likely to be interrupted by starts of recollection for on subjects on which the mind has been much informed invention is slow of exerting itself faded ideas float in the fancy like halfforgotten dreams and the imagination in its fullest enjoyments becomes suspicious of its offspring and doubts whether it has created or adopted  with regard to some particular passages which on the first nights representation seemed generally disliked i confess that if i felt any emotion of surprise at the disapprobation it was not that they were disapproved of but that i had not before perceived that they deserved it as some part of the attack on the piece was begun too early to pass for the sentence of judgment which is ever tardy in condemning it has been suggested to me that much of the disapprobation must have arisen from virulence of malice rather than severity of criticism but as i was more apprehensive of there being just grounds to excite the latter than conscious of having deserved the former i continue not to believe that probable which i am sure must have been unprovoked however if it was so and i could even mark the quarter from whence it came it would be ungenerous to retort for no passion suffers more than malice from disappointment for my own part i see no reason why the author of a play should not regard a first nights audience as a candid and judicious friend attending in behalf of the public at his last rehearsal if he can dispense with flattery he is sure at least of sincerity and even though the annotation be rude he may rely upon the justness of the comment considered in this light that audience whose fiat is essential to the poets claim whether his object be fame or profit has surely a right to expect some deference to its opinion from principles of politeness at least if not from gratitude  as for the little puny critics who scatter their peevish strictures in private circles and scribble at every author who has the eminence of being unconnected with them as they are usually spleenswoln from a vain idea of increasing their consequence there will always be found a petulance and illiberality in their remarks which should place them as far beneath the notice of a gentleman as their original dulness had sunk them from the level of the most unsuccessful author  it is not without pleasure that i catch at an opportunity of justifying myself from the charge of intending any national reflection in the character of sir lucius otrigger if any gentlemen opposed the piece from that idea i thank them sincerely for their opposition and if the condemnation of this comedy however misconceived the provocation could have added one spark to the decaying flame of national attachment to the country supposed to be reflected on i should have been happy in its fate and might with truth have boasted that it had done more real service in its failure than the successful morality of a thousand stagenovels will ever effect  it is usual i believe to thank the performers in a new play for the exertion of their several abilities but where as in this instance their merit has been so striking and uncontroverted as to call for the warmest and truest applause from a number of judicious audiences the poets afterpraise comes like the feeble acclamation of a child to close the shouts of a multitude the conduct however of the principals in a theatre cannot be so apparent to the public i think it therefore but justice to declare that from this theatre the only one i can speak of from experience those writers who wish to try the dramatic line will meet with that candour and liberal attention which are generally allowed to be better calculated to lead genius into excellence than either the precepts of judgment or the guidance of experience  the author          dramatis personae    as originally acted at covent garden theatre in

lydiaand our pleasure is the greaterbut what has been the matteryou were denied to me at first  lydia ah julia i have a thousand things to tell youbut first inform me what has conjured you to bathis sir anthony here  julia he iswe are arrived within this hourand i suppose he will be here to wait on mrs malaprop as soon as he is dressed  lydia then before we are interrupted let me impart to you some of my distressi know your gentle nature will sympathize with me though your prudence may condemn me my letters have informed you of my whole connection with beverley but i have lost him julia my aunt has discovered our intercourse by a note she intercepted and has confined me ever since yet would you believe it she has absolutely fallen in love with a tall irish baronet she met one night since we have been here at lady macshuffles rout  julia you jest lydia  lydia no upon my wordshe really carries on a kind of correspondence with him under a feigned name though till she chooses to be known to himbut it is a delia or a celia i assure you  julia then surely she is now more indulgent to her niece  lydia quite the contrary since she has discovered her own frailty she is become more suspicious of mine then i must inform you of another plaguethat odious acres is to be in bath today so that i protest i shall be teased out of all spirits  julia come come lydia hope for the bestsir anthony shall use his interest with mrs malaprop  lydia but you have not heard the worst unfortunately i had quarrelled with my poor beverley just before my aunt made the discovery and i have not seen him since to make it up  julia what was his offence  lydia nothing at allbut i dont know how it was as often as we had been together we had never had a quarrel and somehow i was afraid he would never give me an opportunity so last thursday i wrote a letter to myself to inform myself that beverley was at that time paying his addresses to another woman i signed it your friend unknown showed it to beverley charged him with his falsehood put myself in a violent passion and vowed id never see him more  julia and you let him depart so and have not seen him since  lydia twas the next day my aunt found the matter out i intended only to have teased him three days and a half and now ive lost him for ever  julia if he is as deserving and sincere as you have represented him to me he will never give you up so yet consider lydia you tell me he is but an ensign and you have thirty thousand pounds  lydia but you know i lose most of my fortune if i marry without my aunts consent till of age and that is what i have determined to do ever since i knew the penalty nor could i love the man who would wish to wait a day for the alternative  julia nay this is caprice  lydia what does julia tax me with capricei thought her lover faulkland had inured her to it  julia i do not love even his faults  lydia but aproposyou have sent to him i suppose  julia not yet upon my wordnor has he the least idea of my being in bath sir anthonys resolution was so sudden i could not inform him of it  lydia well julia you are your own mistress though under the protection of sir anthony yet have you for this long year been a slave to the caprice the whim the jealousy of this ungrateful faulkland who will ever delay assuming the right of a husband while you suffer him to be equally imperious as a lover  julia nay you are wrong entirely we were contracted before my fathers death that and some consequent embarrassments have delayed what i know to be my faulklands most ardent wish he is too generous to trifle on such a pointand for his character you wrong him there too no lydia he is too proud too noble to be jealous if he is captious tis without dissembling if fretful without rudeness unused to the fopperies of love he is negligent of the little duties expected from a loverbut being unhackneyed in the passion his affection is ardent and sincere and as it engrosses his whole soul he expects every thought and emotion of his mistress to move in unison with his yet though his pride calls for this full return his humility makes him undervalue those qualities in him which would entitle him to it and not feeling why he should be loved to the degree he wishes he still suspects that he is not loved enough this temper i must own has cost me many unhappy hours but i have learned to think myself his debtor for those imperfections which arise from the ardour of his attachment  lydia well i cannot blame you for defending him but tell me candidly julia had he never saved your life do you think you should have been attached to him as you arebelieve me the rude blast that overset your boat was a prosperous gale of love to him  julia gratitude may have strengthened my attachment to mr faulkland but i loved him before he had preserved me yet surely that alone were an obligation sufficient  lydia obligation why a water spaniel would have done as muchwell i should never think of giving my heart to a man because he could swim  julia come lydia you are too inconsiderate  lydia nay i do but jestwhats here  reenter lucy in a hurry  lucy o maam here is sir anthony absolute just

absolute  mrs malaprop there sir anthony there sits the deliberate simpleton who wants to disgrace her family and lavish herself on a fellow not worth a shilling  lydia madam i thought you once  mrs malaprop you thought miss i dont know any business you have to think at allthought does not become a young woman but the point we would request of you is that you will promise to forget this fellowto illiterate him i say quite from your memory  lydia ah madam our memories are independent of our wills it is not so easy to forget  mrs malaprop but i say it is miss there is nothing on earth so easy as to forget if a person chooses to set about it im sure i have as much forgot your poor dear uncle as if he had never existedand i thought it my duty so to do and let me tell you lydia these violent memories dont become a young woman  sir anthony why sure she wont pretend to remember what shes ordered notay this comes of her reading  lydia what crime madam have i committed to be treated thus  mrs malaprop now dont attempt to extirpate yourself from the matter you know i have proof controvertible of itbut tell me will you promise to do as youre bid will you take a husband of your friends choosing  lydia madam i must tell you plainly that had i no preferment for any one else the choice you have made would be my aversion  mrs malaprop what business have you miss with preference and aversion they dont become a young woman and you ought to know that as both always wear off tis safest in matrimony to begin with a little aversion i am sure i hated your poor dear uncle before marriage as if hed been a blackamoorand yet miss you are sensible what a wife i madeand when it pleased heaven to release me from him tis unknown what tears i shedbut suppose we were going to give you another choice will you promise us to give up this beverley  lydia could i belie my thoughts so far as to give that promise my actions would certainly as far belie my words  mrs malaprop take yourself to your roomyou are fit company for nothing but your own illhumours  lydia willingly maami cannot change for the worse exit  mrs malaprop theres a little intricate hussy for you  sir anthony it is not to be wondered at maamall this is the natural consequence of teaching girls to read had i a thousand daughters by heaven id as soon have them taught the black art as their alphabet  mrs malaprop nay nay sir anthony you are an absolute misanthropy  sir anthony in my way hither mrs malaprop i observed your nieces maid coming forth from a circulating libraryshe had a book in each handthey were halfbound volumes with marble coversfrom that moment i guessed how full of duty i should see her mistress  mrs malaprop those are vile places indeed  sir anthony madam a circulating library in a town is as an evergreen tree of diabolical knowledge it blossoms through the yearand depend on it mrs malaprop that they who are so fond of handling the leaves will long for the fruit at last  mrs malaprop fy fy sir anthony you surely speak laconically  sir anthony why mrs malaprop in moderation now what would you have a woman know  mrs malaprop observe me sir anthony i would by no means wish a daughter of mine to be a progeny of learning i dont think so much learning becomes a young woman for instance i would never let her meddle with greek or hebrew or algebra or simony or fluxions or paradoxes or such inflammatory branches of learningneither would it be necessary for her to handle any of your mathematical astronomical diabolical instrumentsbut sir anthony i would send her at nine years old to a boardingschool in order to learn a little ingenuity and artifice then sir she should have a supercilious knowledge in accountsand as she grew up i would have her instructed in geometry that she might know something of the contagious countriesbut above all sir anthony she should be mistress of orthodoxy that she might not misspell and mispronounce words so shamefully as girls usually do and likewise that she might reprehend the true meaning of what she is saying this sir anthony is what i would have a woman knowand i dont think there is a superstitious article in it  sir anthony well well mrs malaprop i will dispute the point no further with you though i must confess that you are a truly moderate and polite arguer for almost every third word you say is on my side of the question but mrs malaprop to the more important point in debateyou say you have no objection to my proposal  mrs malaprop none i assure you i am under no positive engagement with mr acres and as lydia is so obstinate against him perhaps your son may have better success  sir anthony well madam i will write for the boy directly he knows not a syllable of this yet though i have for some time had the proposal in my head he is at present with his regiment  mrs malaprop we have never seen your son sir anthony but i hope no objection on his side  sir anthony objectionlet him object if he dareno no

that i always sent him out of the room  mrs malaprop ay and the properest way o my consciencenothing is so conciliating to young people as severitywell sir anthony i shall give mr acres his discharge and prepare lydia to receive your sons invocationsand i hope you will represent her to the captain as an object not altogether illegible  sir anthony madam i will handle the subject prudentlywell i must leave you and let me beg you mrs malaprop to enforce this matter roundly to the girltake my advicekeep a tight hand if she rejects this proposal clap her under lock and key and if you were just to let the servants forget to bring her dinner for three or four days you cant conceive how shed come about exit  mrs malaprop well at any rate i shall be glad to get her from under my intuition she

cannot correct myself what tender honest joy sparkled in her eyes when we met how delicate was the warmth of her expression i was ashamed to appear less happythough i had come resolved to wear a face

welcomerestrained as we were by the presence of a third person  julia o faulkland when your kindness can make me thus happy let me not think that i discovered something of coldness in your first salutation  faulkland twas but your fancy julia i was rejoiced to see youto see you in such health sure i had no cause for coldness  julia nay then i see you have taken something ill you must not conceal from me what it is  faulkland well thenshall i own to you that my joy at hearing of your health and arrival here by your neighbour acres was somewhat damped by his dwelling much on the high spirits you had enjoyed in devonshireon your mirthyour singingdancing and i know not what for such is my temper julia that i should regard every mirthful moment in your absence as a treason to constancy the mutual tear that steals down the cheek of parting lovers is a compact that no smile shall live there till they meet again  julia must i never cease to tax my faulkland with this teasing minute caprice can the idle reports of a silly boor weigh in your breast against my tried affections  faulkland they have no weight with me julia no noi am happy if you have been soyet only say that you did not sing with mirthsay that you thought of faulkland in the dance  julia i never can be happy in your absence if i wear a countenance of content it is to show that my mind holds no doubt of my faulklands truth if i seemed sad it were to make malice triumph and say that i had fixed my heart on one who left me to lament his roving and my own credulity believe me faulkland i mean not to upbraid you when i say that i have often dressed sorrow in smiles lest my friends should guess whose unkindness had caused my tears  faulkland you were ever all goodness to me oh i am a brute when i but admit a doubt of your true constancy  julia if ever without such cause from you as i will not suppose possible you find my affections veering but a point may i become a proverbial scoff for levity and base ingratitude  faulkland ah julia that last word is grating to me i would i had no title to your gratitude search your heart julia perhaps what you have mistaken for love is but the warm effusion of a too thankful heart  julia for what quality must i love you  faulkland for no quality to regard me for any quality of mind or understanding were only to esteem me and for personi have often wished myself deformed to be convinced that i owed no obligation there for any part of your affection  julia where nature has bestowed a show of nice attention in the features of a man he should laugh at it as misplaced i have seen men who in this vain article perhaps might rank above you but my heart has never asked my eyes if it were so or not  faulkland now this is not well from you juliai

itself be a sufficient accommodation but from the ingenuity of your appearance i am convinced you deserve the character here given of you  absolute permit me to say madam that as i never yet have had the pleasure of seeing miss languish my principal inducement in this affair at present is the honour of being allied to mrs malaprop of whose intellectual accomplishments elegant manners and unaffected learning no tongue is silent  mrs malaprop sir you do me infinite honour i beg captain youll be seatedthey sit ah few gentlemen nowadays know how to value the ineffectual qualities in a woman few think how a little knowledge becomes a gentlewomanmen have no sense now but for the worthless flower of beauty  absolute it is but too true indeed maamyet i fear our ladies should share the

hides himself upon my conscience these officers are always in ones way in love affairsi remember i might have married lady dorothy carmine if it had not been for a little rogue of a major who ran away with her before she could get a sight of me and i wonder too what it is the ladies can see in them to be so fond of themunless it be a touch of the old serpent in em that makes the little creatures be caught like vipers with a bit of red cloth ha isnt this the captain comingfaith it isthere is a probability of succeeding about that fellow that is mighty provoking who the devil is he talking to steps aside  enter captain absolute  absolute aside to what fine purpose i have been plotting a noble reward for all my schemes upon my soula little gipsyi did not think her romance could have made her so damned absurd either sdeath i never was in a worse humour in my lifei could cut my own throat or any other persons with the greatest pleasure in the world  sir lucius oh faith im in the luck of it i never could have found him in a sweeter temper for my purposeto be sure im just come in the nick now to enter into conversation with him and so quarrel genteellygoes up to captain absolute with regard to that matter captain i must beg leave to differ in opinion with you  absolute upon my word then you must be a very subtle disputantbecause sir i happened just then to be giving no opinion at all  sir lucius thats no reason for give me leave to tell you a man may think an untruth as well as speak one  absolute very true sir but if a man never utters his thoughts i should think they might stand a chance of escaping controversy  sir lucius then sir you differ in opinion with me which amounts to the same thing  absolute harkee sir lucius if i had not before known you to be a gentleman upon my soul i should not have discovered it at this interview for what you can drive at unless you mean to quarrel with me i cannot conceive  sir lucius i humbly thank you sir for the quickness of your apprehensionbowing you have named the very thing i would be at  absolute very well sir i shall certainly not balk your inclinationsbut i should be glad you would please to explain your motives  sir lucius pray sir be easy the quarrel is a very pretty quarrel as it stands we should only spoil it by trying to explain it however your memory is very short or you could not have forgot an affront you passed on me within this week so no more but name your time and place  absolute well sir since you are so bent on it the sooner the better let it be this eveninghere by the spring gardens we shall scarcely be interrupted  sir lucius faith that same interruption in affairs of this nature shows very great illbreeding i dont know whats the reason but in england if a thing of this kind gets wind people make such a pother that a gentleman can never fight in peace and quietness however if its the same to you captain i should take it as a particular kindness if youd let us meet in kingsmeadfields as a little business will call me there about six oclock and i may despatch both matters at once  absolute tis the same to me exactly a little after six then we will discuss this matter more seriously  sir lucius if you please sir there will be very pretty smallsword light though it wont do for a long shot so that matters settled and my minds at ease exit  enter faulkland  absolute well met i was going to look for you o faulkland all the demons of spite and disappointment have conspired against me im so vexd that if i had not the prospect of a resource in being knocked o the head byandby i should scarce have spirits to tell you the cause  faulkland what can you meanhas lydia changed her mindi should have thought her duty and inclination would now have pointed to the same object  absolute ay just as the eyes do of a person who squints when her loveeye was fixed on me tother her eye of duty was finely obliqued but when duty bid her point that the same way off tother turned on a swivel and secured its retreat with a frown  faulkland but whats the resource you  absolute oh to wind up the whole a goodnatured irishman here hasmimicking sir lucius begged leave to have the pleasure of cutting my throat and i mean to indulge himthats all  faulkland prithee be serious  absolute tis fact upon my soul sir lucius otriggeryou know him by sightfor some affront which i am sure i never intended has obliged me to meet him this evening at six oclock tis on that account i wished to see you you must go with me  faulkland nay there must be some mistake sure sir lucius shall explain himself and i dare say matters may be accommodated but this evening did you say i wish it had been any other time  absolute why there will be light enough there will as sir lucius says be very pretty smallsword light though it will not do for a long shot confound his long shots  faulkland but i am myself a good deal ruffled by a difference i have had with julia my vile tormenting temper has made me treat her so cruelly that i shall not be myself till we are reconciled  absolute by heavens faulkland you dont deserve her  enter servant gives faulkland a letter and exit  faulkland oh jack this is from julia i dread to open it i fear it may be to take a last leaveperhaps to bid me return her letters and restoreoh how i suffer for my folly  absolute here let me seetakes the letter and opens it ay a final sentence indeedtis all over with you faith  faulkland nay jack dont keep me in suspense  absolute here thenreads as i am convinced that my dear faulklands own reflections have already upbraided him for his last unkindness to me i will not add a word on the subject i wish to speak with you as soon as possible yours ever and truly julia theres stubbornness and resentment for yougives him the letter why man you dont seem one whit the happier at this  faulkland o yes i am butbut  absolute confound your buts you never hear any thing that would make another man bless himself but you immediately damn it with a but  faulkland now jack as you are my friend own honestlydont you think there is something forward something indelicate in this haste to forgive women should never sue for reconciliation that should always come from us they should retain their coldness till wooed to kindness and their pardon like their love should not unsought be won  absolute i have not patience to listen to you thourt incorrigible so say no more on the subject i must go to settle a few matters let me see you before six remember at my lodgings a poor industrious devil like me who have toiled and drudged and plotted to gain my ends and am at last disappointed by other peoples folly may in pity be allowed to swear and grumble a little but a captious sceptic in love a slave to fretfulness and whim who has no difficulties but of his own creating is a subject more fit for ridicule than compassion exit  faulkland i feel his reproaches yet i would not change this too exquisite nicety for the gross content with which he tramples on the thorns of love his engaging me in this duel has started an idea in my head which i will instantly pursue ill use it as the touchstone of julias sincerity and disinterestedness if her love prove pure and sterling ore my name will rest on it with honour and once ive stamped it there i lay aside my doubts for ever but if the dross of selfishness the alloy of pride predominate twill be best to leave her as a toy for some less cautious fool to sigh for exit                act v           scene ijulias dressingroom julia discovered alone  julia how this message has alarmed me what dreadful accident can he mean why such charge to be aloneo faulklandhow many unhappy momentshow many tears have you cost me  enter faulkland  julia what means thiswhy this caution faulkland  faulkland alas julia i am come to take a long farewell  julia heavens what do you mean  faulkland you see before you a wretch whose life is forfeited nay start notthe infirmity of my temper has drawn all this misery on me i left you fretful and passionatean untoward accident drew me into a quarrelthe event is that i must fly this kingdom instantly o julia had i been so fortunate as to have called you mine entirely before this mischance had fallen on me i should not so deeply dread my banishment  julia my soul is oppressed with sorrow at the nature of your misfortune had these adverse circumstances arisen from a less fatal cause i should have felt strong comfort in the thought that i could now chase from your bosom every doubt of the warm sincerity of my love my heart has long known no other guardiani now entrust my person to your honourwe will fly together when safe from pursuit my fathers will may be fulfilledand i receive a legal claim to be the partner of your sorrows and tenderest comforter then on the bosom of your wedded julia you may lull your keen regret to slumbering while virtuous love with a cherubs hand shall smooth the brow of upbraiding thought and pluck the thorn from compunction  faulkland o julia i am bankrupt in gratitude but the time is so pressing it calls on you for so hasty a resolutionwould you not wish some hours to weigh the advantages you forego and what little compensation poor faulkland can make you beside his solitary love  julia i ask not a moment no faulkland i have loved you for yourself and if i now more than ever prize the solemn engagement which so long has pledged us to each other it is because it leaves no room for hard aspersions on my fame and puts the seal of duty to an act of love but let us not linger perhaps this delay  faulkland twill be better i should not venture out again till dark yet am i grieved to think what numberless distresses will press heavy on your gentle disposition  julia perhaps your fortune may be forfeited by this unhappy acti know not whether tis so but sure that alone can never make us unhappy the little i have will be sufficient to support us and exile never should be splendid  faulkland ay but in such an abject state of life my wounded pride perhaps may increase the natural fretfulness of my temper till i become a rude morose companion beyond your patience to endure perhaps the recollection of a deed my conscience cannot justify may haunt me in such gloomy and unsocial fits that i shall hate the tenderness that would relieve me break from your arms and quarrel with your fondness  julia if your thoughts should assume so unhappy a bent you will the more want some mild and affectionate spirit to watch over and console you one who by bearing your infirmities with gentleness and resignation may teach you so to bear the evils of your fortune  faulkland julia i have proved you to the quick and with this useless device i throw away all my doubts how shall i plead to be forgiven this last unworthy effect of my restless unsatisfied disposition  julia has no such disaster happened as you related  faulkland i am ashamed to own that it was pretended yet in pity julia do not kill me with resenting a fault which never can be repeated but sealing this once my pardon let me tomorrow in the face of heaven receive my future guide and monitress and expiate my past folly by years of tender adoration  julia hold faulklandthat you are free from a crime which i before feared to name heaven knows how sincerely i rejoice these are tears of thankfulness for that but that your cruel doubts should have urged you to an imposition that has wrung my heart gives me now a pang more keen than i can express  faulkland by heavens julia  julia yet hear memy father loved you faulkland and you preserved the life that tender parent gave me in his presence i pledged my handjoyfully pledged itwhere before i had given my heart when soon after i lost that parent it seemed to me that providence had in faulkland shown me whither to transfer without a pause my grateful duty as well as my affection hence i have been content to bear from you what pride and delicacy would have forbid me from another i will not upbraid you by repeating how you have trifled with my sincerity   faulkland i confess it all yet hear  julia after such a year of trial i might have flattered myself that i should not have been insulted with a new probation of my sincerity as cruel as unnecessary i now see it is not in your nature to be content or confident in love with this convictioni never will be yours while i had hopes that my persevering attention and unreproaching kindness might in time reform your temper i should have been happy to have gained a dearer influence over you but i will not furnish you with a licensed power to keep alive an incorrigible fault at the expense of one who never would contend with you  faulkland nay but julia by my soul and honour if after this  julia but one word moreas my faith has once been given to you i never will barter it with anotheri shall pray for your happiness with the truest sincerity and the dearest blessing i can ask of heaven to send you will be to charm you from that unhappy temper which alone has prevented the performance of our solemn engagement all i request of you is that you will yourself reflect upon this infirmity and when you number up the many true delights it has deprived you of let it not be your least regret that it lost you the love of one who would have followed you in beggary through the world exit  faulkland shes gonefor everthere was an awful resolution in her manner that riveted me to my placeo fooldoltbarbarian cursed as i am with more imperfections than my fellow wretches kind fortune sent a heavengifted cherub to my aid and like a ruffian i have driven her from my sidei must now haste to my appointment well my mind is tuned for

shivering with cold and i with apprehension and while the freezing blast numbed our joints how warmly would he press me to pity his flame and glow with mutual ardourah julia that was something like being in love  julia if i were in spirits lydia i should chide you only by laughing heartily at you but it suits more the situation of my mind at present earnestly to entreat you not to let a man who
