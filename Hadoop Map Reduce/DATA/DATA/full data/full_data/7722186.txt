7722186	the green flag  arthur conan doyle         contents  the green flag  captain sharkey  the croxley master  the lord of chateau noir  the striped chest  a shadow before  the king of the foxes  the three correspondents  the new catacomb  the debut of bimbashi joyce  a foreign office romance      the green flag   when jack conolly of the irish shotgun brigade the rory of the hills inner circle and the extreme left wing of the land league was incontinently shot by sergeant murdoch of the constabulary in a little moonlight frolic near kanturk his twinbrother dennis joined the british army  the countryside had become too hot for him and as the seventyfive shillings were wanting which might have carried him to america he took the only way handy of getting himself out of the way seldom has her majesty had a less promising recruit for his hot celtic blood seethed with hatred against britain and all things british the sergeant however smiling complacently over his 6 ft of brawn and his 44 in chest whisked him off with a dozen other of the boys to the depot at fermoy whence in a few weeks they were sent on with the spadework kinks taken out of their backs to the first battalion of the royal mallows at the top of the roster for foreign service  the royal mallows at about that date were as strange a lot of men as ever were paid by a great empire to fight its battles  it was the darkest hour of the land struggle when the one side came out with crowbar and batteringram by day and the other with mask and with shotgun by night  men driven from their homes and potatopatches found their way even into the service of the government to which it seemed to them that they owed their troubles and now and then they did wild things before they came  there were recruits in the irish regiments who would forget to answer to their own names so short had been their acquaintance with them  of these the royal mallows had their full share and while they still retained their fame as being one of the smartest corps in the army no one knew better than their officers that they were dryrotted with treason and with bitter hatred of the flag under which they served  and the centre of all the disaffection was c company in which dennis conolly found himself enrolled  they were celts catholics and men of the tenant class to a man and their whole experience of the british government had been an inexorable landlord and a constabulary who seemed to them to be always on the side of the rentcollector  dennis was not the only moonlighter in the ranks nor was he alone in having an intolerable family bloodfeud to harden his heart  savagery had begotten savagery in that veiled civil war  a landlord with an iron mortgage weighing down upon him had small bowels for his tenantry he did but take what the law allowed and yet with men like jim holan or patrick mcquire or peter flynn who had seen the roofs torn from their cottages and their folk huddled among their pitiable furniture upon the roadside it was ill to argue about abstract law  what matter that in that long and bitter struggle there was many another outrage on the part of the tenant and many another grievance on the side of the landowner  a stricken man can only feel his own wound and the rank and file of the c company of the royal mallows were sore and savage to the soul  there were low whisperings in barrackrooms and canteens stealthy meetings in publichouse parlours bandying of passwords from mouth to mouth and many other signs which made their officers right glad when the order came which sent them to foreign and better still to active service  for irish regiments have before now been disaffected and have at a distance looked upon the foe as though he might in truth be the friend but when they have been put face on to him and when their officers have dashed to the front with a wave and halloo those rebel hearts have softened and their gallant celtic blood has boiled with the mad joy of the fight until the slower britons have marvelled that they ever could have doubted the loyalty of their irish comrades  so it would be again according to the officers and so it would not be if dennis conolly and a few others could have their way  it was a march morning upon the eastern fringe of the nubian desert the sun had not yet risen but a tinge of pink flushed up as far as the cloudless zenith and the long strip of sea lay like a rosy ribbon across the horizon  from the coast inland stretched dreary sandplains dotted over with thick clumps at mimosa scrub and mottled patches of thorny bush  no tree broke the monotony of that vast desert  the dull dusty hue of the thickets and the yellow glare of the sand were the only colours save at one point where from a distance it seemed that a landslip of snowwhite stones had shot itself across a low foothill but as the traveller approached he saw with a thrill that these were no stones but the bleaching bones of a slaughtered army  with its dull tints its gnarled viprous bushes its arid barren soil and this death streak trailed across it it was indeed a nightmare country  some eight or ten miles inland the rolling plain curved upwards with a steeper slope until it ran into a line of red basaltic rock which zigzagged from north to south heaping itself up at one point into a fantastic knoll  on the summit of this there stood upon that march morning three arab chieftainsthe sheik kadra of the hadendowas moussa wad aburhegel who led the berber dervishes and hamid wad hussein who had come northward with his fighting men from the land of the baggaras they had all three just risen from their prayingcarpets and were peering out with fierce highnosed faces thrust forwards at the stretch of country revealed by the spreading dawn  the red rim of the sun was pushing itself now above the distant sea and the whole coastline stood out brilliantly yellow against the rich deep blue beyond  at one spot lay a huddle of whitewalled houses a mere splotch in the distance while four tiny cockboats which lay beyond marked the position of three of her majestys 10000ton troopers and the admirals flagship  but it was not upon the distant town nor upon the great vessels nor yet upon the sinister white litter which gleamed in the plain beneath them that the arab chieftains gazed  two miles from where they stood amid the sandhills and the mimosa scrub a great parallelogram had been marked by piledup bushes  from the inside of this dozens of tiny blue smokereeks curled up into the still morning air while there rose from it a confused deep murmur the voices of men and the gruntings of camels blended into the same insect buzz  the unbelievers have cooked their morning food said the baggara chief shading his eyes with his tawny sinewy hand  truly their sleep has been scanty for hamid and a hundred of his men have fired upon them since the rising of the moon  so it was with these others answered the sheik kadra pointing with his sheathed sword towards the old battlefield  they also had a day of little water and a night of little rest and the heart was gone out of them ere ever the sons of the prophet had looked them in the eyes this blade drank deep that day and will again before the sun has travelled from the sea to the hill  and yet these are other men remarked the berber dervish  well i know that allah has placed them in the clutch of our fingers yet it may be that they with the big hats will stand firmer than the cursed men of egypt  pray allah that it may be so cried the fierce baggara with a flash of his black eyes  it was not to chase women that i brought 700 men from the river to the coast  see my brother already they are forming their array  a fanfare of buglecalls burst from the distant camp  at the same time the bank of bushes at one side had been thrown or trampled down and the little army within began to move slowly out on to the plain  once clear of the camp they halted and the slant rays of the sun struck flashes from bayonet and from gunbarrel as the ranks closed up until the big pith helmets joined into a single long white ribbon  two streaks of scarlet glowed on either side of the square but elsewhere the fringe of fightingmen was of the dull yellow khaki tint which hardly shows against the desert sand  inside their array was a dense mass of camels and mules bearing stores and ambulance needs  outside a twinkling clump of cavalry was drawn up on each flank and in front a thin scattered line of mounted infantry was already slowly advancing over the bushstrewn plain halting on every eminence and peering warily round as men might who have to pick their steps among the bones of those who have preceded them  the three chieftains still lingered upon the knoll looking down with hungry eyes and compressed lips at the dark steeltipped patch they are slower to start than the men of egypt the sheik of the hadendowas growled in his beard  slower also to go back perchance my brother murmured the dervish  and yet they are not many3000 at the most  and we 10000 with the prophets grip upon our spearhafts and his words upon our banner  see to their chieftain how he rides upon the right and looks up at us with the glass that sees from afar  it may be that he sees this also  the arab shook his sword at the small clump of horsemen who had spurred out from the square  lo he beckons cried the dervish and see those others at the corner how they bend and heave  ha by the prophet i had thought it as he spoke a little woolly puff of smoke spurted up at the corner of the square and a 7 lb shell burst with a hard metallic smack just over their heads  the splinters knocked chips from the red rocks around them  bismillah cried the hadendowa if the gun can carry thus far then ours can answer to it  ride to the left moussa and tell ben ali to cut the skin from the egyptians if they cannot hit yonder mark and you hamid to the right and see that 3000 men lie close in the wady that we have chosen  let the others beat the drum and show the banner of the prophet for by the black stone their spears will have drunk deep ere they look upon the stars again  a long straggling boulderstrewn plateau lay on the summit of the red hills sloping very precipitously to the plain save at one point where a winding gully curved downwards its mouth choked with sandmounds and olivehued scrub  along the edge of this position lay the arab hosta motley crew of shockheaded desert clansmen fierce predatory slave dealers of the interior and wild dervishes from the upper nile all blent together by their common fearlessness and fanaticism  two races were there as wide as the poles apartthe thinlipped straighthaired arab and the thicklipped curly negroyet the faith of islam had bound them closer than a blood tie  squatting among the rocks or lying thickly in the shadow they peered out at the slowmoving square beneath them while women with waterskins and bags of dhoora fluttered from group to group calling out to each other those fighting texts from the koran which in the hour of battle are maddening as wine to the true believer  a score of banners waved over the ragged valiant crew and among them upon desert horses and white bishareen camels were the emirs and sheiks who were to lead them against the infidels  as the sheik kadra sprang into his saddle and drew his sword there was a wild whoop and a clatter of waving spears while the oneended wardrums burst into a dull crash like a wave upon shingle  for a moment 10000 men were up on the rocks with brandished arms and leaping figures the next they were under cover again waiting sternly and silently for their chieftains orders  the square was less than half a mile from the ridge now and shell after shell from the 7 lb guns were pitching over it a deep roar on the right and then a second one showed that the egyptian krupps were in action  sheik kadras hawk eyes saw that the shells burst far beyond the mark and he spurred his horse along to where a knot of mounted chiefs were gathered round the two guns which were served by their captured crews  how is this ben ali he cried  it was not thus that the dogs fired when it was their own brothers in faith at whom they aimed  a chieftain reined his horse back and thrust a bloodsmeared sword into its sheath  beside him two egyptian artillerymen with their throats cut were sobbing out their lives upon the ground  who lays the gun this time asked the fierce chief glaring at the frightened gunners here thou blackbrowed child of shaitan aim and aim for thy life  it may have been chance or it may have been skill but the third and fourth shells burst over the square  sheik kadra smiled grimly and galloped back to the left where his spearmen were streaming down into the gully  as he joined them a deep growling rose from the plain beneath like the snarling of a sullen wild beast and a little knot of tribesmen fell into a struggling heap caught in the blast of lead from a gardner  their comrades pressed on over them and sprang down into the ravine  from all along the crest burst the hard sharp crackle of remington fire  the square had slowly advanced rippling over the low sandhills and halting every few minutes to rearrange its formation  now having made sure that there was no force of the enemy in the scrub it changed its direction and began to take a line parallel to the arab position it was too steep to assail from the front and if they moved far enough to the right the general hoped that he might turn it  on the top of those ruddy hills lay a baronetcy for him and a few extra hundreds in his pension and he meant having them both that day  the remington fire was annoying and so were those two krupp guns already there were more cacolets full than he cared to see  but on the whole he thought it better to hold his fire until he had more to aim at than a few hundred of fuzzy heads peeping over a razorback ridge  he was a bulky redfaced man a fine whistplayer and a soldier who knew his work his men believed in him and he had good reason to believe in them for he had excellent stuff under him that day  being an ardent champion of the shortservice system he took particular care to work with veteran first battalions and his little force was the compressed essence of an army corps  the left front of the square was formed by four companies of the royal wessex and the right by four of the royal mallows  on either side the other halves of the same regiments marched in quarter column of companies  behind them on the right was a battalion of guards and on the left one of marines while the rear was closed in by a rifle battalion  two royal artillery 7 lb screwguns kept pace with the square and a dozen whitebloused sailors under their bluecoated tightwaisted officers trailed their gardner in front turning every now and then to spit up at the draggled banners which waved over the cragged ridge  hussars and lancers scouted in the scrub at each side and within moved the clump of camels with humorous eyes and supercilious lips their comic faces a contrast to the bloodstained men who already lay huddled in the cacolets on either side  the square was now moving slowly on a line parallel with the rocks stopping every few minutes to pick up wounded and to allow the screwguns and gardner to make themselves felt  the men looked serious for that spring on to the rocks of the arab army had given them a vague glimpse of the number and ferocity of their foes but their faces were set like stone for they knew to a man that they must win or they must dieand die too in a particularly unlovely fashion  but most serious of all was the general for he had seen that which brought a flush to his cheeks and a frown to his brow  i say stephen said he to his galloper those mallows seem a trifle jumpy  the right flank company bulged a bit when the niggers showed on the hill  youngest troops in the square sir murmured the aide looking at them critically through his eyeglass  tell colonel flanagan to see to it stephen said the general and the galloper sped upon his way  the colonel a fine old celtic warrior was over at c company in an instant  how are the men captain foley  never better sir answered the senior captain in the spirit that makes a madras officer look murder if you suggest recruiting his regiment from the punjab  stiffen them up cried the colonel  as he rode away a coloursergeant seemed to trip and fell forward into a mimosa bush  he made no effort to rise but lay in a heap among the thorns  sergeant orookes gone sorr cried a voice  never mind lads said captain foley  hes died like a soldier fighting for his queen  down with the queen shouted a hoarse voice from the ranks  but the roar of the gardner and the typewriterlike clicking of the hopper burst in at the tail of the words  captain foley heard them and subalterns grice and murphy heard them  but there are times when a deaf ear is a gift from the gods  steady mallows cried the captain in a pause of the grunting machinegun  we have the honour of ireland to guard this day  and well we know how to guard it captin cried the same ominous voice and there was a buzz from the length of the company  the captain and the two subs came together behind the marching line  they seem a bit out of hand murmured the captain  bedad said the galway boy they mean to scoot like redshanks  they nearly broke when the blacks showed on the hill said grice  the first man that turns my sword is through him cried foley loud enough to be heard by five files on either side of him  then in a lower voice its a bitter drop to swallow but its my duty to report what you think to the chief and have a company of jollies put behind us  he turned away with the safety of the square upon his mind and before he had reached his goal the square had ceased to exist  in their march in front of what looked like a face of cliff they had come opposite to the mouth of the gully in which screened by scrub and boulders 3000 chosen dervishes under hamid wad hussein of the baggaras were crouching  tat tat tat went the rifles of three mounted infantrymen in front of the left shoulder of the square and an instant later they wore spurring it for their lives crouching over the manes of their horses and pelting over the sandhills with thirty or forty galloping chieftains at their heels  rocks and scrub and mimosa swarmed suddenly into life  rushing black figures came and went in the gaps of the bushes  a howl that drowned the shouts of the officers a long quavering yell burst from the ambuscade  two rolling volleys from the royal wessex one crash from the screwgun firing shrapnel and then before a second cartridge could be rammed in a living glistening black wave tipped with steel had rolled over the gun the royal wessex had been dashed back among the camels and 1000 fanatics were hewing and hacking in the heart of what had been the square  the camels and mules in the centre jammed more and more together as their leaders flinched from the rush of the tribesmen shut out the view of the other three faces who could only tell that the arabs had got in by the yells upon allah which rose ever nearer and nearer amid the clouds of sanddust the struggling animals and the dense mass of swaying cursing men  some of the wessex fired back at the arabs who had passed them as excited tommies will and it is whispered among doctors that it was not always a remington bullet which was cut from a wound that day  some rallied in little knots stabbing furiously with their bayonets at the rushing spearmen  others turned at bay with their backs against the camels and others round the general and his staff who revolver in hand had flung themselves into the heart of it but the whole square was sidling slowly away from the gorge pushed back by the pressure at the shattered corner  the officers and men at the other faces were glancing nervously to the rear uncertain what was going on and unable to take help to their comrades without breaking the formation  by jove theyve got through the wessex cried grice of the mallows  the divils have hurrooshed us ted said his brother subaltern cocking his revolver  the ranks were breaking and crowding towards private conolly all talking together as the officers peered back through the veil of dust the sailors had run their gardner out and she was squirting death out of her five barrels into the flank of the rushing stream of savages oh this bloody gun shouted a voice  shes jammed again the fierce metallic grunting had ceased and her crew were straining and hauling at the breech  this damned vertical feed cried an officer  the spanner wilsonthe spanner  stand to your cutlasses boys or theyre into us  his voice rose into a shriek as he ended for a shovelheaded spear had been buried in his chest  a second wave of dervishes lapped over the hillocks and burst upon the machinegun and the right front of the line  the sailors were overborne in an instant but the mallows with their fighting blood aflame met the yell of the moslem with an even wilder fiercer cry and dropped two hundred of them with a single pointblank volley  the howling leaping crew swerved away to the right and dashed on into the gap which had already been made for them  but c company had drawn no trigger to stop that fiery rush  the men leaned moodily upon their martinis  some had even thrown them upon the ground  conolly was talking fiercely to those about him  captain foley thrusting his way through the press rushed up to him with a revolver in his hand  this is your doing you villain he cried  if you raise your pistol captin your brains will be over your coat said a low voice at his side  he saw that several rifles were turned on him  the two subs had pressed forward and were by his side  what is it then he cried looking round from one fierce mutinous face to another  are you irishmen  are you soldiers  what are you here for but to fight for your country  england is no country of ours cried several  you are not fighting for england  you are fighting for ireland and for the empire of which it as part  a black curse on the impire shouted private mcquire throwing down his rifle  twas the impire that backed the man that druv me onto the roadside  may me hand stiffen before i draw trigger for it  whats the impire to us captain foley and whats the widdy to us ayther cried a voice  let the constabulary foight for her  ay be god theyd be better imployed than pullin a poor mans thatch about his ears  or shootin his brother as they did mine  it was the impire laid my groanin mother by the wayside  her son will rot before he upholds it and ye can put that in the chargesheet in the next coortmartial  in vain the three officers begged menaced persuaded  the square was still moving ever moving with the same bloody fight raging in its entrails  even while they had been speaking they had been shuffling backwards and the useless gardner with her slaughtered crew was already a good hundred yards from them  and the pace was accelerating the mass of men tormented and writhing was trying by a common instinct to reach some clearer ground where they could reform  three faces were still intact but the fourth had been caved in and badly mauled without its comrades being able to help it  the guards had met a fresh rush of the hadendowas and had blown back the tribesmen with a volley and the cavalry had ridden over another stream of them as they welled out of the gully  a litter of hamstrung horses and haggled men behind them showed that a spearman on his face among the bushes can show some sport to the man who charges him  but in spite of all the square was still reeling swiftly backwards trying to shake itself clear of this torment which clung to its heart  would it break or would it reform the lives of five regiments and the honour of the flag hung upon the answer  some at least were breaking  the c company of the mallows had lost all military order and was pushing back in spite of the haggard officers who cursed and shoved and prayed in the vain attempt to hold them  the captain and the subs were elbowed and jostled while the men crowded towards private conolly for their orders  the confusion had not spread for the other companies in the dust and smoke and turmoil had lost touch with their mutinous comrades  captain foley saw that even now there might be time to avert a disaster  think what you are doing man he yelled rushing towards the ringleader  there are a thousand irish in the square and they are dead men if we break  the words alone might have had little effect on the old moonlighter it is possible that in his scheming brain he had already planned how he was to club his irish together and lead them to the sea  but at that moment the arabs broke through the screen of camels which had fended them off  there was a struggle a screaming a mule rolled over a wounded man sprang up in a cacolet with a spear through him and then through the narrow gap surged a stream of naked savages mad with battle drunk with slaughter spotted and splashed with bloodblood dripping from their spears their arms their faces  their yells their bounds their crouching darting figures the horrid energy of their spearthrusts made them look like a blast of fiends from the pit  and were these the allies of ireland were these the men who were to strike for her against her enemies conollys soul rose up in loathing at the thought  he was a man of firm purpose and yet at the first sight of those howling fiends that purpose faltered and at the second it was blown to the winds  he saw a huge coalblack negro seize a shrieking cameldriver and saw at his throat with a knife  he saw a shockheaded tribesman plunge his great spear through the back of their own little bugler from millstreet  he saw a dozen deeds of bloodthe murder of the wounded the hacking of the unarmedand caught too in a glance the good wholesome faces of the facedabout rear rank of the marines the mallows too had faced about and in an instant conolly had thrown himself into the heart of c company striving with the officers to form the men up with their comrades  but the mischief had gone too far  the rank and file had no heart in their work  they had broken before and this last rush of murderous savages was a hard thing for broken men to stand against  they flinched from the furious faces and dripping forearms  why should they throw away their lives for a flag for which they cared nothing  why should their leader urge them to break and now shriek to them to reform they would not reform  they wanted to get to the sea and to safety he flung himself among them with outstretched arms with words of reason with shouts with gaspings  it was useless the tide was beyond his control  they were shredding out into the desert with their faces set for the coast  bhoys will ye stand for this screamed a voice  it was so ringing so strenuous that the breaking mallows glanced backwards  they were held by what they saw  private conolly had planted his riflestock downwards in a mimosa bush  from the fixed bayonet there fluttered a little green flag with the crownless harp  god knows for what black mutiny for what signal of revolt that flag had been treasured up within the corporals tunic  now its green wisp stood amid the rush while three proud regimental colours were reeling slowly backwards  what for the flag yelled the private  my hearts blood for it and mine and mine cried a score of voices god bless it  the flag boysthe flag  c company were rallying upon it  the stragglers clutched at each other and pointed  here mcquire flynn ohara ran the shoutings close on the flag  back to the flag  the three standards reeled backwards and the seething square strove for a clearer space where they could form their shattered ranks but c company grim and powderstained choked with enemies and falling fast still closed in on the little rebel ensign that flapped from the mimosa bush  it was a good halfhour before the square having disentangled itself from its difficulties and dressed its ranks began to slowly move forwards over the ground across which in its labour and anguish it had been driven  the long trail of wessex men and arabs showed but too clearly the path they had come  how many got into us stephen asked the general tapping his snuffbox  i should put them down at a thousand or twelve hundred sir  i did not see any get out again  what the devil were the wessex thinking about  the guards stood well though so did the mallows  colonel flanagan reports that his front flank company was cut off sir  why thats the company that was out of hand when we advanced  colonel flanagan reports sir that the company took the whole brunt of the attack and gave the square time to reform  tell the hussars to ride forward stephen said the general and try if they can see anything of them  theres no firing and i fear that the mallows will want to do some recruiting  let the square take ground by the right and then advance  but the sheik kadra of the hadendowas saw from his knoll that the men with the big hats had rallied and that they were coming back in the quiet business fashion of men whose work was before them  he took counsel with moussa the dervish and hussein the baggara and a woestruck man was he when he learned that the third of his men were safe in the moslem paradise  so having still some signs of victory to show he gave the word and the desert warriors flitted off unseen and unheard even as they had come  a red rock plateau a few hundred spears and remingtons and a plain which for the second time was strewn with slaughtered men was all that his days fighting gave to the english general  it was a squadron of hussars which came first to the spot where the rebel flag had waved  a dense litter of arab dead marked the place within the flag waved no longer but the rifle stood in the mimosa bush and round it with their wounds in front lay the fenian private and the silent ranks of the irishry  sentiment is not an english failing but the hussar captain raised his hilt in a salute as he rode past the bloodsoaked ring  the british general sent home dispatches to his government and so did the chief of the hadendowas though the style and manner differed somewhat in each    the sheik kadra of the hadendowa people to mohammed ahmed the chosen of allah homage and greeting began the latter  know by this that on the fourth day of this moon we gave battle to the kaffirs who call themselves inglees having with us the chief hussein with ten thousand of the faithful  by the blessing of allah we have broken them and chased them for a mile though indeed these infidels are different from the dogs of egypt and have slain very many of our men  yet we hope to smite them again ere the new moon be come to which end i trust that thou wilt send us a thousand dervishes from omdurman  in token of our victory i send you by this messenger a flag which we have taken  by the colour it might well seem to have belonged to those of the true faith but the kaffirs gave their blood freely to save it and so we think that though small it is very dear to them    captain sharkey                                 i   how the governor of saint kitts came home  when the great wars of the spanish succession had been brought to an end by the treaty of utrecht the vast number of privateers which had been fitted out by the contending parties found their occupation gone  some took to the more peaceful but less lucrative ways of ordinary commerce others were absorbed into the fishing fleets and a few of the more reckless hoisted the jolly rodger at the mizzen and the bloody flag at the main declaring a private war upon their own account against the whole human race  with mixed crews recruited from every nation they scoured the seas disappearing occasionally to careen in some lonely inlet or putting in for a debauch at some outlying port where they dazzled the inhabitants by their lavishness and horrified them by their brutalities  on the coromandel coast at madagascar in the african waters and above all in the west indian and american seas the pirates were a constant menace  with an insolent luxury they would regulate their depredations by the comfort of the seasons harrying new england in the summer and dropping south again to the tropical islands in the winter  they were the more to be dreaded because they had none of that discipline and restraint which made their predecessors the buccaneers both formidable and respectable  these ishmaels of the sea rendered an account to no man and treated their prisoners according to the drunken whim of the moment  flashes of grotesque generosity alternated with longer stretches of inconceivable ferocity and the skipper who fell into their hands might find himself dismissed with his cargo after serving as boon companion in some hideous debauch or might sit at his cabin table with his own nose and his lips served up with pepper and salt in front of him  it took a stout seaman in those days to ply his calling in the caribbean gulf  such a man was captain john scarrow of the ship morning star and yet he breathed a long sigh of relief when he heard the splash of the falling anchor and swung at his moorings within a hundred yards of the guns of the citadel of basseterre  st kitts was his final port of call and early next morning his bowsprit would be pointed for old england  he had had enough of those robberhaunted seas  ever since he had left maracaibo upon the main with his full lading of sugar and red pepper he had winced at every topsail which glimmered over the violet edge of the tropical sea  he had coasted up the windward islands touching here and there and assailed continually by stories of villainy and outrage  captain sharkey of the twentygun pirate barque happy delivery had passed down the coast and had littered it with gutted vessels and with murdered men  dreadful anecdotes were current of his grim pleasantries and of his inflexible ferocity  from the bahamas to the main his coalblack barque with the ambiguous name had been freighted with death and many things which are worse than death  so nervous was captain scarrow with his new fullrigged ship and her full and valuable lading that he struck out to the west as far as birds island to be out of the usual track of commerce  and yet even in those solitary waters he had been unable to shake off sinister traces of captain sharkey  one morning they had raised a single skiff adrift upon the face of the ocean  its only occupant was a delirious seaman who yelled hoarsely as they hoisted him aboard and showed a driedup tongue like a black and wrinkled fungus at the back of his mouth  water and nursing soon transformed him into the strongest and smartest sailor on the ship he was from marblehead in new england it seemed and was the sole survivor of a schooner which had been scuttled by the dreadful sharkey  for a week hiram evanson for that was his name had been adrift beneath a tropical sun  sharkey had ordered the mangled remains of his late captain to be thrown into the boat as provisions for the voyage but the seaman had at once committed it to the deep lest the temptation should be more than he could bear  he had lived upon his own huge frame until at the last moment the morning star had found him in that madness which is the precursor of such a death  it was no bad find for captain scarrow for with a shorthanded crew such a seaman as this big new englander was a prize worth having  he vowed that he was the only man whom captain sharkey had ever placed under an obligation  now that they lay under the guns of basseterre all danger from the pirate was at an end and yet the thought of him lay heavily upon the seamans mind as he watched the agents boat shooting out from the customhouse quay  ill lay you a wager morgan said he to the first mate that the agent will speak of sharkey in the first hundred words that pass his lips  well captain ill have you a silver dollar and chance it said the rough old bristol man beside him  the negro rowers shot the boat alongside and the linenclad steersman sprang up the ladder  welcome captain scarrow he cried have you heard about sharkey  the captain grinned at the mate  what devilry has he been up to now he asked  devilry  youve not heard then  why weve got him safe under lock and key at basseterre  he was tried last wednesday and he is to be hanged tomorrow morning  captain and mate gave a shout of joy which an instant later was taken up by the crew  discipline was forgotten as they scrambled up through the break of the poop to hear the news  the new englander was in the front of them with a radiant face turned up to heaven for he came of the puritan stock  sharkey to be hanged he cried  you dont know master agent if they lack a hangman do you  stand back cried the mate whose outraged sense of discipline was even stronger than his interest at the news  ill pay that dollar captain scarrow with the lightest heart that ever i paid a wager yet how came the villain to be taken  why as to that he became more than his own comrades could abide and they took such a horror of him that they would not have him on the ship so they marooned him upon the little mangles to the south of the mysteriosa bank and there he was found by a portobello trader who brought him in  there was talk of sending him to jamaica to be tried but our good little governor sir charles ewan would not hear of it hes my meat said he and i claim the cooking of it  if you can stay till tomorrow morning at ten youll see the joint swinging  i wish i could said the captain wistfully but i am sadly behind time now  i should start with the evening tide  that you cant do said the agent with decision  the governor is going back with you  the governor  yes  hes had a dispatch from government to return without delay the flyboat that brought it has gone on to virginia  so sir charles has been waiting for you as i told him you were due before the rains  well well cried the captain in some perplexity im a plain seaman and i dont know much of governors and baronets and their ways  i dont remember that i ever so much as spoke to one  but if its in king georges service and he asks a cast in the morning star as far as london ill do what i can for him  theres my own cabin he can have and welcome  as to the cooking its lobscouse and salmagundy six days in the week but he can bring his own cook aboard with him if he thinks our galley too rough for his taste  you need not trouble your mind captain scarrow said the agent sir charles is in weak health just now only clear of a quartan ague and it is likely he will keep his cabin most of the voyage dr larousse said that he would have sunk had the hanging of sharkey not put fresh life into him  he has a great spirit in him though and you must not blame him if he is somewhat short in his speech  he may say what he likes and do what he likes so long as he does not come athwart my hawse when i am working the ship said the captain he is governor of st kitts but i am governor of the morning star and by his leave i must weigh with the first tide for i owe a duty to my employer just as he does to king george  he can scarce be ready tonight for he has many things to set in order before he leaves  the early morning tide then  very good  i shall send his things aboard tonight and he will follow them tomorrow early if i can prevail upon him to leave st kitts without seeing sharkey do the rogues hornpipe  his own orders were instant so it may be that he will come at once  it is likely that dr larousse may attend him upon the journey  left to themselves the captain and mate made the best preparations which they could for their illustrious passenger  the largest cabin was turned out and adorned in his honour and orders were given by which barrels of fruit and some cases of wine should be brought off to vary the plain food of an oceangoing trader  in the evening the governors baggage began to arrivegreat ironbound antproof trunks and official tin packingcases with other strangeshaped packages which suggested the cocked hat or the sword within  and then there came a note with a heraldic device upon the big red seal to say that sir charles ewan made his compliments to captain scarrow and that he hoped to be with him in the morning as early as his duties and his infirmities would permit  he was as good as his word for the first grey of dawn had hardly begun to deepen into pink when he was brought alongside and climbed with some difficulty up the ladder  the captain had heard that the governor was an eccentric but he was hardly prepared for the curious figure who came limping feebly down his quarterdeck his steps supported by a thick bamboo cane  he wore a ramillies wig all twisted into little tails like a poodles coat and cut so low across the brow that the large green glasses which covered his eyes looked as if they were hung from it  a fierce beak of a nose very long and very thin cut the air in front of him  his ague had caused him to swathe his throat and chin with a broad linen cravat and he wore a loose damask powderinggown secured by a cord round the waist  as he advanced he carried his masterful nose high in the air but his head turned slowly from side to side in the helpless manner of the purblind and he called in a high querulous voice for the captain  you have my things he asked  yes sir charles  have you wine aboard  i have ordered five cases sir  and tobacco  there is a keg of trinidad  you play a hand at picquet  passably well sir  then anchor up and to sea  there was a fresh westerly wind so by the time the sun was fairly through the morning haze the ship was hull down from the islands the decrepit governor still limpid the deck with one guiding hand upon the quarter rail  you are on government service now captain said he  they are counting the days till i come to westminster i promise you  have you all that she will carry  every inch sir charles  keep her so if you blow the sails out of her  i fear captain scarrow that you will find a blind and broken man a poor companion for your voyage  i am honoured in enjoying your excellencys society said the captain but i am sorry that your eyes should be so afflicted  yes indeed  it is the cursed glare of the sun on the white streets of basseterre which has gone far to burn them out  i had heard also that you had been plagued by a quartan ague  yes i have had a pyrexy which has reduced me much  we had set aside a cabin for your surgeon  ah the rascal  there was no budging him for he has a snug business amongst the merchants  but hark  he raised his ringcovered band in the air  from far astern there came the low deep thunder of cannon  it is from the island cried the captain in astonishment  can it be a signal for us to put back  the governor laughed  you have heard that sharkey the pirate is to be hanged this morning  i ordered the batteries to salute when the rascal was kicking his last so that i might know of it out at sea theres an end of sharkey  theres an end of sharkey cried the captain and the crew took up the cry as they gathered in little knots upon the deck and stared back at the low purple line of the vanishing land  it was a cheering omen for their start across the western ocean and the invalid governor found himself a popular man on board for it was generally understood that but for his insistence upon an immediate trial and sentence the villain might have played upon some more venal judge and so escaped  at dinner that day sir charles gave many anecdotes of the deceased pirate and so affable was he and so skilful in adapting his conversation to men of lower degree that captain mate and governor smoked their long pipes and drank their claret as three good comrades should  and what figure did sharkey cut in the dock asked the captain  he is a man of some presence said the governor  i had always understood that he was an ugly sneering devil remarked the mate  well i dare say he could look ugly upon occasions said the governor  i have heard a new bedford whaleman say that he could not forget his eyes said captain scarrow  they were of the lightest filmy blue with redrimmed lids  was that not so sir charles  alas my own eyes will not permit me to know much of those of others but i remember now that the adjutantgeneral said that he had such an eye as you describe and added that the jury was so foolish as to be visibly discomposed when it was turned upon them  it is well for them that he is dead for he was a man who would never forget an injury and if he had laid hands upon any one of them he would have stuffed him with straw and hung him for a figurehead  the idea seemed to amuse the governor for he broke suddenly into a high neighing laugh and the two seamen laughed also but not so heartily for they remembered that sharkey was not the last pirate who sailed the western seas and that as grotesque a fate might come to be their own  another bottle was broached to drink to a pleasant voyage and the governor would drink just one other on the top of it so that the seamen were glad at last to stagger offthe one to his watch and the other to his bunk  but when after his four hours spell the mate came down again he was amazed to see the governor in his ramillies wig his glasses and his powderinggown still seated sedately at the lonely table with his reeking pipe and six black bottles by his side  i have drunk with the governor of st kitts when he was sick said he and god forbid that i should ever try to keep pace with him when he is well  the voyage of the morning star was a successful one and in about three weeks she was at the mouth of the british channel  from the first day the infirm governor had begun to recover his strength and before they were halfway across the atlantic he was save only for his eyes as well as any man upon the ship  those who uphold the nourishing qualities of wine might point to him in triumph for never a night passed that he did not repeat the performance of his first one  and yet be would be out upon deck in the early morning as fresh and brisk as the best of them peering about with his weak eyes and asking questions about the sails and the rigging for he was anxious to learn the ways of the sea  and he made up for the deficiency of his eyes by obtaining leave from the captain that the new england seamanhe who had been cast away in the boatshould lead him about and above all that he should sit beside him when he played cards and count the number of the pips for unaided he could not tell the king from the knave  it was natural that this evanson should do the governor willing service since the one was the victim of the vile sharkey and the other was his avenger  one could see that it was a pleasure to the big american to lend his arm to the invalid and at night he would stand with all respect behind his chair in the cabin and lay his great stubnailed forefinger upon the card which he should play  between them there was little in the pockets either of captain scarrow or of morgan the first mate by the time they sighted the lizard  and it was not long before they found that all they had heard of the high temper of sir charles ewan fell short of the mark  at a sign of opposition or a word of argument his chin would shoot out from his cravat his masterful nose would be cocked at a higher and more insolent angle and his bamboo cane would whistle up over his shoulders he cracked it once over the head of the carpenter when the man had accidentally jostled him upon the deck  once too when there was some grumbling and talk of a mutiny over the state of the provisions he was of opinion that they should not wait for the dogs to rise but that they should march forward and set upon them until they had trounced the devilment out of them  give me a knife and a bucket he cried with an oath and could hardly be withheld from setting forth alone to deal with the spokesman of the seamen  captain scarrow had to remind him that though he might be only answerable to himself at st kitts killing became murder upon the high seas  in politics he was as became his official position a stout prop of the house of hanover and he swore in his cups that he had never met a jacobite without pistolling him where he stood  yet for all his vapouring and his violence he was so good a companion with such a stream of strange anecdote and reminiscence that scarrow and morgan had never known a voyage pass so pleasantly  and then at length came the last day when after passing the island they had struck land again at the high white cliffs at beachy head  as evening fell the ship lay rolling in an oily calm a league off from winchelsea with the long dark snout of dungeness jutting out in front of her  next morning they would pick up their pilot at the foreland and sir charles might meet the kings ministers at westminster before the evening  the boatswain had the watch and the three friends were met for a last turn of cards in the cabin the faithful american still serving as eyes to the governor  there was a good stake upon the table for the sailors had tried on this last night to win their losses back from their passenger  suddenly he threw his cards down and swept all the money into the pocket of his longflapped silken waistcoat  the games mine said he  heh sir charles not so fast cried captain scarrow you have not played out the hand and we are not the losers  sink you for a liar said the governor  i tell you i have played out the hand and that you are a loser  he whipped off his wig and his glasses as he spoke and there was a high bald forehead and a pair of shifty blue eyes with the red rims of a bull terrier  good god cried the mate  its sharkey  the two sailors sprang from their seats but the big american castaway had put his huge back against the cabin door and he held a pistol in each of his hands  the passenger had also laid a pistol upon the scattered cards in front of him and he burst into his high neighing laugh  captain sharkey is the name gentlemen said he and this is roaring ned galloway the quartermaster of the happy delivery we made it hot and so they marooned us me on a dry tortuga cay and him in an oarless boat  you dogsyou poor fond waterhearted dogs we hold you at the end of our pistols  you may shoot or you may not cried scarrow striking his hand upon the breast of his frieze jacket  if its my last breath sharkey i tell you that you are a bloody rogue and miscreant with a halter and hellfire in store for you  theres a man of spirit and one of my own kidney and hes going to make a very pretty death of it cried sharkey  theres no one aft save the man at the wheel so you may keep your breath for youll need it soon  is the dinghy astern ned  ay ay captain  and the other boats scuttled  i bored them all in three places  then we shall have to leave you captain scarrow  you look as if you hadnt quite got your bearings yet  is there anything youd like to ask me  i believe youre the devil himself cried the captain  where is the governor of st kitts  when last i saw him his excellency was in bed with his throat cut when i broke prison i learnt from my friendsfor captain sharkey has those who love him in every portthat the governor was starting for europe under a master who had never seen him  i climbed his verandah and i paid him the little debt that i owed him  then i came aboard you with such of his things as i had need of and a pair of glasses to hide these telltale eyes of mine and i have ruffled it as a governor should  now ned you can get to work upon them  help help watch ahoy yelled the mate  but the butt of the pirates pistol crashed down on his head and he dropped like a pithed ox scarrow rushed for the door but the sentinel clapped his hand over his mouth and threw his other arm round his waist  no use master scarrow said sharkey  let us see you go down on your knees and beg for your life  ill see you cried scarrow shaking his mouth clear  twist his arm round ned  now will you  no not if you twist it off  put an inch of your knife into him  you may put six inches and then i wont  sink me but i like his spirit cried sharkey  put your knife in your pocket ned  youve saved your skin scarrow and its a pity so stout a man should not take to the only trade where a pretty fellow can pick up a living  you must be born for no common death scarrow since you have lain at my mercy and lived to tell the story  tie him up ned  to the stove captain  tut tut theres a fire in the stove  none of your rover tricks ned galloway unless they are called for or ill let you know which of us two is captain and which is quartermaster  make him fast to the table  nay i thought you meant to roast him said the quartermaster you surely do not mean to let him go  if you and i were marooned on a bahama cay ned galloway it is still for me to command and for you to obey  sink you for a villain do you dare to question my orders  nay nay captain sharkey not so hot sir said the quartermaster and lifting scarrow like a child he laid him on the table  with the quick dexterity of a seaman he tied his spreadeagled hands and feet with a rope which was passed underneath and gagged him securely with the long cravat which used to adorn the chin of the governor of st kitts  now captain scarrow we must take our leave of you said the pirate if i had half a dozen of my brisk boys at my heels i should have had your cargo and your ship but roaring ned could not find a foremast hand with the spirit of a mouse  i see there are some small craft about and we shall get one of them  when captain sharkey has a boat he can get a smack when he has a smack he can get a brig when he has a brig he can get a barque and when he has a barque hell soon have a fullrigged ship of his ownso make haste into london town or i may be coming back after all for the morning star  captain scarrow heard the key turn in the lock as they left the cabin then as he strained at his bonds he heard their footsteps pass up the companion and along the quarterdeck to where the dinghy hung in the stern  then still struggling and writhing he heard the creak of the falls and the splash of the boat in the water  in a mad fury he tore and dragged at his ropes until at last with flayed wrists and ankles he rolled from the table sprang over the dead mate kicked his way through the closed door and rushed hatless on to the deck  ahoy peterson armitage  wilson he screamed  cutlasses and pistols  clear away the longboat  clear away the gig  sharkey the pirate is in yonder dinghy   whistle up the larboard watch bosun and tumble into the boats all hands  down splashed the longboat and down splashed the gig but in an instant the coxswains and crews were swarming up the falls on to the deck once more  the boats are scuttled they cried  they are leaking like a sieve  the captain gave a bitter curse  he had been beaten and outwitted at every point  above was a cloudless starlit sky with neither wind nor the promise of it  the sails flapped idly in the moonlight  far away lay a fishingsmack with the men clustering over their net  close to them was the little dinghy dipping and lifting over the shining swell  they are dead men cried the captain  a shout all together boys to warn them of their danger  but it was too late  at that very moment the dinghy shot into the shadow of the fishingboat  there were two rapid pistolshots a scream and then another pistolshot followed by silence  the clustering fishermen had disappeared  and then suddenly as the first puffs of a landbreeze came out from the sussex shore the boom swung out the mainsail filled and the little craft crept out with her nose to the atlantic                                 ii   the dealings of captain sharkey with stephen craddock  careening was a very necessary operation for the old pirate  on his superior speed he depended both for overhauling the trader and escaping the manofwar  but it was impossible to retain his sailing qualities unless he periodicallyonce a year at the leastcleared his vessels bottom from the long trailing plants and crusting barnacles which gather so rapidly in the tropical seas  for this purpose he lightened his vessel thrust her into some narrow inlet where she would be left high and dry at low water fastened blocks and tackles to her masts to pull her over on to her bilge and then scraped her thoroughly from rudderpost to cutwater  during the weeks which were thus occupied the ship was of course defenceless but on the other hand she was unapproachable by anything heavier than an empty hull and the place for careening was chosen with an eye to secrecy so that there was no great danger  so secure did the captains feel that it was not uncommon for them at such times to leave their ships under a sufficient guard and to start off in the longboat either upon a sporting expedition or more frequently upon a visit to some outlying town where they burned the heads of the women by their swaggering gallantry or broached pipes of wine in the market square with a threat to pistol all who would not drink with them  sometimes they would even appear in cities of the size of charleston and walk the streets with their clattering sidearmsan open scandal to the whole lawabiding colony  such visits were not always paid with impunity  it was one of them for example which provoked lieutenant maynard to hack off blackbeards head and to spear it upon the end of his bowsprit  but as a rule the pirate ruffled and bullied and drabbed without let or hindrance until it was time for him to go back to his ship once more  there was one pirate however who never crossed even the skirts of civilisation and that was the sinister sharkey of the barque happy delivery  it may have been from his morose and solitary temper or as is more probable that he knew that his name upon the coast was such that outraged humanity would against all odds have thrown themselves upon him but never once did he show his face in a settlement  when his ship was laid up he would leave her under the charge of ned gallowayher new england quartermasterand would take long voyages in his boat sometimes it was said for the purpose of burying his share of the plunder and sometimes to shoot the wild oxen of hispaniola which when dressed and barbecued provided provisions for his next voyage  in the latter case the barque would come round to some prearranged spot to pick him up and take on board what he had shot  there had always been a hope in the islands that sharkey might be taken on one of these occasions and at last there came news to kingston which seemed to justify an attempt upon him  it was brought by an elderly logwoodcutter who had fallen into the pirates hands and in some freak of drunken benevolence had been allowed to get away with nothing worse than a slit nose and a drubbing  his account was recent and definite the happy delivery was careening at torbec on the southwest of hispaniola  sharkey with four men was buccaneering on the outlying island of la vache  the blood of a hundred murdered crews was calling out for vengeance and now at last it seemed as if it might not call in vain  sir edward compton the highnosed redfaced governor sitting in solemn conclave with the commandant and the head of the council was sorely puzzled in his mind as to how he should use this chance there was no manofwar nearer than jamestown and she was a clumsy old flyboat which could neither overhaul the pirate on the seas nor reach her in a shallow inlet  there were forts and artillerymen both at kingston and port royal but no soldiers available for an expedition  a private venture might be fitted outand there were many who had a bloodfeud with sharkeybut what could a private venture do the pirates were numerous and desperate  as to taking sharkey and his four companions that of course would be easy if they could get at them but how were they to get at them on a large wellwooded island like la vache full of wild hills and impenetrable jungles  a reward was offered to whoever could find a solution and that brought a man to the front who had a singular plan and was himself prepared to carry it out  stephen craddock had been that most formidable person the puritan gone wrong  sprung from a decent salem family his illdoing seemed to be a recoil from the austerity of their religion and he brought to vice all the physical strength and energy with which the virtues of his ancestors had endowed him  he was ingenious fearless and exceedingly tenacious of purpose so that when he was still young his name became notorious upon the american coast  he was the same craddock who was tried for his life in virginia for the slaying of the seminole chief and though he escaped it was well known that he had corrupted the witnesses and bribed the judge  afterwards as a slaver and even as it was hinted as a pirate he had left an evil name behind him in the bight of benin  finally he had returned to jamaica with a considerable fortune and had settled down to a life of sombre dissipation  this was the man gaunt austere and dangerous who now waited upon the governor with a plan for the extirpation of sharkey  sir edward received him with little enthusiasm for in spite of some rumours of conversion and reformation he had always regarded him as an infected sheep who might taint the whole of his little flock  craddock saw the governors mistrust under his thin veil of formal and restrained courtesy  youve no call to fear me sir said he im a changed man from what youve known  ive seen the light again of late after losing sight of it for many a black year  it was through the ministration of the rev john simons of our own people  sir if your spirit should be in need of quickening you would find a very sweet savour in his discourse  the governor cocked his episcopalian nose at him  you came here to speak of sharkey master craddock said he  the man sharkey is a vessel of wrath said craddock  his wicked horn has been exalted over long and it is borne in upon me that if i can cut him off and utterly destroy him it will be a goodly deed and one which may atone for many backslidings in the past  a plan has been given to me whereby i may encompass his destruction  the governor was keenly interested for there was a grim and practical air about the mans freckled face which showed that he was in earnest after all he was a seaman and a fighter and if it were true that he was eager to atone for his past no better man could be chosen for the business  this will be a dangerous task master craddock said he  if i meet my death at it it may be that it will cleanse the memory of an illspent life  i have much to atone for  the governor did not see his way to contradict him  what was your plan he asked  you have heard that sharkeys barque the happy delivery came from this very port of kingston  it belonged to mr codrington and it was taken by sharkey who scuttled his own sloop and moved into her because she was faster said sir edward  yes but it may be that you have lever heard that mr codrington has a sister ship the white rose which lies even now in the harbour and which is so like the pirate that if it were not for a white paint line none could tell them apart  ah and what of that asked the governor keenly with the air of one who is just on the edge of an idea  by the help of it this man shall be delivered into our hands  and how  i will paint out the streak upon the white rose and make it in all things like the happy delivery  then i will set sail for the island of la vache where this man is slaying the wild oxen  when he sees me he will surely mistake me for his own vessel which he is awaiting and he will come on board to his own undoing  it was a simple plan and yet it seemed to the governor that it might be effective  without hesitation he gave craddock permission to carry it out and to take any steps he liked in order to further the object which he had in view  sir edward was not very sanguine for many attempts had been made upon sharkey and their results had shown that he was as cunning as he was ruthless  but this gaunt puritan with the evil record was cunning aid ruthless also  the contest of wits between two such men as sharkey and craddock appealed to the governors acute sense of sport and though he was inwardly convinced that the chances were against him he backed his man with the same loyalty which he would have shown to his horse or his cock  haste was above all things necessary for upon any day the careening might be finished and the pirates out at sea once more  but there was not very much to do and there were many willing hands to do it so the second day saw the white rose beating out for the open sea  there were many seamen in the port who knew the lines and rig of the pirate barque and not one of them could see the slightest difference in this counterfeit  her white side line had been painted out her masts and yards were smoked to give them the dingy appearance of the weatherbeaten rover and a large diamondshaped patch was let into her foretopsail  her crew were volunteers many of them being men who had sailed with stephen craddock beforethe mate joshua hird an old slaver had been his accomplice in many voyages and came now at the bidding of his chief  the avenging barque sped across the caribbean sea and at the sight of that patched topsail the little craft which they met flew left and right like frightened trout in a pool  on the fourth evening point abacou bore five miles to the north and east of them  on the fifth they were at anchor in the bay of tortoises at the island of la vache where sharkey and his four men had been hunting  it was a wellwooded place with the palms and underwood growing down to the thin crescent of silver sand which skirted the shore  they had hoisted the black flag and the red pennant but no answer came from the shore  craddock strained his eyes hoping every instant to see a boat shoot out to them with sharkey seated in the sheets  but the night passed away and a day and yet another night without any sign of the men whom they were endeavouring to trap  it looked as if they were already gone  on the second morning craddock went ashore in search of some proof whether sharkey and his men were still upon the island  what he found reassured him greatly  close to the shore was a boucan of green wood such as was used for preserving the meat and a great store of barbecued strips of oxflesh was hung upon lines all round it  the pirate ship had not taken off her provisions and therefore the hunters were still upon the island  why had they not shown themselves was it that they had detected that this was not their own ship  or was it that they were hunting in the interior of the island and were not on the lookout for a ship yet craddock was still hesitating between the two alternatives when a carib indian came down with information  the pirates were in the island he said and their camp was a days march from the sea  they had stolen his wife and the marks of their stripes were still pink upon his brown back  their enemies were his friends and he would lead them to where they lay  craddock could not have asked for anything better so early next morning with a small party armed to the teeth he set off under the guidance of the carib  all day they struggled through brushwood and clambered over rocks pushing their way further and further into the desolate heart of the island  here and there they found traces of the hunters the bones of a slain ox or the marks of feet in a morass and once towards evening it seemed to some of them that they heard the distant rattle of guns  that night they spent under the trees and pushed on again with the earliest light  about noon they came to the huts of bark which the carib told them were the camp of the hunters but they were silent and deserted  no doubt their occupants were away at the hunt and would return in the evening so craddock and his men lay in ambush in the brushwood around them  but no one came and another night was spent in the forest  nothing more could be done and it seemed to craddock that after the two days absence it was time that he returned to his ship once more  the return journey was less difficult as they had already blazed a path for themselves  before evening they found themselves once more at the bay of palms and saw their ship riding at anchor where they had left her  their boat and oars had been hauled up among the bushes so they launched it and pulled out to the barque  no luck then cried joshua hird the mate looking down with a pale face from the poop  his camp was empty but he may come down to us yet said craddock with his hand on the ladder  somebody upon deck began to laugh  i think said the mate that these men had better stay in the boat  why so  if you will come aboard sir you will understand it  he spoke in a curious hesitating fashion  the blood flushed to craddocks gaunt face  how is this master hird he cried springing up the side  what mean you by giving orders to my boats crew  but as he passed over the bulwarks with one foot upon the deck and one knee upon the rail a towbearded man whom he had never before observed aboard his vessel grabbed suddenly at his pistol  craddock clutched at the fellows wrist but at the same instant his mate snatched the cutlass from his side  what roguery is this shouted craddock looking furiously around him but the crew stood in knots about the deck laughing and whispering amongst themselves without showing any desire to go to his assistance even in that hurried glance craddock noticed that they were dressed in the most singular manner with long ridingcoats fullskirted velvet gowns and coloured ribands at their knees more like men of fashion than seamen  as he looked at their grotesque figures he struck his brow with his clenched fist to be sure that he was awake  the deck seemed to be much dirtier than when he had left it and there were strange sunblackened faces turned upon him from every side  not one of them did he know save only joshua hird  had the ship been captured in his absence  were these sharkeys men who were around him  at the thought he broke furiously away and tried to climb over to his boat but a dozen hands were on him in an instant and he was pushed aft through the open door of his own cabin  and it was all different to the cabin which he had left  the floor was different the ceiling was different the furniture was different his had been plain and austere  this was sumptuous and yet dirty hung with rare velvet curtains splashed with winestains and panelled with costly woods which were pocked with pistolmarks  on the table was a great chart of the caribbean sea and beside it with compasses in his hand sat a cleanshaven palefaced man with a fur cap and a claretcoloured coat of damask  craddock turned white under his freckles as he looked upon the long thin highnostrilled nose and the redrimmed eyes which were turned upon him with the fixed humorous gaze of the master player who has left his opponent without a move sharkey cried craddock  sharkeys thin lips opened and he broke into his high sniggering laugh  you fool he cried and leaning over he stabbed craddocks shoulder again and again with his compasses  you poor dullwitted fool would you match yourself against me  it was not the pain of the wounds but it was the contempt in sharkeys voice which turned craddock into a savage madman  he flew at the pirate roaring with rage striking kicking writhing foaming it took six men to drag him down on to the floor amidst the splintered remains of the tableand not one of the six who did not bear the prisoners mark upon him  but sharkey still surveyed him with the same contemptuous eye  from outside there came the crash of breaking wood and the clamour of startled voices  what is that asked sharkey  they have stove the boat with cold shot and the men are in the water  let them stay there said the pirate  now craddock you know where you are  you are aboard my ship the happy delivery and you lie at my mercy  i knew you for a stout seaman you rogue before you took to this longshore canting  your hands then were no cleaner than my own will you sign articles as your mate has done and join us or shall i heave you over to follow your ships company  where is my ship asked craddock  scuttled in the bay  and the hands  in the bay too  then im for the bay also  hock him and heave him over said sharkey  many rough hands had dragged craddock out upon deck and galloway the quartermaster had already drawn his hanger to cripple him when sharkey came hurrying from his cabin with an eager face  we can do better with the hound he cried  sink me if it is not a rare plan  throw him into the sailroom with the irons on and do you come here quartermaster that i may tell you what i have in my mind  so craddock bruised and wounded in soul and body was thrown into the dark sailroom so fettered that he could not stir hand or foot but his northern blood was running strong in his veins and his grim spirit aspired only to make such an ending as might go some way towards atoning for the evil of his life  all night he lay in the curve of the bilge listening to the rush of the water and the straining of the timbers which told him that the ship was at sea and driving fast  in the early morning someone came crawling to him in the darkness over the heap of sails  heres rum and biscuits said the voice of his late mate  its at the risk of my life master craddock that i bring them to you  it was you who trapped me and caught me as in a snare cried craddock how shall you answer for what you have done  what i did i did with the point of a knife betwixt my bladebones  god forgive you for a coward joshua hird  how came you into their hands  why master craddock the pirate ship came back from its careening upon the very day that you left us  they laid us aboard and shorthanded as we were with the best of the men ashore with you we could offer but a poor defence  some were cut down and they were the happiest  the others were killed afterwards  as to me i saved my life by signing on with them  and they scuttled my ship  they scuttled her and then sharkey and his men who had been watching us from the brushwood came off to the ship  his mainyard had been cracked and fished last voyage so he had suspicions of us seeing that ours was whole  then he thought of laying the same trap for you which you had set for him  craddock groaned  how came i not to see that fished mainyard he muttered  but whither are we bound  we are running north and west  north and west  then we are heading back towards jamaica  with an eightknot wind  have you heard what they mean to do with me  i have not heard  if you would but sign the articles  enough joshua hird  i have risked my soul too often  as you wish  i have done what i could  farewell  all that night and the next day the happy delivery ran before the easterly trades and stephen craddock lay in the dark of the sailroom working patiently at his wristirons  one he had slipped off at the cost of a row of broken and bleeding knuckles but do what he would he could not free the other and his ankles were securely fastened from hour to hour he heard the swish of the water and knew that the barque must be driving with all set in front of the trade wind  in that case they must be nearly back again to jamaica by now  what plan could sharkey have in his head and what use did he hope to make of him craddock set his teeth and vowed that if he had once been a villain from choice he would at least never be one by compulsion  on the second morning craddock became aware that sail had been reduced in the vessel and that she was tacking slowly with a light breeze on her beam  the varying slope of the sail room and the sounds from the deck told his practised senses exactly what she was doing  the short reaches showed him that she was manoeuvring near shore and making for some definite point  if so she must have reached jamaica  but what could she be doing there  and then suddenly there was a burst of hearty cheering from the deck and then the crash of a gun above his head and then the answering booming of guns from far over the water  craddock sat up and strained his ears  was the ship in action  only the one gun had been fired and though many had answered there were none of the crashings which told of a shot coming home  then if it was not an action it must be a salute but who would salute sharkey the pirate  it could only be another pirate ship which would do so  so craddock lay back again with a groan and continued to work at the manacle which still held his right wrist but suddenly there came the shuffling of steps outside and he had hardly time to wrap the loose links round his free hand when the door was unbolted and two pirates came in  got your hammer carpenter asked one whom craddock recognised as the big quartermaster  knock off his leg shackles then  better leave the braceletshes safer with them on  with hammer and chisel the carpenter loosened the irons  what are you going to do with me asked craddock  come on deck and youll see  the sailor seized him by the arm and dragged him roughly to the foot of the companion  above him was a square of blue sky cut across by the mizzen gaff with the colours flying at the peak  but it was the sight of those colours which struck the breath from stephen craddocks lips for there were two of them and the british ensign was flying above the jolly rodgerthe honest flag above that of the rogue  for an instant craddock stopped in amazement but a brutal push from the pirates behind drove him up the companion ladder  as he stepped out upon deck his eyes turned up to the main and there again were the british colours flying above the red pennant and all the shrouds and rigging were garlanded with streamers  had the ship been taken then  but that was impossible for there were the pirates clustering in swarms along the port bulwarks and waving their hats joyously in the air  most prominent of all was the renegade mate standing on the focsle head and gesticulating wildly  craddock looked over the side to see what they were cheering at and then in a flash he saw how critical was the moment  on the port bow and about a mile off lay the white houses and forts of port royal with flags breaking out everywhere over their roofs right ahead was the opening of the palisades leading to the town of kingston  not more than a quarter of a mile off was a small sloop working out against the very slight wind  the british ensign was at her peak and her rigging was all decorated  on her deck could be seen a dense crowd of people cheering and waving their hats and the gleam of scarlet told that there were officers of the garrison among them  in an instant with the quick perception of a man of action craddock saw through it all  sharkey with that diabolical cunning and audacity which were among his main characteristics was simulating the part which craddock would himself have played had he come back victorious  it was in his honour that the salutes were firing and the flags flying it was to welcome him that this ship with the governor the commandant and the chiefs of the island were approaching  in another ten minutes they would all be under the guns of the happy delivery and sharkey would have won the greatest stake that ever a pirate played for yet  bring him forward cried the pirate captain as craddock appeared between the carpenter and the quartermaster  keep the ports closed but clear away the port guns and stand by for a broadside  another two cable lengths and we have them  they are edging away said the boatswain  i think they smell us  thats soon set right said sharkey turning his filmy eyes upon craddock  stand there youright there where they can recognise you with your hand on the guy and wave your hat to them  quick or your brains will be over your coat  put an inch of your knife into him ned now will you wave your hat  try him again then  hey shoot him stop him  but it was too late  relying upon the manacles the quartermaster had taken his hands for a moment off craddocks arm  in that instant he had flung off the carpenter and amid a spatter of pistol bullets had sprung the bulwarks and was swimming for his life  he had been hit and hit again but it takes many pistols to kill a resolute and powerful man who has his mind set upon doing something before he dies  he was a strong swimmer and in spite of the red trail which he left in the water behind him he was rapidly increasing his distance from the pirate  give me a musket cried sharkey with a savage oath  he was a famous shot and his iron nerves never failed him in an emergency  the dark head appearing on the crest of a roller and then swooping down on the other side was already halfway to the sloop sharkey dwelt long upon his aim before he fired  with the crack of the gun the swimmer reared himself up in the water waved his hands in a gesture of warning and roared out in a voice which rang over the bay then as the sloop swung round her headsails and the pirate fired an impotent broadside stephen craddock smiling grimly in his death agony sank slowly down to that golden couch which glimmered far beneath him                                 iii   how copley banks slew captain sharkey  the buccaneers were something higher than a mere band of marauders they were a floating republic with laws usages and discipline of their own  in their endless and remorseless quarrel with the spaniards they had some semblance of right upon their side their bloody harryings of the cities of the main were not more barbarous than the inroads of spain upon the netherlandsor upon the caribs in these same american lands  the chief of the buccaneers were he english or french a morgan or a granmont was still a responsible person whose country might countenance him or even praise him so long as he refrained from any deed which might shock the leathery seventeenthcentury conscience too outrageously  some of them were touched with religion and it is still remembered how sawkins threw the dice overboard upon the sabbath and daniel pistolled a man before the altar for irreverence  but there came a day when the fleets of the buccaneers no longer mustered at the tortugas and the solitary and outlawed pirate took their place  yet even with him the tradition of restraint and of discipline still lingered and among the early pirates the avorys the englands and the robertses there remained some respect for human sentiment  they were more dangerous to the merchant than to the seaman but they in turn were replaced by more savage and desperate men who frankly recognised that they would get no quarter in their war with the human race and who swore that they would give as little as they got of their histories we know little that is trustworthy  they wrote no memoirs and left no trace save an occasional blackened and bloodstained derelict adrift upon the face of the atlantic their deeds could only be surmised from the long roll of ships who never made their port  searching the records of history it is only here and there in an oldworld trial that the veil that shrouds them seems for an instant to be lifted and we catch a glimpse of some amazing and grotesque brutality behind  such was the breed of ned low of gow the scotchman and of the infamous sharkey whose coalblack barque the happy delivery was known from the newfoundland banks to the mouths of the orinoco as the dark forerunner of misery and of death  there were many men both among the islands and on the main who had a blood feud with sharkey but not one who had suffered more bitterly than copley banks of kingston  banks had been one of the leading sugar merchants of the west indies  he was a man of position a member of the council the husband of a percival and the cousin of the governor of virginia  his two sons had been sent to london to be educated and their mother had gone over to bring them back  on their return voyage the ship the duchess of cornwall fell into the hands of sharkey and the whole family met with an infamous death  copley banks said little when he heard the news but he sank into a morose and enduring melancholy  he neglected his business avoided his friends and spent much of his time in the low taverns of the fishermen and seamen  there amidst riot and devilry he sat silently puffing at his pipe with a set face and a smouldering eye  it was generally supposed that his misfortunes had shaken his wits and his old friends looked at him askance for the company which he kept was enough to bar him from honest men  from time to time there came rumours of sharkey over the sea  sometimes it was from some schooner which had seen a great flame upon the horizon and approaching to offer help to the burning ship had fled away at the sight of the sleek black barque lurking like a wolf near a mangled sheep  sometimes it was a frightened trader which had come tearing in with her canvas curved like a ladys bodice because she had seen a patched foretopsail rising slowly above the violet waterline sometimes it was from a coaster which had found a waterless bahama cay littered with sundried bodies  once there came a man who had been mate of a guineaman and who had escaped from the pirates hands  he could not speakfor reasons which sharkey could best supplybut he could write and he did write to the very great interest of copley banks for hours they sat together over the map and the dumb man pointed here and there to outlying reefs and tortuous inlets while his companion sat smoking in silence with his unvarying face and his fiery eyes  one morning some two years after his misfortunes mr copley banks strode into his own office with his old air of energy and alertness the manager stared at him in surprise for it was months since he had shown any interest in business  good morning mr banks said he  good morning freeman  i see that ruffling harry is in the bay  yes sir she clears for the windward islands on wednesday  i have other plans for her freeman  i have determined upon a slaving venture to whydah  but her cargo is ready sir  then it must come out again freeman  my mind is made up and the ruffling harry must go slaving to whydah  all argument and persuasion were vain so the manager had dolefully to clear the ship once more  and then copley banks began to make preparations for his african voyage  it appeared that he relied upon force rather than barter for the filling of his hold for he carried none of those showy trinkets which savages love but the brig was fitted with eight ninepounder guns and racks full of muskets and cutlasses the aftersailroom next the cabin was transformed into a powder magazine and she carried as many round shot as a wellfound privateer water and provisions were shipped for a long voyage  but the preparation of his ships company was most surprising  it made freeman the manager realise that there was truth in the rumour that his master had taken leave of his senses  for under one pretext or another he began to dismiss the old and tried hands who had served the firm for years and in their place he embarked the scum of the portmen whose reputations were so vile that the lowest crimp would have been ashamed to furnish them  there was birthmark sweetlocks who was known to have been present at the killing of the logwoodcutters so that his hideous scarlet disfigurement was put down by the fanciful as being a red afterglow from that great crime  he was first mate and under him was israel martin a little sunwilted fellow who had served with howell davies at the taking of cape coast castle  the crew were chosen from amongst those whom banks had met and known in their own infamous haunts and his own tablesteward was a haggardfaced man who gobbled at you when he tried to talk  his beard had been shaved and it was impossible to recognise him as the same man whom sharkey had placed under the knife and who had escaped to tell his experiences to copley banks  these doings were not unnoticed nor yet uncommented upon in the town of kingston  the commandant of the troopsmajor harvey of the artillerymade serious representations to the governor  she is not a trader but a small warship said he  i think it would be as well to arrest copley banks and to seize the vessel  what do you suspect asked the governor who was a slowwitted man broken down with fevers and port wine  i suspect said the soldier that it is stede bonnet over again  now stede bonnet was a planter of high reputation and religious character who from some sudden and overpowering freshet of wildness in his blood had given up everything in order to start off pirating in the caribbean sea  the example was a recent one and it had caused the utmost consternation in the islands   governors had before now been accused of being in league with pirates and of receiving commissions upon their plunder so that any want of vigilance was open to a sinister construction  well major harvey said he i am vastly sorry to do anything which may offend my friend copley banks for many a time have my knees been under his mahogany but in face of what you say there is no choice for me but to order you to board the vessel and to satisfy yourself as to her character and destination  so at one in the morning major harvey with a launchful of his soldiers paid a surprise visit to the ruffling harry with the result that they picked up nothing more solid than a hempen cable floating at the moorings  it had been slipped by the brig whose owner had scented danger  she had already passed the palisades and was beating out against  the northeast trades on a course for the windward passage  when upon the next morning the brig had left morant point a mere haze upon the southern horizon the men were called aft and copley banks revealed his plans to them  he had chosen them he said as brisk boys and lads of spirit who would rather run some risk upon the sea than starve for a living upon the shore  kings ships were few and weak and they could master any trader who might come their way  others had done well at the business and with a handy wellfound vessel there was no reason why they should not turn their tarry jackets into velvet coats if they were prepared to sail under the black flag he was ready to command them but if any wished to withdraw they might have the gig and row back to jamaica  four men out of sixandforty asked for their discharge went over the ships side into the boat and rowed away amidst the jeers and howlings of the crew  the rest assembled aft and drew up the articles of their association  a square of black tarpaulin had the white skull painted upon it and was hoisted amidst cheering at the main  officers were elected and the limits of their authority fixed  copley banks was chosen captain but as there are no mates upon a pirate craft birthmark sweetlocks became quartermaster and israel martin the boatswain  there was no difficulty in knowing what was the custom of the brotherhood for half the men at least had served upon pirates before  food should be the same for all and no man should interfere with another mans drink  the captain should have a cabin but all hands should be welcome to enter it when they chose  all should share and share alike save only the captain quartermaster boatswain carpenter and mastergunner who had from a quarter to a whole share extra  he who saw a prize first should have the best weapon taken out of her  he who boarded her first should have the richest suit of clothes aboard of her  every man might treat his own prisoner be it man or woman after his own fashion  if a man flinched from his gun the quartermaster should pistol him  these were some of the rules which the crew of the ruffling harry subscribed by putting fortytwo crosses at the foot of the paper upon which they had been drawn  so a new rover was afloat upon the seas and her name before a year was over became as well known as that of the happy delivery  from the bahamas to the leewards and from the leewards to the windwards copley banks became the rival of sharkey and the terror of traders  for a long time the barque and the brig never met which was the more singular as the ruffling harry was for ever looking in at sharkeys resorts but at last one day when she was passing down the inlet of coxons hole at the east end of cuba with the intention of careening there was the happy delivery with her blocks and tacklefalls already rigged for the same purpose  copley banks fired a shotted salute and hoisted the green trumpeter ensign as the custom was among gentlemen of the sea then he dropped his boat and went aboard  captain sharkey was not a man of a genial mood nor had he any kindly sympathy for those who were of the same trade as himself  copley banks found him seated astride upon one of the after guns with his new england quartermaster ned galloway and a crowd of roaring ruffians standing about him  yet none of them roared with quite such assurance when sharkeys pale face and filmy blue eyes were tuned upon him he was in his shirtsleeves with his cambric frills breaking through his open red satin longflapped vest  the scorching sun seemed to have no power upon his fleshless frame for he wore a low fur cap as though it had been winter  a manycoloured band of silk passed across his body and supported a short murderous sword while his broad brassbuckled belt was stuffed with pistols  sink you for a poacher he cried as copley banks passed over the bulwarks  i will drub you within an inch of your life and that inch also  what mean you by fishing in my waters  copley banks looked at him and his eyes were like those of a traveller who sees his home at last  i am glad that we are of one mind said he for i am myself of opinion that the seas are not large enough for the two of us  but if you will take your sword and pistols and come upon a sandbank with me then the world will be rid of a damned villain whichever way it goes  now this is talking said sharkey jumping off the gun and holding out his hand  i have not met many who could look john sharkey in the eyes and speak with a full breath  may the devil seize me if i do not choose you as a consort  but if you play me false then i will come aboard of you and gut you upon your own poop  and i pledge you the same said copley banks and so the two pirates became sworn comrades to each other  that summer they went north as far as the newfoundland banks and harried the new york traders and the whale ships from new england it was copley banks who captured the liverpool ship house of hanover but it was sharkey who fastened her master to the windlass and pelted him to death with empty claretbottles  together they engaged the kings ship royal fortune which had been sent in search of them and beat her off after a night action of five hours the drunken raving crews fighting naked in the light of the battlelanterns with a bucket of rum and a pannikin laid by the tackles of every gun  they ran to topsail inlet in north carolina to refit and then in the spring they were at the grand caicos ready for a long cruise down the west indies  by this time sharkey and copley banks had become very excellent friends for sharkey loved a wholehearted villain and he loved a man of metal and it seemed to him that the two met in the captain of the ruffling harry  it was long before he gave his confidence to him for cold suspicion lay deep in his character  never once would he trust himself outside his own ship and away from his own men  but copley banks came often on board the happy delivery and joined sharkey in many of his morose debauches so that at last any lingering misgivings of the latter were set at rest  he knew nothing of the evil that he had done to his new boon companion for of his many victims how could he remember the woman and the two boys whom he had slain with such levity so long ago when therefore he received a challenge to himself and to his quartermaster for a carouse upon the last evening of their stay at the caicos bank he saw no reason to refuse  a wellfound passenger ship had been rifled the week before so their fare was of the best and after supper five of them drank deeply together  there were the two captains  birthmark sweetlocks ned galloway and israel martin the old buccaneersman  to wait upon them was the dumb steward whose head sharkey split with a glass because he had been too slow in the filling of it  the quartermaster has slipped sharkeys pistols away from him for it was an old joke with him to fire them crosshanded under the table and see who was the luckiest man it was a pleasantry which had cost his boatswain his leg so now when the table was cleared they would coax sharkeys weapons away from him on the excuse of the heat and lay them out of his reach  the captains cabin of the ruffling harry was in a deckhouse upon the poop and a sternchaser gun was mounted at the back of it  round shot were racked round the wall and three great hogsheads of powder made a stand for dishes and for bottles  in this grim room the five pirates sang and roared and drank while the silent steward still filled up their glasses and passed the box and the candle round for their tobaccopipes  hour after hour the talk became fouler the voices hoarser the curses and shoutings more incoherent until three of the five had closed their bloodshot eyes and dropped their swimming heads upon the table  copley banks and sharkey were left face to face the one because he had drunk the least the other because no amount of liquor would ever shake his iron nerve or warm his sluggish blood  behind him stood the watchful steward for ever filling up his waning glass  from without came the low lapping of the tide and from over the water a sailors chanty from the barque  in the windless tropical night the words came clearly to their ears       a trader sailed from stepney town    wake her up shake her up try her with the mainsail      a trader sailed from stepney town    with a keg full of gold and a velvet gown      ho the bully rover jack    waiting with his yard aback      out upon the lowland sea  the two boon companions sat listening in silence  then copley banks glanced at the steward and the man took a coil of rope from the shotrack behind him  captain sharkey said copley banks do you remember the duchess of cornwall hailing from london which you took and sank three years ago off the statira shoal  curse me if i can bear their names in mind said sharkey  we did as many as ten ships a week about that time  there were a mother and two sons among the passengers  maybe that will bring it back to your mind  captain sharkey leant back in thought with his huge thin beak of a nose jutting upwards  then he burst suddenly into a high treble neighing laugh  he remembered it he said and he added details to prove it but burn me if it had not slipped from my mind he cried  how came you to think of it  it was of interest to me said copley banks for the woman was my wife and the lads were my only sons  sharkey stared across at his companion and saw that the smouldering fire which lurked always in his eyes had burned up into a lurid flame he read their menace and he clapped his hands to his empty belt then he turned to seize a weapon but the bight of a rope was cast round him and in an instant his arms were bound to his side  he fought like a wild cat and screamed for help  ned he yelled  ned  wake up heres damned villainy  help nedhelp  but the three men were far too deeply sunk in their swinish sleep for any voice to wake them  round and round went the rope until sharkey was swathed like a mummy from ankle to neck  they propped him stiff and helpless against a powder barrel and they gagged him with a handkerchief but his filmy redrimmed eyes still looked curses at them  the dumb man chattered in his exultation and sharkey winced for the first time when he saw the empty mouth before him  he understood that vengeance slow and patient had dogged him long and clutched him at last  the two captors had their plans all arranged and they were somewhat elaborate  first of all they stove the heads of two of the great powder barrels and they heaped the contents out upon the table and floor they piled it round and under the three drunken men until each sprawled in a heap of it  then they carried sharkey to the gun and they triced him sitting over the porthole with his body about a foot from the muzzle  wriggle as he would he could not move an inch either to the right or left and the dumb man trussed him up with a sailors cunning so that there was no chance that he should work free  now you bloody devil said copley banks softly you must listen to what i have to say to you for they are the last words that you will hear  you are my man now and i have bought you at a price for i have given all that a man can give here below and i have given my soul as well  to reach you i have had to sink to your level  for two years i strove against it hoping that some other way might come but i learnt that there was no other  ive robbed and i have murderedworse still i have laughed and lived with youand all for the one end  and now my time has come and you will die as i would have you die seeing the shadow creeping upon you and the devil waiting for you in the shadow  sharkey could hear the hoarse voices of his rovers singing their chanty over the water      where is the trader of stepney town   wake her up shake her up every stick abending     where is the trader of stepney town     his golds on the capstan his bloods on his gown       all for bully rover jack       reaching on the weather tack     right across the lowland sea  the words came clear to his ear and just outside he could hear two men pacing backwards and forwards upon the deck  and yet he was helpless staring down the mouth of the ninepounder unable to move an inch or to utter so much as a groan  again there came the burst of voices from the deck of the barque      so its up and its over to stornoway bay   pack it on crack it on try her with stunsails     its off on a bowline to stornoway bay     where the liquor is good and the lasses are gay       waiting for their bully jack       watching for him sailing back     right across the lowland sea  to the dying pirate the jovial words and rollicking tune made his own fate seem the harsher but there was no softening in those venomous blue eyes  copley banks had brushed away the priming of the gun and had sprinkled fresh powder over the touchhole  then he had taken up the candle and cut it to the length of about an inch  this he placed upon the loose powder at the breach of the gun  thin he scattered powder thickly over the floor beneath so that when the candle fell at the recoil it must explode the huge pile in which the three drunkards were wallowing  youve made others look death in the face sharkey said he now it has come to be your own turn  you and these swine here shall go together he lit the candleend as he spoke and blew out the other lights upon the table  then he passed out with the dumb man and locked the cabin door upon the outer side  but before he closed it he took an exultant look backwards and received one last curse from those unconquerable eyes  in the single dim circle of light that ivorywhite face with the gleam of moisture upon the high bald forehead was the last that was ever seen of sharkey  there was a skiff alongside and in it copley banks and the dumb steward made their way to the beach and looked back upon the brig riding in the moonlight just outside the shadow of the palm trees  they waited and waited watching that dim light which shone through the stem port  and then at last there came the dull thud of a gun and an instant later the shattering crash of an explosion  the long sleek black barque the sweep of white sand and the fringe of nodding feathery palm trees sprang into dazzling light and back into darkness again  voices screamed and called upon the bay  then copley banks his heart singing within him touched his companion upon the shoulder and they plunged together into the lonely jungle of the caicos    the croxley master                                i  mr robert montgomery was seated at his desk his head upon his hands in a state of the blackest despondency  before him was the open ledger with the long columns of dr oldacres prescriptions  at his elbow lay the wooden tray with the labels in various partitions the cork box the lumps of twisted sealingwax while in front a rank of bottles waited to be filled  but his spirits were too low for work  he sat in silence with his fine shoulders bowed and his head upon his hands  outside through the grimy surgery window over a foreground of blackened brick and slate a line of enormous chimneys like cyclopean pillars upheld the lowering duncoloured cloudbank  for six days in the week they spouted smoke but today the furnace fires were banked for it was sunday  sordid and polluting gloom hung over a district blighted and blasted by the greed of man  there was nothing in the surroundings to cheer a desponding soul but it was more than his dismal environment which weighed upon the medical assistant  his trouble was deeper and more personal  the winter session was approaching  he should be back again at the university completing the last year which would give him his medical degree but alas he had not the money with which to pay his class fees nor could he imagine how he could procure it sixty pounds were wanted to make his career and it might have been as many thousand for any chance there seemed to be of his obtaining it he was roused from his black meditation by the entrance of dr oldacre himself a large cleanshaven respectable man with a prim manner and an austere face  he had prospered exceedingly by the support of the local church interest and the rule of his life was never by word or action to run a risk of offending the sentiment which had made him his standard of respectability and of dignity was exceedingly high and he expected the same from his assistants  his appearance and words were always vaguely benevolent  a sudden impulse came over the despondent student  he would test the reality of this philanthropy  i beg your pardon dr oldacre said he rising from his chair i have a great favour to ask of you  the doctors appearance was not encouraging  his mouth suddenly tightened and his eyes fell  yes mr montgomery  you are aware sir that i need only one more session to complete my course  so you have told me  it is very important to me sir  naturally  the fees dr oldacre would amount to about sixty pounds  i am afraid that my duties call me elsewhere mr montgomery  one moment sir i had hoped sir that perhaps if i signed a paper promising you interest upon your money you would advance this sum to me  i will pay you back sir i really will  or if you like i will work it off after i am qualified  the doctors lips had thinned into a narrow line  his eyes were raised again and sparkled indignantly  your request is unreasonable mr montgomery  i am surprised that you should have made it  consider sir how many thousands of medical students there are in this country  no doubt there are many of them who have a difficulty in finding their fees  am i to provide for them all or why should i make an exception in your favour i am grieved and disappointed mr montgomery that you should have put me into the painful position of having to refuse you  he turned upon his heel and walked with offended dignity out of the surgery  the student smiled bitterly and turned to his work of making up the morning prescriptions  it was poor and unworthy workwork which any weakling might have done as well and this was a man of exceptional nerve and sinew  but such as it was it brought him his board and one pound a weekenough to help him during the summer months and let him save a few pounds towards his winter keep  but those class fees where were they to come from  he could not save them out of his scanty wage  dr oldacre would not advance them  he saw no way of earning them  his brains were fairly good but brains of that quality were a drug in the market  he only excelled in his strength and where was he to find a customer for that  but the ways of fate are strange and his customer was at hand  look yere said a voice at the door  montgomery looked up for the voice was a loud and rasping one  a young man stood at the entrance a stocky bullnecked young miner in tweed sunday clothes and an aggressive necktie  he was a sinisterlooking figure with dark insolent eyes and the jaw and throat of a bulldog  look yere said he again  why hast thou not sent t medicine oop as thy master ordered  montgomery had become accustomed to the brutal frankness of the northern worker  at first it had enraged him but after a time he had grown callous to it and accepted it as it was meant  but this was something different  it was insolencebrutal overbearing insolence with physical menace behind it  what name he asked coldly  barton  happen i may give thee cause to mind that name yoong man mak oop t wifes medicine this very moment look ye or it will be the worse for thee  montgomery smiled  a pleasant sense of relief thrilled softly through him  what blessed safetyvalve was this through which his jangled nerves might find some outlet  the provocation was so gross the insult so unprovoked that he could have none of those qualms which take the edge off a mans mettle  he finished sealing the bottle upon which he was occupied and he addressed it and placed it carefully in the rack look here said he turning round to the miner your medicine will be made up in its turn and sent down to you  i dont allow folk in the surgery  wait outside in the waitingroom if you wish to wait at all  yoong man said the miner thous got to mak t wifes medicine here and now and quick while i wait and watch thee or else happen thou might need some medicine thysel before all is over  i shouldnt advise you to fasten a quarrel upon me montgomery was speaking in the hard staccato voice of a man who is holding himself in with difficulty  youll save trouble if youll go quietly  if you dont youll be hurt  ah you would  take it then  the blows were almost simultaneousa savage swing which whistled past montgomerys ear and a straight drive which took the workman on the chin  luck was with the assistant  that single whizzing uppercut and the way in which it was delivered warned him that he had a formidable man to deal with  but if he had underrated his antagonist his antagonist had also underrated him and had laid himself open to a fatal blow  the miners head had come with a crash against the corner of the surgery shelves and he had dropped heavily on to the ground  there he lay with his bandy legs drawn up and his hands thrown abroad the blood trickling over the surgery tiles  had enough asked the assistant breathing fiercely through his nose  but no answer came  the man was insensible  and then the danger of his position came upon montgomery and he turned as white as his antagonist a sunday the immaculate dr oldacre with his pious connection a savage brawl with a patient he would irretrievably lose his situation if the facts came out  it was not much of a situation but he could not get another without a reference and oldacre might refuse him one  without money for his classes and without a situationwhat was to become of him  it was absolute ruin  but perhaps he could escape exposure after all  he seized his insensible adversary dragged him out into the centre of he room loosened his collar and squeezed the surgery sponge over his face  he sat up at last with a gasp and a scowl  domn thee thous spoilt my necktie said he mopping up the water from his breast  im sorry i hit you so hard said montgomery apologetically  thou hit me hard i could stan such flyflappin all day  twas this here press that cracked my pate for me and thou art a looky man to be able to boast as thou hast outed me  and now id be obliged to thee if thou wilt give me t wifes medicine  montgomery gladly made it up and handed it to the miner  you are weak still said he  wont you stay awhile and rest  t wife wants her medicine said the man and lurched out at the door  the assistant looking after him saw him rolling with an uncertain step down the street until a friend met him and they walked on arm in arm  the man seemed in his rough northern fashion to bear no grudge and so montgomerys fears left him  there was no reason why the doctor should know anything about it  he wiped the blood from the floor put the surgery in order and went on with his interrupted task hoping that he had come scathless out of a very dangerous business  yet all day he was aware of a sense of vague uneasiness which sharpened into dismay when late in the afternoon he was informed that three gentlemen had called and were waiting for him in the surgery a coroners inquest a descent of detectives an invasion of angry relativesall sorts of possibilities rose to scare him  with tense nerves and a rigid face he went to meet his visitors  they were a very singular trio  each was known to him by sight but what on earth the three could be doing together and above all what they could expect from him was a most inexplicable problem the first was sorley wilson the son of the owner of the nonpareil coalpit  he was a young blood of twenty heir to a fortune a keen sportsman and down for the easter vacation from magdalene college he sat now upon the edge of the surgery table looking in thoughtful silence at montgomery and twisting the ends of his small black waxed moustache  the second was purvis the publican owner of the chief beershop and well known as the local bookmaker  he was a coarse cleanshaven man whose fiery face made a singular contrast with his ivorywhite bald head  he had shrewd lightblue eyes with foxy lashes and he also leaned forward in silence from his chair a fat red hand upon either knee and stared critically at the young assistant  so did the third visitor fawcett the horsebreaker who leaned back his long thin legs with their boxcloth ridinggaiters thrust out in front of him tapping his protruding teeth with his ridingwhip with anxious thought in every line of his rugged bony face  publican exquisite and horsebreaker were all three equally silent equally earnest and equally critical  montgomery seated in the midst of them looked from one to the other  well gentlemen he observed but no answer came  the position was embarrassing  no said the horsebreaker at last  no  its off  its nowt  stand oop lad lets see thee standin it was the publican who spoke  montgomery obeyed  he would learn all about it no doubt if he were patient  he stood up and turned slowly round as if in front of his tailor  its off  its off cried the horsebreaker  why mon the master would break him over his knee  oh that be hanged for a yarn said the young cantab  you can drop out if you like fawcett but ill see this thing through if i have to do it alone  i dont hedge a penny  i like the cut of him a great deal better than i liked ted barton  look at bartons shoulders mr wilson  lumpiness isnt always strength  give me nerve and fire and breed thats what wins  ay sir you have it theeryou have it theer said the fat redfaced publican in a thick suety voice  its the same wi poops  get em cleanbred an fine an theyll yark the thick unsyark em out o their skins  hes ten good pund on the light side growled the horsebreaker  hes a welter weight anyhow  a hundred and thirty  a hundred and fifty if hes an ounce  well the master doesnt scale much more than that  a hundred and seventyfive  that was when he was hogfat and living high  work the grease out of him and i lay theres no great difference between them  have you been weighed lately mr montgomery  it was the first direct question which had been asked him  he had stood in the midst of them like a horse at a fair and he was just beginning to wonder whether he was more angry or amused  i am just eleven stone said he  i said that he was a welter weight  but suppose you was trained said the publican  wot then  i am always in training  in a manner of speakin no doubt he is always in trainin remarked the horsebreaker  but trainin for everyday work aint the same as trainin with a trainer and i dare bet with all respec to your opinion mr wilson that theres half a stone of tallow on him at this minute  the young cantab put his fingers on the assistants upper arm then with his other hand on his wrist he bent the forearm sharply and felt the biceps as round and hard as a cricketball spring up under his fingers  feel that said he  the publican and horsebreaker felt it with an air of reverence  good lad  hell do yet cried purvis  gentlemen said montgomery i think that you will acknowledge that i have boon very patient with you  i have listened to all that you have to say about my personal appearance and now i must really beg that you will have the goodness to tell me what is the matter  they all sat down in their serious businesslike way  thats easy done mr montgomery said the fatvoiced publican but before sayin anything we had to wait and see whether in a way of speakin there was any need for us to say anything at all  mr wilson thinks there is  mr fawcett who has the same right to his opinion bein also a backer and one o the committee thinks the other way  i thought him too light built and i think so now said the horsebreaker still tapping his prominent teeth with the metal head of his ridingwhip  but happen he may pull through and hes a finemade buirdly young chap so if you mean to back him mr wilson  which i do  and you purvis  i aint one to go back fawcett  well ill stan to my share of the purse  and well i knew you would said purvis for it would be somethin new to find isaac fawcett as a spoilsport  well then we will make up the hundred for the stake among us and the fight standsalways supposin the young man is willin  excuse all this rot mr montgomery said the university man in a genial voice  weve begun at the wrong end i know but well soon straighten it out and i hope that you will see your way to falling in with our views  in the first place you remember the man whom you knocked out this morning  he is bartonthe famous ted barton  im sure sir you may well be proud to have outed him in one round said the publican  why it took morris the tenstonesix champion a deal more trouble than that before he put barton to sleep  youve done a fine performance sir and happen youll do a finer if you give yourself the chance  i never heard of ted barton beyond seeing the name on a medicine label said the assistant  well you may take it from me that hes a slaughterer said the horsebreaker  youve taught him a lesson that he needed for it was always a word and a blow with him and the word alone was worth five shillin in a public court  he wont be so ready now to shake his nief in the face of everyone he meets  however thats neither here nor there  montgomery looked at them in bewilderment  for goodness sake gentlemen tell me what it is you want me to do he cried  we want you to fight silas craggs better known as the master of croxley  but why  because ted barton was to have fought him next saturday  he was the champion of the wilson coalpits and the other was the master of the ironfolk down at the croxley smelters  wed matched our man for a purse of a hundred against the master  but youve queered our man and he cant face such a battle with a twoinch cut at the back of his head theres only one thing to be done sir and that is for you to take his place  if you can lick ted barton you may lick the master of croxley but if you dont were done for theres no one else who is in the same street with him in this district  its twenty rounds twoounce gloves queensberry rules and a decision on points if you fight to the finish  for a moment the absurdity of the thing drove every other thought out of montgomerys head  but then there came a sudden revulsion  a hundred poundsall he wanted to complete his education was lying there ready to his hand if only that hand were strong enough to pick it up  he had thought bitterly that morning that there was no market for his strength but here was one where his muscle might earn more in an hour than his brains in a year  but a chill of doubt came over him  how can i fight for the coalpits said he  i am not connected with them  eh lad but thou art cried old purvis  weve got it down in writin and its clear enough  anyone connected with the coalpits doctor oldacre is the coalpit club doctor thou art his assistant what more can they want  yes thats right enough said the cantab  it would be a very sporting thing of you mr montgomery if you would come to our help when we are in such a hole  of course you might not like to take the hundred pounds but i have no doubt that in the case of your winning we could arrange that it should take the form of a watch or piece of plate or any other shape which might suggest itself to you  you see you are responsible for our having lost our champion so we really feel that we have a claim upon  you  give me a moment gentlemen  it is very unexpected  i am afraid the doctor would never consent to my goingin fact i am sure that he would not  but he need never knownot before the fight at any rate  we are not bound to give the name of our man  so long as he is within the weight limits on the day of the fight that is all that concerns anyone  the adventure and the profit would either of them have attracted montgomery  the two combined were irresistible  gentlemen said he ill do it  the three sprang from their seats  the publican had seized his right hand the horsedealer his left and the cantab slapped him on the back  good lad good lad croaked the publican  eh mon but if thou yark him thoull rise in one day from being just a common doctor to the bestknown mon twixt here and bradford  thou art a witherin tyke thou art and no mistake and if thou beat the master of croxley thoull find all the beer thou want for the rest of thy life waiting for thee at the four sacks  it is the most sporting thing i ever heard of in my life said young wilson  by george sir if you pull it off youve got the constituency in your pocket if you care to stand  you know the outhouse in my garden  next the road  exactly  i turned it into a gymnasium for ted barton  youll find all you want there clubs punching ball bars dumbbells everything then youll want a sparring partner  ogilvy has been acting for barton but we dont think that he is class enough  barton bears you no grudge hes a goodhearted fellow though crossgrained with strangers  he looked upon you as a stranger this morning but he says he knows you now  he is quite ready to spar with you for practice and he will come any hour you will name  thank you i will let you know the hour said montgomery and so the committee departed jubilant upon their way  the medical assistant sat for a time in the surgery turning it over a little in his mind  he had been trained originally at the university by the man who had been middleweight champion in his day  it was true that his teacher was long past his prime slow upon his feet and stiff in his joints but even so he was still a tough antagonist but montgomery had found at last that he could more than hold his own with him  he had won the university medal and his teacher who had trained so many students was emphatic in his opinion that he had never had one who was in the same class with him  he had been exhorted to go in for the amateur championships but he had no particular ambition in that direction  once he had put on the gloves with hammer tunstall in a booth at a fair and had fought three rattling rounds in which he had the worst of it but had made the prize fighter stretch himself to the uttermost  there was his whole record and was it enough to encourage him to stand up to the master of croxley  he had never heard of the master before but then he had lost touch of the ring during the last few years of hard work  after all what did it matter  if he won there was the money which meant so much to him  if he lost it would only mean a thrashing  he could take punishment without flinching of that he was certain  if there were only one chance in a hundred of pulling it off then it was worth his while to attempt it  dr oldacre new come from church with an ostentatious prayerbook in his kidgloved hand broke in upon his meditation  you dont go to service i observe mr montgomery said he coldly  no sir i have had some business to detain me  it is very near to my heart that my household should set a good example  there are so few educated people in this district that a great responsibility devolves upon us  if we do not live up to the highest how can we expect these poor workers to do so  it is a dreadful thing to reflect that the parish takes a great deal more interest in an approaching glove fight than in their religious duties  a glove fight sir said montgomery guiltily  i believe that to be the correct term  one of my patients tells me that it is the talk of the district  a local ruffian a patient of ours by the way matched against a pugilist over at croxley i cannot understand why the law does not step in and stop so degrading an exhibition  it is really a prize fight  a glove fight you said  i am informed that a 2oz glove is an evasion by which they dodge the law and make it difficult for the police to interfere  they contend for a sum of money  it seems dreadful and almost incredibledoes it notto think that such scenes can be enacted within a few miles of our peaceful home  but you will realise mr montgomery that while there are such influences for us to counteract it is very necessary that we should live up to our highest  the doctors sermon would have had more effect if the assistant had not once or twice had occasion to test his highest and come upon it at unexpectedly humble elevations  it is always so particularly easy to compound for sins were most inclined to by damning those we have no mind to  in any case montgomery felt that of all the men concerned in such a fightpromoters backers spectatorsit is the actual fighter who holds the strongest and most honourable position  his conscience gave him no concern upon the subject  endurance and courage are virtues not vices and brutality is at least better than effeminacy  there was a little tobaccoshop at the corner of the street where montgomery got his birdseye and also his local information for the shopman was a garrulous soul who knew everything about the affairs of the district  the assistant strolled down there after tea and asked in a casual way whether the tobacconist had ever heard of the master of croxley  heard of him heard of him the little man could hardly articulate in his astonishment  why sir hes the first mon o the district an his names as well known in the west riding as the winner o t derby but lor sirhere he stopped and rummaged among a heap of papers they are makin a fuss about him on account o his fight wi ted barton and so the croxley herald has his life an record an here it is an thou canst read it for thysel  the sheet of the paper which he held up was a lake of print around an islet of illustration  the latter was a coarse woodcut of a pugilists head and neck set in a crossbarred jersey  it was a sinister but powerful face the face of a debauched hero cleanshaven strongly eyebrowed keeneyed with huge aggressive jaw and an animal dewlap beneath it  the long obstinate cheeks ran flush up to the narrow sinister eyes  the mighty neck came down square from the ears and curved outwards into shoulders which had lost nothing at the hands of the local artist  above was written silas craggs and beneath the master of croxley  thoull find all about him there sir said the tobacconist  hes a witherin tyke he is and were proud to have him in the county  if he hadnt broke his leg hed have been champion of england  broke his leg has he  yes and it set badly  they ca him owd k behind his back for that is how his two legs look  but his armswell if they was both stropped to a bench as the sayin is i wonder where the champion of england would be then  ill take this with me said montgomery and putting the paper into his pocket he returned home  it was not a cheering record which he read there  the whole history of the croxley master was given in full his many victories his few defeats     born in 1857 said the provincial biographer silas craggs better    known in sporting circles as the master of croxley is now in his    fortieth year  hang it im only twentythree said montgomery to himself and read on more cheerfully     having in his youth shown a surprising aptitude for the game he    fought   his way up among his comrades until he became the    recognised champion of the district and won the proud title which    he still holds  ambitious of a more than local fame he secured a    patron and fought his first fight against jack barton of    birmingham in may 1880 at the old loiterers club  craggs    who fought at ten stonetwo at the time had the better of fifteen    rattling rounds and gained an award on points against the midlander    having disposed of james dunn of rotherhithe cameron of glasgow    and a youth named fernie he was thought so highly of by the fancy    that he was matched against ernest willox at that time    middleweight champion of the north of england and defeated him in a    hardfought battle knocking him out in the tenth round after a    punishing contest  at this period it looked as if the very highest    honours of the ring were within the reach of the young yorkshireman    but he was laid upon the shelf by a most unfortunate accident  the    kick of a horse broke his thigh and for a year he was compelled to    rest himself  when he returned to his work the fracture had set    badly and his activity was much impaired  it was owing to this    that he was defeated in seven rounds by willox the man whom he had    previously beaten and afterwards by james shaw of london though    the latter acknowledged that he had found the toughest customer of    his career  undismayed by his reverses the master adapted the    style of his fighting to his physical disabilities and resumed his    career of victorydefeating norton the black hobby wilson and    levi cohen the latter a heavyweight  conceding two stone he    fought a draw with the famous billy mcquire and afterwards for    a purse of fifty pounds he defeated sam hare at the pelican club    london  in 1891 a decision was given against him upon a foul when    fighting a winning fight against jim taylor the australian middle    weight and so mortified was he by the decision that he withdrew    from the ring  since then he has hardly fought at all save to    accommodate any local aspirant who may wish to learn the difference    between a barroom scramble and a scientific contest  the latest    of these ambitious souls comes from the wilson coalpits which have    undertaken to put up a stake of 100 pounds and back their local    champion  there are various rumours afloat as to who their    representative is to be the name of ted barton being freely    mentioned but the betting which is seven to one on the master    against any untried man is a fair reflection of the feeling of    the community  montgomery read it over twice and it left him with a very serious face no light matter this which he had undertaken no battle with a roughandtumble fighter who presumed upon a local reputation the  mans record showed that he was firstclassor nearly so  there were a few points in his favour and  he must make the most of them there was agetwentythree against forty  there was an old ring proverb that youth will be served but the annals of the ring offer a great number of exceptions  a hard veteran full of cool valour and ringcraft could give ten or fifteen years and a beating to most striplings  he could not rely too much upon his advantage in age but then there was the lameness that must surely count for a great deal  and lastly there was the chance that the master might underrate his opponent that he might be remiss in his training and refuse to abandon his usual way of life if he thought that he had an easy task before him  in a man of his age and habits this seemed very possible montgomery prayed that it might be so  meanwhile if his opponent were the best man who ever jumped the ropes into a ring his own duty was clear  he must prepare himself carefully throw away no chance and do the very best that he could  but he knew enough to appreciate the difference which exists in boxing as in every sport between the amateur and the professional  the coolness the power of hitting above all the capability of taking punishment count for so much  those specially developed guttaperchalike abdominal muscles of the hardened pugilist will take without flinching a blow which would leave another man writhing on the ground  such things are not to be acquired in a week but all that could be done in a week should be done  the medical assistant had a good basis to start from  he was 5ft 11 install enough for anything on two legs as the old ring men used to saylithe and spare with the activity of a panther and a strength which had hardly yet ever found its limitations  his muscular development was finely hard but his power came rather from that higher nerveenergy which counts for nothing upon a measuring tape  he had the wellcurved nose and the widely opened eye which never yet were seen upon the face of a craven and behind everything he had the driving force which came from the knowledge that his whole career was at stake upon the contest  the three backers rubbed their hands when they saw him at work punching the ball in the gymnasium next morning and fawcett the horsebreaker who had written to leeds to hedge his bets sent a wire to cancel the letter and to lay another fifty at the market price of seven to one  montgomerys chief difficulty was to find time for his training without any interference from the doctor  his work took him a large part of the day but as the visiting was done on foot and considerable distances had to be traversed it was a training in itself  for the rest he punched the swinging ball and worked with the dumbbells for an hour every morning and evening and boxed twice a day with ted barton in the gymnasium gaining as much profit as could be got from a rushing twohanded slogger  barton was full of admiration for his cleverness and quickness but doubtful about his strength  hard hitting was the feature of his own style and he exacted it from others  lord sir thats a turble poor poonch for an elevenstone man he would cry  thou wilt have to hit harder than that afore t master will know that thou art theer  all thots better mon thots fine he would add as his opponent lifted him across the room on the end of a right counter  thots how i likes to feel em  happen thoult pull through yet  he chuckled with joy when montgomery knocked him into a corner  eh mon thou art coming along grand  thou hast fair yarked me off my legs  do it again lad do it again  the only part of montgomerys training which came within the doctors observation was his diet and that puzzled him considerably  you will excuse my remarking mr montgomery that you are becoming rather particular in your tastes  such fads are not to be encouraged in ones youth  why do you eat toast with every meal  i find that it suits me better than bread sir  it entails unnecessary work upon the cook  i observe also that you have turned against potatoes  yes sir i think that i am better without them  and you no longer drink your beer  no sir  these causeless whims and fancies are very much to be deprecated mr montgomery  consider how many there are to whom these very potatoes and this very beer would be most acceptable  no doubt sir but at present i prefer to do without them  they were sitting alone at lunch and the assistant thought that it would be a good opportunity of asking leave for the day of the fight  i should be glad if you could let me have leave for saturday dr oldacre  it is very inconvenient upon so busy a day  i should do a double days work on friday so as to leave everything in order  i should hope to be back in the evening  i am afraid i cannot spare you mr montgomery  this was a facer  if he could not get leave he would go without it  you will remember dr oldacre that when i came to you it was understood that i should have a clear day every month  i have never claimed one  but now there are reasons why i wish to have a holiday upon saturday  dr oldacre gave in with a very bad grace  of course if you insist upon your formal rights there is no more to be said mr montgomery though i feel that it shows a certain indifference to my comfort and the welfare of the practice  do you still insist  yes sir  very good  have your way  the doctor was boiling over with anger but montgomery was a valuable assistantsteady capable and hardworkingand he could not afford to lose him  even if he had been prompted to advance those class fees for which his assistant had appealed it would have been against his interests to do so for he did not wish him to qualify and he desired him to remain in his subordinate position in which he worked so hard for so small a wage  there was something in the cool insistence of the young man a quiet resolution in his voice as he claimed his saturday which aroused his curiosity  i have no desire to interfere unduly with your affairs mr montgomery but were you thinking of having a day in leeds upon saturday  no sir  in the country  yes sir  you are very wise  you will find a quiet day among the wild flowers a very valuable restorative  have you thought of any particular direction  i am going over croxley way  well there is no prettier country when once you are past the ironworks  what could be more delightful than to lie upon the fells basking in the sunshine with perhaps some instructive and elevating book as your companion  i should recommend a visit to the ruins of st bridgets church a very interesting relic of the early norman era by the way there is one objection which i see to your going to croxley on saturday  it is upon that date as i am informed that that ruffianly glove fight takes place  you may find yourself molested by the blackguards whom it will attract  i will take my chance of that sir said the assistant  on the friday night which was the last night before the fight montgomerys three backers assembled in the gymnasium and inspected their man as he went through some light exercises to keep his muscles supple  he was certainly in splendid condition his skin shining with health and his eyes with energy and confidence  the three walked round him and exulted  hes simply ripping said the undergraduate  by gad youve come out of it splendidly  youre as hard as a pebble and fit to fight for your life  happen hes a trifle on the fine side said the publican  runs a bit light at the loins to my way of thinking  what weight today  ten stone eleven the assistant answered  thats only three pund off in a weeks trainin said the horsebreaker  he said right when he said that he was in condition well its fine stuff all there is of it but im none so sure as there is enough  he kept poking his finger into montgomery as if he were one of his horses  i hear that the master will scale a hundred and sixty odd at the ringside  but theres some of that which hed like well to pull off and leave behind wi his shirt said purvis  i hear theyve had a rare job to get him to drop his beer and if it had not been for that great redheaded wench of his theyd never ha done it  she fair scratted the face off a potman that had brought him a gallon from t chequers they say the hussy is his sparrin partner as well as his sweetheart and that his poor wife is just breakin her heart over it  hullo young un what do you want  the door of the gymnasium had opened and a lad about sixteen grimy and black with soot and iron stepped into the yellow glare of the oil lamp ted barton seized him by the collar  see here thou yoong whelp this is private and we want noan o thy spyin  but i maun speak to mr wilson  the young cantab stepped forward  well my lad what is it  its aboot t fight mr wilson sir  i wanted to tell your mon somethin aboot t maister  weve no time to listen to gossip my boy  we know all about the master  but thou doant sir  nobody knows but me and mother and we thought as wed like thy mon to know sir for we want him to fair bray him  oh you want the master fair brayed do you  so do we  well what have you to say  is this your mon sir  well suppose it is  then its him i want to tell aboot it  t maister is blind o the left eye  nonsense  its true sir  not stone blind but rarely fogged  he keeps it secret but mother knows and so do i  if thou slip him on the left side he cant cop thee  thoull find it right as i tell thee  and mark him when he sinks his right  tis his best blow his right uppercut t maisters finisher they ca it at t works  its a turble blow when it do come home  thank you my boy  this is information worth having about his sight said wilson  how came you to know so much  who are you  im his son sir  wilson whistled  and who sent you to us  my mother  i maun get back to her again  take this halfcrown  no sir i dont seek money in comin here  i do it  for love suggested the publican  for hate said the boy and darted off into the darkness  seems to me t redheaded wench may do him more harm than good after all remarked the publican  and now mr montgomery sir youve done enough for this evenin an a ninehours sleep is the best trainin before a battle  happen this time tomorrow night youll be safe back again with your 100 pound in your pocket                                  ii   work was struck at one oclock at the coalpits and the ironworks and the fight was arranged for three  from the croxley furnaces from wilsons coalpits from the heartsease mine from the dodd mills from the leverworth smelters the workmen came trooping each with his foxterrier or his lurcher at his heels  warped with labour and twisted by toil bent double by weeklong work in the cramped coal galleries or halfblinded with years spent in front of whitehot fluid metal these men still gilded their harsh and hopeless lives by their devotion to sport  it was their one relief the only thing which could distract their minds from sordid surroundings and give them an interest beyond the blackened circle which enclosed them  literature art science all these things were beyond their horizon but the race the football match the cricket the fight these were things which they could understand which they could speculate upon in advance and comment upon afterwards  sometimes brutal sometimes grotesque the love of sport is still one of the great agencies which make for the happiness of our people  it lies very deeply in the springs of our nature and when it has been educated out a higher more refined nature may be left but it will not be of that robust british type which has left its mark so deeply on the world  every one of these raddled workers slouching with his dog at his heels to see something of the fight was a true unit of his race  it was a squally may day with bright sunbursts and driving showers montgomery worked all morning in the surgery getting his medicine made up  the weather seems so very unsettled mr montgomery remarked the doctor that i am inclined to think that you had better postpone your little country excursion until a later date  i am afraid that i must go today sir  i have just had an intimation that mrs potter at the other side of angleton wishes to see me  it is probable that i shall be there all day  it will be extremely inconvenient to leave the house empty so long  i am very sorry sir but i must go said the assistant doggedly  the doctor saw that it would be useless to argue and departed in the worst of bad tempers upon mission  montgomery felt easier now that he was gone  he went up to his room and packed his runningshoes his fightingdrawers and his cricket sash into a handbag  when he came down mr wilson was waiting for him in the surgery  i hear the doctor has gone  yes he is likely to be away all day  i dont see that it matters much  its bound to come to his ears by tonight  yes its serious with me mr wilson  if i win its all right i dont mind telling you that the hundred pounds will make all the difference to me  but if i lose i shall lose my situation for as you say i cant keep it secret  never mind  well see you through among us  i only wonder the doctor has not heard for its all over the country that you are to fight the croxley champion  weve had armitage up about it already  hes the masters backer you know  he wasnt sure that you were eligible the master said he wanted you whether you were eligible or not armitage has money on and would have made trouble if he could  but i showed him that you came within the conditions of the challenge and he agreed that it was all right  they think they have a soft thing on  well i can only do my best said montgomery  they lunched together a silent and rather nervous repast for montgomerys mind was full of what was before him and wilson had himself more money at stake than he cared to lose  wilsons carriage and pair were at the door the horses with blue and white rosettes at their ears which were the colours of the wilson coalpits well known on many a football field  at the avenue gate a crowd of some hundred pitmen and their wives gave a cheer as the carriage passed  to the assistant it all seemed dreamlike and extraordinarythe strangest experience of his life but with a thrill of human action and interest in it which made it passionately absorbing he lay back in the open carriage and saw the fluttering handkerchiefs from the doors and windows of the miners cottages  wilson had pinned a blue and white rosette upon his coat and everybody knew him as their champion  good luck sir good luck to thee they shouted from the roadside  he felt that it was like some unromantic knight riding down to sordid lists but there was something of chivalry in it all the same he fought for others as well as for himself  he might fail from want of skill or strength but deep in his sombre soul he vowed that it should never be for want of heart  mr fawcett was just mounting into his highwheeled spidery dogcart with his little bit of blood between the shafts  he waved his whip and fell in behind the carriage  they overtook purvis the tomatofaced publican upon the road with his wife in her sunday bonnet  they also dropped into the procession and then as they traversed the seven miles of the high road to croxley their twohorsed rosetted carriage became gradually the nucleus of a comet with a loosely radiating tail from every sideroad came the miners carts the humble ramshackle traps black and bulging with their loads of noisy foultongued openhearted partisans  they trailed for a long quarter of a mile behind themcracking whipping shouting galloping swearing horsemen and runners were mixed with the vehicles  and then suddenly a squad of the sheffield yeomanry who were having their annual training in those parts clattered and jingled out of a field and rode as an escort to the carriage  through the dustclouds round him montgomery saw the gleaming brass helmets the bright coats and the tossing heads of the chargers the delighted brown faces of the troopers  it was more dreamlike than ever  and then as they approached the monstrous uncouth line of bottleshaped buildings which marked the smeltingworks of croxley their long writhing snake of dust was headed off by another but longer one which wound across their path  the main road into which their own opened was filled by the rushing current of traps  the wilson contingent halted until the others should get past  the ironmen cheered and groaned according to their humour as they whirled past their antagonist  rough chaff flew back and forwards like iron nuts and splinters of coal  brought him up then  got t hearse for to fetch him back  wheres t owd klegs  mon mon have thy photograph tooktwill mind thee of what thou used to look  he fighthes nowt but a halfbaked doctor  happen hell doctor thy croxley champion afore hes through wit  so they flashed at each other as the one side waited and the other passed  then there came a rolling murmur swelling into a shout and a great brake with four horses came clattering along all streaming with salmonpink ribbons  the driver wore a white hat with pink rosette and beside him on the high seat were a man and a womanshe with her arm round his waist  montgomery had one glimpse of them as they flashed past he with a furry cap drawn low over his brow a great frieze coat and a pink comforter round his throat she brazen redheaded brightcoloured laughing excitedly  the master for it was he turned as he passed gazed hard at montgomery and gave him a menacing gaptoothed grin  it was a hard wicked face bluejowled and craggy with long obstinate cheeks and inexorable eyes  the brake behind was full of patrons of the sportflushed ironforemen heads of departments managers  one was drinking from a metal flask and raised it to montgomery as he passed and then the crowd thinned and the wilson cortege with their dragoons swept in at the rear of the others  the road led away from croxley between curving green hills gashed and polluted by the searchers for coal and iron  the whole country had been gutted and vast piles of refuse and mountains of slag suggested the mighty chambers which the labour of man had burrowed beneath  on the left the road curved up to where a huge building roofless and dismantled stood crumbling and forlorn with the light shining through the windowless squares  thats the old arrowsmiths factory  thats where the fight is to be said wilson  how are you feeling now  thank you i was never better in my life montgomery answered  by gad i like your nerve said wilson who was himself flushed and uneasy  youll give us a fight for our money come what may that place on the right is the office and that has been set aside as the dressing and weighing room  the carriage drove up to it amidst the shouts of the folk upon the hillside  lines of empty carriages and traps curved down upon the winding road and a black crowd surged round the door of the ruined factory  the seats as a huge placard announced were five shillings three shillings and a shilling with halfprice for dogs  the takings deducting expenses were to go to the winner and it was already evident that a larger stake than a hundred pounds was in question  a babel of voices rose from the door the workers wished to bring their dogs in free  the men scuffled  the dogs barked  the crowd was  a whirling eddying pool surging with a roar up to the narrow cleft which was its only outlet  the brake with its salmoncoloured streamers and four reeking horses stood empty before the door of the office wilson purvis fawcett and montgomery passed in  there was a large bare room inside with square clean patches upon the grimy walls where pictures and almanacs had once hung  worn linoleum covered the floor but there was no furniture save some benches and a deal table with an ewer and a basin upon it  two of the corners were curtained off  in the middle of the room was a weighingchair a hugely fat man with a salmon tie and a blue waistcoat with birdseye spots came bustling up to them  it was armitage the butcher and grazier well known for miles round as a warm man and the most liberal patron of sport in the riding  well well he grunted in a thick fussy wheezy voice you have come then  got your man  got your man  here he is fit and well  mr montgomery let me present you to mr armitage  glad to meet you sir  happy to make your acquaintance  i make bold to say sir that we of croxley admire your courage mr montgomery and that our only hope is a fair fight and no favour and the best man win thats our sentiments at croxley  and it is my sentiment also said the assistant  well you cant say fairer than that mr montgomery  youve taken a large contrac in hand but a large contrac may be carried through sir as anyone that knows my dealings could testify  the master is ready to weigh in  so am i  you must weigh in the buff montgomery looked askance at the tall redheaded woman who was standing gazing out of the window  thats all right said wilson  get behind the curtain and put on your fighting kit  he did so and came out the picture of an athlete in white loose drawers canvas shoes and the sash of a wellknown cricket club round his waist  he was trained to a hair his skin gleaming like silk and every muscle rippling down his broad shoulders and along his beautiful arms as he moved them  they bunched into ivory knobs or slid into long sinuous curves as he raised or lowered his hands  what thinkest thou o that asked ted barton his second of the woman in the window  she glanced contemptuously at the young athlete  its but a poor kindness thou dost him to put a threadpaper yoong gentleman like yon against a mon as is a mon  why my jock would throttle him wi one bond lashed behind him  happen he mayhappen not said barton  i have but twa pund in the world but its on him every penny and no hedgin  but heres t maister and rarely fine he do look  the prizefighter had come out from his curtain a squat formidable figure monstrous in chest and arms limping slightly on his distorted leg  his skin bad none of the freshness and clearness of montgomerys but was dusky and mottled with one huge mole amid the mat of tangled black hair which thatched his mighty breast  his weight bore no relation to his strength for those huge shoulders and great arms with brown sledgehammer fists would have fitted the heaviest man that ever threw his cap into a ring  but his loins and legs were slight in proportion  montgomery on the other hand was as symmetrical as a greek statue  it would be an encounter between a man who was specially fitted for one sport and one who was equally capable of any  the two looked curiously at each other a bulldog and a highbred cleanlimbed terrier each full of spirit  how do you do  how do the master grinned again and his three jagged front teeth gleamed for an instant  the rest had been beaten out of him in twenty years of battle  he spat upon the floor  we have a rare fine day fort  capital said montgomery  thats the good feelin i like wheezed the fat butcher  good lads both of themprime ladshard meat an good bone  theres no illfeelin  if he downs me gawd bless him said the master  an if we down him gawd help him interrupted the woman  haud thy tongue wench said the master impatiently  who art thou to put in thy word  happen i might draw my hand across thy face  the woman did not take the threat amiss  wilt have enough for thy hand to do jock said she  get quit o this gradely man afore thou turn on me  the lovers quarrel was interrupted by the entrance of a newcomer a gentleman with a furcollared overcoat and a very shiny tophat a tophat of a degree of glossiness which is seldom seen five miles from hyde park  this hat he wore at the extreme back of his head so that the lower surface of the brim made a kind of frame for his high bald forehead his keen eyes his rugged and yet kindly face  he bustled in with the quiet air of possession with which the ring master enters the circus  its mr stapleton the referee from london said wilson  how do you do mr stapleton  i was introduced to you at the big fight at the corinthian club in piccadilly  ah i dare say said the other shaking hands  fact is im introduced to so many that i cant undertake to carry their names wilson is it  well mr wilson glad to see you  couldnt get a fly at the station and thats why im late  im sure sir said armitage we should be proud that anyone so well known in the boxing world should come down to our little exhibition  not at all  not at all  anything in the interests of boxin  all ready  men weighed  weighing now sir  ah just as well that i should see it done  seen

goodness what colours are you wearing  the anonymi cricket club  what right have you to wear them i belong to the club myself  so do i  you an amateur  yes sir  and you are fighting for a money prize  yes  i suppose you know what you are doing you realise that youre a professional pug from this onwards and that if ever you fight again  ill never fight again  happen you wont said the woman and the master turned a terrible eye upon her  well i suppose you know your own business best  up you jump  one hundred and fiftyone minus two 14912lbs difference but youth and condition on the other scale  well the sooner we get to work the better for i wish to catch the seven oclock express at hellifield twenty threeminute rounds with oneminute intervals and queensberry rules  those are the conditions are they not  yes sir  very good thenwe may go across  the two combatants had overcoats thrown over their shoulders and the whole party backers fighters seconds and the referee filed out of the room  a police inspector was waiting for them in the road  he had a notebook in his handthat terrible weapon  which awes even the london cabman  i must take your names gentlemen in case it should be necessary to proceed for breach of peace  you dont mean to stop the fight cried armitage in a passion of indignation  im mr armitage of croxley and this is mr wilson and well be responsible that all is fair and as it should be  ill take the names in case it should be necessary to proceed said the inspector impassively  but you know me well  if you was a dook or even a judge it would be all the same said the inspector  its the law and theres an end  ill not take upon myself to stop the fight seeing that gloves are to be used but ill take the names of all concerned  silas craggs robert montgomery edward barton james stapleton of london  who seconds silas craggs  i do said the woman  yes you can stare but its my job and no one elses  anastasias the namefour as  craggs  johnsonanastasia johnson  if you jug him you can jug me  who talked of juggin ye fool growled the master  coom on mr armitage for im fair sick o this loiterin  the inspector fell in with the procession and proceeded as they walked up the hill to bargain in his official capacity for a front seat where he could safeguard the interests of the law and in his private capacity to lay out thirty shillings at seven to one with mr armitage through the door they passed down a narrow lane walled with a dense bank of humanity up a wooden ladder to a platform over a rope which was slung waisthigh from four cornerstakes and then montgomery realised that he was in that ring in which his immediate destiny was to be worked out  on the stake at one corner there hung a blueandwhite streamer  barton led him across the overcoat dangling loosely from his shoulders and he sat down on a wooden stool  barton and another man both wearing white sweaters stood beside him  the socalled ring was a square twenty feet each way  at the opposite angle was the sinister figure of the master with his redheaded woman and a roughfaced friend to look after him  at each corner were metal basins pitchers of water and sponges  during the hubbub and uproar of the entrance montgomery was too bewildered to take things in  but now there was a few minutes delay for the referee had lingered behind and so he looked quietly about him it was a sight to haunt him for a lifetime  wooden seats had been built in sloping upwards to the tops of the walls  above instead of a ceiling a great flight of crows passed slowly across a square of grey cloud  right up to the topmost benches the folk were bankedbroadcloth in front corduroys and fustian behind faces turned everywhere upon him  the grey reek of the pipes filled the building and the air was pungent with the acrid smell of cheap strong tobacco  everywhere among the human faces were to be seen the heads of the dogs  they growled and yapped from the back benches  in that dense mass of humanity one could hardly pick out individuals but montgomerys eyes caught the brazen gleam of the helmets held upon the knees of the ten yeomen of his escort  at the very edge of the platform sat the reporters five of themthree locals and two all the way from london  but where was the allimportant referee  there was no sign of him unless he were in the centre of that angry swirl of men near the door  mr stapleton had stopped to examine the gloves which wore to be used and entered the building after the combatants  he had started to come down that narrow lane with the human walls which led to the ring but already it had gone abroad that the wilson champion was a gentleman and that another gentleman had been appointed as referee  a wave of suspicion passed through the croxley folk  they would have one of their own people for a referee  they would not have a stranger  his path was stopped as he made for the ring  excited men flung themselves in front of him they waved their fists in his face and cursed him  a woman howled vile names in his ear  somebody struck at him with an umbrella go thou back to lunnon  we want noan o thee  go thou back they yelled  stapleton with his shiny hat cocked backwards and his large bulging forehead swelling from under it looked round him from beneath his bushy brows  he was in the centre of a savage and dangerous mob  then he drew his watch from his pocket and held it dial upwards in his palm  in three minutes said he i will declare the fight off  they raged round him  his cool face and that aggressive tophat irritated them  grimy hands were raised  but it was difficult somehow to strike a man who was so absolutely indifferent  in two minutes i declare the fight off  they exploded into blasphemy  the breath of angry men smoked into his placid face  a gnarled grimy fist vibrated at the end of his nose we tell thee we want noan o thee  get thou back where thou comst from  in one minute i declare the fight off  then the calm persistence of the man conquered the swaying mutable passionate crowd  let him through mon  happen therell be no fight after a  let him through  bill thou loomp let him pass  dost want the fight declared off  make room for the refereeroom for the lunnon referee  and half pushed half carried he was swept up to the ring  there were two chairs by the side of it one for him and one for the timekeeper he sat down his hands on his knees his hat at a more wonderful angle than ever impassive but solemn with the aspect of one who appreciates his responsibilities  mr armitage the portly butcher made his way into the ring and held up two fat hands sparkling with rings as a signal for silence  gentlemen he yelled  and then in a crescendo shriek gentlemen  and ladies cried somebody for indeed there was a fair sprinkling of women among the crowd  speak up owd man shouted another  what price pork chops cried somebody at the back  everybody laughed and the dogs began to bark  armitage waved his hands amidst the uproar as if he were conducting an orchestra  at last the babel thinned into silence  gentlemen he yelled the match is between silas craggs whom we call the master of croxley and robert montgomery of the wilson coalpits  the match was to be under eleveneight  when they were weighed just now craggs weighed elevenseven and montgomery tennine the conditions of the contest arethe best of twenty threeminute rounds with twoounce gloves  should the fight run to its full length it will of course be decided upon points  mr stapleton the wellknown london referee has kindly consented to see fair play i wish to say that mr wilson and i the chief backers of the two men have every confidence in mr stapleton and that we beg that you will accept his rulings without dispute  he then turned from one combatant to the other with a wave of his hand                                 iii   montgomerycraggs said he  a great hush fell over the huge assembly  even the dogs stopped yapping one might have thought that the monstrous room was empty the two men had stood up the small white gloves over their hands they advanced from their corners and shook hands montgomery gravely craggs with a smile  then they fell into position  the crowd gave a long sighthe intake of a thousand excited breaths  the referee tilted his chair on to its back legs and looked moodily critical from the one to the other  it was strength against activitythat was evident from the first the master stood stolidly upon his k leg  it gave him a tremendous pedestal one could hardly imagine his being knocked down  and he could pivot round upon it with extraordinary quickness but his advance or retreat was ungainly  his frame however was so much larger and broader than that of the student and his brown massive face looked so resolute and menacing that the hearts of the wilson party sank within them  there was one heart however which had not done so  it was that of robert montgomery  any nervousness which he may have had completely passed away now that he had his work before him  here was something definitethis hardfaced deformed hercules to beat with a career as the price of beating him he glowed with the joy of action  it thrilled through his nerves he faced his man with little inandout steps breaking to the left breaking to the right feeling his way while craggs with a dull malignant eye pivoted slowly upon his weak leg his left arm half extended his right sunk low across the mark  montgomery led with his left and then led again getting lightly home each time  he tried again but the master had his counter ready and montgomery reeled back from a harder blow than he had given  anastasia the woman gave a shrill cry of encouragement and her man let fly his right  montgomery ducked under it and in an instant the two were in each others arms  break away break away said the referee  the master struck upwards on the break and shook montgomery with the blow  then it was time  it had been a spirited opening round the people buzzed into comment and applause  montgomery was quite fresh but the hairy chest of the master was rising and falling the man passed a sponge over his head while anastasia flapped the towel before him  good lass good lass cried the crowd and cheered her  the men were up again the master grimly watchful montgomery as alert as a kitten  the master tried a sudden rush squattering along with his awkward gait but coming faster than one would think  the student slipped aside and avoided him  the master stopped grinned and shook his head  then he motioned with his hand as an invitation to montgomery to come to him  the student did so and led with his left but got a swinging right counter in the ribs in exchange  the heavy blow staggered him and the master came scrambling in to complete his advantage but montgomery with his greater activity kept out of danger until the call of time  a tame round and the advantage with the master  t maisters too strong for him said a smelter to his neighbour  ay but tothers a likely lad  happen well see some sport yet he can joomp rarely  but t maister can stop and hit rarely  happen hell mak him joomp when he gets his nief upon him  they were up again the water glistening upon their faces  montgomery led instantly and got his right home with a sounding smack upon the masters forehead  there was a shout from the colliers and silence order from the referee  montgomery avoided the counter and scored with his left  fresh applause and the referee upon his feet in indignation  no comments gentlemen if you please during the rounds  just bide a bit growled the master  dont talkfight said the referee angrily  montgomery rubbed in the point by a flush hit upon the mouth and the master shambled back to his corner like an angry bear having had all the worst of the round  wheres thot seven to one shouted purvis the publican  ill take six to one  there were no answers  five to one  there were givers at that  purvis booked them in a tattered notebook  montgomery began to feel happy  he lay back with his legs outstretched his back against the cornerpost and one gloved hand upon each rope what a delicious minute it was between each round  if he could only keep out of harms way he must surely wear this man out before the end of twenty rounds  he was so slow that all his strength went for nothing  youre fightin a winnin fighta winnin fight ted barton whispered in his ear  go canny tak no chances you have him proper  but the master was crafty  he had fought so many battles with his maimed limb that he knew how to make the best of it  warily and slowly he manoeuvred round montgomery stepping forward and yet again forward until he had imperceptibly backed him into his corner  the student suddenly saw a flash of triumph upon the grim face and a gleam in the dull malignant eyes  the master was upon him  he sprang aside and was on the ropes  the master smashed in one of his terrible uppercuts and montgomery half broke it with his guard  the student sprang the other way and was against the other converging rope  he was trapped in the angle  the master sent in another with a hoggish grunt which spoke of the energy behind it  montgomery ducked but got a jab from the left upon the mark  he closed with his man  break away  break away cried the referee  montgomery disengaged and got a swinging blow on the ear as he did so  it had been a damaging round for him and the croxley people were shouting their delight gentlemen i will not have this noise stapleton roared  i have been accustomed to preside at a wellconducted club and not at a beargarden  this little man with the tilted hat and the bulging forehead dominated the whole assembly  he was like a headmaster among his boys  he glared round him and nobody cared to meet his eye anastasia had kissed the master when he resumed his seat  good lass  dot again cried the laughing crowd and the angry master shook his glove at her as she flapped her towel in front of him montgomery was weary and a little sore but not depressed  he had learned something  he would not again be tempted into danger  for three rounds the honours were fairly equal  the students hitting was the quicker the masters the harder  profiting by his lesson montgomery kept himself in the open and refused to be herded into a corner  sometimes the master succeeded in rushing him to the sideropes but the younger man slipped away or closed and then disengaged  the monotonous break away  break away of the referee broke in upon the quick low patter of rubbersoled shoes the dull thud of the blows and the sharp hissing breath of two tired men  the ninth round found both of them in fairly good condition montgomerys head was still singing from the blow that he had in the corner and one of his thumbs pained him acutely and seemed to be dislocated  the master showed no sign of a touch but his breathing was the more laboured and a long line of ticks upon the referees paper showed that the student had a good show of points but one of this ironmans blows was worth three of his and he knew that without the gloves he could not have stood for three rounds against him  all the amateur work that he had done was the merest tapping and flapping when compared to those frightful blows from arms toughened by the shovel and the crowbar  it was the tenth round and the fight was half over  the betting now was only three to one for the wilson champion had held his own much better than had been expected  but those who knew the ringcraft as well as the staying power of the old prizefighter knew that the odds were still a long way in his favour  have a care of him whispered barton as he sent his man up to the scratch  have a care  hell play thee a trick if he can  but montgomery saw or imagined he saw that his antagonist was tiring he looked jaded and listless and his hands drooped a little from their position  his own youth and condition were beginning to tell he sprang in and brought off a fine lefthanded lead  the masters return lacked his usual fire  again montgomery led and again he got home  then he tried his right upon the mark and the master guarded it downwards  too low too low a foul a foul yelled a thousand voices  the referee rolled his sardonic eyes slowly round  seems to me this buildin is chockfull of referees said he  the people laughed and applauded but their favour was as immaterial to him as their anger no applause please this is not a theatre he yelled  montgomery was very pleased with himself  his adversary was evidently in a bad way  he was piling on his points and establishing a lead he might as well make hay while the sun shone  the master was looking all abroad  montgomery popped one upon his blue jowl and got away without a return  and then the master suddenly dropped both his hands and began rubbing his thigh  ah that was it was it  he had muscular cramp  go in go in cried teddy barton  montgomery sprang wildly forward and the next instant was lying half senseless with his neck nearly broken in the middle of the ring  the whole round had been a long conspiracy to tempt him within reach of one of those terrible righthand uppercuts for which the master was famous  for this the listless weary bearing for this the cramp in the thigh  when montgomery had sprung in so hotly he had exposed himself to such a blow as neither flesh nor blood could stand  whizzing up from below with a rigid arm which put the masters eleven stone into its force it struck him under the jaw he whirled half round and fell a helpless and halfparalysed mass  a vague groan and murmur inarticulate too excited for words rose from the great audience with open mouths and staring eyes they gazed at the twitching and quivering figure  stand back  stand right back shrieked the referee for the master was standing over his man ready to give him the coupdegrace as he rose  stand back craggs this instant stapleton repeated  the master sank his hands sulkily and walked backwards to the rope with his ferocious eyes fixed upon his fallen antagonist  the timekeeper called the seconds  if ten of them passed before montgomery rose to his feet the fight was ended  ted barton wrung his hands and danced about in an agony in his corner  as if in a dreama terrible nightmarethe student could hear the voice of the timekeeperthreefourfivehe got up on his handsix sevenhe was on his knee sick swimming faint but resolute to rise eighthe was up and the master was on him like a tiger lashing savagely at him with both hands  folk held their breath as they watched those terrible blows and anticipated the pitiful endso much more pitiful where a game but helpless man refuses to accept defeat  strangely automatic is the human brain  without volition without effort there shot into the memory of this bewildered staggering halfstupefied man the one thing which could have saved himthat blind eye of which the masters son had spoken  it was the same as the other to look at but montgomery remembered that he had said that it was the left  he reeled to the left side half felled by a drive which lit upon his shoulder  the master pivoted round upon his leg and was at him in an instant  yark him lad yark him screamed the woman  hold your tongue said the referee  montgomery slipped to the left again and yet again but the master was too quick and clever for him  he struck round and got him full on the face as he tried once more to break away  montgomerys knees weakened under him and he fell with a groan on the floor  this time he knew that he was done  with bitter agony he realised as he groped blindly with his hands that he could not possibly raise himself  far away and muffled he heard amid the murmurs of the multitude the fateful voice of the timekeeper counting off the seconds  onetwothreefourfivesix  time said the referee  then the pentup passion of the great assembly broke loose  croxley gave a deep groan of disappointment  the wilsons were on their feet yelling with delight  there was still a chance for them  in four more seconds their man would have been solemnly counted out  but now he had a minute in which to recover  the referee looked round with relaxed features and laughing eyes  he loved this rough game this school for humble heroes and it was pleasant to him to intervene as a deus ex machina at so dramatic a moment  his chair and his hat were both tilted at an extreme angle he and the timekeeper smiled at each other ted barton and the other second had rushed out and thrust an arm each under montgomerys knee the other behind his loins and so carried him back to his stool  his head lolled upon his shoulder but a douche of cold water sent a shiver through him and he started and looked round him  hes a right cried the people round  hes a rare brave lad good lad  good lad  barton poured some brandy into his mouth the mists cleared a little and he realised where he was and what he had to do  but he was still very weak and he hardly dared to hope that he could survive another round  seconds out of the ring cried the referee  time  the croxley master sprang eagerly off his stool  keep clear of him go easy for a bit said barton and montgomery walked out to meet his man once more  he had had two lessonsthe one when the master got him into his corner the other when he had been lured into mixing it up with so powerful an antagonist  now he would be wary  another blow would finish him he could afford to run no risks  the master was determined to follow up his advantage and rushed at him slogging furiously right and left but montgomery was too young and active to be caught  he was strong upon his legs once more and his wits had all come back to him  it was a gallant sightthe lineofbattleship trying to pour its overwhelming broadside into the frigate and the frigate manoeuvring always so as to avoid it  the master tried all his ringcraft  he coaxed the student up by pretended inactivity he rushed at him with furious rushes towards the ropes  for three rounds he exhausted every wile in trying to get at him  montgomery during all this time was conscious that his strength was minute by minute coming back to him  the spinal jar from an uppercut is overwhelming but evanescent  he was losing all sense of it beyond a great stiffness of the neck  for the first round after his downfall he had been content to be entirely on the defensive only too happy if he could stall off the furious attacks of the master in the second he occasionally ventured upon a light counter  in the third he was smacking back merrily where he saw an opening  his people yelled their approval of him at the end of every round  even the ironworkers cheered him with that fine unselfishness which true sport engenders  to most of them unspiritual and unimaginative the sight of this cleanlimbed young apollo rising above disaster and holding on while consciousness was in him to his appointed task was the greatest thing their experience had ever known  but the masters naturally morose temper became more and more murderous at this postponement of his hopes  three rounds ago the battle had been in his hands now it was all to do over again  round by round his man was recovering his strength  by the fifteenth he was strong again in wind and limb  but the vigilant anastasia saw something which encouraged her  that bash in t ribs is telling on him jock she whispered why else should he be gulping t brandy  go in lad and thou hast him yet  montgomery had suddenly taken the flask from bartons hand and had a deep pull at the contents  then with his face a little flushed and with a curious look of purpose which made the referee stare hard at him in his eyes he rose for the sixteenth round  game as a pairtridge cried the publican as he looked at the hardset face  mix it oop lad  mix it oop cried the ironmen to their master and then a hum of exultation ran through their ranks as they realised that their tougher harder stronger man held the vantage after all neither of the men showed much sign of punishment  small gloves crush and numb but they do not cut  one of the masters eyes was even more flush with his cheek than nature had made it  montgomery had two or three livid marks upon his body and his face was haggard save for that pink spot which the brandy had brought into either cheek  he rocked a little as he stood opposite his man and his hands drooped as if he felt the gloves to be an unutterable weight  it was evident that he was spent and desperately weary  if he received one other blow it must surely be fatal to him  if he brought one home what power could there be behind it and what chance was there of its harming the colossus in front of him  it was the crisis of the fight  this round must decide it  mix it oop lad  mix it oop the ironmen whooped  even the savage eyes of the referee were unable to restrain the excited crowd  now at last the chance had come for montgomery  he had learned a lesson from his more experienced rival  why should he not play his own game upon him  he was spent but not nearly so spent as he pretended that brandy was to call up his reserves to let him have strength to take full advantage of the opening when it came  it was thrilling and tingling through his veins at the very moment when he was lurching and rocking like a beaten man  he acted his part admirably  the master felt that there was an easy task before him and rushed in with ungainly activity to finish it once for all  he slapbanged away left and right boring montgomery up against the ropes swinging in his ferocious blows with those animal grunts which told of the vicious energy behind them  but montgomery was too cool to fall a victim to any of those murderous uppercuts  he kept out of harms way with a rigid guard an active foot and a head which was swift to duck  and yet he contrived to present the same appearance of a man who is hopelessly done  the master weary from his own shower of blows and fearing nothing from so weak a man dropped his hand for an instant and at that instant montgomerys right came home  it was a magnificent blow straight clean crisp with the force of the loins and the back behind it  and it landed where he had meant it to upon the exact point of that bluegrained chin  flesh and blood could not stand such a blow in such a place  neither valour nor hardihood can save the man to whom it comes  the master fell backwards flat prostrate striking the ground with so simultaneous a clap that it was like a shutter falling from a wall  a yell which no referee could control broke from the crowded benches as the giant went down  he lay upon his back his knees a little drawn up his huge chest panting he twitched and shook but could not move  his feet pawed convulsively once or twice  it was no use  he was done  eightnineten said the timekeeper and the roar of a thousand voices with a deafening clap like the broadside of a ship told that the master of croxley was the master no more  montgomery stood half dazed looking down at the huge prostrate figure he could hardly realise that it was indeed all over  he saw the referee motion towards him with his hand  he heard his name bellowed in triumph from every side  and then he was aware of someone rushing towards him he caught a glimpse of a flushed face and an aureole of flying red hair a gloveless fist struck him between the eyes and he was on his back in the ring beside his antagonist while a dozen of his supporters were endeavouring to secure the frantic anastasia  he heard the angry shouting of the referee the screaming of the furious woman and the cries of the mob  then something seemed to break like an overstretched banjo string and he sank into the deep deep mistgirt abyss of unconsciousness  the dressing was like a thing in a dream and so was a vision of the master with the grin of a bulldog upon his face and his three teeth amiably protruded  he shook montgomery heartily by the hand  i would have been rare pleased to shake thee by the throttle lad a short while syne said he  but i bear no illfeeling again thee it was a rare poonch that brought me downi have not had a better since my second fight wi billy edwards in 89 happen thou might think o goin further wi this business  if thou dost and want a trainer theres not much inside t ropes as i dont know  or happen thou might like to try it wi me old style and bare knuckles  thou hast but to write to t ironworks to find me  but montgomery disclaimed any such ambition  a canvas bag with his share190 sovereignswas handed to him of which he gave ten to the master who also received some share of the gatemoney  then with young wilson escorting him on one side purvis on the other and fawcett carrying his bag behind he went in triumph to his carriage and drove amid a long roar which lined the highway like a hedge for the seven miles back to his startingpoint  its the greatest thing i ever saw in my life  by george its ripping cried wilson who had been left in a kind of ecstasy by the events of the day  theres a chap over barnsley way who fancies himself a bit  let us spring you on him and let him see what he can make of you  well put up a pursewont we purvis you shall never want a backer  at his weight said the publican im behind him i am for twenty rounds and no age country or colour barred  so am i cried fawcett middleweight champion of the world thats what he ishere in the same carriage with us  but montgomery was not to be beguiled  no i have my own work to do now  and what may that be  ill use this money to get my medical degree  well weve plenty of doctors but youre the only man in the riding that could smack the croxley master off his legs  however i suppose you know your own business best  when youre a doctor youd best come down into these parts and youll always find a job waiting for you at the wilson coalpits  montgomery had returned by devious ways to the surgery  the horses were smoking at the door and the doctor was just back from his long journey several patients had called in his absence and he was in the worst of tempers  i suppose i should be glad that you have come back at all mr montgomery he snarled  when next you elect to take a holiday i trust it will not be at so busy a time  i am sorry sir that you should have been inconvenienced  yes sir i have been exceedingly inconvenienced here for the first time he looked hard at the assistant  good heavens mr montgomery what have you been doing with your left eye  it was where anastasia had lodged her protest  montgomery laughed  it is nothing sir said he  and you have a livid mark under your jaw  it is indeed terrible that my representative should be going about in so disreputable a condition how did you receive these injuries  well sir as you know there was a little glovefight today over at croxley  and you got mixed up with that brutal crowd  i was rather mixed up with them  and who assaulted you  one of the fighters  which of them  the master of croxley  good heavens  perhaps you interfered with him  well to tell the truth i did a little  mr montgomery in such a practice as mine intimately associated as it is with the highest and most progressive elements of our small community it is impossible  but just then the tentative bray of a cornetplayer searching for his keynote jarred upon their ears and an instant later the wilson colliery brass band was in full cry with see the conquering hero comes outside the surgery window  there was a banner waving and a shouting crowd of miners  what is it  what does it mean cried the angry doctor  it means sir that i have in the only way which was open to me earned the money which is necessary for my education  it is my duty dr oldacre to warn you that i am about to return to the university and that you should lose no time in appointing my successor    the lord of chateau noir  it was in the days when the german armies had broken their way across france and when the shattered forces of the young republic had been swept away to the north of the aisne and to the south of the loire three broad streams of armed men had rolled slowly but irresistibly from the rhine now meandering to the north now to the south dividing coalescing but all uniting to form one great lake round paris  and from this lake there welled out smaller streamsone to the north one southward to orleans and a third westward to normandy  many a german trooper saw the sea for the first time when he rode his horse girthdeep into the waves at dieppe  black and bitter were the thoughts of frenchmen when they saw this weal of dishonour slashed across the fair face of their country  they had fought and they had been overborne  that swarming cavalry those countless footmen the masterful gunsthey had tried and tried to make head against them  in battalions their invaders were not to be beaten but man to man or ten to ten they were their equals  a brave frenchman might still make a single german rue the day that he had left his own bank of the rhine  thus unchronicled amid the battles and the sieges there broke out another war a war of individuals with foul murder upon the one side and brutal reprisal on the other  colonel von gramm of the 24th posen infantry had suffered severely during this new development  he commanded in the little norman town of les andelys and his outposts stretched amid the hamlets and farmhouses of the district round  no french force was within fifty miles of him and yet morning after morning he had to listen to a black report of sentries found dead at their posts or of foraging parties which had never returned  then the colonel would go forth in his wrath and farmsteadings would blaze and villages tremble but next morning there was still that same dismal tale to be told  do what he might he could not shake off his invisible enemies  and yet it should not have been so hard for from certain signs in common in the plan and in the deed it was certain that all these outrages came from a single source  colonel von gramm had tried violence and it had failed  gold might be more successful  he published it abroad over the countryside that 500frs  would be paid for information  there was no response  then 800frs  the peasants were incorruptible  then goaded on by a murdered corporal he rose to a thousand and so bought the soul of francois rejane farm labourer whose norman avarice was a stronger passion than his french hatred  you say that you know who did these crimes asked the prussian colonel eyeing with loathing the bluebloused ratfaced creature before him  yes colonel  and it was  those thousand francs colonel  not a sou until your story has been tested  come  who is it who has murdered my men  it is count eustace of chateau noir  you lie cried the colonel angrily  a gentleman and a nobleman could not have done such crimes  the peasant shrugged his shoulders  it is evident to me that you do not know the count  it is this way colonel  what i tell you is the truth and i am not afraid that you should test it  the count of chateau noir is a hard man even at the best time he was a hard man but of late he has been terrible  it was his sons death you know his son was under douay and he was taken and then in escaping from germany he met his death  it was the counts only child and indeed we all think that it has driven him mad  with his peasants he follows the german armies  i do not know how many he has killed but it is he who cut the cross upon the foreheads for it is the badge of his house  it was true  the murdered sentries had each had a saltire cross slashed across their brows as by a huntingknife  the colonel bent his stiff back and ran his forefinger over the map which lay upon the table  the chateau noir is not more than four leagues he said  three and a kilometre colonel  you know the place  i used to work there  colonel von gramm rang the bell  give this man food and detain him said he to the sergeant  why detain me colonel i can tell you no more  we shall need you as guide  as guide  but the count  if i were to fall into his hands ah colonel  the prussian commander waved him away  send captain baumgarten to me at once said he  the officer who answered the summons was a man of middleage heavyjawed blueeyed with a curving yellow moustache and a brickred face which turned to an ivory white where his helmet had sheltered it he was bald with a shining tightly stretched scalp at the back of which as in a mirror it was a favourite messjoke of the subalterns to trim their moustaches  as a soldier he was slow but reliable and brave  the colonel could trust him where a more dashing officer might be in danger  you will proceed to chateau noir tonight captain said he  a guide has been provided  you will arrest the count and bring him back if there is an attempt at rescue shoot him at once  how many men shall i take colonel  well we are surrounded by spies and our only chance is to pounce upon him before he knows that we are on the way  a large force will attract attention  on the other hand you must not risk being cut off  i might march north colonel as if to join general goeben  then i could turn down this road which i see upon your map and get to chateau noir before they could hear of us  in that case with twenty men  very good captain  i hope to see you with your prisoner tomorrow morning  it was a cold december night when captain baumgarten marched out of les andelys with his twenty poseners and took the main road to the north west  two miles out he turned suddenly down a narrow deeply rutted track and made swiftly for his man  a thin cold rain was falling swishing among the tall poplar trees and rustling in the fields on either side  the captain walked first with moser a veteran sergeant beside him  the sergeants wrist was fastened to that of the french peasant and it had been whispered in his ear that in case of an ambush the first bullet fired would be through his head  behind them the twenty infantrymen plodded along through the darkness with their faces sunk to the rain and their boots squeaking in the soft wet clay they knew where they were going and why and the thought upheld them for they were bitter at the loss of their comrades  it was a cavalry job they knew but the cavalry were all on with the advance and besides it was more fitting that the regiment should avenge its own dead men  it was nearly eight when they left les andelys  at halfpast eleven their guide stopped at a place where two high pillars crowned with some heraldic stonework flanked a huge iron gate  the wall in which it had been the opening had crumbled away but the great gate still towered above the brambles and weeds which had overgrown its base  the prussians made their way round it and advanced stealthily under the shadow of a tunnel of oak branches up the long avenue which was still cumbered by the leaves of last autumn  at the top they halted and reconnoitred  the black chateau lay in front of them  the moon had shone out between two rainclouds and threw the old house into silver and shadow  it was shaped like an l with a low arched door in front and lines of small windows like the open ports of a manofwar  above was a dark roof breaking at the corners into little round overhanging turrets the whole lying silent in the moonshine with a drift of ragged clouds blackening the heavens behind it  a single light gleamed in one of the lower windows  the captain whispered his orders to his men  some were to creep to the front door some to the back  some were to watch the east and some the west  he and the sergeant stole on tiptoe to the lighted window  it was a small room into which they looked very meanly furnished an elderly man in the dress of a menial was reading a tattered paper by the light of a guttering candle  he leaned back in his wooden chair with his feet upon a box while a bottle of white wine stood with a halffilled tumbler upon a stool beside him  the sergeant thrust his needlegun through the glass and the man sprang to his feet with a shriek  silence for your life  the house is surrounded and you cannot escape  come round and open the door or we will show you no mercy when we come in  for gods sake dont shoot  i will open it  i will open it he rushed from the room with his paper still crumpled up in his hand an instant later with a groaning of old locks and a rasping of bars the low door swung open and the prussians poured into the stoneflagged passage  where is count eustace de chateau noir  my master  he is out sir  out at this time of night  your life for a lie  it is true sir  he is out  where  i do not know  doing what  i cannot tell  no it is no use your cocking your pistol sir  you may kill me but you cannot make me tell you that which i do not know  is he often out at this hour  frequently  and when does he come home  before daybreak  captain baumgarten rasped out a german oath  he had had his journey for nothing then  the mans answers were only too likely to be true  it was what he might have expected  but at least he would search the house and make sure  leaving a picket at the front door and another at the back the sergeant and he drove the trembling butler in front of them his shaking candle sending strange flickering shadows over the old tapestries and the low oakraftered ceilings  they searched the whole house from the huge stoneflagged kitchen below to the dininghall on the second floor with its gallery for musicians and its panelling black with age but nowhere was there a living creature  up above in an attic they found marie the elderly wife of the butler but the owner kept no other servants and of his own presence there was no trace  it was long however before captain baumgarten had satisfied himself upon the point  it was a difficult house to search  thin stairs which only one man could ascend at a time connected lines of tortuous corridors  the walls were so thick that each room was cut off from its neighbour  huge fireplaces yawned in each while the windows were 6ft deep in the wall  captain baumgarten stamped with his feet tore down curtains and struck with the pommel of his sword  if there were secret hidingplaces he was not fortunate enough to find them  i have an idea said he at last speaking in german to the sergeant you will place a guard over this fellow and make sure that he communicates with no one  yes captain  and you will place four men in ambush at the front and at the back  it is likely enough that about daybreak our bird may return to the nest  and the others captain  let them have their suppers in the kitchen  the fellow will serve you with meat and wine  it is a wild night and we shall be better here than on the country road  and yourself captain  i will take my supper up here in the dininghall  the logs are laid and we can light the fire  you will call me if there is any alarm what can you give me for supperyou  alas monsieur there was a time when i might have answered what you wish but now it is all that we can do to find a bottle of new claret and a cold pullet  that will do very well  let a guard go about with him sergeant and let him feel the end of a bayonet if he plays us any tricks  captain baumgarten was an old campaigner  in the eastern provinces and before that in bohemia he had learned the art of quartering himself upon the enemy  while the butler brought his supper he occupied himself in making his preparations for a comfortable night  he lit the candelabrum of ten candles upon the centre table  the fire was already burning up crackling merrily and sending spurts of blue pungent smoke into the room  the captain walked to the window and looked out the moon had gone in again and it was raining heavily  he could hear the deep sough of the wind and see the dark loom of the trees all swaying in the one direction  it was a sight which gave a zest to his comfortable quarters and to the cold fowl and the bottle of wine which the butler had brought up for him  he was tired and hungry after his long tramp so he threw his sword his helmet and his revolverbelt down upon a chair and fell to eagerly upon his supper  then with his glass of wine before him and his cigar between his lips he tilted his chair back and looked about him  he sat within a small circle of brilliant light which gleamed upon his silver shoulderstraps and threw out his terracotta face his heavy eyebrows and his yellow moustache  but outside that circle things were vague and shadowy in the old dininghall  two sides were oakpanelled and two were hung with faded tapestry across which huntsmen and dogs and stags were still dimly streaming  above the fireplace were rows of heraldic shields with the blazonings of the family and of its alliances the fatal saltire cross breaking out on each of them  four paintings of old seigneurs of chateau noir faced the fireplace all men with hawk noses and bold high features so like each other that only the dress could distinguish the crusader from the cavalier of the fronde  captain baumgarten heavy with his repast lay back in his chair looking up at them through the clouds of his tobacco smoke and pondering over the strange chance which had sent him a man from the baltic coast to eat his supper in the ancestral hall of these proud norman chieftains  but the fire was hot and the captains eyes were heavy  his chin sank slowly upon his chest and the ten candles gleamed upon the broad white scalp  suddenly a slight noise brought him to his feet  for an instant it seemed to his dazed senses that one of the pictures opposite had walked from its frame  there beside the table and almost within arms length of him was standing a huge man silent motionless with no sign of life save his fierceglinting eyes  he was blackhaired oliveskinned with a pointed tuft of black beard and a great fierce nose towards which all his features seemed to run  his cheeks were wrinkled like a last years apple but his sweep of shoulder and bony corded hands told of a strength which was unsapped by age  his arms were folded across his arching chest and his mouth was set in a fixed smile  pray do not trouble yourself to look for your weapons he said as the prussian cast a swift glance at the empty chair in which they had been laid  you have been if you will allow me to say so a little indiscreet to make yourself so much at home in a house every wall of which is honeycombed with secret passages  you will be amused to hear that forty men were watching you at your supper  ah  what then  captain baumgarten had taken a step forward  with clenched fists the frenchman held up tho revolver which he grasped in his right hand while with the left he hurled the german back into his chair  pray keep your seat said he  you have no cause to trouble about your men  they have already been provided for  it is astonishing with these stone floors how little one can hear what goes on beneath you have been relieved of your command and have now only to think of yourself  may i ask what your  name is  i am captain baumgarten of the 24th posen regiment  your french is excellent though you incline like most of your countrymen to turn the p into a b  i have been amused to hear them cry avez bitie sur moi you know doubtless who it is who addresses you  the count of chateau noir  precisely  it would have been a misfortune if you had visited my chateau and i had been unable to have a word with you  i have had to do with many german soldiers but never with an officer before  i have much to talk to you about  captain baumgarten sat still in his chair  brave as he was there was something in this mans manner which made his skin creep with apprehension  his eyes glanced to right and to left but his weapons were gone and in a struggle he saw that he was but a child to this gigantic adversary  the count had picked up the claret bottle and held it to the light  tut tut said he  and was this the best that pierre could do for you i am ashamed to look you in the face captain baumgarten  we must improve upon this  he blew a call upon a whistle which hung from his shootingjacket the old manservant was in the room in an instant  chambertin from bin 15 he cried and a minute later a grey bottle streaked with cobwebs was carried in as a nurse bears an infant the count filled two glasses to the brim  drink said he  it is the very best in my cellars and not to be matched between rouen and paris  drink sir and be happy there are cold joints below  there are two lobsters fresh from honfleur  will you not venture upon a second and more savoury supper  the german officer shook his head  he drained the glass however and his host filled it once more pressing him to give an order for this or that dainty  there is nothing in my house which is not at your disposal  you have but to say the word  well then you will allow me to tell you a story while you drink your wine  i have so longed to tell it to some german officer  it is about my son my only child eustace who was taken and died in escaping  it is a curious little story and i think that i can promise you that you will never forget it  you must know then that my boy was in the artillerya fine young fellow captain baumgarten and the pride of his mother  she died within a week of the news of his death reaching us  it was brought by a brother officer who was at his side throughout and who escaped while my lad died  i want to tell  you all that he told me  eustace was taken at weissenburg on the 4th of august  the prisoners were broken up into parties and sent back into germany by different routes  eustace was taken upon the 5th to a village called lauterburg where he met with kindness from the german officer in command this good colonel had the hungry lad to supper offered him the best he had opened a bottle of good wine as i have tried to do for you and gave him a cigar from his own case  might i entreat you to take one from mine  the german again shook his head  his horror of his companion had increased as he sat watching the lips that smiled and the eyes that glared  the colonel as i say was good to my boy  but unluckily the prisoners were moved next day across the rhine into ettlingen they were not equally fortunate there  the officer who guarded them was a ruffian and a villain captain baumgarten  he took a pleasure in humiliating and illtreating the brave men who had fallen into his power  that night upon my son answering fiercely back to some taunt of his he struck him in the eye like this  the crash of the blow rang through the hall  the germans face fell forward his hand up and blood oozing through his fingers  the count settled down in his chair once more  my boy was disfigured by the blow and this villain made his appearance the object of his jeers  by the way you look a little comical yourself at the present moment captain and your colonel would certainly say that you had been getting into mischief  to continue however my boys youth and his destitutionfor his pockets were emptymoved the pity of a kindhearted major and he advanced him ten napoleons from his own pocket without security of any kind  into your hands captain baumgarten i return these ten gold pieces since i cannot learn the name of the lender  i am grateful from my heart for this kindness shown to my boy  the vile tyrant who commanded the escort accompanied the prisoners to durlack and from there to carlsruhe  he heaped every outrage upon my lad because the spirit of the chateau noirs would not stoop to turn away his wrath by a feigned submission  ay this cowardly villain whose hearts blood shall yet clot upon this hand dared to strike my son with his open hand to kick him to tear hairs from his moustache to use him thusand thusand thus  the german writhed and struggled  he was helpless in the hands of this huge giant whose blows were raining upon him  when at last blinded and halfsenseless he staggered to his feet it was only to be hurled back again into the great oaken chair  he sobbed in his impotent anger and shame  my boy was frequently moved to tears by the humiliation of his position continued the count  you will understand me when i say that it is a bitter thing to be helpless in the hands of an insolent and remorseless enemy  on arriving at carlsruhe however his face which had been wounded by the brutality of his guard was bound up by a young bavarian subaltern who was touched by his appearance  i regret to see that your eye is bleeding so  will you permit me to bind it with my silk handkerchief  he leaned forward but the german dashed his hand aside  i am in your power you monster he cried i can endure your brutalities but not your hypocrisy  the count shrugged his shoulders  i am taking things in their order just as they occurred said he i was under vow to tell it to the first german officer with whom i could talk teteatete  let me see i had got as far as the young bavarian at carlsruhe  i regret extremely that you will not permit me to use such slight skill in surgery as i possess  at carlsruhe my lad was shut up in the old caserne where he remained for a fortnight the worst pang of his captivity was that some unmannerly curs in the garrison would taunt him with his position as he sat by his window in the evening  that reminds me captain that you are not quite situated upon a bed of roses yourself are you now  you came to trap a wolf my man and now the beast has you down with his fangs in your throat a family man too i should judge by that wellfilled tunic  well a widow the more will make little matter and they do not usually remain widows long  get back  into the chair you dog  well to continue my storyat the end of a fortnight my son and his friend escaped  i need not trouble you with the dangers which they ran or with the privations which they endured  suffice it that to disguise themselves they had to take the clothes of two peasants whom they waylaid in a wood  hiding by day and travelling by night they had got as far into france as remilly and were within a milea single mile captainof crossing the german lines when a patrol of uhlans came right upon them  ah it was hard was it not when they had come so far and were so near to safety  the count blew a double call upon his whistle and three hardfaced peasants entered the room  these must represent my uhlans said he  well then the captain in command finding that these men were french soldiers in civilian dress within the german lines proceeded to hang them without trial or ceremony  i think jean that the centre beam is the strongest  the unfortunate soldier was dragged from his chair to where a noosed rope had been flung over one of the huge oaken rafters which spanned the room  the cord was slipped over his head and he felt its harsh grip round his throat  the three peasants seized the other end and looked to the count for his orders  the officer pale but firm folded his arms and stared defiantly at the man who tortured him  you are now face to face with death and i perceive from your lips that you are praying  my son was also face to face with death and he prayed also  it happened that a general officer came up and he heard the lad praying for his mother and it moved him sohe being himself a fatherthat he ordered his uhlans away and he remained with his aidedecamp only beside the condemned men  and when he heard all the lad had to tellthat he was the only child of an old family and that his mother was in failing healthhe threw off the rope as i throw off this and he kissed him on either cheek as i kiss you and he bade him go as i bid you go and may every kind wish of that noble general though it could not stave off the fever which slew my son descend now upon your head  and so it was that captain baumgarten disfigured blinded and bleeding staggered out into the wind and the rain of that wild december dawn    the striped chest   what do you make of her allardyce i asked  my second mate was standing beside me upon the poop with his short thick legs astretch for the gale had left a considerable swell behind it and our two quarterboats nearly touched the water with every roll he steadied his glass against the mizzenshrouds and he looked long and hard at this disconsolate stranger every time she came reeling up on to the crest of a roller and hung balanced for a few seconds before swooping down upon the other side  she lay so low in the water that i could only catch an occasional glimpse of a peagreen line of bulwark she was a brig but her mainmast had been snapped short off some 10ft above the deck and no effort seemed to have been made to cut away the wreckage which floated sails and yards like the broken wing of a wounded gull upon the water beside her  the foremast was still standing but the foretopsail was flying loose and the headsails were streaming out in long white pennons in front of her  never have i seen a vessel which appeared to have gone through rougher handling  but we could not be surprised at that for there had been times during the last three days when it was a question whether our own barque would ever see land again  for thirtysix hours we had kept her nose to it and if the mary sinclair had not been as good a seaboat as ever left the clyde we could not have gone through  and yet here we were at the end of it with the loss only of our gig and of part of the starboard bulwark it did not astonish us however when the smother had cleared away to find that others had been less lucky and that this mutilated brig staggering about upon a blue sea and under a cloudless sky had been left like a blinded man after a lightning flash to tell of the terror which is past  allardyce who was a slow and methodical scotchman stared long and hard at the little craft while our seamen lined the bulwark or clustered upon the fore shrouds to have a view of the stranger  in latitude 20 degrees and longitude 10 degrees which were about our bearings one becomes a little curious as to whom one meets for one has left the main lines of atlantic commerce to the north for ten days we had been sailing over  a solitary sea  shes derelict im thinking said the second mate  i had come to the same conclusion for i could see  no signs of life upon her deck and there was no answer to the friendly wavings from our seamen  the crew had probably deserted her under the impression that she was about to founder  she cant last long continued allardyce in his  measured way she may put her nose down and her tail up any minute  the waters lipping up to  the edge of her rail  whats her flag i asked  im trying to make out  its got all twisted and tangled with the halyards  yes ive got it now clear enough  its the brazilian flag but its wrong side up  she had hoisted a signal of distress then before  her people had abandoned her  perhaps they had only just gone  i took the mates glass and looked round over the tumultuous face of the deep blue atlantic still veined and starred with white lines and spoutings of foam  but nowhere could i see anything human beyond ourselves  there may be living men aboard said i  there may be salvage muttered the second mate  then we will run down upon her lee side and lie to  we were not more than a hundred yards from her when we swung our foreyard aback and there we were the barque and the brig ducking and bowing like two clowns in a dance  drop one of the quarterboats said i  take four men mr allardyce and see what you can learn  of her  but just at that moment my first officer mr armstrong came on deck for seven bells had struck and it was but a few minutes off his watch it would interest me to go myself to this abandoned vessel and to see what there might be aboard of her  so with a word to armstrong i swung myself over the side slipped down the falls and took my place in the sheets of the boat  it was but a little distance but it took some time to traverse and so heavy was the roll that often when we were in the trough of the sea we could not see either the barque which we had left or the brig which we were approaching  the sinking sun did not penetrate down there and it was cold and dark in the hollows of the waves but each passing billow heaved us up into the warmth and the sunshine once more  at each of these moments as we hung upon a whitecapped ridge between the two dark valleys i caught a glimpse of the long peagreen line and the nodding foremast of the brig and i steered so as to come round by her stern so that we might determine which was the best way of boarding her  as we passed her we saw the name nossa sehnora da vittoria painted across her dripping counter  the weather side sir said the second mate  stand by with the boathook carpenter  an instant later we had jumped over the bulwarks which were hardly higher than our boat and found ourselves upon the deck of the abandoned vessel  our first thought was to provide for our own safety in caseas seemed very probablethe vessel should settle down beneath our feet  with this object two of our men held on to the painter of the boat and fended her off from the vessels side so that she might be ready in case we had to make a hurried retreat the carpenter was sent to find out how much water there was and whether it was still gaming while the other seaman allardyce and myself made a rapid inspection of the vessel and her cargo  the deck was littered with wreckage and with hencoops in which the dead birds were washing about  the boats were gone with the exception of one the bottom of which had been stove and it was certain that the crew had abandoned the vessel  the cabin was in a deckhouse one side of which had been beaten in by a heavy sea  allardyce and i entered it and found the captains table as he had left it his books and papers all spanish or portuguesescattered over it with piles of cigarette ash everywhere  i looked about for the log but could not find it  as likely as not he never kept one said allardyce  things are pretty slack aboard a south american trader and they dont do more than they can help  if there was one it must have been taken away with him in the boat  i should like to take all these books and papers said i  ask the carpenter how much time we have  his report was reassuring  the vessel was full of water but some of the cargo was buoyant and there was no immediate danger of her sinking probably she would never sink but would drift about as one of those terrible unmarked reefs which have sent so many stout vessels to the bottom  in that case there is no danger in your going below mr allardyce said i  see what you can make of her and find out how much of her cargo may be saved  ill look through these papers while you are gone  the bills of lading and some notes and letters which lay upon the desk sufficed to inform me that the brazilian brig nossa sehnora da vittoria had cleared from bahia a month before  the name of the captain was texeira but there was no record as to the number of the crew  she was bound for london and a glance at the bills of lading was sufficient to show me that we were not likely to profit much in the way of salvage  her cargo consisted of nuts ginger and wood the latter in the shape of great logs of valuable tropical growths  it was these no doubt which had prevented the illfated vessel from going to the bottom but they were of such a size as to make it impossible for us to extract them  besides these there were a few fancy goods such as a number of ornamental birds for millinery purposes and a hundred cases of preserved fruits  and then as i turned over the papers i came upon a short note in english which arrested my attention     it is requested said the note that the various old spanish    and indian curiosities which came out of the santarem    collection and which are consigned to prontfoot  neuman    of oxford street london should be put in some place where    there may be no danger of these very valuable and unique articles    being injured or tampered with  this applies most particularly    to the treasurechest of don ramirez di leyra which must on    no account be placed where anyone can get at it  the treasurechest of don ramirez  unique and valuable articles here was a chance of salvage after all  i had risen to my feet with the paper in my hand when my scotch mate appeared in the doorway  im thinking all isnt quite as it should be aboard  of this ship sir said he  he was a hardfaced man and yet i could see that he had been startled  whats the matter  murders the matter sir  theres a man here with his brains beaten out  killed in the storm said i  may be so sir but ill be surprised if you think so after you have seen him  where is he then  this way sir here in the maindeck house  there appeared to have been no accommodation below in the brig for there was the afterhouse for the captain another by the main hatchway with the cooks galley attached to it and a third in the forecastle for the men  it was to this middle one that the mate led me  as you entered the galley with its litter of tumbled pots and dishes was upon the right and upon the left was a small room with two bunks for the officers  then beyond there was a place about 12ft square which was littered with flags and spare canvas  all round the walls were a number of packets done up in coarse cloth and carefully lashed to the woodwork  at the other end was a great box striped red and white though the red was so faded and the white so dirty that it was only where the light fell directly upon it that one could see the colouring the box was by subsequent measurement 4ft 3ins in length 3ft 2ins in height and 3ft acrossconsiderably larger than a seamans chest but it was not to the box that my eyes or my thoughts were turned as i entered the  storeroom  on the floor lying across the litter of bunting there was stretched a small dark man with a short curling beard  he lay as far as it was possible from the box with his feet towards it and his head away  a crimson patch was printed upon the white canvas on which his head was resting and little red ribbons wreathed themselves round his swarthy neck and trailed away on to the floor but there was no sign of a wound that i could see and his face was as placid as that of a sleeping child  it was only when i stooped that i could perceive his injury and then i turned away with an exclamation of horror  he had been poleaxed apparently by some person standing behind him  a frightful blow had smashed in the top of his head and penetrated deeply into his brains  his face might well be placid for death must have been absolutely instantaneous and the position of the wound showed that he could never have seen the person who had inflicted it  is that foul play or accident captain barclay asked my second mate demurely  you are quite right mr allardyce  the man has been murderedstruck down from above by a sharp and heavy weapon  but who was he and why did they murder him  he was a common seaman sir said the mate  you can see that if you look at his fingers  he turned out his pockets as he spoke and brought to light a pack of cards some tarred string and a bundle  of brazilian tobacco  hello look at this said he  it was a large open knife with a stiff spring blade which he had picked up from the floor  the steel was shining and bright so that we could not associate it with the crime and yet the dead man had apparently held it in his hand when he was struck down for it still lay within his grasp  it looks to me sir as if he knew he was in danger and kept his knife handy said the mate  however we cant help the poor beggar now i cant make out these things that are lashed to the wall  they seem to be idols and weapons and curios of all sorts done up in old sacking  thats right said i  they are the only things of value that we are likely to get from the cargo  hail the barque and tell them to send the other quarterboat to help us to get the stuff aboard  while he was away i examined this curious plunder which had come into our possession  the curiosities were so wrapped up that i could only form a general idea as to their nature but the striped box stood in a good light where i could thoroughly examine it  on the lid which was clamped and cornered with metalwork there was engraved a complex coat of arms and beneath it was a line of spanish which i was able to decipher as meaning the treasurechest of don ramirez di leyra knight of the order of saint james governor and captaingeneral of terra firma and of the province of veraquas  in one corner was the date 1606 and on the other a large white label upon which was written in english you are earnestly requested upon no account to open this box the same warning was repeated underneath in spanish  as to the lock it was a very complex and heavy one of engraved steel with a latin motto which was above a seamans comprehension  by the time i had finished this examination of the peculiar box the other quarterboat with mr armstrong the first officer had come alongside and we began to carry out and place in her the various curiosities which appeared to be the only objects worth moving from the derelict ship  when she was full i sent her back to the barque and then allardyce and i with the carpenter and one seaman shifted the striped box which was the only thing left to our boat and lowered it over balancing it upon the two middle thwarts for it was so heavy that it would have given the boat a dangerous tilt had we placed it at either end  as to the dead man we left him where we had found him  the mate had a theory that at the moment of the desertion of the ship this fellow had started plundering and that the captain in an attempt to preserve discipline had struck him down with a hatchet or some other heavy weapon it seemed more probable than any other explanation and yet it did not entirely satisfy me either  but the ocean is full of mysteries and we were content to leave the fate of the dead seaman of the brazilian brig to be added to that long list which every sailor can recall  the heavy box was slung up by ropes on to the deck of the mary sinclair and was carried by four seamen into the cabin where between the table and the afterlockers there was just space for it to stand there it remained during supper and after that meal the mates remained with me and discussed over a glass of grog the event of the day mr armstrong was a long thin vulturelike man an excellent seaman but famous for his nearness and cupidity  our treasuretrove had excited him greatly and already he had begun with glistening eyes to reckon up how much it might be worth to each of us when the shares of the salvage came to be divided  if the paper said that they were unique mr barclay then they may be worth anything that you like to name  you wouldnt believe the sums that the rich collectors give  a thousand pounds is nothing to them well have something to show for our voyage or i am mistaken  i dont think that said i  as far as i can see they are not very different from any other south american curios  well sir ive traded there for fourteen voyages and i have never seen anything like that chest before  thats worth a pile of money just as it stands  but its so heavy that surely there must be something valuable inside it  dont you think that we ought to open it and see  if you break it open you will spoil it as likely as not said the second mate  armstrong squatted down in front of it with his head on one side and his long thin nose within a few inches of the lock  the wood is oak said he and it has shrunk a little with age  if i had a chisel or a strongbladed knife i could force the lock back without doing any damage at all  the mention of a strongbladed knife made me think of the dead seaman upon the brig  i wonder if he could have been on the job when someone came to interfere with him said i  i dont know about that sir but i am perfectly certain that i could open the box  theres a screwdriver here in the locker  just hold the lamp allardyce and ill have it done in a brace of shakes  wait a bit said i for already with eyes which gleamed with curiosity and with avarice he was stooping over the lid  i dont see that there is any hurry over this matter  youve read that card which warns us not to open it  it may mean anything or it may mean nothing but somehow i feel inclined to obey it  after all whatever is in it will keep and if it is valuable it will be worth as much if it is opened in the owners offices as in the cabin of the mary sinclair  the first officer seemed bitterly disappointed at my decision  surely sir you are not superstitious about it said he with a slight sneer upon his thin lips  if it gets out of our own hands and we dont see for ourselves what is inside it we may be done out of our rights besides  thats enough mr armstrong said i abruptly  you may have every confidence that you will get your rights but i will not have that box opened tonight  why the label itself shows that the box has been examined by europeans allardyce added  because a box is a treasurebox is no reason that it has treasures inside it now  a good many folk have had a peep into it since the days of the old governor of terra firma  armstrong threw the screwdriver down upon the table and shrugged his shoulders  just as you like said he but for the rest of the evening although we spoke upon many subjects i noticed that his eyes were continually coming round with the same expression of curiosity and greed to the old striped box  and now i come to that portion of my story which fills me even now with a shuddering horror when i think of it  the main cabin had the rooms of the officers round it but mine was the farthest away from it at the end of the little passage which led to the companion  no regular watch was kept by me except in cases of emergency and the three mates divided the watches among them  armstrong had the middle watch which ends at four in the morning and he was relieved by allardyce  for my part i have always been one of the soundest of sleepers and it is rare for anything less than a hand upon my shoulder to arouse me  and yet i was aroused that night or rather in the early grey of the morning  it was just halfpast four by my chronometer when something caused me to sit up in my berth wide awake and with every nerve tingling  it was a sound of some sort a crash with a human cry at the end of it which still jarred on my ears  i sat listening but all was now silent  and yet it could not have been imagination that hideous cry for the echo of it still rang in my head and it seemed to have come from some place quite close to me  i sprang from my bunk and pulling on some clothes i made my way into the cabin  at first i saw nothing unusual there  in the cold grey light i made out the redclothed table the six rotating chairs the walnut lockers the swinging barometer and there at the end the big striped chest  i was turning away with the intention of going upon deck and asking the second mate if he had heard anything when my eyes fell suddenly upon something which projected from under the table  it was the leg of a mana leg with a long seaboot upon it  i stooped and there was a figure sprawling upon his face his arms thrown forward and his body twisted  one glance told me that it was armstrong the first officer and a second that he was a dead man  for a few moments i stood gasping then i rushed on to the deck called allardyce to my assistance and came back with him into the cabin  together we pulled the unfortunate fellow from under the table and as we looked at his dripping head we exchanged glances and i do not know which was the paler of the two  the same as the spanish sailor said i  the very same  god preserve us  its that infernal chest  look at armstrongs hand  he held up the mates right hand and there was the screwdriver which he had wished to use the night before  hes been at the chest sir  he knew that i was on deck and you were asleep  he knelt down in front of it and he pushed the lock back with that tool  then something happened to him and he cried out so that you heard him  allardyce i whispered what could have happened to him  the second mate put his hand upon my sleeve and drew me into his cabin  we can talk here sir and we dont know who may be listening to us in there  what do you suppose is in that box captain barclay  i give you my word allardyce that i have no idea  well i can only find one theory which will fit all the facts  look at the size of the box  look at all the carving and metalwork which may conceal any number of holes  look at the weight of it it took four men to carry it  on top of that remember that two men have tried to open it and both have come to their end through it  now sir what can it mean except one thing  you mean there is a man in it  of course there is a man in it  you know how it is in these south american states sir  a man may be president one week and hunted like a dog the nextthey are for ever flying for their lives  my idea is that there is some fellow in hiding there who is armed and desperate and who will fight to the death before he is taken  but his food and drink  its a roomy chest sir and he may have some provisions stowed away as to his drink he had a friend among the crew upon the brig who saw that he had what he needed  you think then that the label asking people not to open the box was simply written in his interest  yes sir that is my idea  have you any other way of explaining the facts  i had to confess that i had not  the question is what we are to do i asked  the mans a dangerous ruffian who sticks at nothing  im thinking it wouldnt be a bad thing to put a rope round the chest and tow it alongside for half an hour then we could open it at our ease  or if we just tied the box up and kept him from getting any water maybe that would do as well  or the carpenter could put a coat of varnish over it and stop all the blowholes  come allardyce said i angrily  you dont seriously mean to say that a whole ships company are going to be terrorised by a single man in a box  if hes there ill engage to fetch him out i went to my room and came back with my revolver in my hand  now allardyce said i do you open the lock and ill stand on guard  for gods sake think what you are doing sir cried the mate  two men have lost their lives over it and the blood of one not yet dry upon the carpet  the more reason why we should revenge him  well sir at least let me call the carpenter  three are better than two and he is a good stout man  he went off in search of him and i was left alone with the striped chest in the cabin  i dont think that im a nervous man but i kept the table between me and this solid old relic of the spanish main in the growing light of morning the red and white striping was beginning to appear and the curious scrolls and wreaths of metal and carving which showed the loving pains which cunning craftsmen had expended upon it  presently the carpenter and the mate came back together the former with a hammer in his hand  its a bad business this sir said he shaking his head as he looked at the body of the mate  and you think theres someone hiding in the box  theres no doubt about it said allardyce picking up the screwdriver and setting his jaw like a man who needs to brace his courage ill drive the lock back if you will both stand by  if he rises let him have it on the head with your hammer carpenter  shoot at once sir if he raises his hand  now  he had knelt down in front of the striped chest and passed the blade of the tool under the lid  with a sharp snick the lock flew back  stand by yelled the mate and with a heave he threw open the massive top of the box  as it swung up we all three sprang back i with my pistol levelled and the carpenter with the hammer above his head  then as nothing happened we each took a step forward and peeped in  the box was empty  not quite empty either for in one corner was lying an old yellow candlestick elaborately engraved which appeared to be as old as the box itself  its rich yellow tone and artistic shape suggested that it was an object of value  for the rest there was nothing more weighty or valuable than dust in the old striped treasurechest  well im blessed cried allardyce staring blankly into it where does the weight come in then  look at the thickness of the sides and look at the lid  why its five inches through  and see that great metal spring across it  thats for holding the lid up said the mate  you see it wont lean back  whats that german printing on the inside  it means that it was made by johann rothstein of augsburg in 1606  and a solid bit of work too  but it doesnt throw much light on what has passed does it captain barclay  that candlestick looks like gold we shall have something for our trouble after all  he leant forward to grasp it and from that moment i have never doubted as to the reality of inspiration for on the instant i caught him by the collar and pulled him straight again  it may have been some story of the middle ages which had come back to my mind or it may have been that my eye had caught some red which was not that of rust upon the upper part of the lock but to him and to me it will always seem an inspiration so prompt and sudden was my action  theres devilry here said i  give me the crooked stick from the corner  it was an ordinary walkingcane with a hooked top  i passed it over the candlestick and gave it a pull  with a flash a row of polished steel fangs shot out from below the upper lip and the great striped chest snapped at us like a wild animal  clang came the huge lid into its place and the glasses on the swinging rack sang and tinkled with the shock  the mate sat down on the edge of the table and shivered like a frightened horse  youve saved my life captain barclay said he  so this was the secret of the striped treasurechest of old don ramirez di leyra and this was how he preserved his illgotten gains from the terra firma and the province of veraquas  be the thief ever so cunning he could not tell that golden candlestick from the other articles of value and the instant that he laid hand upon it the terrible spring was unloosed and the murderous steel pikes were driven into his brain while the shock of the blow sent the victim backward and enabled the chest to automatically close itself  how many i wondered had fallen victims to the ingenuity of the mechanic of ausgburg  and as i thought of the possible history of that grim striped chest my resolution was very quickly taken  carpenter bring three men and carry this on deck  going to throw it overboard sir  yes mr allardyce  im not superstitious as a rule but there are some things which are more than a sailor can be called upon to stand  no wonder that brig made heavy weather captain barclay with such a thing on board  the glass is dropping fast sir and we are only just in time  so we did not even wait for the three sailors but we carried it out the mate the carpenter and i and we pushed it with our own hands over the bulwarks  there was a white spout of water and it was gone  there it lies the striped chest a thousand fathoms deep and if as they say the sea will some day be dry land i grieve for the man who finds that old box and tries to penetrate into its secret    a shadow before   the 15th of july 1870 found john worlington dodds a ruined gamester of the stock exchange  upon the 17th he was a very opulent man  and yet he had effected the change without leaving the penurious little irish townlet of dunsloe which could have been bought outright for a quarter of the sum which he had earned during the single day that he was within its walls  there is a romance of finance yet to be written a story of huge forces which are for ever waxing and waning of bold operations of breathless suspense of agonised failure of deep combinations which are baffled by others still more subtle  the mighty debts of each great european power stand like so many columns of mercury for ever rising and falling to indicate the pressure upon each he who can see far enough into the future to tell how that evervarying column will stand tomorrow is the man who has fortune within his grasp  john worlington dodds had many of the gifts which lead a speculator to success  he was quick in observing just in estimating prompt and fearless in acting  but in finance there is always the element of luck which however one may eliminate it still remains like the blank at roulette a constantly present handicap upon the operator  and so it was that worlington dodds had come to grief  on the best advices he had dabbled in the funds of a south american republic in the days before south american republics had been found out  the republic defaulted and dodds lost his money  he had bulled the shares of a scotch railway and a four months strike had hit him hard  he had helped to underwrite a coffee company in the hope that the public would come along upon the feed and gradually nibble away some of his holding but the political sky had been clouded and the public had refused to invest  everything which he had touched had gone wrong and now on the eve of his marriage young clearheaded and energetic he was actually a bankrupt had his creditors chosen to make him one  but the stock exchange is an indulgent body   what is the case of one today may be that of another tomorrow and everyone is interested in seeing that the stricken man is given time to rise again  so the burden of worlington dodds was lightened for him many shoulders helped to bear it and he was able to go for a little summer tour into ireland for the doctors had ordered him rest and change of air to restore his shaken nervous system  thus it was that upon the 15th of july 1870 he found himself at his breakfast in the flyblown coffeeroom of the george hotel in the market square of dunsloe  it is a dull and depressing coffeeroom and one which is usually empty but on this particular day it was as crowded and noisy as that of any london hotel  every table was occupied and a thick smell of fried bacon and of fish hung in the air  heavily booted men clattered in and out spurs jingled ridingcrops were stacked in corners and there was a general atmosphere of horse  the conversation too was of nothing else  from every side worlington dodds heard of yearlings of windgalls of roarers of spavins of cribsuckers of a hundred other terms which were as unintelligible to  him as his own stock exchange jargon would have been to the company  he asked the waiter for the reason of it all and the waiter was an astonished man that there should be any man in this world who did not know it  shure its the dunsloe horse fair your honourthe greatest horsefair in all oireland  it lasts for a wake and the folk come from far an nearfrom england an scotland an iverywhere  if you look out of the winder your honour youll see the horses and its asy your honours conscience must be or you wouldnt slape so sound that the creatures didnt rouse you with their clatter  dodds had a recollection that he had heard a confused murmur which had interwoven itself with his dreamsa sort of steady rhythmic beating and clankingand now when he looked through the window he saw the cause of it  the square was packed with horses from end to endgreys bays browns blacks chestnutsyoung ones and old fine ones and coarse horses of every conceivable sort and size  it seemed a huge function for so small a town and he remarked as much to the waiter  well you see your honour the horses dont live in the town an they dont vex their heads how small it is  but its in the very centre of the horsebradin districts of oireland so where should they come to be sould if it wasnt to dunsloe  the waiter had a telegram in his hand and he turned the address to worlington dodds  shure i niver heard such a name sorr  maybe you could tell me who owns it  dodds looked at the envelope  strellenhaus was the name  no i dont know said he  i never heard it before  its a foreign name perhaps if you were  but at that moment a little roundfaced ruddycheeked gentleman who was breakfasting at the next table leaned forward and interrupted him  did you say a foreign name sir said he  strellenhaus is the name  i am mr strellenhausmr julius strellenhaus of liverpool  i was expecting a telegram  thank you very much  he sat so near that dodds without any wish to play the spy could not help to some extent overlooking him as he opened the envelope the message was a very long one  quite a wad of melontinted paper came out from the tawny envelope  mr strellenhaus arranged the sheets methodically upon the tablecloth in front of him so that no eye but his own could see them  then he took out a notebook and with an anxious face he began to make entries in it glancing first at the telegram and then at the book and writing apparently one letter or figure at a time  dodds was interested for he knew exactly what the man was doing  he was working out a cipher  dodds had often done it himself  and then suddenly the little man turned very pale as if the full purport of the message had been a shock to him  dodds had done that also and his sympathies were all with his neighbours  then the stranger rose and leaving his breakfast untasted he walked out of the room  im thinkin that the gintleman has had bad news sorr said the confidential waiter  looks like it dodds answered and at that moment his thoughts were suddenly drawn off into another direction  the boots had entered the room with a telegram in his hand  wheres mr mancune said he to the waiter  well there are some quare names about  what was it you said  mr mancune said the boots glancing round him  ah there he is and he handed the telegram to a gentleman who was sitting reading the paper in a corner  doddss eyes had already fallen upon this man and he had wondered vaguely what he was doing in such company  he was a tall whitehaired eaglenosed gentleman with a waxed moustache and a carefully pointed beardan aristocratic type which seemed out of its element among the rough hearty noisy dealers who surrounded him  this then was mr mancune for whom the second telegram was intended  as he opened it tearing it open with a feverish haste dodds could perceive that it was as bulky as the first one  he observed also from the delay in reading it that it was also in some sort of cipher the gentleman did not write down any translation of it but he sat for some time with his nervous thin fingers twitching amongst the hairs of his white beard and his shaggy brows bent in the deepest and most absorbed attention whilst he mastered the meaning of it  then he sprang suddenly to his feet his eyes flashed his cheeks flushed and in his excitement he crumpled the message up in his hand  with an effort he mastered his emotion put the paper into his pocket and walked out of the room  this was enough to excite a less astute and imaginative man than worlington dodds  was there any connection between these two messages or was it merely a coincidence  two men with strange names receive two telegrams within a few minutes of each other each of considerable length each in cipher and each causing keen emotion to the man who received it  one turned pale  the other sprang excitedly to his feet it might be a coincidence but it was a very curious one  if it was not a coincidence then what could it mean  were they confederates who pretended to work apart but who each received identical orders from some person at a distance  that was possible and yet there were difficulties in the way  he puzzled and puzzled but could find no satisfactory solution to the problem  all breakfast he was turning it over in his mind  when breakfast was over he sauntered out into the market square where the horse sale was already in progress  the yearlings were being sold firsttall longlegged skittish wildeyed creatures who had run free upon the upland pastures with ragged hair and towsie manes but hardy inured to all weathers and with the makings of splendid hunters and steeplechasers when corn and time had brought them to maturity they were largely of thoroughbred blood and were being bought by english dealers who would invest a few pounds now on what they might sell for fifty guineas in a year if all went well  it was legitimate speculation for the horse is a delicate creature he is afflicted with many ailments the least accident may destroy his value he is a certain expense and an uncertain profit and for one who comes safely to maturity several may bring no return at all  so the english horsedealers took their risks as they bought up the shaggy irish yearlings  one man with a ruddy face and a yellow overcoat took them by the dozen with as much sang froid as if they had been oranges entering each bargain in a bloated notebook  he bought forty or fifty during the time that dodds was watching him  who is that he asked his neighbour whose spurs and gaiters showed that he was likely to know  the man stared in astonishment at the strangers ignorance why thats jim holloway the great jim holloway said he then seeing by the blank look upon doddss face that even this information had not helped him much he went into details  sure hes the head of holloway  morland of london said he  hes the buying partner and he buys cheap and the other stays at home and sells and he sells dear he owns more horses than any man in the world and asks the best money for them  i dare say youll find that half of what are sold at the dunsloe fair this day will go to him and hes got such a purse that theres not a man who can bid against him  worlington dodds watched the doings of the great dealer with interest he had passed on now to the twoyearolds and threeyearolds fullgrown horses but still a little loose in the limb and weak in the bone  the london buyer was choosing his animals carefully but having chosen them the vigour of his competition drove all other bidders out of it  with a careless nod he would run the figure up five pounds at a time until he was left in possession of the field  at the same time he was a shrewd observer and when as happened more than once he believed that someone was bidding against him simply in order to run him up the head would cease suddenly to nod the notebook would be closed with a snap and the intruder would be left with a purchase which he did not desire upon his hands  all doddss business instincts were aroused by the tactics of this great operator and he stood in the crowd watching with the utmost interest all that occurred  it is not to buy young horses however that the great dealers come to ireland and the real business of the fair commenced when the four and fiveyearolds were reached the fullgrown perfect horses at their prime and ready for any work or any fatigue  seventy magnificent creatures had been brought down by a single breeder a comfortable looking keeneyed ruddycheeked gentleman who stood beside the salesman and whispered cautions and precepts into his ear  thats flynn of kildare said doddss informant  jack flynn has brought down that string of horses and the other large string over yonder belongs to tom flynn his brother  the two of them together are the two first breeders in ireland a crowd had gathered in front of the horses  by common consent a place had been made for mr holloway and dodds could catch a glimpse of his florid face and yellow covertcoat in the front rank  he had opened his notebook and was tapping his teeth reflectively with his pencil as he eyed the horses  youll see a fight now between the first seller and the first buyer in the country said doddss acquaintance  they are a beautiful string anyhow  i shouldnt be surprised if he didnt average  fiveandthirty pound apiece for the lot as they stand  the salesman had mounted upon a chair and his keen cleanshaven face overlooked the crowd  mr jack flynns grey whiskers were at his elbow and mr holloway immediately in front  youve seen these horses gentlemen said the salesman with a backward sweep of his hand towards the line of tossing heads and streaming manes  when you know that they are bred by mr jack flynn at his place in kildare you will have a guarantee of their quality they are the best that ireland can produce and in this class of horse the best that ireland can produce are the best in the world as every riding man knows well  hunters or carriage horses all warranted sound and bred from the best stock  there are seventy in mr jack flynns string and he bids me say that if any wholesale dealer would make one bid for the whole lot to save time he would have the preference over any purchaser  there was a pause and a whisper from the crowd in front with some expressions of discontent  by a single sweep all the small dealers had been put out of it  it was only a long purse which could buy on  such a scale as that  the salesman looked round him inquiringly  come mr holloway said he at last you didnt come over here for the sake of the scenery  you may travel the country and not see such another string of horses  give us a starting bid  the great dealer was still rattling his pencil upon his front teeth well said he at last they are a fine lot of horses and i wont deny it  they do you credit mr flynn i am sure  all the same i didnt mean to fill a ship at a single  bid in this fashion  i like to pick and choose my horses  in that case mr flynn is quite prepared to sell them in smaller lots said the salesman  it was rather for the convenience of a wholesale customer that he was prepared to put them all up together  but if no gentleman wishes to bid  wait a minute said a voice  they are very fine horses these and i will give you a bid to start you  i will give you twenty pounds each for the string of seventy  there was a rustle as the crowd all swayed their heads to catch a glimpse of the speaker  the salesman leaned forward  may i ask your name sir  strellenhausmr strellenhaus of liverpool  its a new firm said doddss neighbour  i thought i knew them all but i never heard of him before  the salesmans head had disappeared for he was whispering with the breeder  now he suddenly straightened himself again  thank you for giving us a lead sir said he  now gentlemen you have heard the offer of mr strellenhaus of liverpool  it will give us a base to start from  mr strellenhaus has offered twenty pounds a head  guineas said holloway  bravo mr holloway  i knew that you would take a hand  you are not the man to let such a string of horses pass away from you  the bid is twenty guineas a head  twentyfive pounds said mr strellenhaus  twentysix  thirty  it was london against liverpool and it was the head of the trade against an outsider  still the one man had increased his bids by fives and the other only by ones  those fives meant determination and also wealth  holloway had ruled the market so long that the crowd was delighted at finding someone who would stand up to him  the bid now stands at thirty pounds a head said the salesman the word lies with you mr holloway  the london dealer was glancing keenly at his unknown opponent and he was asking himself whether this was a genuine rival or whether it was a device of some sortan agent of flynns perhapsfor running up the price  little mr strellenhaus the same applefaced gentleman whom dodds had noticed in the coffeeroom stood looking at the horses with the sharp quick glances of a man who knows what he is looking for  thirtyone said holloway with the air of a man who has gone to his extreme limit  thirtytwo said strellenhaus promptly  holloway grew angry at this persistent opposition  his red face flushed redder still  thirtythree he shouted  thirtyfour said strellenhaus  holloway became thoughtful and entered a few figures in his notebook there were seventy horses  he knew that flynns stock was always of the highest quality  with the hunting season coming on he might rely upon selling them at an average of from fortyfive to fifty  some of them might carry a heavy weight and would run to three figures  on the other hand there was the feed and keep of them for three months the danger of the voyage the chance of influenza or some of those other complaints which run through an entire stable as measles go through a nursery  deducting all this it was a question whether at the present price any profit would be left upon the transaction  every pound that he bid meant seventy out of his pocket  and yet he could not submit to be beaten by this stranger without a struggle  as a business matter it was important to him to be recognised as the head of his profession he would make one more effort if he sacrificed his profit by doing so  at the end of your rope mr holloway asked the salesman with the suspicion of a sneer  thirtyfive cried holloway gruffly  thirtysix said strellenhaus  then i wish you joy of your bargain said holloway  i dont buy at that price but i should be  glad to sell you some  mr strellenhaus took no notice of the irony  he was still looking critically at the horses  the salesman glanced round him in a perfunctory way  thirtysix pounds bid said he  mr jack flynns lot is going to mr strellenhaus of liverpool at thirtysix pounds a head  goinggoing  forty cried a high thin clear voice  a buzz rose from the crowd and they were all on tiptoe again trying to catch a glimpse of this reckless buyer  being a tall man dodds could see over the others and there at the side of holloway he saw the masterful nose and aristocratic beard of the second stranger in the coffeeroom  a sudden personal interest added itself to the scene he felt that he was on the verge of somethingsomething dimly seen which he could himself turn to account  the two men with strange names the telegrams the horseswhat was underlying it all  the salesman was all animation again and mr jack flynn was sitting up with his white whiskers bristling and his eyes twinkling  it was the best deal which he had ever made in his fifty years of experience  what name sir asked the salesman  mr mancune  address  mr mancune of glasgow  thank you for your bid sir  forty pounds a head has been bid by mr mancune of glasgow  any advance upon forty  fortyone said strellenhaus  fortyfive said mancune  the tactics had changed and it was the turn of strellenhaus now to advance by ones while his rival sprang up by fives  but the former was as dogged as ever  fortysix said he  fifty cried mancune  it was unheard of  the most that the horses could possibly average at a retail price was as much as these men were willing to pay wholesale  two lunatics from bedlam whispered the angry holloway  if i was flynn i would see the colour of their money before i went any further  the same thought had occurred to the salesman  as a mere matter of business gentlemen said he it is usual in such cases to put down a small deposit as a guarantee of bona fides  you will understand how i am placed and that i have not had the pleasure of doing business with either of you before  how much asked strellenhaus briefly  should we say five hundred  here is a note for a thousand pounds  and here is another said mancune  nothing could be more handsome gentlemen said the salesman  its a treat to see such a spirited competition  the last bid was fifty pounds a head from mancune  the word lies with you mr strellenhaus  mr jack flynn whispered something to the salesman  quite so mr flynn suggests gentlemen that as you are both large buyers it would perhaps be a convenience to you if he was to add the string of mr tom flynn which consists of seventy animals of precisely the same quality making one hundred and forty in all  have you any objection mr mancune  no sir  and you mr strellenhaus  i should prefer it  very handsome very handsome indeed murmured the salesman  then i understand mr mancune that your offer of fifty pounds a head extends to the whole of these horses  yes sir  a long breath went up from the crowd  seven thousand pounds at one deal  it was a record for dunsloe  any advance mr strellenhaus  fiftyone  fiftyfive  fiftysix  sixty  they could hardly believe their ears  holloway stood with his mouth open staring blankly in front of him  the salesman tried hard to look as if such bidding and such prices were nothing unusual  jack flynn of kildare smiled benignly and rubbed his hands together  the crowd listened in dead silence  sixtyone said strellenhaus  from the beginning he had stood without a trace of emotion upon his round face like a little automatic figure which bid by clockwork  his rival was of a more excitable nature  his eyes were shining and he was for ever twitching at his beard  sixtyfive he cried  sixtysix  seventy  but the clockwork had run down  no answering bid came from mr strellenhaus  seventy bid sir  mr strellenhaus shrugged his shoulders  i am buying for another and i have reached his limit said he if you will permit me to send for instructions  i am afraid sir that the sale must proceed  then the horses belong to this gentleman  for the first time he turned towards his rival and their glances crossed like swordblades it is possible that i may see the horses again  i hope so said mr mancune and his white waxed moustache gave a feline upward bristle  so with a bow they separated  mr strellenhaus walked down to the telegraphoffice where his message was delayed because mr worlington dodds was already at the end of the wires for after dim guesses and vague conjecture he had suddenly caught a clear view of this coming event which had cast so curious a shadow before it in this little irish town  political rumours names appearances telegrams seasoned horses at any price there could only be one meaning to it  he held a secret and he meant to use it  mr warner who was the partner of mr worlington dodds and who was suffering from the same eclipse had gone down to the stock exchange but had found little consolation there for the european system was in a ferment and rumours of peace and of war were succeeding each other with such rapidity and assurance that it was impossible to know which to trust  it was obvious that a fortune lay either way for every rumour set the funds fluctuating but without special information it was impossible to act and no one dared to plunge heavily upon the strength of newspaper surmise and the gossip of the street  warner knew that an hours work might resuscitate the fallen fortunes of himself and his partner and yet he could not afford to make a mistake  he returned to his office in the afternoon half inclined to back the chances of peace for of all war scares not one in ten comes to pass  as he entered the office a telegram lay upon the table  it was from dunsloe a place of which he had never heard and was signed by his absent partner the message was in cipher but he soon translated it for it was short and crisp  i am a bear of everything german and french  sell sell sell keep on selling  for a moment warner hesitated  what could worlington dodds know at dunsloe which was not known in throgmorton street  but he remembered the quickness and decision of his partner  he would not have sent such a message without very good grounds  if he was to act at all he must act at once so hardening his heart he went down to the house and dealing upon that curious system by which a man can sell what he has not got and what he could not pay for if he had it he disposed of heavy parcels of french and german securities  he had caught the market in one of its little spasms of hope and there was no lack of buying until his own persistent selling caused others to follow his lead and so brought about a reaction  when warner returned to his offices it took him some hours to work out his accounts and he emerged into the streets in the evening with the absolute certainty that the next settlingday would leave him either hopelessly bankrupt or exceedingly prosperous  it all depended upon worlington doddss information  what could he possibly have found out at dunsloe  and then suddenly he saw a newspaper boy fasten a poster upon a lamppost and a little crowd had gathered round it in an instant one of them waved his hat in the air another shouted to a friend across the street  warner hurried up and caught a glimpse of the poster between two craning heads             france declares war on germany  by jove cried warner  old dodds was right after all    the king of the foxes   it was after a hunting dinner and there were as many scarlet coats as black ones round the table  the conversation over the cigars had turned therefore in the direction of horses and horsemen with reminiscences of phenomenal runs where foxes had led the pack from end to end of a county and been overtaken at last by two or three limping hounds and a huntsman on foot while every rider in the field had been pounded  as the port circulated the runs became longer and more apocryphal until we had the whips inquiring their way and failing to understand the dialect of the people who answered them  the foxes too became mere eccentric and we had foxes up pollard willows foxes which were dragged by the tail out of horses mangers and foxes which had raced through an open front door and gone to ground in a ladys bonnetbox  the master had told one or two tall reminiscences and when he cleared his throat for another we were all curious for he was a bit of an artist in his way and produced his effects in a crescendo fashion  his face wore the earnest practical severely accurate expression which heralded some of his finest efforts  it was before i was master said he  sir charles adair had the hounds at that time and then afterwards they passed to old lathom and then to me  it may possibly have been just after lathom took them over but my strong impression is that it was in adairs time  that would be early in the seventiesabout seventytwo i should say  the man i mean has moved to another part of the country but i daresay that some of you can remember him  danbury was the namewalter danbury or wat danbury as the people used to call him  he was the son of old joe danbury of high ascombe and when his father died he came into a very good thing for his only brother was drowned when the magna charta foundered so he inherited the whole estate  it was but a few hundred acres but it was good arable land and those were the great days of farming  besides it was freehold and a yeoman farmer without a mortgage was a warmish man before the great fall in wheat came foreign wheat and barbed wirethose are the two curses of this country for the one spoils the farmers work and the other spoils his play  this young wat danbury was a very fine fellow a keen rider and a thorough sportsman but his head was a little turned at having come when so young into a comfortable fortune and he went the pace for a year or two  the lad had no vice in him but there was a harddrinking set in the neighbourhood at that time and danbury got drawn in among them and being an amiable fellow who liked to do what his friends were doing he very soon took to drinking a great deal more than was good for him  as a rule a man who takes his exercise may drink as much as he likes in the evening and do himself no very great harm if he will leave it alone during the day  danbury had too many friends for that however and it really looked as if the poor chap was going to the bad when a very curious thing happened which pulled him up with such a sudden jerk that he never put his hand upon the neck of a whisky bottle again  he had a peculiarity which i have noticed in a good many other men that though he was always playing tricks with his own health he was none the less very anxious about it and was extremely fidgety if ever he had any trivial symptom  being a tough openair fellow who was always as hard as a nail it was seldom that there was anything amiss with him but at last the drink began to tell and he woke one morning with his hands shaking and all his nerves tingling like overstretched fiddlestrings  he had been dining at some very wet house the night before and the wine had perhaps been more plentiful than choice at any rate there he was with a tongue like a bath towel and a head that ticked like an eightday clock  he was very alarmed at his own condition and he sent for doctor middleton of ascombe the father of the man who practises there now  middleton had been a great friend of old danburys and he was very sorry to see his son going to the devil so he improved the occasion by taking his case very seriously and lecturing him upon the danger of his ways  he shook his head and talked about the possibility of delirium tremens or even of mania if he continued to lead such a life wat danbury was horribly frightened  do you think i am going to get anything of the sort he wailed  well really i dont know said the doctor gravely  i cannot undertake to say that you are out of danger  your system is very much out of order  at any time during the day you might have those grave symptoms of which i warn you  you think i shall be safe by evening  if you drink nothing during the day and have no nervous symptoms before evening i think you may consider yourself safe the doctor answered  a little fright would he thought do his patient good so he made the most of the matter  what symptoms may i expect asked danebury  it generally takes the form of optical delusions  i see specks floating all about  that is mere biliousness said the doctor soothingly for he saw that the lad was highly strung and he did not wish to overdo it i daresay that you will have no symptoms of the kind but when they do come they usually take the shape of insects or reptiles or curious animals  and if i see anything of the kind  if you do you will at once send for me and so with a promise of medicine the doctor departed  young wat danbury rose and dressed and moped about the room feeling very miserable and unstrung with a vision of the county asylum for ever in his mind  he had the doctors word for it that if he could get through to evening in safety he would be all right but it is not very exhilarating to be waiting for symptoms and to keep on glancing at your bootjack to see whether it is still a bootjack or whether it has begun to develop antennae and legs  at last he could stand it no longer and an overpowering longing for the fresh air and the green grass came over him  why should he stay indoors when the ascombe hunt was meeting within half a mile of him  if he was going to have these delusions which the doctor talked of he would not have them the sooner nor the worse because he was on horseback in the open  he was sure too it would ease his aching head  and so it came about that in ten minutes he was in his huntingkit and in ten more he was riding out of his stableyard with his roan mare matilda between his knees  he was a little unsteady in his saddle just at first but the farther he went the better he felt until by the time he reached the meet his head was almost clear and there was nothing troubling him except those haunting words of the doctors about the possibility of delusions any time before nightfall  but soon he forgot that also for as he came up the hounds were thrown off and they drew the gravel hanger and afterwards the hickory copse it was just the morning for a scentno wind to blow it away no water to wash it out and just damp enough to make it cling  there was a field of forty all keen men and good riders so when they came to the black hanger they knew that there would be some sport for thats a cover which never draws blank  the woods were thicker in those days than now and the foxes were thicker also and that great dark oakgrove was swarming with them  the only difficulty was to make them break for it is as you know a very close country and you must coax them out into the open before you can hope for a run  when they came to the black hanger the field took their positions along the coverside wherever they thought that they were most likely to get a good start  some went in with the hounds some clustered at the ends of the drives and some kept outside in the hope of the fox breaking in that direction  young wat danbury knew the country like the palm of his hand so he made for a place where several drives intersected and there he waited  he had a feeling that the faster and the farther he galloped the better he should be and so he was chafing to be off  his mare too was in the height of fettle and one of the fastest goers in the county  wat was a splendid lightweight riderunder ten stone with his saddleand the mare was a powerful creature all quarters and shoulders fit to carry a lifeguardsman and so it was no wonder that there was hardly a man in the field who could hope to stay with him there he waited and listened to the shouting of the huntsman and the whips catching a glimpse now and then in the darkness of the wood of a whisking tail or the gleam of a whiteandtan side amongst the underwood  it was a welltrained pack and there was not so much as a whine to tell you that forty hounds were working all round you  and then suddenly there came one longdrawn yell from one of them and it was taken up by another and another until within a few seconds the whole pack was giving tongue together and running on a hot scent danbury saw them stream across one of the drives and disappear upon the other side and an instant later the three red coats of the hunt servants flashed after them upon the same line  he might have made a shorter cut down one of the other drives but he was afraid of heading the fox so he followed the lead of the huntsman  right through the wood they went in a beeline galloping with their faces brushed by their horses manes as they stooped under the branches  its ugly going as you know with the roots all wriggling about in the darkness but you can take a risk when you catch an occasional glimpse of the pack running with a breasthigh scent so in and out they dodged until the wood began to thin at the edges and they found themselves in the long bottom where the river runs  it is clear going there upon grassland and the hounds were running very strong about two hundred yards ahead keeping parallel with the stream  the field who had come round the wood instead of going through were coming hard over the fields upon the left but danbury with the hunt servants had a clear lead and they never lost it  two of the field got on terms with themparson geddes on a big seventeenhand bay which he used to ride in those days and squire foley who rode as a featherweight and made his hunters out of cast thoroughbreds from the newmarket sales but the others never had a lookin from start to finish for there was no check and no pulling and it was clear crosscountry racing from start to finish  if you had drawn a line right across the map with a pencil you couldnt go straighter than that fox ran heading for the south downs and the sea and the hounds ran as surely as if they were running to view and yet from the beginning no one ever saw the fox and there was never a hallo forrard to tell them that he had been spied  this however is not so surprising for if youve been over that line of country you will know that there are not very many people about  there were six of them then in the front rowparson geddes squire foley the huntsman two whips and wat danbury who had forgotten all about his head and the doctor by this time and had not a thought for anything but the run  all six were galloping just as hard as they could lay hoofs to the ground  one of the whips dropped back however as some of the hounds were tailing off and that brought them down to five then foleys thoroughbred strained herself as these slimlegged daintyfetlocked thoroughbreds will do when the going is rough and he had to take a back seat  but the other four were still going strong and they did four or five miles down the river flat at a rasping pace it had been a wet winter and the waters had been out a little time before so there was a deal of sliding and splashing but by the time they came to the bridge the whole field was out of sight and these four had the hunt to themselves  the fox had crossed the bridgefor foxes do not care to swim a chilly river any more than humans doand from that point he had streaked away southward as hard as he could tear  it is broken country rolling heaths down one slope and up another and its hard to say whether the up or the down is the more trying for the horses  this sort of switchback work is all right for a cobby shortbacked shortlegged little horse but it is killing work for a big longstriding hunter such as one wants in the midlands  anyhow it was too much for parson geddes seventeenhand bay and though he tried the irish trickfor he was a rare keen sportsmanof running up the hills by his horses head it was all to no use and he had to give it up  so then there were only the huntsman the whip and wat danburyall going strong  but the country got worse and worse and the hills were steeper and more thickly covered in heather and bracken  the horses were over their hocks all the time and the place was pitted with rabbitholes but the hounds were still streaming along and the riders could not afford to pick their steps  as they raced down one slope the hounds were always flowing up the opposite one until it looked like that game where the one figure in falling makes the other one rise  but never a glimpse did they get of the fox although they knew very well that he must be only a very short way ahead for the scent to be so strong  and then wat danbury heard a crash and a thud at his elbow and looking round he saw a pair of white cords and topboots kicking out of a tussock of brambles  the whips horse had stumbled and the whip was out of the running  danbury and the huntsman eased down for an instant and then seeing the man staggering to his feet all right they turned and settled into their saddles once more  joe clarke the huntsman was a famous old rider known for five counties round but he reckoned upon his second horse and the second horses had all been left many miles behind  however the one he was riding was good enough for anything with such a horseman upon his back and he was going as well as when he started  as to wat danbury he was going better  with every stride his own feelings improved and the mind of the rider had its influence upon the mind of the horse  the stout little roan was gathering its muscular limbs under it and stretching to the gallop as if it were steel and whalebone instead of flesh and blood  wat had never come to the end of its powers yet and today he had such a chance of testing them as he had never had before  there was a pasture country beyond the heather slopes and for several miles the two riders were either losing ground as they fumbled with their crophandles at the bars of gates or gaining it again as they galloped over the fields  those were the days before this accursed wire came into the country and you could generally break a hedge where you could not fly it so they did not trouble the gates more than they could help  then they were down in a hard lane where they had to slacken their pace and through a farm where a man came shouting excitedly after them but they had no time to stop and listen to him for the hounds were on some ploughland only two fields ahead  it was sloping upwards that ploughland and the horses were over their fetlocks in the red soft soil  when they reached the top they were blowing badly but a grand valley sloped before them leading up to the open country of the south downs between there lay a belt of pinewoods into which the hounds were streaming running now in a long straggling line and shedding one here and one there as they ran  you could see the whiteandtan dots here and there where the limpers were tailing away  but half the pack were still going well though the pace and distance had both been tremendoustwo clear hours now without a check  there was a drive through the pinewoodone of those green slightly rutted drives where a horse can get the last yard out of itself for the ground is hard enough to give him clean going and yet springy enough to help him  wat danbury got alongside of the huntsman and they galloped together with their stirrupirons touching and the hounds within a hundred yards of them  we have it all to ourselves said he  yes sir weve shook on the lot of em this time said old joe clarke  if we get this fox its worth while aving im skinned an stuffed for es a curiosity e is  its the fastest run i ever had in my life cried danbury  and the fastest that ever i ad an that means more said the old huntsman  but what licks me is that weve never ad a look at the beast  e must leave an amazin scent beind im when these ounds can follow im like this and yet none of us have seen im when weve ad a clear alf mile view in front of us  i expect well have a view of him presently said danbury and in his mind he added at least i shall for the huntsmans horse was gasping as it ran and the white foam was pouring down it like the side of a washingtub  they had followed the hounds on to one of the side tracks which led out of the main drive and that divided into a smaller track still where the branches switched across their faces as they went and there was barely room for one horse at a time  wat danbury took the lead and he heard the huntsmans horse clumping along heavily behind him while his own mare was going with less spring than when she had started  she answered to a touch of his crop or spur however and he felt that there was something still left to draw upon  and then he looked up and there was a heavy wooden stile at the end of the narrow track with a lane of stiff young saplings leading down to it which was far too thick to break through  the hounds were running clear upon the grassland on the other side and you were bound either to get over that stile or lose sight of them for the pace was too hot to let you go round  well wat danbury was not the lad to flinch and at it he went full split like a man who means what he is doing  she rose gallantly to it rapped it hard with her front hoof shook him on to her withers recovered herself and was over  wat had hardly got back into his saddle when there was a clatter behind him like the fall of a woodstack and there was the top bar in splinters the horse on its belly and the huntsman on hands and knees half a dozen yards in front of him wat pulled up for an instant for the fall was a smasher but he saw old joe spring to his feet and get to his horses bridle  the horse staggered up but the moment it put one foot in front of the other wat saw that it was hopelessly lamea slipped shoulder and a six weeks job  there was nothing he could do and joe was shouting to him not to lose the hounds so off he went again the one solitary survivor of the whole hunt  when a man finds himself there he can retire from foxhunting for he has tasted the highest which it has to offer i remember once when i was out with the royal surreybut ill tell you that story afterwards  the pack or what was left of them had got a bit ahead during this time but he had a clear view of them on the downland and the mare seemed full of pride at being the only one left for she was stepping out rarely and tossing her head as she went  they were two miles over the green shoulder of a hill a rattle down a stony deeprutted country lane where the mare stumbled and nearly came down a jump over a 5ft brook a cut through a hazel copse another dose of heavy ploughland a couple of gates to open and then the green unbroken downs beyond  well said wat danbury to himself ill see this fox run into or i shall see it drowned for its all clear going now between this and the chalk cliffs which line the sea  but he was wrong in that as he speedily discovered  in all the little hollows of the downs at that part there are plantations of firwoods some of which have grown to a good size  you do not see them until you come upon the edge of the valleys in which they lie  danbury was galloping hard over the short springy turf when he came over the lip of one of these depressions and there was the dark clump of wood lying in front of and beneath him there were only a dozen hounds still running and they were just disappearing among the trees  the sunlight was shining straight upon the long olivegreen slopes which curved down towards this wood and danbury who had the eyes of a hawk swept them over this great expanse but there was nothing moving upon it  a few sheep were grazing far up on the right but there was no other sight of any living creature he was certain then that he was very near to the end for either the fox must have gone to ground in the wood or the hounds noses must be at his very brush  the mare seemed to know also what that great empty sweep of countryside meant for she quickened her stride and a few minutes afterwards danbury was galloping into the firwood  he had come from bright sunshine but the wood was very closely planted and so dim that he could hardly see to right or to left out of the narrow path down which he was riding  you know what a solemn churchyardy sort of place a firwood is  i suppose it is the absence of any undergrowth and the fact that the trees never move at all  at any rate a kind of chill suddenly struck wat danbury and it flashed through his mind that there had been some very singular points about this run its length and its straightness and the fact that from the first find no one had ever caught a glimpse of the creature  some silly talk which had been going round the country about the king of the foxesa sort of demon fox so fast that it could outrun any pack and so fierce that they could do nothing with it if they overtook itsuddenly came back into his mind and it did not seem so laughable now in the dim firwood as it had done when the story had been told over the wine and cigars the nervousness which had been on him in the morning and which he had hoped that he had shaken off swept over him again in an overpowering wave  he had been so proud of being alone and yet he would have given 10 pounds now to have had joe clarkes homely face beside him  and then just at that moment there broke out from the thickest part of the wood the most frantic hullabaloo that ever he had heard in his life the hounds had run into their fox  well you know or you ought to know what your duty is in such a case you have to be whip huntsman and everything else if you are the first man up  you get in among the hounds lash them off and keep the brush and pads from being destroyed  of course wat danbury knew all about that and he tried to force his mare through the trees to the place where all this hideous screaming and howling came from but the wood was so thick that it was impossible to ride it  he sprang off therefore left the mare standing and broke his way through as best he could with his huntinglash ready over his shoulder  but as he ran forward he felt his flesh go cold and creepy all over he had heard hounds run into foxes many times before but he had never heard such sounds as these  they were not the cries of triumph but of fear  every now and then came a shrill yelp of mortal agony  holding his breath he ran on until he broke through the interlacing branches and found himself in a little clearing with the hounds all crowding round a patch of tangled bramble at the further end  when he first caught sight of them the hounds were standing in a halfcircle round this bramble patch with their backs bristling and their jaws gaping  in front of the brambles lay one of them with his throat torn out all crimson and whiteandtan  wat came running out into the clearing and at the sight of him the hounds took heart again and one of them sprang with a growl into the bushes  at the same instant a creature the size of a donkey jumped on to its feet a huge grey head with monstrous glistening fangs and tapering fox jaws shot out from among the branches and the hound was thrown several feet into the air and fell howling among the cover  then there was a clashing snap like a rattrap closing and the howls sharpened into a scream and then were still  danbury had been on the lookout for symptoms all day and now he had found them  he looked once more at the thicket saw a pair of savage red eyes fixed upon him and fairly took to his heels  it might only be a passing delusion or it might be the permanent mania of which the doctor had spoken but anyhow the thing to do was to get back to bed and to quiet and to hope for the best  he forgot the hounds the hunt and everything else in his desperate fears for his own reason  he sprang upon his mare galloped her madly over the downs and only stopped when he found himself at a country station  there he left his mare at the inn and made back for home as quickly as steam would take him  it was evening before he got there shivering with apprehension and seeing those red eyes and savage teeth at every turn  he went straight to bed and sent for dr middleton  ive got em doctor said he  it came about exactly as you said strange creatures optical delusions and everything  all i ask you now is to save my reason  the doctor listened to his story and was shocked as he heard it  it appears to be a very clear case said he  this must be a lesson to you for life  never a drop again if i only come safely through this cried wat danbury  well my dear boy if you will stick to that it may prove a blessing in disguise  but the difficulty in this case is to know where fact ends and fancy begins  you see it is not as if there was only one delusion there have been several  the dead dogs for example must have been one as well as the creature in the bush  i saw it all as clearly as i see you  one of the characteristics of this form of delirium is that what you see is even clearer than reality  i was wondering whether the whole run was not a delusion also  wat danbury pointed to his hunting boots still lying upon the floor necked with the splashings of two counties  hum that looks very real certainly  no doubt in your weak state you overexerted yourself and so brought this attack upon yourself well whatever the cause our treatment is clear  you will take the soothing mixture which i will send to you and we shall put two leeches upon your temples tonight to relieve any congestion of the brain  so wat danbury spent the night in tossing about and reflecting what a sensitive thing this machinery of ours is and how very foolish it is to play tricks with what is so easily put out of gear and so difficult to mend  and so he repeated and repeated his oath that this first lesson should be his last and that from that time forward he would be a sober hardworking yeoman as his father had been before him  so he lay tossing and still repentant when his door flew open in the morning and in rushed the doctor with a newspaper crumpled up in his hand  my dear boy he cried i owe you a thousand apologies  youre the most illused lad and i the greatest numskull in the county  listen to this and he sat down upon the side of the bed flattened out his paper upon his knee and began to read  the paragraph was headed disaster to the ascombe hounds and it went on to say that four of the hounds shockingly torn and mangled had been found in winton fir wood upon the south downs  the run had been so severe that half the pack were lamed but the four found in the wood were actually dead although the cause of their extraordinary injuries was still unknown  so you see said the doctor looking up that i was wrong when i put the dead hounds among the delusions  but the cause cried wat  well i think we may guess the cause from an item which has been inserted just as the paper went to press     late last night mr brown of smithers farm to the    east of hastings perceived what he imagined to be an enormous    dog worrying one of his sheep  he shot the creature which    proves to be a grey siberian wolf of the variety known as    lupus giganticus  it is supposed to have escaped from some    travelling menagerie  thats the story gentlemen and wat danbury stuck to his good resolutions for the fright which he had cured him of all wish to run such a risk again and he never touches anything stronger than limejuiceat least he hadnt before he left this part of the country five years ago next lady day    the three correspondents   there was only the one little feathery clump of dom palms in all that great wilderness of black rocks and orange sand  it stood high on the bank and below it the brown nile swirled swiftly towards the ambigole cataract fitting a little frill of foam round each of the boulders which studded its surface  above out of a naked blue sky the sun was beating down upon the sand and up again from the sand under the brims of the pithhats of the horsemen with the scorching glare of a blastfurnace  it had risen so high that the shadows of the horses were no larger than themselves  whew cried mortimer mopping his forehead youd pay five shillings for this at the hummums  precisely said scott  but you are not asked to ride twenty miles in a turkish bath with a fieldglass and a revolver and a waterbottle and a whole christmastreeful of things dangling from you  the hothouse at kew is excellent as a conservatory but not adapted for exhibitions upon the horizontal bar  i vote for a camp in the palmgrove and a halt until evening  mortimer rose on his stirrups and looked hard to the southward everywhere were the same black burned rocks and deep orange sand at one spot only an intermittent line appeared to have been cut through the rugged spurs which ran down to the river  it was the bed of the old railway long destroyed by the arabs but now in process of reconstruction by the advancing egyptians  there was no other sign of mans handiwork in all that desolate scene  its palm trees or nothing said scott  well i suppose we must and yet i grudge every hour until we catch the force up  what would our editors say if we were late for the action  my dear chap an old bird like you doesnt need to be told that no sane modern general would ever attack until the press is up  you dont mean that said young anerley  i thought we were looked upon as an unmitigated nuisance  newspaper correspondents and travelling gentlemen and all that tribe of useless dronesbeing an extract from lord wolseleys soldiers pocketbook cried scott  we know all about that anerley and he winked behind his blue spectacles  if there was going to be a battle we should very soon have an escort of cavalry to hurry us up  ive been in fifteen and i never saw one where they had not arranged for a reporters table  thats very well but the enemy may be less considerate said mortimer  they are not strong enough to force a battle  a skirmish then  much more likely to be a raid upon the rear  in that case we are just where we should be  so we are  what a score over reuters man up with the advance well well outspan and have our tiffin under the palms  there were three of them and they stood for three great london dailies reuters was thirty miles ahead two evening pennies upon camels were twenty miles behind  and among them they represented the eyes and ears of the publicthe great silent millions and millions who had paid for everything and who waited so patiently to know the result of their outlay  they were remarkable men these bodyservants of the press two of them already veterans in camps the other setting out upon his first campaign and full of deference for his famous comrades  this first one who had just dismounted from his bay polopony was mortimer of the intelligencetall straight and hawkfaced with khaki tunic and ridingbreeches drab putties a scarlet cummerbund and a skin tanned to the red of a scotch fir by sun and wind and mottled by the mosquito and the sandfly  the othersmall quick mercurial with blueblack curling beard and hair a flyswitch for ever flicking in his left handwas scott of the courier who had come through more dangers and brought off more brilliant coups than any man in the profession save the eminent chandler now no longer in a condition to take the field  they were a singular contrast mortimer and scott and it was in their differences that the secret of their close friendship lay  each dovetailed into the other  the strength of each was in the others weakness   together they formed a perfect unit  mortimer was saxonslow conscientious and deliberate  scott was celticquick happygolucky and brilliant  mortimer was the more solid scott the more attractive  mortimer was the deeper thinker scott the brighter talker  by a curious coincidence though each had seen much of warfare their campaigns had never coincided  together they covered all recent military history  scott had done plevna the shipka the zulus egypt suakim mortimer had seen the boer war the chilian the bulgaria and servian the gordon relief the indian frontier brazilian rebellion and madagascar  this intimate personal knowledge gave a peculiar flavour to their talk  there was none of the secondhand surmise and conjecture which form so much of our conversation it was all concrete and final  the speaker had been there had seen it and there was an end of it  in spite of their friendship there was the keenest professional rivalry between the two men  either would have sacrificed himself to help his companion but either would also have sacrificed his companion to help his paper  never did a jockey yearn for a winning mount as keenly as each of them longed to have a full column in a morning edition whilst every other daily was blank  they were perfectly frank about the matter  each professed himself ready to steal a march on his neighbour and each recognised that the others duty to his employer was far higher than any personal consideration  the third man was anerley of the gazetteyoung inexperienced and rather simplelooking  he had a droop of the lip which some of his more intimate friends regarded as a libel upon his character and his eyes were so slow and so sleepy that they suggested an affectation a leaning towards soldiering had sent him twice to autumn manoeuvres and a touch of colour in his descriptions had induced the proprietors of the gazette to give him a trial as a warspecial  there was a pleasing diffidence about his bearing which recommended him to his experienced companions and if they had a smile sometimes at his guileless ways it was soothing to them to have a comrade from whom nothing was to be feared  from the day that they left the telegraphwire behind them at sarras the man who was mounted upon a 15guinea 134 syrian was delivered over into the hands of the owners of the two fastest poloponies that ever shot down the ghezireh ground the three had dismounted and led their beasts under the welcome shade in the brassy yellow glare every branch above threw so black and solid a shadow that the men involuntarily raised their feet to step over them  the palm makes an excellent hatrack said scott slinging his revolver and his waterbottle over the little upwardpointing pegs which bristle from the trunk   as a shade tree however it isnt an unqualified success  curious that in the universal adaptation of means to ends something a little less flimsy could not have been devised for the tropics  like the banyan in india  or the fine hardwood trees in ashantee where a whole regiment could picnic under the shade  the teak tree isnt bad in burmah either  by jove the baccy has all come loose in the saddlebag  that longcut mixture smokes rather hot for this climate  how about the baggles anerley  theyll be here in five minutes  down the winding path which curved among the rocks the little train of baggagecamels was daintily picking its way  they came mincing and undulating along turning their heads slowly from side to side with the air of a selfconscious woman  in front rode the three berberee bodyservants upon donkeys and behind walked the arab camelboys they had been travelling for nine long hours ever since the first rising of the moon at the weary cameldrag of two and a half miles an hour but now they brightened both beasts and men at the sight of the grove and the riderless horses  in a few minutes the loads were unstrapped the animals tethered a fire lighted fresh water carried up from the river and each camelboy provided with his own little heap of tibbin laid in the centre of the tablecloth without which no wellbred arabian will condescend to feed  the dazzling light without the subdued halftones within the green palmfronds outlined against the deep blue sky the flitting silentfooted arab servants the crackling of sticks the reek of a lighting fire the placid supercilious heads of the camels they all come back in their dreams to those who have known them  scott was breaking eggs into a pan and rolling out a lovesong in his rich deep voice  anerley with his head and arms buried in a deal packingcase was working his way through strata of tinned soups bully beef potted chicken and sardines to reach the jams which lay beneath the conscientious mortimer with his notebook upon his knee was jotting down what the railway engineer had told him at the lineend the day before  suddenly he raised his eyes and saw the man himself on his chestnut pony dipping and rising over the broken ground  hullo heres merryweather  a pretty lather his pony is in  hes had her at that handgallop for hours by the look of her  hullo merryweather hullo  the engineer a small compact man with a pointed red beard had made as though he would ride past their camp without word or halt  now he swerved and easing his pony down to a canter he headed her towards them  for gods sake a drink he croaked  my tongue is stuck to the roof of my mouth  mortimer ran with the waterbottle scott with the whiskyflask and anerley with the tin pannikin  the engineer drank until his breath failed him  well i must be off said he striking the drops from his red moustache  any news  a hitch in the railway construction  i must see the general its the devil not having a telegraph  anything we can report  out came three notebooks  ill tell you after ive seen the general  any dervishes  the usual shaves  hudup jinny goodbye  with a soft thudding upon the sand and a clatter among the stones the weary pony was off upon her journey once more  nothing serious i suppose said mortimer staring after him  deuced serious cried scott  the ham and eggs are burned  noits all rightsaved and done to a turn  pull the box up anerley come on mortimer stow that notebook  the fork is mightier than the pen just at present  whats the matter with you anerley  i was wondering whether what we have just seen was worth a telegram  well its for the proprietors to say if its worth it  sordid money considerations are not for us  we must wire about something just to justify our khaki coats and our putties  but what is there to say  mortimers long austere face broke into a smile over the youngsters innocence  its not quite usual in our profession to give each other tips said he  however as my telegram is written ive no objection to your reading it  you may be sure that i would not show it to you if it were of the slightest importance  anerley took up the slip of paper and read     merryweather obstacles stop journey confer general stop nature    difficulties later stop rumours dervishes  this is very condensed said anerley with wrinkled brows  condensed cried scott  why its sinfully garrulous  if my old man got a wire like that his language would crack the lampshades  id cut out half this for example id have out journey and nature and rumours but my old man would make a tenline paragraph of it for all that  how  well ill do it myself just to show you  lend me that stylo he scribbled for a minute in his notebook  it works out somewhat on these lines     mr charles h  merryweather the eminent railway engineer    who is at present engaged in superintending the construction    of the line from sarras to the front has met with considerable    obstacles to the rapid completion of his important task  of course the old man knows who merryweather is and what he is about so the word obstacles would suggest all that to him     he has today been compelled to make a journey of forty    miles to the front in order to confer with the general upon    the steps which are necessary in order to facilitate the work    further particulars of the exact nature of the difficulties    met with will be made public at a later date  all is quiet    upon the line of communications though the usual persistent    rumours of the presence of dervishes in the eastern desert    continue to circulateour own correspondent  hows that cried scott triumphantly and his white teeth gleamed suddenly through his black beard  thats the sort of flapdoodle for the dear old public  will it interest them  oh everything interests them  they want to know all about it and they like to think that there is a man who is getting a hundred a month simply in order to tell it to them  its very kind of you to teach me all this  well it is a little unconventional for after all we are here to score over each other if we can  there are no more eggs and you must take it out in jam  of course as mortimer says such a telegram as this is of no importance one way or another except to prove to the office that we are in the soudan and not at monte carlo  but when it comes to serious work it must be every man for himself  is that quite necessary  why of course it is  i should have thought if three men were to combine and to share their news they would do better than if they were each to act for himself and they would have a much pleasanter time of it  the two older men sat with their breadandjam in their hands and an expression of genuine disgust upon their faces  we are not here to have a pleasant time said mortimer with a flash through his glasses  we are here to do our best for our papers how can they score over each other if we do not do the same  if we all combine we might as well amalgamate with reuter at once  why it would take away the whole glory of the profession cried scott  at present the smartest man gets his stuff first on the wires what inducement is there to be smart if we all share and share alike  and at present the man with the best equipment has the best chance remarked mortimer glancing across at the shotsilk polo ponies and the cheap little syrian grey  that is the fair reward of foresight and enterprise  every man for himself and let the best man win  thats the way to find who the best man is  look at chandler he would never have got his chance if he had not played always off his own bat  youve heard how he pretended to break his leg sent his fellowcorrespondent off for the doctor and so got a fair start for the telegraphoffice  do you mean to say that was legitimate  everything is legitimate  its your wits against my wits  i should call it dishonourable  you may call it what you like  chandlers paper got the battle and the others didnt  it made chandlers name  or take westlake said mortimer cramming the tobacco into his pipe hi abdul you may have the dishes  westlake brought his stuff down by pretending to be the government courier and using the relays of government horses  westlakes paper sold half a million  is that legitimate also asked anerley thoughtfully  why not  well it looks a little like horsestealing and lying  well i think i should do a little horsestealing and lying if i could have a column to myself in a london daily  what do you say scott  anything short of manslaughter  and im not sure that id trust you there  well i dont think i should be guilty of newspapermanslaughter that i regard as a distinct breach of professional etiquette  but if any outsider comes between a highly charged correspondent and an electric wire he does it at his peril  my dear anerley i tell you frankly that if you are going to handicap yourself with scruple you may just as well be in fleet street as in the soudan  our life is irregular  our work has never been systematised  no doubt it will be some day but the time is not yet  do what you can and how you can and be first on the wires thats my advice to you and also that when next you come upon a campaign you bring with you the best horse that money can buy  mortimer may beat me or i may beat mortimer but at least we know that between us we have the fastest ponies in the country  we have neglected no chance  i am not so certain of that said mortimer slowly  you are aware of course that though a horse beats a camel on twenty miles a camel beats a horse on thirty  what one of those camels cried anerley in astonishment  the two seniors burst out laughing  no no the real highbred trotterthe kind of beast the dervishes ride when they make their lightning raids  faster than a galloping horse  well it tires a horse down  it goes the same gait all the way and it wants neither halt nor drink and it takes rough ground much better than a horse  they used to have long distance races at haifa and the camel always won at thirty  still we need not reproach ourselves scott for we are not very likely to have to carry a thirtymile message they will have the field telegraph next week  quite so  but at the present moment  i know my dear chap but there is no motion of urgency before the house  load baggles at five oclock so you have just three hours clear  any sign of the evening pennies  mortimer swept the northern horizon with his binoculars  not in sight yet  they are quite capable of travelling during the heat of the day just the sort of thing evening pennies would do  take care of your match anerley  these palm groves go up like a powder magazine if you set them alight  byebye  the two men crawled under their mosquitonets and sank instantly into the easy sleep of those whose lives are spent in the open  young anerley stood with his back against a palm tree and his briar between his lips thinking over the advice which he had received after all they were the heads of the profession these men and it was not for him the newcomer to reform their methods  if they served their papers in this fashion then he must do the same  they had at least been frank and generous in teaching him the rules of the game if it was good enough for them it was good enough for him  it was a broiling afternoon and those thin frills of foam round the black glistening necks of the nile boulders looked delightfully cool and alluring  but it would not be safe to bathe for some hours to come the air shimmered and vibrated over the baking stretch of sand and rock there was not a breath of wind and the droning and piping of the insects inclined one for sleep  somewhere above a hoopoe was calling anerley knocked out his ashes and was turning towards his couch when his eye caught something moving in the desert to the south  it was a horseman riding towards them as swiftly as the broken ground would permit  a messenger from the army thought anerley and then as he watched the sun suddenly struck the man on the side of the head and his chin flamed into gold  there could not be two horsemen with beards of such a colour  it was merryweather the engineer and he was returning  what on earth was he returning for  he had been so keen to see the general and yet he was coming back with his mission unaccomplished  was it that his pony was hopelessly foundered it seemed to be moving well  anerley picked up mortimers binoculars and a foambespattered horse and a weary koorbashcracking man came cantering up the centre of the field  but there was nothing in his appearance to explain the mystery of his return  then as he watched them they dipped into a hollow and disappeared  he could see that it was one of those narrow khors which led to the river and he waited glass in hand for their immediate reappearance  but minute passed after minute and there was no sign of them  that narrow gully appeared to have swallowed them up  and then with a curious gulp and start he saw a little grey cloud wreathe itself slowly from among the rocks and drift in a long hazy shred over the desert  in an instant he had torn scott and mortimer from their slumbers  get up you chaps he cried  i believe merryweather has been shot by dervishes  and reuter not here cried the two veterans exultantly clutching at their notebooks  merryweather shot  where  when  how  in a few words anerley explained what he had seen  you heard nothing  nothing  well a shot loses itself very easily among rocks  by george look at the buzzards  two large brown birds were soaring in the deep blue heaven  as scott spoke they circled down and dropped into the little khor  thats good enough said mortimer with his nose between the leaves of his book  merryweather headed dervishes stop return stop shot mutilated stop raid communications  hows that  you think he was headed off  why else should he return  in that case if they were out in front of him and others cut him off there must be several small raiding parties  i should judge so  how about the mutilated  ive fought against arabs before  where are you off to  sarras  i think ill race you in said scott  anerley stared in astonishment at the absolutely impersonal way in which these men regarded the situation  in their zeal for news it had apparently never struck them that they their camp and their servants were all in the lions mouth  but even as they talked there came the harsh importunate rattattat of an irregular volley from among the rocks and the high keening whistle of bullets over their heads a palm spray fluttered down amongst them  at the same instant the six frightened servants came running wildly in for protection  it was the coolheaded mortimer who organised the defence for scotts celtic soul was so aflame at all this copy in hand and more to come that he was too exuberantly boisterous for a commander  the other with his spectacles and his stern face soon had the servants in hand tali henna  egri  what the deuce are you frightened about  put the camels between the palm trunks  thats right  now get the kneetethers on them  quies  did you never hear bullets before  now put the donkeys here  not muchyou dont get my polopony to make a zareba with  picket the ponies between the grove and the river out of dangers way  these fellows seem to fire even higher than they did in 85  thats got home anyhow said scott as they heard a soft splashing thud like a stone in a mudbank  whos hit then  the brown camel thats chewing the cud  as he spoke the creature its jaw still working laid its long neck along the ground and closed its large dark eyes  that shot cost me 15 pounds said mortimer ruefully  how many of them do you make  four i think  only four bezingers at any rate there may be some spearmen  i think not it is a little raidingparty of riflemen  by the way anerley youve never been under fire before have you  never said the young pressman who was conscious of a curious feeling of nervous elation  love and poverty and war they are all experiences necessary to make a complete life  pass over those cartridges  this is a very mild baptism that you are undergoing for behind these camels you are as safe as if you were sitting in the back room of the authors club  as safe but hardly as comfortable said scott  a long glass of hock and seltzer would be exceedingly acceptable  but oh mortimer what a chance  think of the generals feelings when he hears that the first action of the war has been fought by the press column  think of reuter who has been stewing at the front for a week  think of the evening pennies just too late for the fun  by george that slug brushed a mosquito off me  and one of the donkeys is hit  this is sinful  it will end in our having to carry our own kits to khartoum  never mind my boy it all goes to make copy  i can see the headlinesraid on communications murder of british engineer press column attacked  wont it be ripping  i wonder what the next line will be said anerley  our special wounded cried scott rolling over on to his back no harm done he added gathering himself up again only a chip off my knee  this is getting sultry  i confess that the idea of that back room at the authors club begins to grow upon me  i have some diachylon  afterwards will do  were having a appy day with fuzzy on the rush i wish he would rush  theyre coming nearer  this is an excellent revolver of mine if it didnt throw so devilish high  i always aim at a mans toes if i want to stimulate his digestion  o lord theres our kettle gone  with a boom like a dinnergong a remington bullet had passed through the kettle and a cloud of steam hissed up from the fire  a wild shout came from the rocks above  the idiots think that they have blown us up  theyll rush us now as sure as fate then it will be our turn to lead  got your revolver anerley  i have this doublebarrelled fowlingpiece  sensible man  its the best weapon in the world at this sort of roughandtumble work  what cartridges  swanshot  that will do all right  i carry this big bore doublebarrelled pistol loaded with slugs  you might as well try to stop one of these fellows with a peashooter as with a service revolver  there are ways and means said scott  the geneva convention does not hold south of the first cataract  its easy to make a bullet mushroom by a little manipulation of the tip of it  when i was in the broken square at tamai  wait a bit cried mortimer adjusting his glasses  i think they are coming now  the time said scott snapping up his watch being exactly seventeen minutes past four  anerley had been lying behind a camel staring with an interest which bordered upon fascination at the rocks opposite  here was a little woolly puff of smoke and there was another one but never once had they caught a glimpse of the attackers  to him there was something weird and awesome in these unseen persistent men who minute by minute were drawing closer to them  he had heard them cry out when the kettle was broken and once immediately afterwards an enormously strong voice had roared something which had set scott shrugging his shoulders  theyve got to take us first said he and anerley thought his nerve might be better if he did not ask for a translation  the firing had begun at a distance of some 100 yards which put it out of the question for them with their lighter weapons to make any reply to it  had their antagonists continued to keep that range the defenders must either have made a hopeless sally or tried to shelter themselves behind their zareba as best they might on the chance that the sound might bring up help  but luckily for them the african has never taken kindly to the rifle and his primitive instinct to close with his enemy is always too strong for his sense of strategy  they were drawing in therefore and now for the first time anerley caught sight of a face looking at them from over a rock  it was a huge virile strongjawed head of a pure negro type with silver trinkets gleaming in the ears the man raised a great arm from behind the rock and shook his remington at them  shall i fire asked anerley  no no it is too far  your shot would scatter all over the place  its a picturesque ruffian said scott  couldnt you kodak him mortimer  theres another  a finefeatured brown arab with a black pointed beard was peeping from behind another boulder  he wore the green turban which proclaimed him hadji and his face showed the keen nervous exultation of the religious fanatic  they seem a piebald crowd said scott  that last is one of the real fighting baggara remarked mortimer hes a dangerous man  he looks pretty vicious  theres another negro  two more  dingas by the look of them  just the same chaps we get our own black battalions from  as long as they get a fight they dont mind who its for but if the idiots had only sense enough to understand they would know that the arab is their hereditary enemy and we their hereditary friends  look at the silly juggins gnashing his teeth at the very men who put down the slave trade  couldnt you explain  ill explain with this pistol when he comes a little nearer  now sit tight anerley  theyre off  they were indeed  it was the brown man with the green turban who headed the rush  close at his heels was the negro with the silver earrings a giant of a man and the other two were only a little behind  as they sprang over the rocks one after the other it took anerley back to the school sports when he held the tape for the hurdlerace  it was magnificent the wild spirit and abandon of it the flutter of the chequered galabeeahs the gleam of steel the wave of black arms the frenzied faces the quick pitterpatter of the rushing feet  the lawabiding briton is so imbued with the idea of the sanctity of human life that it was hard for the young pressman to realise that these men had every intention of killing him and that he was at perfect liberty to do as much for them  he lay staring as if this were a show and he a spectator  now anerley now  take the arab cried somebody  he put up the gun and saw the brown fierce face at the other end of the barrel  he tugged at the trigger but the face grew larger and fiercer with every stride  again and again he tugged  a revolvershot rang out at his elbow then another one and he saw a red spot spring out on the arabs brown breast  but he was still coming on  shoot you ass shoot screamed scott  again he strained unavailingly at the trigger  there were two more pistolshots and the big negro had fallen and risen and fallen again  cock it you fool shouted a furious voice  and at the same instant with a rush and flutter the arab bounded over the prostrate camel and came down with his bare feet upon anerleys chest  in a dream he seemed to be struggling frantically with someone upon the ground then he was conscious of a tremendous explosion in his very face and so ended for him the first action of the war  goodbye old chap  youll be all right  give yourself time  it was mortimers voice and he became dimly conscious of a long spectacled face and of a heavy hand upon his shoulder  sorry to leave you  well be lucky now if we are in time for the morning editions  scott was tightening his girth as he spoke  well put in our wire that you have been hurt so your people will know why they dont hear from you  if reuter or the evening pennies come up dont give the thing away  abbas will look after you and well be back tomorrow afternoon  byebye  anerley heard it all though he did not feel energy enough to answer then as he watched two sleek brown ponies with their yellowclad riders dwindling among the rocks his memory cleared suddenly and he realised that the first great journalistic chance of his life was slipping away from him  it was a small fight but it was the first of the war and the great public at home were all athirst for news they would have it in the courier they would have it in the intelligence and not a word in the gazette  the thought brought him to his feet though he had to throw his arm round the stem of the palm tree to steady his swimming head  there was a big black man lying where he had fallen his huge chest pocked with bulletmarks every wound rosetted with its circle of flies  the arab was stretched out within a few yards of him with two hands clasped over the dreadful thing which had been his head  across him was lying anerleys fowlingpiece one barrel discharged the other at half cock  scott effendi shoot him your gun said a voice  it was abbas his englishspeaking bodyservant  anerley groaned at the disgrace of it  he had lost his head so completely that he had forgotten to cock his gun and yet he knew that it was not fear but interest which had so absorbed him  he put his hand up to his head and felt that a wet handkerchief was bound round his forehead  where are the two other dervishes  they ran away  one got shot in arm  whats happened to me  effendi got cut on head  effendi catch bad man by arms and scott effendi shot him  face burn very bad  anerley became conscious suddenly that there was a pringling about his skin and an overpowering smell of burned hair under his nostrils  he put his hand to his moustache  it was gone  his eyebrows too he could not find them  his head no doubt was very near to the dervishs when they were rolling upon the ground together and this was the effect of the explosion of his own gun  well he would have time to grow some more hair before he saw fleet street again  but the cut perhaps was a more serious matter  was it enough to prevent him getting to the telegraphoffice at sarras  the only way was to try and see  but there was only that poor little syrian grey of his  there it stood in the evening sunshine with a sunk head and a bent knee as if its mornings work was still heavy upon it  what hope was there of being able to do thirtyfive miles of heavy going upon that  it would be a strain upon the splendid ponies of his companionsand they were the swiftest and most enduring in the country  the most enduring there was one creature more enduring and that was a real trotting camel  if he had had one he might have got to the wires first after all for mortimer had said that over thirty miles they have the better of any horse  yes if he had only had a real trotting camel  and then like a flash came mortimers words it is the kind of beast that the dervishes ride when they make their lightning raids  the beasts the dervishes ride  what had these dead dervishes ridden in an instant he was clambering up the rocks with abbas protesting at his heels  had the two fugitives carried away all the camels or had they been content to save themselves  the brass gleam from a litter of empty remington cases caught his eye and showed where the enemy had been crouching  and then he could have shouted for joy for there in the hollow some little distance off rose the high graceful white neck and the elegant head of such a camel as he had never set eyes upon beforea swanlike beautiful creature as far from the rough clumsy baggles as the carthorse is from the racer  the beast was kneeling under the shelter of the rocks with its waterskin and bag of doora slung over its shoulders and its forelegs tethered arab fashion with a rope around the knees  anerley threw his leg over the front pommel while abbas slipped off the cord   forward flew anerley towards the creatures neck then violently backwards clawing madly at anything which might save him and then with a jerk which nearly snapped his loins he was thrown forward again  but the camel was on its legs now and the young pressman was safely seated upon one of the fliers of the desert  it was as gentle as it was swift and it stood oscillating its long neck and gazing round with its large brown eyes whilst anerley coiled his legs round the peg and grasped the curved camelstick which abbas had handed up to him  there were two bridlecords one from the nostril and one from the neck but he remembered that scott had said that it was the servants and not the housebell which had to be pulled so he kept his grasp upon the lower then he touched the long vibrating neck with his stick and in an instant abbas farewell seemed to come from far behind him and the black rocks and yellow sand were dancing past on either side  it was his first experience of a trotting camel and at first the motion although irregular and abrupt was not unpleasant  having no stirrup or fixed point of any kind he could not rise to it but he gripped as tightly as be could with his knee and he tried to sway backwards and forwards as he had seen the arabs do  it was a large very concave makloofa saddle and he was conscious that he was bouncing about on it with as little power of adhesion as a billiardball upon a teatray  he gripped the two sides with his hands to hold himself steady  the creature had got into its long swinging stealthy trot its spongelike feet making no sound upon the hard sand  anerley leaned back with his two hands gripping hard behind him and he whooped the creature on  the sun had already sunk behind the line of black volcanic peaks which look like huge slagheaps at the mouth of a mine the western sky had taken that lovely light green and pale pink tint which makes evening beautiful upon the nile and the old brown river itself swirling down amongst the black rocks caught some shimmer of the colours above  the glare the heat and the piping of the insects had all ceased together  in spite of his aching head anerley could have cried out for pure physical joy as the swift creature beneath him flew along with him through that cool invigorating air with the virile north wind soothing his pringling face  he had looked at his watch and now he made a swift calculation of times and distances  it was past six when he had left the camp  over broken ground it was impossible that he could hope to do more than seven miles an hourless on bad parts more on the smooth  his recollection of the track was that there were few smooth and many bad  he would be lucky then if he reached sarras anywhere from twelve to one  then the messages took a good two hours to go through for they had to be transcribed at cairo  at the best he could only hope to have told his story in fleet street at two or three in the morning  it was possible that he might manage it but the chances seemed enormously against him about three the morning edition would be made up and his chance gone for ever  the one thing clear was that only the first man at the wires would have any chance at all and anerley meant to be first if hard riding could do it  so he tapped away at the birdlike neck and the creatures long loose limbs went faster and faster at every tap where the rocky spurs ran down to the river horses would have to go round while camels might get across so that anerley felt that he was always gaining upon his companions  but there was a price to be paid for the feeling  he had heard of men who had burst when on camel journeys and he knew that the arabs swathe their bodies tightly in broad cloth bandages when they prepare for a long march  it had seemed unnecessary and ridiculous when he first began to speed over the level track but now when he got on the rocky paths he understood what it meant  never for an instant was he at the same angle  backwards forwards he swung with a tingling jar at the end of each sway until he ached from his neck to his knees  it caught him across the shoulders it caught him down the spine it gripped him over the loins it marked the lower line of his ribs with one heavy dull throb  he clutched here and there with his hand to try and ease the strain upon his muscles  he drew up his knees altered his seat and set his teeth with a grim determination to go through with it should it kill him  his head was splitting his flayed face smarting and every joint in his body aching as if it were dislocated  but he forgot all that when with the rising of the moon he heard the clinking of horses hoofs down upon the track by the river and knew that unseen by them he had already got well abreast of his companions  but he was hardly halfway and the time already eleven  all day the needles had been ticking away without intermission in the little corrugated iron hut which served as a telegraph station at sarras  with its bare walls and its packingcase seats it was none the less for the moment one of the vital spots upon the earths surface and the crisp importunate ticking might have come from the worldold clock of destiny  many august people had been at the other end of those wires and had communed with the moistfaced military clerk  a french premier had demanded a pledge and an english marquis had passed on the request to the general in command with a question as to how it would affect the situation  cipher telegrams had nearly driven the clerk out of his wits for of all crazy occupations the taking of a cipher message when you are without the key to the cipher is the worst much high diplomacy had been going on all day in the innermost chambers of european chancellories and the results of it had been whispered into this little corrugatediron hut  about two in the morning an enormous despatch had come at last to an end and the weary operator had opened the door and was lighting his pipe in the cool fresh air when he saw a camel plump down in the dust and a man who seemed to be in the last stage of drunkenness come rolling towards him  whats the time he cried in a voice which appeared to be the only sober thing about him  it was on the clerks lips to say that it was time that the questioner was in his bed but it is not safe upon a campaign to be ironical at the expense of khakiclad men  he contented himself therefore with the bald statement that it was after two  but no retort that he could have devised could have had a more crushing effect  the voice turned drunken also and the man caught at the doorpost to uphold him  two oclock im done after all said he  his head was tied up in a bloody handkerchief his face was crimson and he stood with his legs crooked as if the pith had all gone out of his back  the clerk began to realise that something out of the ordinary was in the wind  how long does it take to get a wire to london  about two hours  and its two now  i could not get it there before four  before three  four  no three  but you said two hours  yes but theres more than an hours difference in longitude  by heaven ill do it yet cried anerley and staggering to a packingcase he began the dictation of his famous despatch  and so it came about that the gazette had a long column with headlines like an epitaph when the sheets of the intelligence and the courier were as blank as the faces of their editors  and so too it happened that when two weary men upon two foundered horses arrived about four in the morning at the sarras postoffice they looked at each other in silence and departed noiselessly with the conviction that there are some situations with which the english language is not capable of dealing     the new catacomb   look here burger said kennedy i do wish that you would confide in me  the two famous students of roman remains sat together in kennedys comfortable room overlooking the corso  the night was cold and they had both pulled up their chairs to the unsatisfactory italian stove which threw out a zone of stuffiness rather than of warmth  outside under the bright winter stars lay the modern rome the long double chain of the electric lamps the brilliantly lighted cafes the rushing carriages and the dense throng upon the footpaths  but inside in the sumptuous chamber of the rich young english archaeologist there was only old rome to be seen  cracked and timeworn friezes hung upon the walls grey old busts of senators and soldiers with their fighting heads and their hard cruel faces peered out from the corners  on the centre table amidst a litter of inscriptions fragments and ornaments there stood the famous reconstruction by kennedy of the baths of caracalla which excited such interest and admiration when it was exhibited in berlin  amphorae hung from the ceiling and a litter of curiosities strewed the rich red turkey carpet  and of them all there was not one which was not of the most unimpeachable authenticity and of the utmost rarity and value for kennedy though little more than thirty had a european reputation in this particular branch of research and was moreover provided with that long purse which either proves to be a fatal handicap to the students energies or if his mind is still true to its purpose gives him an enormous advantage in the race for fame  kennedy had often been seduced by whim and pleasure from his studies but his mind was an incisive one capable of long and concentrated efforts which ended in sharp reactions of sensuous languor  his handsome face with its high white forehead its aggressive nose and its somewhat loose and sensuous mouth was a fair index of the compromise between strength and weakness in his nature  of a very different type was his companion julius burger  he came of a curious blend a german father and an italian mother with the robust qualities of the north mingling strangely with the softer graces of the south  blue teutonic eyes lightened his sunbrowned face and above them rose a square massive forehead with a fringe of close yellow curls lying round it  his strong firm jaw was cleanshaven and his companion had frequently remarked how much it suggested those old roman busts which peered out from the shadows in the corners of his chamber under its bluff german strength there lay always a suggestion of italian subtlety but the smile was so honest and the eyes so frank that one understood that this was only an indication of his ancestry with no actual bearing upon his character  in age and in reputation he was on the same level as his english companion but his life and his work had both been far more arduous twelve years before he had come as a poor student to rome and had lived ever since upon some small endowment for research which had been awarded to him by the university of bonn  painfully slowly and doggedly with extraordinary tenacity and singlemindedness he had climbed from rung to rung of the ladder of fame until now he was a member of the berlin academy and there was every reason to believe that he would shortly be promoted to the chair of the greatest of german universities  but the singleness of purpose which had brought him to the same high level as the rich and brilliant englishman had caused him in everything outside their work to stand infinitely below him  he had never found a pause in his studies in which to cultivate the social graces  it was only when he spoke of his own subject that his face was filled with life and soul  at other times he was silent and embarrassed too conscious of his own limitations in larger subjects and impatient of that small talk which is the conventional refuge of those who have no thoughts to express  and yet for some years there had been an acquaintanceship which appeared to be slowly ripening into a friendship between these two very different rivals  the base and origin of this lay in the fact that in their own studies each was the only one of the younger men who had knowledge and enthusiasm enough to properly appreciate the other  their common interests and pursuits had brought them together and each had been attracted by the others knowledge  and then gradually something had been added to this  kennedy had been amused by the frankness and simplicity of his rival while burger in turn had been fascinated by the brilliancy and vivacity which had made kennedy such a favourite in roman society  i say had because just at the moment the young englishman was somewhat under a cloud  a love affair the details of which had never quite come out had indicated a heartlessness and callousness upon his part which shocked many of his friends  but in the bachelor circles of students and artists in which he preferred to move there is no very rigid code of honour in such matters and though a head might be shaken or a pair of shoulders shrugged over the flight of two and the return of one the general sentiment was probably one of curiosity and perhaps of envy rather than of reprobation  look here burger said kennedy looking hard at the placid face of his companion i do wish that you would confide in me  as he spoke he waved his hand in the direction of a rug which lay upon the floor  on the rug stood a long shallow fruitbasket of the light wickerwork which is used in the campagna and this was heaped with a litter of objects inscribed tiles broken inscriptions cracked mosaics torn papyri rusty metal ornaments which to the uninitiated might have seemed to have come straight from a dustmans bin but which a specialist would have speedily recognized as unique of their kind  the pile of odds and ends in the flat wickerwork basket supplied exactly one of those missing links of social development which are of such interest to the student  it was the german who had brought them in and the englishmans eyes were hungry as he looked at them  i wont interfere with your treasuretrove but i should very much like to hear about it he continued while burger very deliberately lit a cigar  it is evidently a discovery of the first importance  these inscriptions will make a sensation throughout europe  for every one here there are a million there said the german  there are so many that a dozen savants might spend a lifetime over them and build up a reputation as solid as the castle of st angelo  kennedy was thinking with his fine forehead wrinkled and his fingers playing with his long fair moustache  you have given yourself away burger said he at last  your words can only apply to one thing  you have discovered a new catacomb  i had no doubt that you had already come to that conclusion from an examination of these objects  well they certainly appeared to indicate it but your last remarks make it certain  there is no place except a catacomb which could contain so vast a store of relics as you describe  quite so  there is no mystery about that  i have discovered a new catacomb  where  ah that is my secret my dear kennedy  suffice it that it is so situated that there is not one chance in a million of anyone else coming upon it  its date is different from that of any known catacomb and it has been reserved for the burial of the highest christians so that the remains and the relics are quite different from anything which has ever been seen before  if i was not aware of your knowledge and of your energy my friend i would not hesitate under the pledge of secrecy to tell you everything about it  but as it is i think that i must certainly prepare my own report of the matter before i expose myself to such formidable competition  kennedy loved his subject with a love which was almost a maniaa love which held him true to it amidst all the distractions which come to a wealthy and dissipated young man  he had ambition but his ambition was secondary to his mere abstract joy and interest in everything which concerned the old life and history of the city  he yearned to see this new underworld which his companion had discovered  look here burger said he earnestly i assure you that you can trust me most implicitly in the matter  nothing would induce me to put pen to paper about anything which i see until i have your express permission  i quite understand your feeling and i think it is most natural but you have really nothing whatever to fear from me  on the other hand if you dont tell me i shall make a systematic search and i shall most certainly discover it  in that case of course i should make what use i liked of it since i should be under no obligation to you  burger smiled thoughtfully over his cigar  i have noticed friend kennedy said he that when i want information over any point you are not always so ready to supply it  when did you ever ask me anything that i did not tell you  you remember for example my giving you the material for your paper about the temple of the vestals  ah well that was not a matter of much importance  if i were to question you upon some intimate thing would you give me an answer i wonder  this new catacomb is a very intimate thing to me and i should certainly expect some sign of confidence in return  what you are driving at i cannot imagine said the englishman but if you mean that you will answer my question about the catacomb if i answer any question which you may put to me i can assure you that i will certainly do so  well then said burger leaning luxuriously back in his settee and puffing a blue tree of cigarsmoke into the air tell me all about your relations with miss mary saunderson  kennedy sprang up in his chair and glared angrily at his impassive companion  what the devil do you mean he cried  what sort of a question is this  you may mean it as a joke but you never made a worse one  no i dont mean it as a joke said burger simply  i am really rather interested in the details of the matter  i dont know much about the world and women and social life and that sort of thing and such an incident has the fascination of the unknown for me  i know you and i knew her by sighti had even spoken to her once or twice  i should very much like to hear from your own lips exactly what it was which occurred between you  i wont tell you a word  thats all right  it was only my whim to see if you would give up a secret as easily as you expected me to give up my secret of the new catacomb  you wouldnt and i didnt expect you to  but why should you expect otherwise of me  theres st johns clock striking ten  it is quite time that i was going home  no wait a bit burger said kennedy this is really a ridiculous caprice of yours to wish to know about an old love affair which has burned out months ago  you know we look upon a man who kisses and tells as the greatest coward and villain possible  certainly said the german gathering up his basket of curiosities when he tells anything about a girl which is previously unknown he must be so  but in this case as you must be aware it was a public matter which was the common talk of rome so that you are not really doing miss mary saunderson any injury by discussing her case with me but still i respect your scruples and so good night  wait a bit burger said kennedy laying his hand upon the others arm i am very keen upon this catacomb business and i cant let it drop quite so easily  would you mind asking me something else in returnsomething not quite so eccentric this time  no no you have refused and there is an end of it said burger with his basket on his arm  no doubt you are quite right not to answer and no doubt i am quite right alsoand so again my dear kennedy good night  the englishman watched burger cross the room and he had his hand on the handle of the door before his host sprang up with the air of a man who is making the best of that which cannot be helped  hold on old fellow said he i think you are behaving in a most ridiculous fashion but still if this is your condition i suppose that i must submit to it  i hate saying anything about a girl but as you say it is all over rome and i dont suppose i can tell you anything which you do not know already  what was it you wanted to know  the german came back to the stove and laying down his basket he sank into his chair once more  may i have another cigar said he  thank you very much  i never smoke when i work but i enjoy a chat much more when i am under the influence of tobacco  now as regards this young lady with whom you had this little adventure  what in the world has become of her  she is at home with her own people  oh reallyin england  yes  what part of englandlondon  no twickenham  you must excuse my curiosity my dear kennedy and you must put it down to my ignorance of the world  no doubt it is quite a simple thing to persuade a young lady to go off with you for three weeks or so and then to hand her over to her own family atwhat did you call the place  twickenham  quite soat twickenham  but it is something so entirely outside my own experience that i cannot even imagine how you set about it  for example if you had loved this girl your love could hardly disappear in three weeks so i presume that you could not have loved her at all  but if you did not love her why should you make this great scandal which has damaged you and ruined her  kennedy looked moodily into the red eye of the stove  thats a logical way of looking at it certainly said he  love is a big word and it represents a good many different shades of feeling  i liked her and well you say youve seen heryou know how charming she can look but still i am willing to admit looking back that i could never have really loved her  then my dear kennedy why did you do it  the adventure of the thing had a great deal to do with it  what  you are so fond of adventures  where would the variety of life be without them  it was for an adventure that i first began to pay my attentions to her  ive chased a good deal of game in my time but theres no chase like that of a pretty woman  there was the piquant difficulty of it also for as she was the companion of lady emily rood it was almost impossible to see her alone on the top of all the other obstacles which attracted me i learned from her own lips very early in the proceedings that she was engaged  mein gott  to whom  she mentioned no names  i do not think that anyone knows that  so that made the adventure more alluring did it  well it did certainly give a spice to it  dont you think so  i tell you that i am very ignorant about these things  my dear fellow you can remember that the apple you stole from your neighbours tree was always sweeter than that which fell from your own and then i found that she cared for me  whatat once  oh no it took about three months of sapping and mining  but at last i won her over  she understood that my judicial separation from my wife made it impossible for me to do the right thing by herbut she came all the same and we had a delightful time as long as it lasted  but how about the other man  kennedy shrugged his shoulders  i suppose it is the survival of the fittest said he  if he had been the better man she would not have deserted him  lets drop the subject for i have had enough of it  only one other thing  how did you get rid of her in three weeks  well we had both cooled down a bit you understand  she absolutely refused under any circumstances to come back to face the people she had known in rome  now of course rome is necessary to me and i was already pining to be back at my workso there was one obvious cause of separation  then again her old father turned up at the hotel in london and there was a scene and the whole thing became so unpleasant that reallythough i missed her dreadfully at firsti was very glad to slip out of it  now i rely upon you not to repeat anything of what i have said  my dear kennedy i should not dream of repeating it  but all that you say interests me very much for it gives me an insight into your way of looking at things which is entirely different from mine for i have seen so little of life  and now you want to know about my new catacomb theres no use my trying to describe it for you would never find it by that  there is only one thing and that is for me to take you there  that would be splendid  when would you like to come  the sooner the better  i am all impatience to see it  well it is a beautiful nightthough a trifle cold  suppose we start in an hour  we must be very careful to keep the matter to ourselves if anyone saw us hunting in couples they would suspect that there was something going on  we cant be too cautious said kennedy  is it far  some miles  not too far to walk  oh no we could walk there easily  we had better do so then  a cabmans suspicions would be aroused if he dropped us both at some lonely spot in the dead of the night  quite so  i think it would be best for us to meet at the gate of the appian way at midnight  i must go back to my lodgings for the matches and candles and things  all right burger  i think it is very kind of you to let me into this secret and i promise you that i will write nothing about it until you have published your report  goodbye for the present  you will find me at the gate at twelve  the cold clear air was filled with the musical chimes from that city of clocks as burger wrapped in an italian overcoat with a lantern hanging from his hand walked up to the rendezvous  kennedy stepped out of the shadow to meet him  you are ardent in work as well as in love said the german laughing  yes i have been waiting here for nearly half an hour  i hope you left no clue as to where we were going  not such a fool  by jove i am chilled to the bone  come on burger let us warm ourselves by a spurt of hard walking  their footsteps sounded loud and crisp upon the rough stone paving of the disappointing road which is all that is left of the most famous highway of the world  a peasant or two going home from the wineshop and a few carts of country produce coming up to rome were the only things which they met  they swung along with the huge tombs looming up through the darkness upon each side of them until they had come as far as the catacombs of st calixtus and saw against a rising moon the great circular bastion of cecilia metella in front of them  then burger stopped with his hand to his side  your legs are longer than mine and you are more accustomed to walking said he laughing  i think that the place where we turn off is somewhere here  yes this is it round the corner of the trattoria  now it is a very narrow path so perhaps i had better go in front and you can follow  he had lit his lantern and by its light they were enabled to follow a narrow and devious track which wound across the marshes of the campagna  the great aqueduct of old rome lay like a monstrous caterpillar across the moonlit landscape and their road led them under one of its huge arches and past the circle of crumbling bricks which marks the old arena  at last burger stopped at a solitary wooden cowhouse and he drew a key from his pocket  surely your catacomb is not inside a house cried kennedy  the entrance to it is  that is just the safeguard which we have against anyone else discovering it  does the proprietor know of it  not he  he had found one or two objects which made me almost certain that his house was built on the entrance to such a place  so i rented it from him and did my excavations for myself  come in and shut the door behind you  it was a long empty building with the mangers of the cows along one wall  burger put his lantern down on the ground and shaded its light in all directions save one by draping his overcoat round it  it might excite remark if anyone saw a light in this lonely place said he just help me to move this boarding  the flooring was loose in the corner and plank by plank the two savants raised it and leaned it against the wall  below there was a square aperture and a stair of old stone steps which led away down into the bowels of the earth  be careful cried burger as kennedy in his impatience hurried down them  it is a perfect rabbitswarren below and if you were once to lose your way there the chances would be a hundred to one against your ever coming out again  wait until i bring the light  how do you find your own way if it is so complicated  i had some very narrow escapes at first but i have gradually learned to go about  there is a certain system to it but it is one which a lost man if he were in the dark could not possibly find out  even now i always spin out a ball of string behind me when i am going far into the catacomb  you can see for yourself that it is difficult but every one of these passages divides and subdivides a dozen times before you go a hundred yards  they had descended some twenty feet from the level of the byre and they were standing now in a square chamber cut out of the soft tufa  the lantern cast a flickering light bright below and dim above over the cracked brown walls  in every direction were the black openings of passages which radiated from this common centre  i want you to follow me closely my friend said burger  do not loiter to look at anything upon the way for the place to which i will take you contains all that you can see and more  it will save time for us to go there direct  he led the way down one of the corridors and the englishman followed closely at his heels  every now and then the passage bifurcated but burger was evidently following some secret marks of his own for he neither stopped nor hesitated  everywhere along the walls packed like the berths upon an emigrant ship lay the christians of old rome  the yellow light flickered over the shrivelled features of the mummies and gleamed upon rounded skulls and long white armbones crossed over fleshless chests  and everywhere as he passed kennedy looked with wistful eyes upon inscriptions funeral vessels pictures vestments utensils all lying as pious hands had placed them so many centuries ago  it was apparent to him even in those hurried passing glances that this was the earliest and finest of the catacombs containing such a storehouse of roman remains as had never before come at one time under the observation of the student  what would happen if the light went out he asked as they hurried on  i have a spare candle and a box of matches in my pocket  by the way kennedy have you any matches  no you had better give me some  oh that is all right  there is no chance of our separating  how far are we going  it seems to me that we have walked at least a quarter of a mile  more than that i think  there is really no limit to the tombsat least i have never been able to find any  this is a very difficult place so i think that i will use our ball of string  he fastened one end of it to a projecting stone and he carried the coil in the breast of his coat paying it out as he advanced  kennedy saw that it was no unnecessary precaution for the passages had become more complexed and tortuous than ever with a perfect network of intersecting corridors but these all ended in one large circular hall with a square pedestal of tufa topped with a slab of marble at one end of it  by jove cried kennedy in an ecstasy as burger swung his lantern over the marble  it is a christian altarprobably the first one in existence  here is the little consecration cross cut upon the corner of it  no doubt this circular space was used as a church  precisely said burger  if i had more time i should like to show you all the bodies which are buried in these niches upon the walls for they are the early popes and bishops of the church with their mitres their croziers and full canonicals  go over to that one and look at it kennedy went across and stared at the ghastly head which lay loosely on the shredded and mouldering mitre  this is most interesting said he and his voice seemed to boom against the concave vault  as far as my experience goes it is unique bring the lantern over burger for i want to see them all  but the german had strolled away and was standing in the middle of a yellow circle of light at the other side of the hall  do you know how many wrong turnings there are between this and the stairs he asked  there are over two thousand  no doubt it was one of the means of protection which the christians adopted  the odds are two thousand to one against a man getting out even if he had a light but if he were in the dark it would of course be far more difficult  so i should think  and the darkness is something dreadful  i tried it once for an experiment  let us try it again  he stooped to the lantern and in an instant it was as if an invisible hand was squeezed tightly over each of kennedys eyes  never had he known what such darkness was  it seemed to press upon him and to smother him  it was a solid obstacle against which the body shrank from advancing  he put his hands out to push it back from him  that will do burger said he lets have the light again  but his companion began to laugh and in that circular room the sound seemed to come from every side at once  you seem uneasy friend kennedy said he  go on man light the candle said kennedy impatiently  its very strange kennedy but i could not in the least tell by the sound in which direction you stand  could you tell where i am  no you seem to be on every side of me  if it were not for this string which i hold in my hand i should not have a notion which way to go  i dare say not  strike a light man and have an end of this nonsense  well kennedy there are two things which i understand that you are very fond of  the one is adventure and the other is an obstacle to surmount  the adventure must be the finding of your way out of this catacomb  the obstacle will be the darkness and the two thousand wrong turns which make the way a little difficult to find  but you need not hurry for you have plenty of time and when you halt for a rest now and then i should like you just to think of miss mary saunderson and whether you treated her quite fairly  you devil what do you mean roared kennedy  he was running about in little circles and clasping at the solid blackness with both hands  goodbye said the mocking voice and it was already at some distance i really do not think kennedy even by your own showing that you did the right thing by that girl  there was only one little thing which you appeared not to know and i can supply it  miss saunderson was engaged to a poor ungainly devil of a student and his name was julius burger there was a rustle somewherethe vague sound of a foot striking a stoneand then there fell silence upon that old christian churcha stagnant heavy silence which closed round kennedy and shut him in like water round a drowning man   some two months afterwards the following paragraph made the round of the european press      one of the most interesting discoveries of recent years is    that of the new catacomb in rome which lies some distance to the    east of the wellknown vaults of st calixtus  the finding of this    important burialplace which is exceedingly rich in most    interesting early christian remains is due to the energy and    sagacity of dr julius burger the young german specialist who is    rapidly taking the first place as an authority upon ancient rome    although the first to publish his discovery it appears that a less    fortunate adventurer had anticipated dr burger  some months ago    mr kennedy the wellknown english student disappeared suddenly    from his rooms in the corso and it was conjectured that his    association with a recent scandal had driven him to leave rome  it    appears now that he had in reality fallen a victim to that fervid    love of archaeology which had raised him to a distinguished place    among living scholars  his body was discovered in the heart of the    new catacomb and it was evident from the condition of his feet and    boots that he had tramped for days through the tortuous corridors    which make these subterranean tombs so dangerous to explorers  the    deceased gentleman had with inexplicable rashness made his way    into this labyrinth without as far as can be discovered taking    with him either candles or matches so that his sad fate was the    natural result of his own temerity  what makes the matter more    painful is that dr julius burger was an intimate friend of the    deceased  his joy at the extraordinary find which he has been so    fortunate as to make has been greatly marred by the terrible fate    of his comrade and fellowworker    the debut of bimbashi joyce   it was in the days when the tide of mahdism which had swept in such a flood from the great lakes and darfur to the confines of egypt had at last come to its full and even begun as some hoped to show signs of a turn  at its outset it had been terrible  it had engulfed hickss army swept over gordon and khartoum rolled behind the british forces as they retired down the river and finally cast up a spray of raiding parties as far north as assouan  then it found other channels to east and west to central africa and to abyssinia and retired a little on the side of egypt  for ten years there ensued a lull during which the frontier garrisons looked out upon those distant blue hills of dongola behind the violet mists which draped them lay a land of blood and horror  from time to time some adventurer went south towards those hazegirt mountains tempted by stories of gum and ivory but none ever returned  once a mutilated egyptian and once a greek woman mad with thirst and fear made their way to the lines  they were the only exports of that country of darkness  sometimes the sunset would turn those distant mists into a bank of crimson and the dark mountains would rise from that sinister reek like islands in a sea of blood  it seemed a grim symbol in the southern heaven when seen from the fortcapped hills by wady halfa  ten years of lust in khartoum ten years of silent work in cairo and then all was ready and it was time for civilisation to take a trip south once more travelling as her wont is in an armoured train  everything was ready down to the last packsaddle of the last camel and yet no one suspected it for an unconstitutional government has its advantage  a great administrator had argued and managed and cajoled a great soldier had organised and planned and made piastres do the work of pounds  and then one night these two master spirits met and clasped hands and the soldier vanished away upon some business of his own  and just at that very time bimbashi hilary joyce seconded from the royal mallow fusiliers and temporarily attached to the ninth soudanese made his first appearance in cairo  napoleon had said and hilary joyce had noted that great reputations are only to be made in the east  here he was in the east with four tin cases of baggage a wilkinson sword a bonds slugthrowing pistol and a copy of greens introduction to the study of arabic  with such a start and the blood of youth running hot in his veins everything seemed easy  he was a little frightened of the general he had heard stories of his sternness to young officers but with tact and suavity he hoped for the best  so leaving his effects at shepherds hotel he reported himself at headquarters  it was not the general but the head of the intelligence department who received him the chief being still absent upon that business which had called him  hilary joyce found himself in the presence of a short thickset officer with a gentle voice and a placid expression which covered a remarkably acute and energetic spirit  with that quiet smile and guileless manner he had undercut and outwitted the most cunning of orientals  he stood a cigarette between his fingers looking at the newcomer  i heard that you had come  sorry the chief isnt here to see you  gone up to the frontier you know  my regiment is at wady halfa  i suppose sir that i should report myself there at once  no i was to give you your orders he led the way to a map upon the wall and pointed with the end of his cigarette  you see this place its the oasis of kurkura little quiet i am afraid but excellent air  you are to get out there as quick as possible  youll find a company of the ninth and half a squadron of cavalry  you will be in command  hilary joyce looked at the name printed at the intersection of two black lines without another dot upon the map for several inches around it  a village sir  no a well  not very good water im afraid but you soon get accustomed to natron  its an important post as being at the junction of two caravan routes  all routes are closed now of course but still you never know who might come along them  we are there i presume to prevent raiding  well between you and me theres really nothing to raid  you are there to intercept messengers  they must call at the wells  of course you have only just come out but you probably understand already enough about the conditions of this country to know that there is a great deal of disaffection about and that the khalifa is likely to try and keep in touch with his adherents  then again senoussi lives up that wayhe waved his cigarette to the westwardthe khalifa might send a message to him along that route  anyhow your duty is to arrest everyone coming along and get some account of him before you let him go  you dont talk arabic i suppose  i am learning sir  well well youll have time enough for study there  and youll have a native officer ali something or other who speaks english and can interpret for you  well goodbyeill tell the chief that you reported yourself  get on to your post now as quickly as you can  railway to baliani the postboat to assouan and then two days on a camel in the libyan desert with an ababdeh guide and three baggagecamels to tie one down to their own exasperating pace however even two and a half miles an hour mount up in time and at last on the third evening from the blackened slagheap of a hill which is called the jebel kurkur hilary joyce looked down upon a distant clump of palms and thought that this cool patch of green in the midst of the merciless blacks and yellows was the fairest colour effect that he had ever seen  an hour later he had ridden into the little camp the guard had turned out to salute him his native subordinate had greeted him in excellent english and he had fairly entered into his own it was not an exhilarating place for a lengthy residence  there was one large bowlshaped grassy depression sloping down to the three pits of brown and brackish water  there was the grove of palm trees also beautiful to look upon but exasperating in view of the fact that nature has provided her least shady trees on the very spot where shade is needed most  a single widespread acacia did something to restore the balance  here hilary joyce slumbered in the heat and in the cool he inspected his squareshouldered spindleshanked soudanese with their cheery black faces and their funny little porkpie forage caps joyce was a martinet at drill and the blacks loved being drilled so the bimbashi was soon popular among them  but one day was exactly like another  the weather the view the employment the foodeverything was the same  at the end of three weeks he felt that he had been there for interminable years  and then at last there came something to break the monotony  one evening as the sun was sinking hilary joyce rode slowly down the old caravan road  it had a fascination for him this narrow track winding among the boulders and curving up the nullahs for he remembered how in the map it had gone on and on stretching away into the unknown heart of africa  the countless pads of innumerable camels through many centuries had beaten it smooth so that now unused and deserted it still wound away the strangest of roads a foot broad and perhaps two thousand miles in length  joyce wondered as he rode how long it was since any traveller had journeyed up it from the south and then he raised his eyes and there was a man coming along the path for an instant joyce thought that it might be one of his own men but a second glance assured him that this could not be so  the stranger was dressed in the flowing robes of an arab and not in the closefitting khaki of a soldier  he was very tall and a high turban made him seem gigantic  he strode swiftly along with head erect and the bearing of a man who knows no fear  who could he be this formidable giant coming out of the unknown the precursor possibly of a horde of savage spearmen  and where could he have walked from  the nearest well was a long hundred miles down the track  at any rate the frontier post of kurkur could not afford to receive casual visitors  hilary joyce whisked round his horse galloped into camp and gave the alarm  then with twenty horsemen at his back he rode out again to reconnoitre  the man was still coming on in spite of these hostile preparations  for an instant he hesitated when first he saw the cavalry but escape was out of the question and he advanced with the air of one who makes the best of a bad job  he made no resistance and said nothing when the hands of two troopers clutched at his shoulders but walked quietly between their horses into camp shortly afterwards the patrol came in again  there were no signs of any dervishes  the man was alone  a splendid trotting camel had been found lying dead a little way down the track  the mystery of the strangers arrival was explained  but why and whence and whitherthese were questions for which a zealous officer must find an answer  hilary joyce was disappointed that there were no dervishes  it would have been a great start for him in the egyptian army had he fought a little action on his own account  but even as it was he had a rare chance of impressing the authorities  he would love to show his capacity to the head of the intelligence and even more to that grim chief who never forgot what was smart or forgave what was slack the prisoners dress and bearing showed that he was of importance mean men do not ride purebred trotting camels  joyce sponged his head with cold water drank a cup of strong coffee put on an imposing official tarboosh instead of his sunhelmet and formed himself into a court of inquiry and judgment under the acacia tree  he would have liked his people to have seen him now with his two black orderlies in waiting and his egyptian native officer at his side  he sat behind a camptable and the prisoner strongly guarded was led up to him the man was a handsome fellow with bold grey eyes and a long black beard  why cried joyce the rascal is making faces at me  a curious contraction had passed over the mans features but so swiftly that it might have been a nervous twitch  he was now a model of oriental gravity  ask him who he is and what he wants  the native officer did so but the stranger made no reply save that the same sharp spasm passed once more over his face  well im blessed cried hilary joyce  of all the impudent scoundrels  he keeps on winking at me who are you you rascal  give an account of yourself  dye hear but the tall arab was as impervious to english as to arabic the egyptian tried again and again  the prisoner looked at joyce with his inscrutable eyes and occasionally twitched his face at him but never opened his mouth  the bimbashi scratched his head in bewilderment  look here mahomet ali weve got to get some sense out of this fellow you say there are no papers on him  no sir we found no papers  no clue of any kind  he has come far sir  a trotting camel does not die easily  he has come from dongola at least  well we must get him to talk  it is possible that he is deaf and dumb  not he  i never saw a man look more all there in my life  you might send him across to assouan  and give someone else the credit  no thank you  this is my bird but how are we going to get him to find his tongue  the egyptians dark eyes skirted the encampment and rested on the cooks fire  perhaps said he if the bimbashi thought fit  he looked at the prisoner and then at the burning wood  no no it wouldnt do  no by jove thats going too far  a very little might do it  no no  its all very well here but it would sound just awful if ever it got as far as fleet street  but i say he whispered we might frighten him a bit  theres no harm in that  no sir  tell them to undo the mans galabeeah  order them to put a horseshoe in the fire and make it redhot  the prisoner watched the proceedings with an air which had more of amusement than of uneasiness  he never winced as the black sergeant approached with the glowing shoe held upon two bayonets  will you speak now asked the bimbashi savagely  the prisoner smiled gently and stroked his beard  oh chuck the infernal thing away cried joyce jumping up in a passion  theres no use trying to bluff the fellow  he knows we wont do it  but i can and i will flog him and you can tell him from me that if he hasnt found his tongue by tomorrow morning ill take the skin off his back as sure as my names joyce  have you said all that  yes sir  well you can sleep upon it you beauty and a good nights rest may it give you  he adjourned the court and the prisoner as imperturbable as ever was led away by the guard to his supper of rice and water hilary joyce was a kindhearted man and his own sleep was considerably disturbed by the prospect of the punishment which he must inflict next day  he had hopes that the mere sight of the koorbash and the thongs might prevail over his prisoners obstinacy  and then again he thought how shocking it would be if the man proved to be really dumb after all  the possibility shook him so that he had almost determined by daybreak that he would send the stranger on unhurt to assouan and yet what a tame conclusion it would be to the incident  he lay upon his angareeb still debating it when the question suddenly and effectively settled itself  ali mahomet rushed into his tent  sir he cried the prisoner is gone  gone  yes sir and your own best riding camel as well  there is a slit cut in the tent and he got away unseen in the early morning  the bimbashi acted with all energy  cavalry rode along every track scouts examined the soft sand of the wadys for signs of the fugitive but no trace was discovered  the man had utterly disappeared  with a heavy heart hilary joyce wrote an official report of the matter and forwarded it to assouan  five days later there came a curt order from the chief that he should report himself there  he feared the worst from the stern soldier who spared others as little as he spared himself and his worst forebodings were realised  travelstained and weary he reported himself one night at the generals quarters  behind a table piled with papers and strewn with maps the famous soldier and his chief of intelligence were deep in plans and figures  their greeting was a cold one  i understand captain joyce said the general that you have allowed a very important prisoner to slip through your fingers  i am sorry sir  no doubt  but that will not mend matters  did you ascertain anything about him before you lost him  no sir  how was that  i could get nothing out of him sir  did you try  yes sir i did what i could  what did you do  well sir i threatened to use physical force  what did he say  he said nothing  what was he like  a tall man sir  rather a desperate character i should think  any way by which we could identify him  a long black beard sir  grey eyes  and a nervous way of twitching his face  well captain joyce said the general in his stern inflexible voice i cannot congratulate you upon your first exploit in the egyptian army you are aware that every english officer in this force is a picked man i have the whole british army from which to draw  it is necessary therefore that i should insist upon the very highest efficiency it would be unfair upon the others to pass over any obvious want of zeal or intelligence  you are seconded from the royal mallows i understand  yes sir  i have no doubt that your colonel will be glad to see you fulfilling your regimental duties again hilary joyces heart was too heavy for words  he was silent  i will let you know my final decision tomorrow morning  joyce saluted and turned upon his heel  you can sleep upon that you beauty and a good nights rest may it give you  joyce turned in bewilderment  where had those words been used before who was it who had used them  the general was standing erect  both he and the chief of the intelligence were laughing  joyce stared at the tall figure the erect bearing the inscrutable grey eyes  good lord he gasped  well well captain joyce we are quits said the general holding out his hand  you gave me a bad ten minutes with that infernal redhot horseshoe of yours  ive done as much for you  i dont think we can spare you for the royal mallows just yet awhile  but sir but  the fewer questions the better perhaps  but of course it must seem rather amazing  i had a little private business with the kabbabish it must be done in person  i did it and came to your post in my return  i kept on winking at you as a sign that i wanted a word with you alone  yes yes  i begin to understand  i couldnt give it away before all those blacks or where should i have been the next time i used my false beard and arab dress  you put me in a very awkward position  but at last i had a word alone with your egyptian officer who managed my escape all right  he  mahomet ali  i ordered him to say nothing  i had a score to settle with you but we dine at eight captain joyce  we live plainly here but i think i can do you a little better than you did me at kurkur    a foreign office romance   there are many folk who knew alphonse lacour in his old age  from about the time of the revolution of 48 until he died in the second year of the crimean war he was always to be found in the same corner of the cafe de provence at the end of the rue st honore coming down about nine in the evening and going when he could find no one to talk with  it took some selfrestraint to listen to the old diplomatist for his stories were beyond all belief and yet he was quick at detecting the shadow of a smile or the slightest little raising of the eyebrows  then his huge rounded back would straighten itself his bulldog chin would project and his rs would burr like a kettledrum  when he got as far as ah monsieur rrrrit or vous ne me crrrroyez pas donc it was quite time to remember that you had a ticket for the opera  there was his story of talleyrand and the five oystershells and there was his utterly absurd account of napoleons second visit to ajaccio then there was that most circumstantial romance which he never ventured upon until his second bottle had been uncorked of the emperors escape from st helenahow he lived for a whole year in philadelphia while count herbert de bertrand who was his living image personated him at longwood  but of all his stories there was none which was more notorious than that of the koran and the foreign office messenger  and yet when monsieur ottos memoirs were written it was found that there really was some foundation for old lacours incredible statement  you must know monsieur he would say that i left egypt after klebers assassination  i would gladly have stayed on for i was engaged in a translation of the koran and between ourselves i had thoughts at the time of embracing mahometanism for i was deeply struck by the wisdom of their views about marriage  they had made an incredible mistake however upon the subject of wine and this was what the mufti who attempted to convert me could never get over  then when old kleber died and menou came to the top i felt that it was time for me to go  it is not for me to speak of my own capacities monsieur but you will readily understand that the man does not care to be ridden by the mule  i carried my koran and my papers to london where monsieur otto had been sent by the first consul to arrange a treaty of peace for both nations were very weary of the war which had already lasted ten years  here i was most useful to monsieur otto on account of my knowledge of the english tongue and also if i may say so on account of my natural capacity  they were happy days during which i lived in the square of bloomsbury  the climate of monsieurs country is it must be confessed detestable  but then what would you have  flowers grow best in the rain  one has but to point to monsieurs fellow countrywomen to prove it  well monsieur otto our ambassador was kept terribly busy over that treaty and all of his staff were worked to death  we had not pitt to deal with which was perhaps as well for us  he was a terrible man that pitt and wherever half a dozen enemies of france were plotting together there was his sharppointed nose right in the middle of them the nation however had been thoughtful enough to put him out of office and we had to do with monsieur addington  but milord hawkesbury was the foreign minister and it was with him that we were obliged to do our bargaining  you can understand that it was no childs play  after ten years of war each nation had got hold of a great deal which had belonged to the other or to the others allies  what was to be given back and what was to be kept  is this island worth that peninsula  if we do this at venice will you do that at sierra leone  if we give up egypt to the sultan will you restore the cape of good hope which you have taken from our allies the dutch  so we wrangled and wrestled and i have seen monsieur otto come back to the embassy so exhausted that his secretary and i had to help him from his carriage to his sofa  but at last things adjusted themselves and the night came round when the treaty was to be finally signed  now you must know that the one great card which we held and which we played played played at every point of the game was that we had egypt  the english were very nervous about our being there  it gave us a foot at each end of the mediterranean you see and they were not sure that that wonderful little napoleon of ours might not make it the base of an advance against india  so whenever lord hawkesbury proposed to retain anything we had only to reply in that case of course we cannot consent to evacuate egypt and in this way we quickly brought him to reason  it was by the help of egypt that we gained terms which were remarkably favourable and especially that we caused the english to consent to give up the cape of good hope  we did not wish your people monsieur to have any foothold in south africa for history has taught us that the british foothold of one halfcentury is the british empire of the next  it is not your army or your navy against which we have to guard but it is your terrible younger son and your man in search of a career  when we french have a possession across the seas we like to sit in paris and to felicitate ourselves upon it with you it is different  you take your wives and your children and you run away to see what kind of place this may be and after that we might as well try to take that old square of bloomsbury away from you  well it was upon the first of october that the treaty was finally to be signed  in the morning i was congratulating monsieur otto upon the happy conclusion of his labours  he was a little pale shrimp of a man very quick and nervous and he was so delighted now at his own success that he could not sit still but ran about the room chattering and laughing while i sat on a cushion in the corner as i had learned to do in the east  suddenly in came a messenger with a letter which had been forwarded from paris  monsieur otto cast his eye upon it and then without a word his knees gave way and he fell senseless upon the floor  i ran to him as did the courier and between us we carried him to the sofa  he might have been dead from his appearance but i could still feel his heart thrilling beneath my palm  what is this then i asked  i do not know answered the messenger  monsieur talleyrand told me to hurry as never man hurried before and to put this letter into the hands of monsieur otto  i was in paris at midday yesterday  i know that i am to blame but i could not help glancing at the letter picking it out of the senseless hand of monsieur otto  my god the thunderbolt that it was  i did not faint but i sat down beside my chief and i burst into tears  it was but a few words but they told us that egypt had been evacuated by our troops a month before  all our treaty was undone then and the one consideration which had induced our enemies to give us good terms had vanished  in twelve hours it would not have mattered  but now the treaty was not yet signed  we should have to give up the cape  we should have to let england have malta now that egypt was gone we had nothing left to offer in exchange  but we are not so easily beaten we frenchmen  you english misjudge us when you think that because we show emotions which you conceal that we are therefore of a weak and womanly nature  you cannot read your histories and believe that  monsieur otto recovered his senses presently and we took counsel what we should do  it is useless to go on alphonse said he  this englishman will laugh at me when i ask him to sign  courage i cried and then a sudden thought coming into my headhow do we know that the english will have news of this  perhaps they may sign the treaty before they know of it  monsieur otto sprang from the sofa and flung himself into my arms  alphonse he cried you have saved me  why should they know about it  our news has come from toulon to paris and thence straight to london  theirs will come by sea through the straits of gibraltar  at this moment it is unlikely that anyone in paris knows of it save only talleyrand and the first consul  if we keep our secret we may still get our treaty signed  ah monsieur you can imagine the horrible uncertainty in which we spent the day  never never shall i forget those slow hours during which we sat together starting at every distant shout lest it should be the first sign of the rejoicing which this news would cause in london  monsieur otto passed from youth to age in a day  as for me i find it easier to go out and meet danger than to wait for it  i set forth therefore towards evening  i wandered here and wandered there i was in the fencingrooms of monsieur angelo and in the salondeboxe of monsieur jackson and in the club of brooks and in the lobby of the chamber of deputies but nowhere did i hear any news  still it was possible that milord hawkesbury had received it himself just as we had he lived in harley street and there it was that the treaty was to be finally signed that night at eight  i entreated monsieur otto to drink two glasses of burgundy before he went for i feared lest his haggard face and trembling hands should rouse suspicion in the english minister  well we went round together in one of the embassys carriages about halfpast seven  monsieur otto went in alone but presently on excuse of getting his portfolio he came out again with his cheeks flushed with joy to tell me that all was well  he knows nothing he whispered  ah if the next halfhour were over  give me a sign when it is settled said i  for what reason  because until then no messenger shall interrupt you  i give you my promisei alphonse lacour  he clasped my hand in both of his  i shall make an excuse to move one of the candles on to the table in the window said he and hurried into the house whilst i was left waiting beside the carriage  well if we could but secure ourselves from interruption for a single halfhour the day would be our own  i had hardly begun to form my plans when i saw the lights of a carriage coming swiftly from the direction of oxford street  ah if it should be the messenger  what could i do i was prepared to kill himyes even to kill himrather than at this last moment allow our work to be undone  thousands die to make a glorious war  why should not one die to make a glorious peace what though they hurried me to the scaffold  i should have sacrificed myself for my country  i had a little curved turkish knife strapped to my waist  my hand was on the hilt of it when the carriage which had alarmed me so rattled safely past me  but another might come  i must be prepared  above all i must not compromise the embassy  i ordered our carriage to move on and i engaged what you call a hackney coach  then i spoke to the driver and gave him a guinea  he understood that it was a special service  you shall have another guinea if you do what you are told said i  all right master said he turning his slow eyes upon me without a trace of excitement or curiosity   if i enter your coach  with another gentleman you will drive up and down harley street and take no orders from anyone but me  when i get out you will carry the other gentleman to watiers club in bruton street  all right master said he again  so i stood outside milord hawkesburys house and you can think how often my eyes went up to that window in the hope of seeing the candle twinkle in it  five minutes passed and another five  oh how slowly they crept along  it was a true october night raw and cold with a white fog crawling over the wet shining cobblestones and blurring the dim oillamps  i could not see fifty paces in either direction but my ears were straining straining to catch the rattle of hoofs or the rumble of wheels  it is not a cheering place monsieur that street of harley even upon a sunny day  the houses are solid and very respectable over yonder but there is nothing of the feminine about them  it is a city to be inhabited by males  but on that raw night amid the damp and the fog with the anxiety gnawing at my heart it seemed the saddest weariest spot in the whole wide world  i paced up and down slapping my hands to keep them warm and still straining my ears  and then suddenly out of the dull hum of the traffic down in oxford street i heard a sound detach itself and grow louder and louder and clearer and clearer with every instant until two yellow lights came flashing through the fog and a light cabriolet whirled up to the door of the foreign minister  it had not stopped before a young fellow sprang out of it and hurried to the steps while the driver turned his horse and rattled off into the fog once more  ah it is in the moment of action that i am best monsieur  you who only see me when i am drinking my wine in the cafe de provence cannot conceive the heights to which i rise  at that moment when i knew that the fruits of a ten years war were at stake i was magnificent  it was the last french campaign and i the general and army in one  sir said i touching him upon the arm are you the messenger for lord hawkesbury  yes said he  i have been waiting for you half an hour said i  you are to follow me at once  he is with the french ambassador  i spoke with such assurance that he never hesitated for an instant when he entered the hackney coach and i followed him in my heart gave such a thrill of joy that i could hardly keep from shouting aloud he was a poor little creature this foreign office messenger not much bigger than monsieur otto and imonsieur can see my hands now and imagine what they were like when i was sevenandtwenty years of age  well now that i had him in my coach the question was what i should do with him  i did not wish to hurt him if i could help it  this is a pressing business said he  i have a despatch which i must deliver instantly  our coach had rattled down harley street now in accordance with my instruction it turned and began to go up again  hullo he cried  whats this  what then  i asked  we are driving back  where is lord hawkesbury  we shall see him presently  let me out he shouted  theres some trickery in this  coachman stop the coach  let me out i say  i dashed him back into his seat as he tried to turn the handle of the door  he roared for help  i clapped my palm across his mouth  he made his teeth meet through the side of it  i seized his own cravat and bound it over his lips  he still mumbled and gurgled but the noise was covered by the rattle of our wheels  we were passing the ministers house and there was no candle in the window  the messenger sat quiet for a little and i could see the glint of his eyes as he stared at me through the gloom  he was partly stunned i think by the force with which i had hurled him into his seat  and also he was pondering perhaps what he should do next  presently he got his mouth partly free from the cravat  you shall have my watch and my purse if you will let me go said he  sir said i i am as honourable a man as you are yourself  who are you then  my name is of no importance  what do you want with me  it is a bet  a bet  what dyou mean  do you understand that i am on the government service and that you will see the inside of a gaol for this  that is the bet  that is the sport said i  you may find it poor sport before you finish he cried  what is this insane bet of yours then  i have bet i answered that i will recite a chapter of the koran to the first gentleman whom i should meet in the street  i do not know what made me think of it save that my translation was always running in my head  he clutched at the doorhandle and again i had to hurl him back into his seat  how long will it take he gasped  it depends on the chapter i answered  a short one then and let me go  but is it fair i argued  when i say a chapter i do not mean the shortest chapter but rather one which should be of average length  help help help he squealed and i was compelled again to adjust his cravat  a little patience said i and it will soon be over  i should like to recite the chapter which would be of most interest to yourself  you will confess that i am trying to make things as pleasant as i can for you  he slipped his mouth free again  quick then quick he groaned  the chapter of the camel i suggested  yes yes  or that of the fleet stallion  yes yes  only proceed  we had passed the window and there was no candle  i settled down to recite the chapter of the stallion to him  perhaps you do not know your koran very well monsieur  well i knew it by heart then as i know it by heart now  the style is a little exasperating for anyone who is in a hurry  but then what would you have  the people in the east are never in a hurry and it was written for them  i repeated it all with the dignity and solemnity which a sacred book demands and the young englishman he wriggled and groaned  when the horses standing on three feet and placing the tip of their fourth foot upon the ground were mustered in front of him in the evening he said i have loved the love of earthly good above the remembrance of things on high and have spent the time in viewing these horses  bring the horses back to me  and when they were brought back he began to cut off their legs and  it was at this moment that the young englishman sprang at me  my god how little can i remember of the next few minutes  he was a boxer this shred of a man  he had been trained to strike  i tried to catch him by the hands  pac pac he came upon my nose and upon my eye  i put down my head and thrust at him with it  pac he came from below  but ah i was too much for him  i hurled myself upon him and he had no place where he could escape from my weight  he fell flat upon the cushions and i seated myself upon him with such conviction that the wind flew from him as from a burst bellows  then i searched to see what there was with which i could tie him  i drew the strings from my shoes and with one i secured his wrists and with another his ankles  then i tied the cravat round his mouth again so that he could only lie and glare at me  when i had done all this and had stopped the bleeding of my own nose i looked out of the coach and ah monsieur the very first thing which caught my eyes was that candlethat dear little candleglimmering in the window of the minister

to watiers  for myself i sprang into our embassys carriage and a moment later the door of the minister opened  he had himself escorted monsieur otto downstairs and now so deep was he in talk that he walked out bareheaded as far as the carriage  as he stood there by the open door there came the rattle of wheels and a man rushed down the pavement  a despatch of great importance for milord hawkesbury he cried  i could see that it was not my messenger but a second one  milord hawkesbury caught the paper from his hand and read it by the light of the carriage lamp  his face monsieur was as white as this plate before he had finished  monsieur otto he cried we have signed this treaty upon a false understanding  egypt is in our hands  what cried monsieur otto  impossible  it is certain  it fell to abercrombie last month  in that case said monsieur otto it is very fortunate that the treaty is signed  very fortunate for you sir cried milord hawkesbury as he turned back to the house  next day monsieur what they call the bow street runners were after me but they could not run across salt water and alphonse lacour was receiving the congratulations of monsieur talleyrand and the first consul before ever his pursuers had got as far as dover
