edition  new york d appleton and company m dccc xcvii  copyright 1897 by d appleton and company  copyright 1892 by hamlin garland     to  william dean howells  the foremost historian of our common lives and the most vital figure in our literature i dedicate this study of the great middle west its contemporary life and landscape     preface to the new edition   in this story of a spoil of office it was my intention to treat life as it would present itself to a young western man of humble condition who should set himself to the task of winning a political success i have therefore maintained with considerable care the point of view of bradley talcott such a design loses in variety but gains it seems to me in unity and continuity of movement  it has one marked disadvantage however it is apt to be misunderstood by the reader who may take the characters events and theories judged by the central figure to be the authors estimate to illustrate ida wilbur is presented as she appeared to bradley talcott and not as the reader would see her and not as the author would have delineated her had she been taken as the central figure of the book this explanatory word seemed needed being given i leave its working out to the reader  the three great movements of the american farmer herein used as backgroundthe grange the alliance and the peoples partyseem to me to be as legitimate subjects for fiction as any war or crusade they came in impulses with mightiest enthusiasms they died out like waves upon the beach but the power which originated them did not die it will return in different forms again and again so long as the love of liberty and the hatred of injustice live in the hearts of men and women  what the next movement will be i do not know but when it comes bradley talcott and ida his wife will be foremost among its leaders  hamlin garland  chicago may 1897     contents   chapter                                                          page       ithe grange picnic

the seventies a curious vehicle left farmer councills door loaded with a merry group of young people it was a huge omnibus constructed out of a heavy farm wagon and a hay rack and was drawn by six horses the driver was councills hired man bradley talcott councill himself held between his vast knees the staff of a mighty flag in which they all took immense pride the girls of the grange had made it for the day  laughter and scraps of song and rude witticisms made the huge wagon a bouquet of smiling faces everybody laughed except bradley who sat with intent eyes and steady lips his sinewy brown hand holding the excited horses in place this intentness and selfmastery lent a sort of majesty to his roughhewn face  let em out a little brad said councill were a little late  behind them came teams before them were teams along every lane of the beautiful upland prairie teams were rolling rapidly all toward the south the day was perfect summer it made the heart of reticent bradley talcott ache with the beauty of it every time his thoughts went up to the blue sky the larks and bobolinks and redwings made every meadow riotous with song and the everalert kingbirds and flickers flew along from post to post as if to have a part in the celebration  on every side stretched fields of wheat green as emerald and soft as velvet some of it was high enough already to ripple in the soft winds the corn fields showed their yellowgreen rows of timid shoots and cattle on the pastures luxuriated in the fullness of the june grass the whole land was at its fairest and liberalest and it seemed peculiarly fitting that the farmers should go on a picnic this day of all days  at the four corners below stood scores of other wagons loaded to the rim with men women and children up and down the line rode milton jennings the marshal of the day exalted by the baton he held and the gay red sash looped across his shoulders everywhere rose merry shouts and far away at the head of the procession the burr oak band was playing all waited for the flag whose beautiful folds flamed afar in the bright sunlight  every member of the grange wore its quaint regalia apron sash and pouch of white orange buff and red each grange was headed by banners worked in silk by the patient fingers of the women counting the banners there were three granges presentliberty grange meadow grange and burr oak grange at the lead with the band the marshal of the leading grange came charging back along the line riding magnificently his fiery little horse afoam  are we all ready he shouted like a field officer  yaas  all ready tom  ready when you are came the fusillade of replies  he consulted a moment with milton the two horses prancing with unwonted excitement that transformed them into fiery chargers of romance in the eyes of the boys and girls just as the sash and baton transfigured milton into something martial  all ready there shouted the marshals with grandiloquent gestures of their beribboned rods the band blared out again and the teams began to move toward the west the men stood up to look ahead while the boys in the back end of the wagons craned perilously over the edge of the box to see how long the line was it seemed enormous to them and their admiration of the marshals broke forth in shrill cries of primitive wildness  many of the young fellows had hired at ruinous expense the carriages in which they sat with their girls wearing a quiet air of aristocratic reserve which did not allow them to shout sarcasms at milton when his horse broke into a trot and jounced him up and down till his hat flew off but mainly the young people were in huge bowered lumber wagons in wildly hilarious groups the girls in their simple white dresses tied with blue ribbon at the waist and the boys in their thick woolen suits which did allround duty for best wear  as they moved off across the prairie toward the dim blue belt of timber which marked the banks of rock river other processions joined them with banner and bands and choirs all making a peaceful and significant parade an army of reapers of grain not reapers of men some came singing john brown or hail columbia everywhere was a voiced excitement which told how tremendous the occasion seemed in every wagon hid in cool deeps of freshcut grass were unimaginable quantities of good things which the boys never for a moment forgot even in their great excitement  on the procession moved with gay flags and flashing banners the dust rolled up the cattle stared across the fences the colts ran snorting away tails waving like flags and unlucky toilers in the fields stopped to wave their hats and gaze wistfully till the caravan passed the men shouted jovial words to them and the boys waved their hats in ready sympathy  at ten oclock they entered the magnificent grove of oaks where a speakers stand had been erected and where enterprising salesmen from rock river had erected soda water and candy stands with an eye to business  there was already a stupendous crowd at least so it seemed to the farmers boys two or three bands were whanging away somewhere in the grove children were shouting and laughing and boys were racing to and fro playing ball or wrestling babies were screaming and the marshals were shouting directions to the entering teams in voices that rang through the vaulted foliage with thrilling effect and the harsh bray of the ice cream and candy sellers completed the confusion  bradleys skill as a horseman came out as he swung into the narrow winding road which led through threatening stumps into the heart of the wood past the speakers stand councill furled his great flag and trailed it over the heads of those behind and flora and ceres and all the other deities of the grange upheld the staff with smiling goodwill and so they drew up to the grand stand the most imposing turnout of the day they sprang out and mingled with the merry crowd while bradley drove away after he had taken care of the team he came back towards the grand stand and wandered about alone he was not a native of the country and knew very few of the people he stood about with a timid expression on his face that made him seem more awkward than he really was he was tall and strong and graceful when not conscious of himself as he was now he felt a little bitter at being ignoredthat is he felt it in a vague and wordless way  lovers passed him in pairs eating peanuts or hot candy which they bit off from a huge triangular mass still hot from the kettle he had never seen any candy just like that and wondered if he had better try a piece the speaking on the stand attracted and held his attention however oratory always had a powerful attraction for him he moved forward and stood leaning against a tree  seats had been arranged in a semicircle around the stand on which the speakers of the day the band and the singers were already grouped all around leaning against the trees twined in the branches of the oaks or ranked against the railing were the banners and mottoes of the various granges no 10 liberty grange justice is our plea meadow grange united we stand divided we fall bethel grange fraternity other mottoes were through difficulties to the stars equal rights to all special privileges to none a small organ sat upon the stand surrounded with the singers milton resplendent in his sash and his white vest and black coat sat beside the organist eileen the daughter of osmond deering  the choir arose to sing accompanied by the organ and their voices rolled out under the vaulted aisles of foliage with that thrilling faraway effect of the singing voice in the midst of illimitable spaces this was followed by prayer and then mr deering the president called upon everybody to join in singing the national anthem after which he made the opening address  he spoke of the marvellous growth of the order how it had sprung up from the soil at the need of the farmer it was the first great movement of the farmer in history and it was something to be proud of the farmer had been oppressed he had been helpless and would continue helpless till he asked and demanded his rights after a dignified and earnest speech he saidi will now introduce as the next speaker mr isaac hobkirk  mr hobkirk a large man with a very bad voice made a fiery speech down with the middlemen he cried and was applauded vigorously they are the bloodsuckers thats takin the life out of us farmers what we want is to deal right with the manufacturers an cut off these whitehanded fellers in rock river who git all we raise speechifyin and picnickin is all well an good but what we want is agents we want agents fr machinery wheat buyers agents fr groceries thats what we want thats what were here for thats what the grange was got together for down with the middlemen  this brought out vigorous applause and showed that a very large number agreed with him bradley sat silently through it all it didnt mean very much to him and he wished theyd sing again  the chairman again came forward napoleon said old men for counsel but young men for war but our young men have listened patiently to us old fellows for years and mebbe they dont think much of our counsel im going to call on milton jennings one of our rising young men  milton a handsome young fellow with yellow hair and smiling lips arose and came forward to the rail feeling furtively in his coattail pocket to see that his handkerchief was all right he was a student at the seminary and was considered a fine young orator this was his first attempt before so large an audience  ladies and gentlemen he began after clearing his throat brothers and sisters of the order i feel highly honored by the president by being thus called upon to address you old men for counsel is all right if they counsel what we young men want but im for war im for a fight in the interests of the farmer not merely a defensive warfare but an offensive warfare  how by the ballot mr president i know you dont agree with me i know its a rule of the order to keep politics out of it but i dont know of a better place to discuss the interests of the farmer its a mistake weve got to unite at the ballot box whats the use of our order if we dont we must be represented at the state legislature and we cant do that unless we make the grange a political factor  you may talk about legislative corruption mr president and about county rings to come near home cheers and cries now youre getting at it thats right etc but the only way to get em out is to vote em out thats a fact you msay we can talk it over outside the order yes but i tell you mr president the orders the place for it if its an educational thing then i say it ought to educate and educate in politics mr president  i tell you im for war lets go in to win when the falls work is done in fact from this time on mr president the farmers of this county ought to organize for the campaign cut and dry our tickets cut and dry our plans if we begin early and work together we can strangle the anacondy that is crushing us and the eagle of victory will perch on our banners on the third of november and the bloodsuckers trouble us no more forever  with this remarkable peroration spoken in a high monotonous key after the fashion of the political orator milton sat down mopping his face while his admirers cheered  the chairman who had been nervously twisting in his chair hastened to explain  fellowcitizens im not to be held responsible for anything anybody else speaks on this platform i do not believe with our young brother i think that politics will destroy the grange to make it a debating school on political questions would bring discord and wrangling into it i hope i shall never see the day i now ask brother jennings to say a few words  mr jennings a fat and jolly farmer came to the front looking very hot his collar had long since melted  i aint very much of a speechmaker mr president brothers and sisters fact is i sent my boy down to the seminary to learn how to talk sot i wouldnt haf to i guess he represents my idees purty well though all except this political idee i dont know about that i aint quite made up my mind on that point i guess id better leave the floor for somebody else  glad you left the floor whispered milton to his father as he sat down by his side milton was a merciless joker especially upon his father  we have with us today said the chairman in the tone of one who announces the coming in of the dessert one of the most eloquent speakers in the state one whose name all grangers know our state lecturer miss ida wilbur  the assembly rose to its feet with applause as a slender young woman stepped forth and waited with easy dignity to begin her speech there was something significant in her manner which was grave and dignified and a splendid stillness fell upon the audience as she began in a clear penetrating contralto  brothers and sisters in the order while i have been sitting here listening to your speakers i have been looking at the mottoes on your banners and i have been trying to find out by those expressions what your conception of this movement is i wonder whether its majesty appears to you as it does to me she paused for an instant we are in danger of losing sight of its larger meaning  primarily the object of the grange has been the education of the farmers it has been a great social educator and i am glad my friends and neighbors when i can look out upon such an assembly as this i see in it the rise of the idea of union and intelligent union but principally i see in it the meeting together of the farmers who live too much apart from the rest of the world  i believe she cried with lifted hand i believe this is the greatest movement of the farmer in the history of the world it is a movement against unjust discrimination no doubt but it has another side to me a poetic side i call it the farmer is a free citizen of a great republic it is true but he is a solitary free citizen he lives alone too much he meets his fellowmen too little his dull life his hard work make it almost impossible to keep his better nature uppermost the work of the grange is a social work she was supported by generous applause  it is not to antagonize town and country the work of the grange to me is not political keep politics out of it or it will destroy you use it to bring yourselves together let it furnish you with pleasant hours establish your agencies if you can but i care more for meetings like this i care more for the poetry there is in having flora and ceres and pomona brought into the farmers home  her great brown eyes glowed as she spoke and her lifted head thrilled those who sat near enough to see the emotion that was in the lines of her face the sun struck through the trees that swayed in masses overhead dappling the upturned faces with light and shade the leaves under the tread of the wind rustled softly and the soaring hawk looked down curiously as he drifted above the grove like a fleck of cloud  on bradley standing there alone there fell something mysterious like a light something whiter and more penetrating than the sunlight as he listened something stirred within him a vast longing a hopeless ambition nameless as it was strange his bronzed face paled and he breathed heavily his eyes absorbed every detail of the girls face and figure there was wonder in his eyes at her girlish face and something like awe at her powerful diction and her impersonal emotion she stood there like an incarnation of the great dreamworld that lay beyond his horizon the world of poets and singers in the far realms of light and luxury  i have a dream of what is coming she said in conclusion and her voice had a prophetic ring i see a time when the farmer will not need to live in a cabin on a lonely farm i see the farmers coming together in groups i see them with time to read and time to visit with their fellows i see them enjoying lectures in beautiful halls erected in every village i see them gather like the saxons of old upon the green at evening to sing and dance i see cities rising near them with schools and churches and concert halls and theatres i see a day when the farmer will no longer be a drudge and his wife a bond slave but happy men and women who will go singing to their pleasant tasks upon their fruitful farms the audience did not cheer it sat as if in church the girl seemed to be speaking prophecy  when the boys and girls will not go west nor to the city when life will be worth living in that day the moon will be brighter and the stars more glad and pleasure and poetry and love of life come back to the man who tills the soil  the people broke into wild applause when she finished all were deeply stirred tears were streaming down many faces and when deering arose to announce a song by the choir his voice shook and he made no secret of his deep emotion after the song he said neighbors we dont want to spoil that splendid speech with another this day the best thing we can do is to try to think that good time is here and eat our dinner with the resolution to bring that good time as soon as possible  bradley stood there after the others had risen the dazzling pictures called up by the speakers words were still moving confusedly in his brain they faded at last and he moved with a sigh and went out to feed the horses their oats     ii  the dinner under the oaks   the dinner made a beautiful scene the most idyllic in the farmers life the sun now high noon fell through the leaves in patches of quivering light upon the white tablecloth spread out upon the planks and it fell upon the fair hair of girls and upon the hard knotted fingers of men and women grown old in toil the rattle of dishes the harshkeyed unwonted laughter of the women and the sounding invitations to dinner given and taken filled the air the long plank seats placed together made capital tables and eager children squatted about wistfully watching the display of each new delicacy the crude abundance of the iowa farm had been brought out to make it a great dinner the boys could hardly be restrained from clutching at each new dish  the councills and the burns families took dinner together mrs burns fretful and worn cuffed the children back from the table while bringing out her biscuit and roast chicken some sat stolidly silent but bigvoiced councill joked in his heavy way with everyone within earshot  well the lord is on our side neighbor jennings today anyhow he roared across the space of two or three tables  hes always on our side brother councill smiled jennings  wal id know about that sometimes im a leettle in doubt  got something good to eat inquired jennings of mrs councill  land sakes no we never have anything fit to eat since janes gone to havin beaux my cookin aint fit for a hawg to eat  i aint agoin to eat it then roared councill in vast delight at his joke on himself ill go over and eat with marm jennings they all laughed at this  tell us sot we cn laff called mrs smith coming over to see what they did have  wheres brad said mrs councill looking about her aint he comin to dinner  i dont see him around anywheres mebbe hes out feedn the horses replied councill without concern  say that was a great speech that girl made put in brother smith coming over with a chicken leg in one hand and a buttered biscuit in the other but what we want is free trade  what we want is a home market said milton some distance away  oh go totexas with yr home market  tut tut tut no politics brethren interrupted jennings  bradley ignored by everybody was standing over by the trunk of a large oak tree watching from afar the young girl who had so stirred him she was eating dinner with deering his wife and daughter and milton who was there looking very bright and handsome or at least he appeared so to eileen deering a graceful little girl his classmate at the seminary  miss wilbur sat beside deering who was a large man with a type of face somewhat resembling lincolns she was smiling brightly but her smile had something thoughtful in it and her eyes had unknown deeps like a leafbottomed woodland pool across which the sun fell she was feeling yet the stress of emotion she had felt in speaking and was a little conscious of the admiring glances of the people  she saw once or twice a tall roughly dressed young farmer who seemed to be looking at her steadily and there was something in his glance a timid worshipful expression that touched her and made her observe him more closely he was very farmerlike she noticed his cheap coat fitted him badly and his hat was old and shapeless yet there was something natively fine and chivalrous in his admiration she felt that  youre a farmers daughter yourself said deering as if they had been speaking of somebody else who was  yes my father was a farmer im a teacher i only began a little while ago to speak in the interest of the farmer it seems to me that everybody is looking out for himself except the farmer and i want to help him to help himself i expect to speak in every county in the state this winter  bradley crept nearer he was eager to hear what she was saying he grew furtive in his manner when she observed him and he felt as if he were doing something criminal he saw miss wilbur say something to mr deering who looked up a moment later and said to bradley whom he did not know why certainly come and have some dinner plenty of it  bradley flushed hot with shame and indignation and moved away deeply humiliated they had taken him for a poor friendless lonely tramp and there was just enough truth in his loneliness to make it sting  say brad dont you want some grub called councill catching sight of him  quick ry lose it said burns  he sat down and fell upon the dinner silently but there was a hot flush still upon his face he was not a beau it had always been difficult for him to address a marriageable woman and a joke on that subject threw him into dumb confusion he had lived a dozen tender dreams of which no one knew a word indeed he never acknowledged them to himself he had admired in this way eileen deering whom he had seen with milton a few times during the year he now envied milton his easy air of calm selfpossession in the presence of two such beautiful girls there was a bitter feeling of rebellion in his heart  miss wilbur had stirred his unexplored self down where ambitions are born where aspirations rise like sunshot mists her words and the light of her face had gone already there was something sacred and ineffably sweet about her voice and face she had come to him as the right woman comes sometimes to a man and thereafter his whole life is changed  he walked away from the few people he knew and tried to interest himself in the games they were playing but he could not he drifted back to the grand stand and sought about till he could see miss wilbur once more she was so pure so beautiful to him  the hour or two after dinner was spent in visiting and getting acquainted and the time seemed all too short each granger took this opportunity of inquiring after the health of the other grangers of the county the young people wandered in laughing romping groups about the grounds buying peanuts and sugar candy and drinking the soda water and lemonade which the venders called with strenuous enterprise  on the shadowed side of the stand the leading men of the grange gathered consulting about plans and measures  now it seems to me that were going on all right now said deering were getting our goods cheap and were cuttin off the middleman  and were getting hold of the railways  yes but it dont amount to nothin compared to what ought to be done we ought o oust them infernal bloodsuckers thats in our courthouse and we want to do it as a grange  no said jennings in his placid way we can do that better ive got a plan  what we want said hobkirk is a party a ticket of our own then we can  no we cant do that it wont be right to do that we must stand by the party that has given us our railway legislation  milton and several of the younger farmers drew off one side and talked earnestly about the fall campaign  theyll beat us again unless we go in together milton said with emphatic gesticulation milton was a natural politician his words found quick response in the erratic hobkirk who had good ideas but whose temperament made all his words jagged shot he irritated where he meant to convince  bradley listened to it all without feeling that he had any part in it it didnt seem to him that politics had anything to do with the beautiful words of the girl on the stand the choir began to sing again and he walked toward them they sang on and the people listened while they packed away the dishes they sang auld lang syne and well meet beyond the river with that characteristic attraction of the common people for wistful sorrowful cadences which is a paradox not easily explained  all aboard called councill from his wagon as bradley drove the team up to the band stand while the merry young people clambered in and paired off along the seats he was seeing miss wilbur shaking hands with the people who paused to say goodby his heart ached for a glance of her brown eyes and a word but he held the reins in his great hands and his face showed only his usual impassive reticence he was only councills hired man  the banners were taken up the children loaded in the boys looking back wistfully to the games and the candystands councill unfurled his flag to the wind and bradley swung the eager horses into the lane on all sides the farmers teams were getting out into the road the work of the marshals was done each man went his own gait  the young people behind bradley began to sing      out on an ocean all boundless we ride         were homeward bound         homeward bound  and so along each lane through the red sunset the farmers rolled home home through lanes bordered with velvet green wheat across which the sunlight streamed in dazzling yellow floods home through wild prairies where the birds nested and the gophers whistled the dust rose up transformed into gold by the light of the setting sun the children fell asleep in their tired mothers arms the men shouted to each other from team to team discussing the speakers and the crops  smiles were few as each wagon turned into its gateway and rolled up to the silent house the sombre shadow of the farms drudgery had fallen again on faces unused to smiling  only the lovers lingering on the road till the moon rose and the witchery of night came to make the girlish eyes more brilliant softening their gayety into a wistful tenderness only to these did the close of the day seem as sweet and momentous as the morning while the trusty horse jogged on impatient of the slow pace set by his driver the lovers sat with little to say but with hearts lit by the light that can glorify for a few moons at least even the life of ceaseless toil     iii  bradley resolves to go to school   a farm is a good place to think in if a man has sufficient selfsustaining forcethat is if work does not dominate him and force him to think in petty or degrading circles  it is a lonely life especially lonely on a large farm in the west the life of a hired man like bradley talcott is spent mainly with the horses and cattle in the spring he works day after day with a drag or seeder moving to and fro an animate speck across a dull brown expanse of soil even when he has a companion there is little talk for there is little to say and the extra exertion of speaking against the wind or across distances soon forces them both into silence  true there is the glory of the vast sweep of sky the wild note of the crane the flight of geese the multitudinous twitter of sparrows and the subtle exalting smell of the fresh brown earth but these things do not compensate for human society nature palls upon the normal man when he is alone with her constantly the monotone of the wind and the monochrome of the sky oppress him his heart remains empty  the rustle of flashing bladelike corn leaves the vast cleancut mountainous clouds of june the shade of shimmering popple trees the whistle of plover and the sailing hawk do not satisfy the man who follows the cornplow with the hot sun beating down all day upon his bent head and dusty shoulders his point of view is not that from the hammock he is not out on a summer vacation if he thinks he thinks bitter things and when he speaks his words are apt to be oaths  still a man has time to think and occasionally a man dominates his work and refuses to be hardened and distorted many farmers swear at the team or the plow and everything that bothers them some whistle vacantly and mechanically all day or sing in endless succession the few gloomy songs they know bradley thought  he thought all summer long he was a powerful man physically and turned off his work with a ready knack which left him free to think all day as he moved to and fro in the rustling corn rows he thought and with his thinking his powers expanded he had the mysterious power of selfdevelopment  the centre of his thinking was that slender young woman and the words she had uttered he repeated her prophetic words as nearly as he could a hundred times he repeated them aloud as he plowed day after day through the dreamful september mist he began to look ahead and wonder what he should do or could do must he be a farmers hired man or a renter all his life his mind moved slowly from point to point but it never returned to its old dumb patience his mind like his body had unknown latent forces he was one of those natures whose delicacy and strength are alike hidden  brad dont know his strength councill was accustomed to say if he should ever get mad enough to fight the other fellerd better go avisitin and a person who knew his mind might have said if bradley makes up his mind to do a thing hell do it but no one knew his mind he did not know its resources himself  his mind seized upon every hint and bit by bit his resolution was formed milton going by one monday morning on his way to the seminary stopped beside the fence where brad was plowing and waited for him to come up he had a real interest in bradley  hello brad he called cheerily  hello milt  hows business  oh so so pretty cold  the wind was blowing cold and cuttingly from the northwest milton rosy with his walk dropped down beside the hedge of weeds in the sun and brad climbed over the fence and joined him it was warm and cosy there and the crickets were cheeping feebly in the russet grass where the sunlight fell the wind whistled through the weeds with a wild mournful sound bradley did not speak for some time he listened to milton at last he said abruptly  say milt what does it cost to go to school down there  depends on who goes cost me bout forty dollars a term shep an i room it and cook our own grub  whats the tuition  eight dollars a term  feller could go to the public school for nauthin couldnt he  yes and thatd be all it ud be worth said milton with fine scorn at an inferior institution  what does a room cost brad pursued after a silence  well ours cost bout three dollars a month but we have two rooms you could get one for fifty cents a week  he looked up at brad with a laugh in his eyes dont think of starting in right off do you  well i dont know but i might if i had money enough to carry me through  what y think o doin study law  no but

as if going into politics were really something fine are you  well theres no tellin what minit a fellers liable to be called on and id kinder like tohe fell off into silence again  milton jumped up well hold on this wont do fr me i must mosey along goodby he said and set off down the road  when does the next term begin called bradley  november 15th milton replied looking about for an instant better try it  bradley threw the lines over his shoulder and bending his head fell into deep calculation miltons clear tenor was heard ringing across the fields fitfully dying away milton made the most of everything and besides he was on his way to see eileen he could afford to be gay  bradley thought even while he husked the corn one of the bitterest of all farm tasks when the cold winds of november begin to blow councill had a large field of corn and every morning in the cold and frosty light ike and bradley were out in the field each with a team beautiful mornings if one could have looked upon it from a window in a comfortable home there were mornings when the glittering purple and orange domes of the oaks and maples swam in the mist dreamfully so beautiful the eyes lingered upon them wistfully mornings when the dim lines of the woods were a royal purple and grayblue shadows streamed from the trees upon the yellowgreen grass  husking was the last of the fall work and the last day of husking found bradley desolately undecided they had been working desperately all the week to finish the field on saturday it was a bitter cold morning as they leaped into the frostrimmed wagonbox and caught up the reins the halffrozen team sprang away with desperate energy making the wagon bound over the frozen ground with a thunderous clatter  in every field the sound of similar wagons getting out to work could be heard it was not yet light a leadengray dome of cloud had closed in over the morning sky and the feeling of snow was in the air there was only a dull flush of red in the east to show the night had been frostily clear  ike raised a great shout to let his neighbors know he was in the field councill with a fork over his shoulder was on his way down the lane to help a neighbor thresh ike jovially shook the reins above his colts and bradley followed close behind and the two wagons went crashing through the forest of corn the race started the blood of the drivers as well as that of the teams the cold wind cut the face like a knife and the crackling cornstalks flew through the air as the wagons swept over them reaching the farther side they turned in and faced toward the house the horses blowing white clouds of breath  jee whitaker shouted ike as he crouched on the leeward side of his wagon and threshed his arms around his chest after having finished blanketing his team to protect them against the ferocious wind im thunderin glad this is the last day of this kind o thing  he looked like a grizzly bear in bad repair he had an old fur cap on his head that concealed his ears and most of his face he wore a ragged coat that was generally gray but had white lines along the seams under this he wore another coat still more ragged and the whole was belted at the waist with an old surcingle like his father he was possessed of vast physical strength and took pride in his powers of endurance  wal here goes he said stripping off his outside coat its tough but it aint no use dreadin it  bradley smiled back at him in his wordless way and caught hold of the first ear it sent a shiver of pain through him his fingers worn to the quick protruded from his stiff ragged gloves and the motions of clasping and stripping the ear were like the rasp of a file on a naked nerve he shivered and swore but his oath was like a groan  the horses humped and shivering looked black and fuzzy by reason of their erected hair they tore at the cornstalks hungrily their tails streamed sidewise with the force of the wind which had a wild and lonesome sound as it swept across the sear stretches of the corn the stalks towered far above the heads of the huskers but did little to temper the onslaught of the blast  occasional flocks of geese drifted by in the grasp of the inexorable gale their necks outthrust as if they had already caught the gleam of their warm southern lagoons clouds of ducks more adventurous were seen in irregular flight rising and falling from the lonely fields with wild clapping of wings only the sparrows seemed indifferent to the cold  there was immensity in the dome of the unbroken seamless gray threatening sky there was majesty in the dim plain across which the morning light slowly fell the plain with its dark blue groves from which thin lines of smoke rose and hastened away and majesty in the wind that came from the illimitable and desolate north but the lonely huskers had no time to feel much less to think upon these things  they bent down to their work and snatched the red and yellow ears bare of their frosty husks with marvelous dexterity the first plunge over bradley found as usual that the sharpest pain was over the wind cut his face and an occasional driving flake of snow struck and clung to his face and stung his coat collar chafed his chin and the frost wet his gloves through and through but he warmed to it and at last almost forgot it he fell into thought again so deep that his work became absolutely mechanical  say brad lets go to that dance over at daviss shouted ike after an hour of silence  i guess not  why not  because i aint invited  oh thats all right ed he told me to bring anyone i felt like  i aint going all the same i may be in rock river by next wednesday  they aint no danger o youre going to rock river  bradley fell once more into the circle of his plans and went the round again he had saved two hundred dollars it was enough to take him to school a year but what then that was the recurring question it was the most momentous day in his life should he spend his money in this way every dollar of it represented toil long days of lonely plowing or dragging long days under the burning harvest sun it was all he had all he had to show for his life was it right to spend it for schooling  what goodll it do yeh ike asked one day when bradley was feeling out for a little helpful sympathy better buy a team with it and rent a piece of land what y goan to do after you spent the money  i dont know bradley had replied in his honest way  wal id think of it a dum long spell fore id do it was ikes reply and councill had agreed with it  bradley fell behind ike for he wanted to be alone he had grown into the habit of accounting to her for his actions and when he wished to consult with her he wanted to be alone there was something sacred even in the thought of her and he shrank from having his thoughts broken in upon by any careless or jesting word  as he pondered his hands grew slower in their action and at last he stopped and leaned against the wagonbox something came into his heart that shook him a feeling of unknown power a certainty of faith in himself he shivered with an electric thrill that made his hair stir  he lifted his face to the sky and his eyes saw a crane sailing with stately grace in measureless circle a mere speck against the unbroken gray of the sky there seemed something prophetic something mystic in its harsh wild cry that fell like the scream of the eagle a defiant note against wind and storm  ill do it he said and his hands clinched at the sound of his voice he shivered again as if the wind had suddenly penetrated his clothing his dress made him grotesque the spaces around him made him pathetic but in his goldenbrown eyes was something that made him sublime  the thought which he dared not utter but which lay deep under every resolution and action he made was the hope undefined and unacknowledged to himself that sometime he might meet her and have her approve his action     iv  bradleys trials at school   the morning on which bradley was to begin his term at the seminary was a clear crisp day in later november he had rented a room in the basement of a queer old building known as the park hotel a crazy mansardroofed structure which held at regular intervals some rash men attempting to run it as a hotel  bradley had rented this cellar because it was the cheapest place he could find he agreed to pay two dollars a month for it and the use of the two chairs and cooking stove which made up its furnishing he had purchased a skillet and two or three dishes mrs councill had lent him a bed and he seemed reasonably secure against hunger and cold  he looked forward to his entrance into the school with dread all that monday morning he stood about his door watching for milton and seeing the merry students in procession up the walk the girls seemed so bright and so beautiful he wondered how the boys could walk beside them with such calm unconcern their laughter their mutual greetings threw him into a profound selfpity and disgust when he joined milton and shepard and went up the walk under the barelimbed maple trees he shivered with fear they all seemed perfectly at home with the exception of himself  milton knowing what to expect smuggled him into the chapel in the midst of a crowd of five or six others and thus he escaped the derisive applause with which the pupils were accustomed to greet each newcomer at the opening of a term he gave one quick glance at the rows of faces and shambled awkwardly along to his seat beside milton his eyes downcast he found courage to look around and study his fellowstudents after a little and discovered that several of them were quite as awkward quite as ill at ease as himself  milton old pupil as he was that is to say this was his second term sat beside him and indicated the seniors as they came in and among the rest pointed out radbourn  hes the high muckymuck o this shebang shep whispered  why so asked bradley looking carefully at the big smoothfaced rather gloomylooking young fellow  shep hit his own head with his fist in a comically significant gesture brains what d ye call em milt correscations of the serry beltum  shepard was a short youth with thick yellow hair and a comically serious quality in the twist of his long upper lip  milton grinned convolutions of the cerebrum i spose youre driving at shep comes to school to have fun milton explained to bradley  chuss said shep by which he meant yes an i have it too betyerneck i enter no plea me lord  there came a burst of applause as a tall and attractive girl came in with her arms laden down with books her intellectual face lit up with a smile at the applause and a pink flush came into her pale cheek thats miss graham whispered shepard shes all bent up on radbourn  the teachers came in the choir rose to sing and the exercises of the morning began bradley thought miss graham with her heavylidded velvetybrown eyes looked like miss wilbur her eyes were darker he decided and she was taller and paler in fact the resemblance was mainly in her manner which had the same dignity and repose  at miltons suggestion bradley remained in his seat after the rest of the pupils had marched out to the sound of the organ then milton introduced him to the principal who took him by the hand so cordially that his embarrassment was gone in a moment come and see me at eleven he said after a short talk with him in his room a couple hours later his work was assigned  youll be in the preparatory department mr talcott but if you care to do extra work we may get you into the junior class jennings look after him a little wont you  the principal was a kind man but he had two hundred of these rude awkward farmerboys and he could not be expected to study each one closely enough to discover their latent powers bradley went away down town to buy his books with a feeling that the smile of the principal was not genuine and he felt also that milton was a little ashamed of him here in the town everything seemed to be going hard with him but his hardest trial came when he entered the classroom at one oclock  he knew no one of course and the long narrow room was filled with riotous boys and girls all much younger than himself all the desks seemed to be occupied and he was obliged to run the gauntlet of the entire class in his search for a seat as he walked down the room so close to the wall that he brushed the chalk of the blackboard off upon his shoulder he made a really ludicrous figure all of his fine free unconscious grace was gone and his strength of limb only added to his awkwardness  the girls were of that age where they find the keenest delight in annoying a bashful fellow such as they perceived this newcomer to be his hair had been badly barbered by councill and his suit of cotton diagonal originally too small and never a fit was now yellow on the shoulders where the sun had faded the analine dye and his trousers were so tight that they clung to the tops of his great boots exposing his huge feet in all their enormity of shapeless housing his large hands protruded from his sleeves and were made still more noticeable by his evident loss of their control  picked too soon said nettie russell with a vacant stare into space whereat the rest shrieked with laughter a great hot wave of blood rushed up over bradley making him dizzy he knew that joke all too well he looked around blindly for a seat as he stood there helpless nettie hit him with a piece of chalk and someone threw the eraser at his boots  number twelves said young brown  when did it get loose  does your mother know youre out  put your hat over it came from all sides  he saw an empty chair and started to sit down but nettie slipped into it before him he started for her seat and her brother claude got there apparently by mere accident just before him bradley stood again indecisively not daring to look up burning with rage and shame again someone hit him with a piece of chalk making a resounding whack and the entire class roared again in concert  why its head is wood said claude in apparent astonishment at his own discovery  bradley raised his head for the first time there came into his eyes a look that made claude russell tremble he again approached an empty chair and was again forestalled by young brown with a bitter curse he swung his great open palm around and laid his tormenter flat on the floor stunned and breathless a silence fell on the group it was as if a lion had awakened with a roar of wrath  come on all o ye he snarled through his set teeth facing them all as he stood thus the absurdity of his own attitude came upon him they were only children after all reeking with the sweat of shame and anger which burst from his burning skin he reached for a chair  nettie like the little daredevil that she was pulled the chair from under him and he saved himself from falling only by wildly clutching the desk before him as it was he fell almost into her lap and everybody shrieked with uncontrollable laughter in the midst of it miss clayson the teacher came hurrying in to silence the tumult and bradley rushed from the room like a bull from the arena maddened with the spears of the toreador he snatched his hat and coat from the rack and hardly looked up till he reached the haven of his little cellar  he threw his cap on the floor and for a half hour raged up and down the floor his mortification and shame and rage finding vent in a fit of cursing such as he had never had in his life before all awkwardness was gone now his great limbs supple and swift clenched doubled and thrust out against the air in unconscious lightningswift gestures that showed how terrible he could be when roused  at last he grew calm enough to sit down and then his mood changed to the deepest dejection he sank into a measureless despair a terrible ache came into his throat  they were right he was a great hulking fool he never could be anything but a clodhopper anyway he looked down at his great hand at his short trousers and the indecent ugliness of his horrible boots and studied himself without mercy to himself he acknowledged that they were hideous but he couldnt help it  then his mind took another turn and he went over the history of that suit he didnt want it when he bought it but he found himself like wax moulded by the soft white confidential hands of the jew salesman who offered it to him as a special favor below cost in common with other young men of his sort he always felt under obligation to buy if he went into a store even if there were nothing there that suited him he knew when he bought the suit and paid eleven dollars for it that he would always be sorry and its cheapness now appalled him  he always swore at himself for this weakness before the salesman and yet year by year he had been cheated in the same way for the first time however he saw his clothing in all its hideousness those cruel girls and grinning boys had shown him that clothes made the man even in a western school the worst part of it was that he had been humiliated by a girl and there was no redress his strength of limb was useless here  he sat there till darkness came into his room he did not replenish the coal in the stove that leered at him from the two broken doors in front and seemed to face him with a crazy drunken reel on its mismatched legs he was hungry but he sat there enjoying in a morbid way the pang of hunger it helped him someway to bear the sting of his defeat  it was the darkest hour of his life he swore never to go back again to that room he couldnt face that crowd of grinning faces he turned hot and cold by turns as he thought of his folly he was a cursed fool for ever thinking of trying to do anything but just dig away on a farm he might have known how it would be hed got behind and had to be classed in with the children there was no help for it hed never go back  the thought of her came in again and again but the thought couldnt help him her face drove the last of his curses from his lips but it threw him into a fathomless despair where he no longer defined his thoughts into words her face shone like a star but it stood over a bottomless rift in the earth and showed how impassable its yawning barrier was  there came a whoop outside and a scramble at the door and somebody tumbled into the room  anybody here  hello where are you brad  he recognized miltons voice yes im here but wait a minute  cæsar i guess well wait break our necks if we dont said the other shadow whom he now recognized as shep watson always live in the dark  they waited while he lighted the dim little kerosene lamp on the table o conspiracy shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night quoted shep in the interim  been sleep asked milton  no se down anywheres he added on second thought as he realized that chairs were limited  say brad come on lets go over t the society  i guess not said brad sullenly  why not asked milton recognizing something bitter in his voice  because i aint got any right to go i aint goin t school agin im goin west  why whats up  i aint agoin thats all i cant never ketch up with the rest of you fellers his voice broke a little an it aint much fun havin to go in with a whole raft o little boys and girls  oh say now brad i wouldnt mind em if i was you said milton after a pause he had the delicacy not to say he had heard the details of bradleys experience we all have to go through bout the same row o stumps dont we shep the way to do with em is to jest pay no tention to em  but the goodwill and sympathy of the boys could not prevail upon bradley to go with them he persisted in his determination to leave school and the boys finally went out leaving him alone their influence had been good however he was distinctly less bitter after they left him and his thoughts went back to miss wilbur what would she think of him if he gave up all his plans the first day simply because some mischievous girls and boys had made him absurd when he thought of her he felt strong enough to go back but when he thought of his tormentors and what he would be obliged to endure from them he shivered and shrank back into despondency  he was still fighting his battle when a slow step came down the stairs ending in a sharp rap upon the door he said come in and radbourn the most powerful and most popular senior entered the room he was a good deal of an autocrat in the town and in the school and took pleasure in exercising his power on behalf of some poor devil like bradley talcott  jennings tells me youre going to give it up he said without preliminary conversation  bradley nodded sullenly whats the use anyhow i might as well im too old anyhow  radbourn looked at him a moment in silence put on your hat and lets go outside he said at length and there was something in his voice that bradley obeyed  once on the outside radbourn took his arm and they walked on up the street in silence for some distance it was still and clear and frosty and the stars burned overhead with manycolored brilliancy  now i know all about it talcott and i know just about how you feel but all the same you must go back there tomorrow morning  it aint no use talkin i cant do it  yes you can you think you cant but you can a man can do anything if he only thinks he can and tries hard you cant afford to let a little thing like that upset your plans i understand your position exactly youre at a disadvantage he changed his pace suddenly stopping bradley now talcott youre at a disadvantage with that suit it makes you look like a gawk when youre not youre a stalwart fellow and if youll invest in a new suit of clothes as jennings did itll make all the difference in the world  i cant afford it  no thats a mistake you cant afford not to have it a good suit of clothes will do more to put you on an equality with the boys than anything else you can do for yourself now lets drop in here to see my friend who keeps what you need and tomorrow ill call for you and take you into the class and introduce you to miss clayson and youll be all right you didnt start right  when he walked in with radbourn the next morning and was introduced to the teacher nettie russell stared in breathless astonishmemt he was barbered and wore a suit which showed his splendid length and strength of limb  well said aint we a big sunflower my sakes aint we acoming out no moon last night must a ben a fire he got them with a basket and a club were some of the remarks he heard  bradley felt the difference in the atmosphere and he walked to his seat with a selfpossession that astonished himself and from that time he was master of the situation the girls pelted him with chalk and marked figures on his back but he kept at his work he had a firm grip on the plowhandles now and he didnt look back they grew to respect him at length and some of the girls distinctly showed their admiration brown came over to get help on a sum and so did nettie and when he sat down beside her she winked in triumph at the other girls while bradley patiently tried to explain the problem in algebra which was his own terror  he certainly was a handsome fellow in a roughangled way and when the boys found he could jump eleven feet and eight inches at a standing jump they no longer drew any distinctions between his attainments in algebra and their own neither did his poverty count against him with them he sawed wood in every spare hour with desperate energy to make up for the sinful extravagance of his new fifteen dollar suit of clothes                                                 he was sawing wood in an alley one saturday morning where he could hear a girl singing in a birdlike way that was very charming he was tremendously hungry for he had been at work since the first faint gray light and the smell of breakfast that came to his senses was tantalizing  he heard the girls rapid feet moving about in the kitchen and her voice rising and falling pausing and beginning again as if she were working rapidly then she fell silent and he knew she was at breakfast  at last she opened the door and came out along the walk with a tablecloth she shook her cloth and then her singing ceased and bradley went on with his work  hello brad called a sudden voice  he looked up and saw nettie russells roguish face peering over the board fence  hello he replied and stood an instant in wordless surprise i didnt know you lived there  well i do aint tickled to death to find it out i spose say you aint so very mad at me are yeh she added insinuatingly  he didnt know what to say so he kept silent he noticed for the first time how childishly round her face was  she took a new turn say aint you hungry  bradley admitted that he had eaten an early breakfast he did not say it was composed of fried pork and potatoes and bakers bread without tea coffee or milk  the girl seemed delighted to think he was hungry  you wait a minute she commanded and her smiling face disappeared from the top of the fence brad went to work to keep from catching cold wondering what she was going to do she reappeared soon with a fat homemade sausage and a couple of warm biscuits which she insisted upon his taking  theyre all buttered andtheyve got sugar on em she whispered significantly  say you eat now while i saw she commanded coming around through the gate  she had put on her fascinator hood but her hands and wrists were bare she struggled away on a log putting her knee on it in a comically resolute style  the saw always goes crooked she said in despair bradley laughed at her heartily  say do you do this for fun she asked stopping to puff her cheeks a beautiful pink  no i dont i do it because im obliged to  she threw down the saw well that beats me i cant saw but i can cook i made them biscuits she challenged his opinion as he well knew  theyre first rate he admitted and they were friends she watched him eat with apparent satisfaction  say i cant stay here ill freeze are yeh going to be here till noon  yes  well when i whistle you come in and get some grub will yeh bradley smiled back at her laughing face  this aint your folks wood pile  whats the difference she replied you jest come in will yeh  yes ill come  like fun you will honest she persisted  hope to die he said solemnly  thats the checker she said and disappeared with a click of the tongue  bradley worked away in a glow of cheerfulness it was astonishing how much this little victory over a roguish girl meant to him he had changed one persons ridicule to friendship and it seemed to be prophetic of other victories  the time seemed very short that forenoon once or twice nettie came out to bring some news about the cooking  say im making an apple pie im a dandy on pies and cakes  i guess they would be pizen cakes  she threw an imaginary club at him  well if that aint the sickest old joke youll go without any pie if you get off such a thing again  but as dinnertime drew on he felt more and more unwilling to go into the kitchen  he heard her whistle but he remained at the sawhorse it would do in the country but not here he had no right to go in there and eat  there was a note of impatience in her voice when she looked over the fence and said why dont you come  i dassant  oh bother what y fraid of  what business have i got to eat your dinner this aint your woodpile  say if you dont come in illi dunno what  bring it out here its warm  i wont do it youve got to come in the old mans gone up town and mother wont throw you out there isnt anybody in the kitchen come on now she pleaded  bradley followed her into the house feeling a good deal like a very large dog very hungry who had followed a childs invitation into the parlor and felt out of place  he sat down by the fire and silently ate what she placed before him while she chattered away in high glee when mrs russell came in nettie did not take the trouble to introduce him to her mother who moved about the room in a wordless way smiling a little about the eyes she was entirely subject to her daughter she heard them discussing lessons and concluded they were classmates  bradley went back to his woodsawing and soon finished the job as he shouldered his saw and sawbuck nettie came out and peered over the fence again  say goin to attend the social monday  guess not i aint much on such things  its lots o fun we spin the platter and all kinds o things im goin she looked archly inviting  bradley colored he was not astute but hints like this were not far from kicks he looked down at his saw as he said i guess i wont go ive got to study  well goodby she said without mortification she was so much of a child yet that she could be jilted without keen pain see y monday she said as she ran into the house  someway bradleys life was lightened by that days experience he went home to his bleak little room in a resolute mood he sat down at his table upon which lay his algebra determined to prepare mondays lessons but the pencil fell from his hand his head sank down and lay upon the open page before him wood sawing had worn him down and algebra had made him sleep     v  bradley rises to address the carthaginians   he was now facing another terror the friday afternoon recitals in which alternate sections of the pupils were obliged to appear before the public in the chapel to recite or read an essay it was an ordeal that tried the souls of the bravest of them all  unquestionably it kept many pupils away nothing could be more terrible to a shrinking awkward boy or girl from a farm than this requirement to stand upon a raised platform with nothing to break the effect of sheer crucifixion it was appalling it was a pillory a stake a burning and yet there was a fearful fascination about it and it was doubtful if a majority of the students would have voted for its abolition the preps and juniors saw the seniors winning electrical applause from the audience and fancied the same prize was within their reach there was no surer or more instant success to be won than that which followed a splendid oratorical effort on the platform it was worth the cost  each newcomer dreaded it for weeks and talked about it constantly bradley like all the rest before him could not eat a thing on the morning preceding his trial and in fact had suffered a distinct loss of appetite from the middle of the week  mary barber a tall awkward badlydressed girl met him as he was going up the steps after the first bell  say how you feelin ive shook all the mornin i dont know what im goin to do im just sick  why dont you say so an get off bradley suggested  because thats what i did last time and it wont work any more the poor girls teeth were chattering with her fright she laughed at herself in an hysterical way and wrung her hands as if with cold and dropped back into the broadest kind of dialect oh i feel sif my stomach was all gone  nettie russell regarded it all as merely another disagreeable duty to be shirked nothing troubled her very much you just wait and see how i get out of it she said as she passed by at two oclock the principal came in and removed even the small pulpit so that nothing should stand between the shrinking young orators and the keen derisive eyes below  the chapel was a very imposing structure to bradley it was square and papered in greywhite with fluted columns of the corinthian order of architecture and that touch of history and romance did not fail of its effect on the country boys fresh from the barnyard and the cornrows it added to their fear and selfabasement as they rolled their slow eyes around and upward the audience consisted mainly of the pupils arranged according to classes the girls on the left and the boys on the right in addition some of the townspeople who loved oratory or were specially interested in the speakers of the day were often present to add to the terror of the occasion  radbourn came in with lily graham talking earnestly he was in the same section with bradley a fact which did not cheer bradley at all jack carver came in with a jaunty air his cuffs and collar were linen and his trousers were tailormade which was distinction enough for him he had no scruples therefore in shirking the speaking with the same indifference nettie russell showed  milton who came in the first section was joking the rest upon their nervousness  say when did you eat yr last meal he whispered to bradley  yesterday morning bradley replied unable to smile  all the week the members of the last section had been prancing up and down the various rooms in boardinghouses to the deep disgust of their fellow students who mixed harsh comments throughout their practice as they shouted in thunder tones  i came not here to talk then why dont you shut up you know too well the story of our thraldom you bet we do weve heard it all the week the beams of the setting sun fall upon a slave would a beam of some sort would fall on you o rome romeoh go roam the wild wood  all the week the boardinghouse mistresses had pounded on the stovepipe to bring the appeal of spartacus to the romans down to a key that would not also include all the people in the block all to no purpose spartacus was aroused and nothing but a glaive or a battleaxe could bring him to silence and submission the first section now sat smiling grimly their revenge was coming  after the choir had sung the principal of oratory notebook in hand came down among the pupils and began the fateful rollcall  the first name called was alice masters an ambitious but terribly plain and awkward girl she had not eaten anything since the middle of the week and was weak and nervous with fright she sprang out of her seat white as a dead person and rushed up the aisle as she stepped upon the platform she struck her toe and nearly fell the rest laughed some hysterically the most of them in thoughtless derision the blood rushed into her face and when she turned she seemed to be masked in scarlet she began stammeringly her fingers playing nervously with the seams of her dress  beside his block the sculptor  beside his block  beside the sculptor stood beside  she could not think of another word not one and she fell into a horrible silence wringing her hands piteously it was impossible for her to go on and impossible for her to leave the floor till the word of release came  that will do said the principal in calm unconcern and she rushed from the room and the next name was called at length nettie russell faced the audience a saucy smile on her lips and a defiant tilt to her nose she spoke a verse of twinkle twinkle little star to the vast delight of the preps who had dared her to do it the principal scowled darkly and put a very emphatic black mark opposite her name  as name after name was called bradleys chill deepened and the cold sweat broke out upon his body there was a terrible weakness and nausea at his stomach and he drew long shivering inspirations like a man facing an icy river into which he must plunge his hands shook till he was forced to grasp the desk to hide his tremor  he was saved from utter flight by radbourn who came before him whatever nervousness the big senior had ever felt he was well over now for he walked calmly up the aisle and took his place with easy dignity he scorned to address the romans or the men of england he was always contemporaneous he usually gave orations on political topics or astounded his teachers by giving a revolutionary opinion of some classic no matter what subject he dealt with he interested and held his audience his earnest face and deepset eyes had something compelling in them and his dignity and selfpossession in themselves fascinated the poor fellows who sat there in deathly sickness shaking with terror  bradley felt again the fascination of an orator and again his heart glowed with a secret feeling that he too could be an orator like that he felt strong and cool and hopeful while radbourn was speaking but afterward that horrible weakening fear came back upon him  he couldnt look at poor harry stillman who came on a few names further harry had pounded away all the week on websters reply to hayne and he now stood forth in piteous contrast to his ponderous theme his thin shaking legs toedin like an indians and his trousers were tight and short and checked which seemed to increase the tightness and shortness he had narrow shoulders and thin long arms which he used like a jumping jack each gesture being curiously unrelated to his facial expression which was mainly appealing and apprehensive as shep watson said he looked as if he expected a barn to fall on him  at last bradleys name was spoken and he rose in a mist the windows had disappeared they were mere blurs of light as he walked up the aisle the floor fell away from the soles of his feet he no longer walked he was a brain floating in space he made his way to the stage without accident for he had rehearsed it all so many times in his mind that unconscious cerebration attended to the necessary motions when he faced the assembly he seemed facing a boundless sea of faces they in their turn were awed by something they saw in his eyes his face was white and his eyes burned with a singular light a mysterious power emanated from him as from the born orator  like all the rest he had taken a theme that was far beyond his apparent powers and the apparent comprehension of his audience but they had been fed so long upon william tell rienzi marc antony and spartacus that every line was familiar nothing was too ponderous too lofty too peakaddressing for them  he mispronounced the words his gestures were awkward and spasmodic but lofty emotion exalted him and vibrated in his voice he thrilled every heart he had opened somewhere somehow a vast reservoir of power a great calm fell upon him a wild joy of newfound strength that awed and thrilled his own heart it seemed as if a new spirit had taken his flesh as he went on he grew more dignified and graceful his great arms seemed to be gigantic as he thundered against the carthaginians everybody forgot his dress his freckled face and when he closed the applause was instant and generous  as he walked back to his seat the exultant light went out of his eyes his limbs relaxed the windows and the sunlight cleared to vulgar day and his face flushed with timidity he sat down with a feeling of melancholy in his heart as if something divine had faded out of his life  but radbourn reached out his hand in the face of the whole school and said first rate the pupils had the western love for oratory and several of them crowded about to congratulate him on his speech  bradley did not feel at all sure of his success he had been something alien to himself in that speech and he could not remember what he had said or done he was not at all sure that he had done the right thing or the best thing he was suspicious of his power because he no longer felt it he was like a man who had dreamed of flying and woke to find himself paralyzed after his triumph he was the same great awkward country hiredman  say look here talcott said radbourn as they met at the door of the chapel going out im going to propose you as a member of the delta come up monday and ill put you through  oh they dont want me  dont be so modest theyre in need of just such men youll be in demand now no fear about that  there was a struggle now to get him into the societies which were as usual bitter rivals he was secretly anxious to be one of the debaters in fact he had counted more on that than upon all the rest of the advantages of the school he thought it would please her better  he joined the delta over which radbourn presided and wore the society pin with genuine pride he sat for several meetings silently in his seat awed by the excessive formality of proceedings and the strictness of the parliamentary rules it was a curious thing to see the meeting come to order out of a chaos of wrestling shouting singing members whose excess of life filled the room like a crowd of prizefighters  rap rap and the sound of the gavel stilled the noise as if each man had received a blow on his head  they took their seats while the stern president remained standing one final rap and the room was perfectly quiet and every member an inexorable parliamentarian ready to question decisions or rise to points of order at the slightest infraction of cushings manual radbourn ruled with a gavel of iron but they all enjoyed it the more half the fun and probably half the benefit of the society would have been lost with the loss of order  this strenuous dignity awed bradley for a time his fellows seemed transformed into something quite other than their usual selves into grave lawmakers this strangeness wore away after a time and he grew more at ease he began to study cushing along with the rest it laid the foundation for a thorough knowledge of the methods of conducting a meeting which was afterward of so much value to him  his first attempt at debating was upon the question should farmers be free traders a question which was introduced by milton who was always attempting to introduce questions which would strike fire nothing pleased his funloving nature more than to take part in a live debate  as real free traders were scarce mason a brilliant young democrat requested radbourn to take the side of free trade and he consented milton formed the third part of the free trade cohort he liked the fun of trying to debate on the opposite side a thing which would have been impossible to bradleys more intense and simplehearted nature what he believed he fought for  mason led off with a discussion of the theory of free exchange and made a passionate plea florid and declamatory which gave fergusson a cool pointed scholarly norwegian an excellent chance to raise a laugh he called the attention of the house to the copperhead democracy which the gentleman of the opposition was preaching he asked what the practical application would mean plainly it meant cheap goods  thats what we want interrupted mason and was silenced savagely by the chairman  england would flood us with cheap goods  let em flood said somebody unknown and the chairman was helpless  fergusson worked away steadily and was called down at last  he was distinguished as one of the few men who always talked out his ten minutes  radbourn astonished them all by saying with absolute sincerity free trade as a theory is right considered as a question of ethics as a question of the trend of things its right the right to trade is as much my right as my right to produce the one question is whether it ought to be put into operation at once there is no reason why the farmer should uphold protection  from this on his remarks had a mysterious quality im a free trader but im not a democrat tariff tinkering is not free trade and i dont believe the democrats would do any more than the republicans but that aint the question the question is whether the farmers should be free traders  after the discussion along familiar lines had taken place radbourn resumed the chair and called on any one in the room to volunteer a word on either side we would like to hear from talcott he said  talcott talcott called the rest  bradley rose as if impelled by some irresistible power within himself he began stammeringly he had but one line of thought at his command and that was the line of thought indicated by miss wilbur in her speech at the picnic the home market idea upon which he had spent a great deal of thought mr chairman i dont believe in free trade i believe if we had free trade it would make us all farmers for england it aint what we ought t do weve got gold in our hills an coal an timber to manufacture what we want t do is to build up our industries make a home market  as he went on with these stock phrases he seemed to get hold of things which before had seemed out of his reach scraps of speeches newspaper comments an astonishing flood of arguments or at least what he took for arguments came rushing into his mind he reached out his hands and grasped and used phrases not his own as if they were bludgeons he assaulted the opposition blindly but with immense power  he sat down amid loud applause and young mason arose to close the affirmative he was sarcastic to the point of offence  he has said em all he began alluding to bradley all the regulation arguments of republican newspapers and as for the leader of the opposition he has got off the usual sneer at copperhead democracy this debate wouldnt have been complete without that remark from my esteemed leader of the opposition where argument fails misrepresentations and sneers may do service with the injudicious i trust the judges will remember that the argument has been on our side and the innuendoes on the side of the opposition  the verdict of the judges was in favor of the free traders but the decision of the judges had less effect on bradley than the surprising revelation of radbourns thought there were phrases whose reach and significance he did not realize to the full but their effect was not lost he never forgot such things  he was thinking how diametrically opposite miss wilburs ideas were when radbourn came up and said with a significant smile  well talcott you did get hold of all the regulation stock material the home market idea is a great field for you you think a city is of itself a good thing you think a city means civilization well i want to tell you and maybe you wont believe me cities mean vice and crime and poverty and vast wealth for the few and as for the home market idea how would it do to let the farmer buy in the same market in which he sells he sells in the worlds market but youd force him to buy in a protected market  radbourn went off with a peculiar smile which left bradley uncertain whether he was laughing at him or not he began from that moment to overhaul his stock of phrases to see if they were really shopworn and worthless he was growing marvellously his whole nature was now awake he thought as he sawed wood in the back alleys of the town and at night he toiled at his books those were great days new powers were swiftly burgeoning  radbourn spoke to several of the politicians of the town about bradley  there is a good deal in that man talcott of course hes just beginning but youll hear from him on the stump he is an orator that reaches people he has the advantage of most of us hes in dead earnest when hes advocating republicanism  radbourn had times of saying things like this when his hearers didnt know what to make of him  its just his way some one usually said and the rest sat in silence they didnt enjoy it but as radbourn was not running for any office and was known to be a powerful thinker they thought it best not to antagonize him  i wonder if he intends the law asked judge brown  i see what the judge is driving at radbourn said quickly he thinks he can make a democrat of him  the group laughed democrats were in a hopeless minority but the judge and colonel peavey never lost their proselyting zeal  the judge is always on hand like a sore thumb said amos  the judgell be on the right side of the tariff one of these fine days and have the laugh on the lot of yeh  what y idee about that rad  good heavens you dont expect to have protection always do yeh was his only reply  a day or two later he said to bradley  talcott brown wants to see you he wants to make you a lawyers hack now id say to most men dont do it but if he offers to give you a place take it it wont be worse than sawing wood thirty hours a week  following radbourns direction he passed up a narrow incredibly grimy stairway and knocked at a door at the end of a hall whose only light came through the letterslit in the door  come in yelled a snarling voice  bradley entered timidly for the voice was not at all cordial the judge in his own den was a different man from the judge at robies grocery and this day he was in bad humor he sat with his heels on a revolving bookcase a lawbook spread out on his legs a long pipe in his hand  if he uttered any words of greeting they were lost in the crescendo growl of a fat bulldog lying in supple shining length at his feet  down with yeh he snarled at the dog who ceased his growling but ran lightly and with ferocious suggestiveness toward bradley and clung sniffing about his heels  si down the judge said indicating a chair with his pipe which he held by the bowl he made no other motion  bradley sat down this greeting drove him back into his usual stubborn silence he waited for developments his eyes on the dog  well young man what can i do for you asked the lawyer after a long silence during which he laid down one book and read a page in another  nothin i guess  well what the devil did yeh come in here for he inquired with a glare of astonishment want o buy a dog  bradley was mad i came because radbourn sent me i cn git out agin mighty quick  the judge took down his heels oh youre that young orator why didnt yeh say so you damned young indian he now rose and walked over to the spittoon before going on bradley knew that this rough tone was entirely different from the first it was a sort of affectionate blackguardism i heard you speak last friday all you need young man is a chance to swing yr elbows you want room according to yr strength but you neverd find it in the republican party its struck with the palsy  the judge had been talking this for two presidential campaigns and didnt take himself at all seriously  what are you going to do  i dont know yet  do you want o study law  i dont know sir do you think i can be a lawyer  if youre not too damned honest if you want o try it ill make an arrangement with you that will be better than sawing wood anyhow this winter and you can keep right on with your studies well see what can be done next year  the old man had taken a liking to bradley on account of his oratory and the possibilities of making him a democratic leader had really taken possession of him he had no son of his own and he took a deep interest in young men of the stamp of milton and bradley  after he reached home that night bradley extended his ambitions he dared to hope that he might be a lawyer and an orator which meant also a successful politician to him politics to him as to most western men was the greatest concern of life and the city of washington the mecca whose shining dome lured from afar to go to washington was equivalent to being born again a man can do anything if he thinks so and tries hard he thought following radbourns words  he bustled about cheerily cooking his fried potatoes and scraps of meat and boiling his tea the dim light made his large face softer and more thoughtful than it had appeared before and his cheerfulness over his lonely meal typed forth the sublime audacity profound ignorance and pathetic faith with which such a man faces the worlds millions and dares to hope for success     vi  bradley attends a convention   on a dreamful september day of the following year bradley was helping milton jennings to dig potatoes it was nearly time for his return to school and to judge browns office and the two young men were full of plans milton was intending to go back for another year and bradley intended to keep up with his studies if possible and retain his place with brown also  say broke out milton suddenly we ought to attend this convention  what convention  why the nominating convention at rock fathers going this afternoon i neverve been lets go with him  that wont dig taters smiled bradley in his slow way  darn the taters if were goin into politics we want o know all about things  thats so i would like to go if your fatherll let us off on the taters  mr jennings made no objection itll be a farce though the whole thing  why so  ill tell you on the way down git the team ready and well take neighbor councill in  bradley listened to mr jennings explanation with an interest born of his expanding ambition his marvellously retentive mind absorbed every detail and the situation cleared in his mind  for sixteen years the affairs of the country had been managed by a group of persuasive welldressed citizens of rock river who played into each others hands and juggled with the countys money with such adroitness and address that their reign seemed hopelessly permanent to the discontented and suspicious farmers of the county year after year they saw these gentlemen building new houses opening banks and buying in farm mortgages all out of the county many grangers asserted  year after year the convention assembled and year after year the delegates from the rural townships came down to find their duties purely perfunctory simply to fill up the seats they always found the slate made up and fine speakers ready to put it through with a rush of ready applause before which the slowerspoken disorganized farmers were wellnigh helpless it was a case of perfect organization against disorganization and mutual distrust banded officialism fighting to keep its place against the demands of a disorganized righteous mob of citizens office is always a trained command the intrenched minority is capable of a sort of rocklike resistance  rock river and its neighboring village of cedarville by pooling together could tie the convention and in addition to these towns they always controlled several of the outlying townships by judicious flattery of their selfconstituted managers who were given small favors put on the central committee and otherwise made to feel that they were leading men in the township and it was beginning to be stated that the county treasurer had regularly bribed other influential whippersin by an amiable remission of taxes  why dont you fight em asked milton after mr jennings had covered the whole ground thoroughly  councill laughed weve been afightin um suppose you try  give us a chance and well do our part wont we brad  bradley nodded and so committed himself to the fight he was fated to begin his political career as an independent republican  on the street they met other leading grangers of the county and it became evident that there was a deep feeling of resentment present they gathered in knots on the sidewalks which led up under the splendid maples that lined the sidewalks leading toward the courthouse  the courthouse was of the usual pseudoclassic style of architecture that is to say it was a brick building with an ambitious facade of four wooden fluted columns its halls echoed to the voices and footsteps of the crowd that passed up its broad worn and grimy steps into the courtroom itself which was grimier and more hopelessly filthy than the staircase with its stratified accumulations of cigar stubs and foul sawdust its seats were benches hacked and carved like the desks of a country schoolhouse nothing could be more barren more desolate it had nothing to relieve it save the beautiful stains of color that seemed thrown upon the windows by the crimson and orange maples which stood in the yard  they found the room full of delegates among whom there was going on a great deal of excited conversation from a side room near the judges bench there issued from time to time messengers who came out among the general mob and invited certain flattered and useful delegates to come in and meet with the central committee there was plainly a division in the house  the rusty cusses are on their ears today said milton and theres going to be fun his blue eyes were beaming with laughter and his quick wit kept those who were within hearing on the broad grin  goin to down em t day he asked of councill  were goin t try  in one dishonest way or another the ring had kept its hold upon the county notwithstanding all criticism and now came to the struggle with smiling confidence they secured the chairman by the readymade quick vote by acclamation for reelection the president then appointed the committee upon credentials and upon nominations and the work of the convention was opened  the committee on nominations in due course presented its slate as usual but here the real battle began bradley suddenly found himself tense with interest his ancestry must have been a race of orators and politicians for the atmosphere of the convention roused him till it transformed him  here was the real thing no mere debate but a fight there was battle in the air now blue with smoke and rank with the reek of tobacco there was fight in the poise of the grizzled heads and rusty yellow shoulders of the farmers who had now fallen into perfect silence in looking over them one might have been reminded of a field of yellowgray boulders  colonel russell moved the election of the entire slate as presented by the nominating committee in whom he said the convention had the utmost confidence four or five farmers sprang to their feet instantly and osmond deering got the floor when he began speaking the loafers in the gallery stopped their chewing in excess of interest he was one of the most influential men in the county  mr president he began in his mild way i dont want to seem captious about this matter but i want to remind this convention that this is the eighth year that almost the same identical slate has been presented to the farmers of rock county and passed against our wishes it isnt right that it should pass again it shant pass without my protest applause this convention has been robbed of its right to nominate every year and every year weve gone home feeling weve been made cats paws of for the benefit of a few citizens of rock river i protest against the slate i claim the right to nominate my man i dont intend to have a committee empowered to take away my rights to  the opposition raised a clamor question question attempting to force a vote but the old man carried out of himself by his excitement shook his broad flat hand in the air and cried i have the floor gentlemen and i propose to keep it the farmers applauded i say to this convention vote down this motion and set down on the oldfashioned slatemaking committee business it aint just it aint right and i protest against it  he sat down to wild excitement his supporters trying to speak the opposition crying question question several fiery speeches were made by leading grangers but they were met by a cool smooth persuasive speech from the chairman of the nominating committee who argued that it was not to be supposed that this committee chosen by this convention would bring in a slate which would not be a credit and honor to the country true they were mainly from rock river and cedarville but it must be remembered that the population of the county was mainly in these towns and that no ticket could succeed which did not give a proper proportion of representation to these towns these men could not be surpassed in business ability they were old in their office it was true but the affairs of the county were passing through a critical period in their history and it was an old and welltried saying never swap horses in the midst of a stream anyhow he was content to leave the matter to the vote of this convention  the vote carried the slate through by a small majority leaving the farmers again stunned and helpless and the further business of the convention was to restore peace and goodwill as far as possible among the members it was amazing to bradley to find how easily he could be swayed by the plausible speeches of the gentlemanly chairman of the nominating committee it was a great lesson to him in the power of oratory the slate was put through simply by the address of the chairman of the committee  on the way out they met councill and jennings walking out with chairman russell who had his hand on a shoulder of each and was saying with beautiful candor and joviality well we beat you again its all fair in politics you know  yes but its the last time said jennings who refused to smile we cant give this the goby  oh well now neighbor jennings you mustnt take it too hard you know these men are good capable men  they are capable enough put in deering but we want a change  then make it laughed russell goodnaturedly defiant  we will make it bet yr boots said amos ridings  lets see yeh was russells parting word delivered with a jaunty wave of his hand  the farmers rode home full of smoldering wrath they were in fighting humor and only needed an organizer to become a dangerous force     vii  the farmers oust the ring   the following saturday bradley who was still at work with milton saw amos ridings gallop up and dismount at the gate and call jennings out and during the next two hours every time he looked up he saw them in deep discussion out by the pig pen part of the time jennings faced amos who leaned against the fence and whittled a stick and part of the time he talked to jennings who leaned back against the fence on his elbows and studied amos whittling the rail mrs jennings at last called them all to dinner and still the question remained apparently unsolved though they changed the conversation to crops and the price of wheat  brad set down here and make a lot o copies of this call milt you help him  the call read      a new deal reform in county politics      a mass convention of the citizens of rock county will be held at     rock creek grove on september 28th for the purpose of nominating a     peoples ticket all who favor reform in politics and rebel against     the ringrule of our county officers are invited to be present      per order      amos ridings     john jennings     william councill      peoples committee  whats all this asked milton of his father  were going to have a convention of our own  were on the war path said amos grimly well make them fellers think hells t pay and no pitch hot  after dinner amos took a roll of the copies of the call and rode away to the north and jennings hitched up his team and drove away to the south milton and bradley went back to their cornhusking feeling that they were small petaters  they dont intend to let us into it thats dead sure said milton all the same i know the scheme theyre going to bolt the convention and therell be fun in the air  the county woke up the next morning to find its schoolhouse doors proclaiming a revolt of the farmers and the new deal was the talk of the county it was the grange that had made this revolt possible this general intelligence and selfcognizance was the direct result of the work of the grange it had brought the farmers together and had made them acquainted with their own men their own leaders and when they came together a few days later under the open sky like the saxon thanes of old there was a spirit of rebellion in the air that made every man look his neighbor in the face with exultation  it was a perfectly democratic meeting they came together that beautiful september day under the great oaks a witenagemote of serious libertyloving men ready to follow wherever their leaders pointed  amos ridings was the chairman tall grimlipped and earnesteyed his curt speech carried the convention with him his platform was a wagon box and he stood there with his hat off the sun falling upon his shock of closeclipped stiff hair making a powerful and resolute figure with a touch of poetry in his face  fellowcitizens weve come together here today to organize to oust the ring that has held our county affairs in their hands so long we can oust them if well stand together if we dont we cant i believe we will stand together the grange has learned us something its made us better acquainted with each other an the time has come fr a fight the first thing is a permanent chairman wholl y have for chairman  i nominate amos ridings  second the motion cried two voices in quick succession  the chairmans grim visage did not relax he had no time for false delicacy are y ready fr the question  yes yes shouted the crowd  all in favor say aye  there was a vast shout of approval  contrary minds no its a vote  the other officers were elected in the same way they were there for business they passed immediately to the nominations and there was the same unanimity all down the ticket until the nominations for the county auditor began  a small man lifted his hand and cried i nominate james mcgann of rock for auditor  there was a little silence followed by murmurs of disapproval the first false note had been struck someone seconded the motion the chairmans gavel fell  i want to ask the secretary to take the chair for a few minutes he said and there was something in his voice that meant business something ominous the delegates pressed closer the secretary took the chair ive got something to say right here ridings began  fellowcitizens were here in a big fight we cant afford t make any mistake we cant afford to be tolled off the track by a bag of anise seed who is the man makin this motion does anybody know him i do hes a spy hes sent here fr a purpose suppose hed nominated a better man his motion would have been out of place his nomination of jim mcgann was a trick jim mcgann cant git a pound o sugar on credit in his own town he never had any credit nr influence why was he nominated simply to make us ridiculousa laughin stock i want to put you on your guard if we win its got t be in a straight fight thats all ive got t say recognize no nomination that dont come from a man y know  the convention clamored its approval and the small spy and trickster slunk away and disappeared there was a certain majesty in the action of this group of roused farmers nominations were seconded and ratified with shouts even down through the most important officers in the county and town it was magnificent to see how deep was the harmony of action  deering was forced to accept the nomination for treasurer by this feeling of the unanimity and genuineness which pervaded each succeeding action and when the vote was called and the men thrust their hands in the air and shouted they had something of the same feeling that lay at the heart of the men of uri and unterwalden and schwyz when they shouted their votes together in the valley with the mighty cordon of guarding mountains around them  the grange had made this convention and its magnificent action possible each leading member of the grange through its festivals and picnics and institutes had become known to the rest and they were able to choose their leaders instantly the ticket as it stood was very strong deering as treasurer and councill as sheriff insured success so far as these officers were concerned  on the way home councill shouted back at the young men riding with jennings nows a good time for you young chaps t take the field and lectioneer while we nominees wear biled collars and set in the parlor winder  what you want to do is stay at home and dig taters shouted milton a biled collar would defeat any one of yeh dead sure  this was in fact the plan of the campaign  amos ridings assumed practical direction of it  now we dont want a candidate to go outnot once every man stay at home and not open his head well do the work you tend your knittin and well elect yeh  the boys went out on friday nights to electioneer for the granger ticket as it was called  its boss fun milton said to his father its ahead o husking corn it does tickle me to see the future sheriff of the county diggin pertaters while im ridin around in my best cloes makin speeches  well have the whiprow on you when we get into office replied mr jennings  dont crow till yr out o the woods laughed milton  the boys really aroused considerable enthusiasm and each had stanch admirers though they were entirely opposed in style milton told a great many funny stories and went off on what he considered to be the most approved oratorical flights he called on the farmers to stand together he asked them whether it was fair that the town should have all the offices in short he made very taking political harangues  bradley always arose in the same slow way he was a little heavy in getting started his deep voice was thick and husky at beginning but cleared as he went on his words came slowly as if each were an iron weight he dealt in factsor what he believed to be facts he had carefully collated certain charges which had been made against the officials of the county and in his perfectly fearless way of stating them there was immense power     viii  bradley offends netties father   it was a singular thing to see the farmers suddenly begin to ask themselves why they should stand quietly by while the townsmen monopolized all the offices and defied the farmers to make a change they laughed at the charges of chicanery in office and openly said that no man with corns on his hands and hayseed in his hair can be elected to office in the county this speech was of the greatest value to the young champions it became their text  the speech that made bradley famous among the farmers came about the middle of october it was an openair meeting in the cottonwood township one saturday afternoon he and milton drove out to their appointment in a carriage which milton had borrowed it was a superb indian summer day and they were both very happy each had his individual way of showing it milton put his heels on the dashboard and sung or whistled all the way out stopping only occasionally to say  aint this boss this is what i call doin a thing up brown wish i could do this for a stiddy business  bradley smiled at his companions fun he felt the pride and glory of it all but he couldnt express it as milton did it was such a magnificent thing to be thus selected to push on a campaign the mere idea of the crowd waiting out there for their arrival had something royal in it and then this riding away into a practically unknown part of the county to speak before perfect strangers had an epic quality great things seemed coming to him  they found quite an assembly of farmers notwithstanding the busy season it showed how deep was the interest in the campaign and milton commented upon it in beginning his speech  if a farmer ever gets his share of things hes got to take time to turn out to caucuses and meetings and especially hes got to stop work and vote  bradley arose after miltons speech which pleased the farmers with its shrewdness and drollery feeling at a great disadvantage  my colleague he began preserving the formality of the delta society debates has told you of the ring that has controlled the officers of this county for so long but he hasnt told you of the inside facts i aint fightin in this campaign to put the town people out and the farmers in im fightin to put thieves out and honest men in  this was a blow straight out from the shoulder and was followed by great applause but a few voices cried  take that back  i wont take anything back that i know is the truth  yes you will thats a lie an you know it shouted an excited man a short distance away  let me tell you a story bradley went on slowly last session of court a friend of mine was on the jury when court adjourned he took his order on the county to the treasurer and asked for his pay the treasurer said im sorry but they aint any funds left for the jurors fees  cant you give me some out of some other fund  no that wont docant do that  well when will yeh have some money in  well its hard tellinin two or three months probably  well id like the money on this order i need it cant i git somebody to cash it for me  well i dunno i guess theyll take it at the store my brother john might cash itpossibly as an accommodation  well my friend goes over to brother johns bank and brother john cashes the order and gives him eight dollars for it brother john then turns in the order to the treasurer and gets twelve dollars for it and then they divvy on the thing now hows that for a nice game  its a damn lie shouted an excited man in the foreground he had his sleeves rolled up and kept up a continual muttering growl  its the truth repeated bradley there was a strong russell contingent in the meeting and they were full of fight the angry man in front repeated his shout  thats a lie take it back or ill yank yeh offn that wagon box  come and try it said bradley throwing off his coat  the excitement had reached the point where blows begin several irresponsible fellows were urging their companion on  jump im jump im hank well see fair play  stand yer ground brad shouted the friends of the speaker well see they come one at a time  oh see here no fightin shouted others the man hank was not to be silenced he pushed his way to the wagonwheel and shook his extended fist at the speaker  take that back you  bradley caught him by his uplifted wrist and bracing himself against the wheel jerked his assailant into the wagonbox and tumbled him out in a disjointed heap on the other side before he could collect his scattered wits  then bradley stood up in his splendid height and breadth i say its the truth and if there are any more rowdies who want o try yankin me out o this wagon nows your time you neverll have a better chance nobody seemed anxious the cheers of the crowd and the young orators determined attitude discouraged them now ill tell yeh who the man was who presented that order it was william bacon mebbe some o you fellers want to tell him he lies  he finished his speech without any marked interruption and was roundly congratulated by the farmers on the way back to rock river however he seemed very much depressed while milton exulted over it all  gosh i wish i had your muscle old man i aint worth a cent in things like that cæsar but you snatched him baldheaded  makes me feel sick bradley said i aint had but one squabble before since i was a boy it makes me feel like a plugugly  milton was delighted with it all it made such a capital story to tell say brad do you know what i thought of when you was yankin that feller over the wheel scaldin hogs you pulled on him just as if he was a threehundred pound shote it was funny as all time  but bradley had trouble in going to sleep that night thinking about it he was wondering what she would have thought of him in that disgraceful row he tried to remember whether he swore or not he felt even in the darkness her grave sweet eyes fixed upon him in a sorrowful disappointed way and it made him groan and turn his face to the wall to escape the picture of himself standing there in the wagon with his coat off shouting back at a band of rowdies  but the story spread and it pleased the farmers immensely the boldness of the charge and the magnificent muscle that backed it up took hold of the peoples imagination strongly and added very greatly to his fame  when the story reached judge brown he was deeply amused on the following monday morning as brad was writing away busily the judge entered the room  well brad they say you called the russells thieves  i guess perhaps i did  well aint that goin to embarrass you a little whenwhen youre calling on nettie  i aint agoin to call there any more  oh i see expect the colonel to call on you eh  i dont care what he does bradley cried turning and facing his employer i said what i know to be the truth i call it thieving and if they dont like it they can hate it i aint agoin to back down an inch as long as i know what i know  thats right chuckled the judge as a democrat he rejoiced to see a republican ring assaulted go ahead ill stand by you if they try the law     ix  bradley meets mrs brown   though bradley had called a good many times at the russell house to accompany nettie to parties or home from school yet he had never had any conversation to speak of with russell who was a large and somewhat pompous man he knew his place as a western father and never interfered with his daughters love affairs he knew bradley as a likely and creditable young fellow and besides his experience with his two older daughters had taught him the perfect uselessness of trying to marry them to suit himself or his wife  he was annoyed at this attack of bradley upon him and his brother the treasurer it was really carrying things too far accustomed to all sorts of epithets and charges on the part of opposing candidates he ought not to have been so sensitive to bradleys charge but the case was peculiar it was exactly true in the first place and then it came from a young man whom his daughter had brought into the family and whom he had begun to think of as a probable soninlaw  on tuesday morning just as bradley was tumbling his dishes into a pan of hot water their weekly bath milton called it there came a sharp knock on the door and a girls voice called out clearly  hello brad can i come in  yes come in  nettie came in her cheeks radiant with color her eyes shining oh washing your dishes wait a minute ill help she flung off her coat in a helterskelter way and rolled up her sleeves  bradley expostulated no no dont do that ill have em done in a jiffy they aint but a few  ill wipe em anyway she replied oh fun what a towel she held up the side of a floursack on which was a firmname in brown letters she laughed in high glee there was a delicious suggestion in the fact that she was standing by his side helping him in his household affairs  bradley was embarrassed but she chattered away oblivious of space and time her regard for him had grown absolutely outspoken and without shame there was something primitive and savage in her frank confession of her feelings she had come to make all the advances herself in a confidence that was at once beautiful and pathetic she met him in the morning on the way to school and clung to him at night and made him walk home with her she came afternoons with a team to take him out driving the presence of the whole town really made no difference to her she took his arm just the same proud and happy that he permitted it  oh say she broke off suddenly pa wants to see you about something he wanted me to tell you to come down tonight she was dusting the floor at the moment while he was moving the furniture i wonder what he wants she asked  i dont know he replied evasively  something about politics i suppose she came over and stood beside him in silence she was very girlish in spite of her assumption of a young ladys dress and airs and she loved him devouringly she stood so close to him that she could put her hand on his as it lay on the table her clear sweet eyes gazed at him with the confidence and purity of a child  it was a relief to bradley to hear the last bell ring she withdrew her hand and threw down the broom which she had been holding in her left hand oh thats the last bell help me on with my cloak quick he put her cloak on for her she stamped her foot impatiently pull my hair outside  he took her luxuriant hair in both his hands and pulled it outside the cloak and fitted the collar about her neck she caught both his hands in hers and looking up laughed gleefully  you dassent kiss me now  he stooped and kissed her cheek and blushed with shame on the way up the walk to the chapel he suffered an agony of remorse he felt dimly that he had done his ideal an irreparable wrong nettie talked on not minding his silence looking up into his face in innocent glee planning some new party or moonlit drive  all that morning he was too deep in thought to give attention to his classes and at noon he avoided nettie and went home to think but try as he might something prevented him from getting hold of the real facts in the case  he was fond of nettie she stood near him an embodied passion his love for miss wilbur which he had no idea of calling love was a vague and massive feeling of adoration entirely disassociated from the flesh she stood for him as the embodiment of a world of longings and aspirations undeveloped and undefined  one thought was clear he ought not to allowthat is the way it took shape in his mindhe ought not to allow nettie to be seen with him so much unless he intended to marry her and he had never thought of her as a possible wife  he didnt know how to meet russell so put off going down to his house as he had promised he excused himself by saying he was busy moving anyway he had determined upon taking a boardingplace somewhere in correspondence with his change of fortunes and when he had spoken of it the judge had said  why not come up to my house mrs brown and i get kind of lonesome sometimes and then i hate to milk an curry horses an split kindlings always did come up and try living with us  bradley had accepted the offer with the greatest delight it meant a great deal to him it took him out of a cellar and put him into one of the finest houses in townalbeit it was a cold and gloomy house it was large and white and square with sharp gables and its blinds were always closed he went up to dinner that day with the judge to meet mrs brown whom he had never seen nobody saw her for she was a perfect recluse  she looked at her husband through her glasses in a calm surprise as he introduced bradley and stated he had invited him to dinner  well mr brown if you will do such things you must expect your company to take everyday fare  maybe our everyday fare mrs brown will be sunday fare for this young man  they sat down at the table which mrs brown waited upon herself rising from her place for the tea or the biscuits she said very little thereafter but bradley caught the gleam of her glasses fixed upon him several times she had a beautiful mouth but the line of her lips seemed to indicate sadness and a determined silence  mrs brown i wish youd take care of this young man for a few weeks hes my clerk and iahemisuppose hes going to milk the cow and split the kindlings for me to pay for his board in that useful way  she looked at him again in silence and the line of her lips got a little straighter as she waited for the judge to go on  this young man is going to study law with me and i hope to make a great man of him mrs brown  mr brown i wish youd consult with me once in a while she said without anger  mrs brown it was a case of necessity i was on the point of giving up the milking of that cow and my back got a crick in it every time i split the kindlings i consider ive done you a benefit and myself a favor mrs brown  she turned her glasses upon bradley again and studied him in silence she was a very dignified woman of fifty her hair was like wavy masses of molasses candy and her brow cold and placid her eyes could not be seen but her mouth and chin were almost girlish in their beauty  the judge felt that he had done a hazardous thing he took a new tone his reminiscent tone mrs brown do you remember the first time you saw me well i was pirating through oberlinchopping wood you remember we didnt saw it in those days and living in a cellar just like this young man hes been cookin his own grub just as i did then because he hasnt any money to pay for board now i think we ought to give him a lift dont you think so mrs brown  her mouth relaxed a little the glasses turned upon bradley again and looked upon him so steadily that he was able to see her gray eyes  mr brown is always doing things without consulting me she explained to bradley but you are welcome sir if our lonesome house aint worse than your cellar mr brown very seldom takes the trouble to explain what he wants to do but ill try to make you feel at home sir  they ate the rest of the meal in silence the judge was evidently thinking over old times and it would be very difficult to say what his wife was thinking of at last he rose saying  now if youll come out ill show you the well and the cow as he went by his wifes chair he stopped a moment and said gently hell do us two lonely old fossils good elizabeth his hand lay on her shoulder an instant as he passed and when bradley went out of the room he saw her wiping her eyes upon her handkerchief her glasses in her hand  the judge coughed a little we never had but one childa boy he was killed while out huntinghe broke off quickly now heres the meal for the cow i give her about a panful twice a daywhen i dont forget it  somehow mrs brown didnt seem so hard when he met her again at supper the line of her mouth was softer in his room he found many little touches of her motherly handa clean sweet bed and little handmade things upon the wall that made him think of his own mother who had been dead since his sixteenth year he had never had such a room as this it appeared to him as something very fine its frigid atmosphere and lack of grace and charm did not appear to his eyes it was nothing short of princely after his cellar  his knowledge of the inner life of the common western homes made him feel that this rigid coldness between the judge and his wife was only their way the touch of the judges hand on her shoulder meant more than a thousand worn phrases spoken every day under that silence and reserve there was a deep of tenderness and wistful longing which they could not utter and dared not acknowledge even to themselves their lonely house had grown intolerable and bradley came into it bringing youth and sunlight     x  a country polling place   the suffering of the county papers was acute they had supported the incumbents for so long and had derived a reciprocal support so long that they could not bring themselves to a decision the democratic paper the call was too feeble to be anything distinctive at this stage of its career chard foster had not yet assumed control of it it lent a halfhearted support to the independent movement and justified its action on the ground that it was really a democratic movement leading toward reform and it assumed to be the only paper advocating reform the other paper unequivocally republican supported the regular ticket with that singleheartedness of enmity born of bribery or that ignorance which shuts out any admission that the other side has a case  the oak grove schoolhouse was the real stormcentre of the election and there was a great crowd there all day it was a cold raw day the men and boys all came in their overcoats and stood about on the leeward side of the schoolhousewhere a pale sunlight felland scuffled and told stories and bet cookies and apples on the election  some of the boys made up fires out in the woods near by to which they ran whooping whenever the cold became intolerable they crouched around the flames with a weird return of ancestral barbarism and laughed when the smoke puffed out into their faces they made occasional forages in company with boys who lived near after eggs and apples and popcorn which they placed before the fire and ate spiced with ashes  horsemen galloped up at intervals bringing encouraging news of other voting places teams clattered up filled with roughlydressed farmers who greeted the other voters with loud and hearty shouts they tumbled out of the wagons voted riotously and then clattered back into the cornfields to their work with wild hurrahs for the granger ticket  the schoolhouse itself roared with laughter and excited talk and the big stove in the centre devoured its huge chunks of wood making the heat oppressive near it no presidential election had ever brought out such throngs of voters or produced such interested discussion  bradley had been made clerk his capital handwriting and knowledge of bookkeeping made him a valuable man for that work he sat behind his desk with the books before him and impassively performed his duties but it was his first public appointment and he was really deeply gratified he felt paid for all his years hard study  about two oclock when the voters were thickest at the polls a man galloped up with an excited air and reining in his foaming horse yelled  deering has withdrawn in favor of russell the crowd swarmed out  whats the matter  who spoke  deering has withdrawn in favor of russell cast your votes for russell repeated the man and plunged off up the road  the farmers looked at each other what the hells all this said smith  who was it  i dont know  hes a liar whoever he is said councill whereve i seen him before  i knowits deerings hired man  you dont say so this seemed like the truth  i know who it isits sam harding shouted milton but that aint deerings horse its a republican trick jump yr horse there councill he was carried out of himself by his excitement and anger the men leaped upon their horses  some o you fellers take his back trail shouted councill hell come from shellrock and hells corner  the men saw the whole trick this man had been sent out to the most populous of the county voting places to spread a lying report trusting to the surprise of the announcement to carry a few indecisive votes for russell  other men leaped their horses and rode off on hardings back trail while councill milton and old man bacon rode away after him bacon growled as he rode  im agin you fellers but by god i blieve in a square game if i kin git my paw on that houn  they rode furiously in the hope of overtaking him before he reached the next pollingplace milton was in the lead on his gray colt a magnificent creature he was light and a fine rider and forged ahead of the elder men but the spy was also riding a fine horse and was riding very fast  when they reached the next pollingplace he was just passing out of sight beyond they dashed up scattering the wondering crowd  its a lie its a trick shouted milton deering wouldnt withdraw cast every vote for deering its all done to fool yeh  the others came thundering up its a lie they shouted  come on cried milton dropping the rein on marks neck and darting away on the trail of the false courier  the young fellows caught the excitement and every one who had a horse leaped into the saddle and clattered after with whoop and halloo as if they were chasing a wolf  the rider ahead suddenly discovered that he was being followed and he urged his horse to a more desperate pace along the lane which skirted the woods edge for a mile and then turned sharply and led across the river  along the lane is the chase led there was something in the grim silence with which milton and bacon rode in the lead that startled the spys guilty heart he pushed his horse unmercifully hoping to discourage his pursuers  miltons blood was up now and bringing the flat of his hand down on the proud neck of his coltthe first blow he ever struck him he shouted  get out o this mark  the magnificent animal threw out his chin his ears laid flat back he seemed to lower and lengthen his eyes took on a wild glare the air whizzed by miltons ears a wild exultation rose in his heart all the stories of rides and desperate men he had ever read came back in a vague mass to make his heart thrill  marks terrific pace steadily ate up the intervening distance and milton turned the corner and thundered down the decline at the very heels of the fugitive  hey hold on there milton shouted as he drew alongside and passed the fellow hold on there  git out o my way was the savage answer  stop right here commanded milton reining mark in the way of the other horse  the fellow struck mark git out o my way he yelled  milton seized the bit of the other horse and held it the fellow raised his arm and struck him twice before bacon came thundering up  hyare damn yehnone o that  he leaped from his horse and running up tore the rider from his saddle in one swift effort the fellow struggled fiercely  let go o me r ill kill yeh  bacon growled something inarticulate as he cuffed the man from side to side shook him like a rag and threw him to the ground he lay there dazed and scared while bacon caught his horse and tied it to a tree  he came back to the fellow as he was rising and again laid his bearlike clutch upon him  who paid you to do this he demanded as councill and the others came straggling up their horses panting with fatigue  the fellow struck him in the face the old man lifted him in the air and dashed him to the ground with a snarling cry his gesture was like that of one who slams a biting cat upon the floor the man did not rise  youve killed him cried milton  damn imi dont care  the man was about thirtyfive years of age a slender thinfaced man with tobaccostained whiskers the fellows knew him for a sneaking fellow but they plead for him  dont hit im agin bacon hes got enough  the fellow sat up and looked around the blood was streaming from his nose and from a wound in his head he had a savage and hunted look he was unsubdued but was too much dazed to be able to do anything more than swear at them all  what a yuh chasen me fur y damn cowards six on one  whatre you doun ridin across the country like this fur  none o your business you lowlived  bacon brought the doubled leadingstrap which he held in his hand down over the fellows shoulders with a sounding slap  what you need is a sound tannun he said he plied the strap in perfect silence upon the writhing man who swore and yelled but dared not rise  give him enough of it yelled the crowd  give the fool enough  bacon worked away with a curious air of taking a job the strap fell across the mans upheld hands and over his shoulders penetrating even the thick coat he worebut it was not the blows that quelled him it was the look in bacons eyes he saw that the old man would stand there till sunset and ply that strap  hold on dam yehy want o kill me  got nough  yes yes my god yes  climb onto that horse there  he climbed upon his horse and with bacon leading it rode back along the road he had come covered with blood  now i want you to say with yr own tongue ye lied bacon said as they came to the last pollingplace he had passed  the crowd came rushing out with excited questions  what y got there bacon  a liar come what ye gount say he asked the captive  i lieddeering aint withdrawn  they rode on councill and milton following bacon and his prisoner at the oak grove schoolhouse a great crowd had gathered and they came out in a swarm as the cavalcade rode up bradley left his book and came out to see the poor prisoner who reeled in his saddle covered with blood and dirt  they rode on to the next pollingplace relentlessly forcing the man to undo as much of his villainy as possible milton remained with bradley that shows how desperate they are he said as they went back into the schoolhouse they see we mean business this time                                                 all was quiet even gloomy when bradley and milton reached rock river the streets were deserted and only an occasional opening door at some favorite haunt like the drugstore or robies grocery showed that a living soul was interested in the outcome of the election there were no bonfires no marching of boys through the street with tin pans and horns  some reckless fellows tried it out of devilment but were promptly put down by the strong hand of the city marshal whose sympathies were with the broken ring it had been evident at an early hour of the day that the town of rock river itself was divided amos ridings and robie had carried a strong following over into the camp of the farmers a general feeling had developed which demanded a change  milton was wild with excitement he realized more of the significance of the victory than bradley he had been in politics longer for the first time in the history of the county the farmers had asserted themselves for the first time in the history of the farmers of iowa had they felt the power of their own mass  for the first time in the history of the american farmer there had come a feeling of solidarity they perceived for a moment at least their community of interests and their power to preserve themselves against the combined forces of the political pensioners of the small towns they made the mistake of supposing the interests of the merchant artisan and mechanic were also inimicable  they saw the smaller circle first they had not yet risen to the perception of the solidarity of all productive interests that was sure to follow     xi  studying with the judge   after this campaign bradley went back to his studies at the seminary and to his work in browns office milton did not go back deering made him his assistant in the treasurers office and he confided to bradley his approaching marriage with eileen  in talking about miltons affairs to bradley mr jennings said sadly well that leaves me alone hell never come back to the farm when he was at school i didnt miss him so much because he was always coming back on a saturday but nowwell its no use making a fuss over it i spose but its going to be lonesome work for us out there  mebbe hell come back after his term of office is up  mr jennings shook his head no town life and officell spoil imand then hell get married youll never go back on the farm nobody ever does that gets away from it and learns how to get a livin anywhere else  this melancholy sat strangely upon mr jennings who usually took things as they came with smiling resignation it affected bradley deeply to see him so gloomy  bradley found a quiet and comfortable home with judge brown and his odd old wife who manifested her growing regard for him by little touches of adornment in his room and by infrequent confidences as for the judge he took an immense delight in the young fellow he made such a capital listener between bradley and the grocery he really found opportunity to tell all his old stories and philosophize upon every conceivable subject he talked a deal of politics quoting jefferson and jackson he criticised members of congress and told what he would have done in their places he criticised also the grange movement from what he considered to be a lofty plane  they profess to have for a motto equal rights to all and special privileges to none and then they go off into class legislation its easy to talk that principle but it means business when you stand by it i haint got the sand to stand by that principle myself it goes too deep for me but its something you young politicians ought to study on one o these days that principle will get life into it and when it does things will tumble the democratic party used to be a party that meant that and if it ever succeeds again it must head that way thats the reason i want to get you young fellows into it  these talks didnt mean as much to bradley as they should have done he was usually at work at something and only half listened while the judge wandered on his heels in the air his cheek full of tobacco old colonel peavy dropped in occasionally and dr carver and then the air was full of good oldtime democratic phrases at such times the judge even went so far as to quote calhoun  as a matter of fact calhoun was on the right track if he hadnt got his states rights doctrine mixed up with slavery hed a been all right what he really stood for was local government as opposed to centralized government were just comin around back to a part of calhouns position  this statement of the judge stuck in bradleys mind months afterward it kept coming up and becoming more significant each time that he talked upon it  he thought less often of miss wilbur now and he could hear her name mentioned without flushing she had become a vaguer but no less massive power in his life that beautiful place in his soul where she was he had a strange reverence for he loved to have it there it was an inspiration to him and yet he did not distinctly look forward to ever seeing her much less to meeting her  indefinite as this feeling was it saved him from the mistake of marrying nettie poor girl she was in the grasp of her first great passion and was as helpless as a brokenwinged bird in the current of a river she was feverishly happy and unaccountably sad by turns the commands of her father not to see bradley only roused her antagonism and her mothers timid entreaties made no impression upon her not even bradleys unresponsiveness seemed to have a decided discouraging effect  her classmates laughed at her as they did at three or four other pairs in the school who proclaimed their devouring love for each other by walking to and from the chapel with locked arms or who sat side by side in their classes with clasped hands indifferent to any rude jest reprimand from the teacher or slylyflung eraser the principal gave it up in despair calling it a sort of measles which theyll outgrow  it was really pitiful to the comprehending observer there was so much that was pain mixed with this pleasure there were so many keen and benumbing disappointments like that of waiting about the door of the office for bradley to come down and then to see him appear in company with some client of judge brown not that the client made so much difference but the cold glance of bradleys eyes did at such times she turned away with quivering lip and choking throat  she had lost much of her pertness and brightness she talked very little at home and it was only when with bradley that she seemed at all like her old birdlike self then she chattered away in a wild delight if he happened to be in a responsive mood or feverishly and with a forced quality of gayety if he were cold and unresponsive  bradley knew he ought to decide one way or the other and often he promised himself that he would refuse to walk or ride with her but the next time she came he weakly relented at sight of her eager face it took so little to make her happy that the temptation was very great to yield and so their lives went along he took her to the parties and sleighrides with the young people but on his return he refused to enter the house he met her at the gate and left her there upon his return  the colonel had met him shortly after the election and had threatened to whip him for his charges against him as an officeholder he concluded not to try it however and contented himself by saying dont you never darken my door again young man  but in general bradleys life moved on uneventfully he applied himself studiously to his work in the office he was getting hold of some common law and a great deal of common sense for the judge was strong on both these points  young man said the judge one day after bradley had returned from a sleighride with nettie i see that the womanquestion is before you now dont make a mistake be sure you are right in nine cases out of ten back out and youll be right  bradley remained silent over by the rickety redhot stove warming his stiffened fingers the judge went on in a speculative way  i believe i notice a tendency in the times that makes it harder for a married man to succeed than it used to be i think on the whole my advice would be to keep out of it altogether more men fail on that account i observe than upon any other you see its so infernally hard to tell what kind of a woman your girl is going to turn out  you neednt worry about me said bradley a little sullenly  thats what mrs brown said i just thought id say a word or two anyway if ive gone too far you may kick my dog over there  bradley looked at the sleeping dog and back at the meditative judge and smiled he sat down at his work and said no more upon the subject     xii  the judge advises bradley   it was at the judges advice that he decided to take a year at the lawschool at iowa city he had been in the office over a year and a half and though he had not been converted to democracy the judge was still hopeful  oh youll have to come into the democratic camp he often said you see its like this the republicans are so damn proud of their record theyre going to ossify with their faces turned backward they have a past but no future now the democratic party has no past that it cares particularly to look back at and so its got to look into the future you progressive young fellows cant afford to stand in a party where everything is all done because that leaves nothing for you to do but to admire some dead man youll be forced into the party of ideas sure i aint disposed to hurry you youll come out all right when the time comes  bradley never argued with him he had simply shut his lips and his mind to it all democracy had lost some of its evil associations in his mind however and free trade and secession no longer meant practically the same thing as it used to do  now people are damn foolsexcepting you an me of course yawned the judge one day in midsummer what you want to do is to take a couple of years at iowa city and then come back here and jump right into the political arena and toot your horn theyll elect you twice as quick if you come back here with a high collar and a plughat even these grangers they distrust a man in hodden grayno sort of doubt of it now you take my advice people like to be pollygoggled by a sleek suit of clothes and then there is nothing that impresses people with a mans immense accumulation of learning and dignity like a judicious spell of absence  it was very warm and they both sat with coats and vests laid aside the fat old bulldog was panting convulsively from the exertion of having just climbed the stairs the judge went on after looking affectionately at the dog  ah were a gittin old together bull an me we like the shady side of the street now you could make a good run in the county today as you are but your election would be doubtful and we cant afford to take any chances there are a lot o fellers whod say you hadnt had experience enoughtoo young an all that kind o thing well suppose you could be elected auditor it wouldnt pay it would only stand in the way of bigger things now you take my advice  id like to but i cant afford it judge  how much you got on hand  oh couple of hundred dollars or so  the judge ruminated a bit scratching his chin well now ill tell yeh mrs brown and i had a little talk about the matter last night and she thinks i ought to lend you the money andshe thinks you ought to take it so pack up yr duds in september and start in  bradleys first impulse of course was to refuse because he felt he had no claim upon the judges charity it took hold of his imagination however and he talked it all over thoroughly during the intervening weeks and the judge put it this way  now theres no charity about this thingi simply expect to get three hundred per cent on my money so you go right along and when you come back well have a new shingle paintedbrown  talcott we aint anxious to lose yeh as a matter of fact mrs brown and ill be pretty lonesome for the first few weeks after you go awayand what ill do about that cussed cow and kindlingwood i really dont know mrs brown suggested wed better take in another homeless boy and i guess thats what well do  a couple of nights later while bradley was sitting before his trunk which he had begun to pack like the inexperienced traveller he was several days in advance mrs brown came to the stairway to tell him nettie was below and wanted to see him  the poor girl had just heard that he was going away and she met him with a white scared face he sat down without speaking for he had no defence except silence for things of that nature the girls fury of grief appalled him she came over and flung herself sobbing upon his lap her arms about his neck  oh brad is it true are you going away  i expect to he replied coldly  you mustnt you shant i wont let you she cried tightening her arms about him as if that would detain him from that on there was nothing but sobs on her side and explanations on hisexplanations to which her love direct and selfish would not listen for a moment the unreserve and unreason of her passion at last disgusted him his tone grew sharper  i cant stay here he said youve no business to ask me to i cant always be a lawyers hack i want to study and go higher ive got to leave this town if i ever amount to anything in the world  then take me with you she cried  i cant do that i cant any moren make a livin for myself besides ive got to study  ill make father give you some money she said  he closed his lips sternly and said nothing further her agony wore itself out after a time and she was content to sit up and look at him and listen to him at last while he explained and her suppressed sobs and the tears that stood in her big childish eyes moved him more than her unrestrained sorrow it was thus she conquered him  he promised her he would come home often and he promised to write every day and by implication though not in words he promised to marry herthat is to say he acquiesced in her plans for housekeeping when he returned and was established in the office he ended it all by walking home with her and promising to see her every day before he went and as he kissed her goodnight at the gate she was smiling again and quite happy although a little catching of the breath even in her laughter showed that she was not yet out of the groundswell of her emotion  mrs brown was waiting for him when he returned and as he sat down in the sittingroom where she was busy at her sewing she looked at him in her slow way and at last arose and came over near his chair  have you promised her anything bradley she asked laying her thimbled hand upon his shoulder as his own mother might have done bradley lifted his gloomy eyes and colored a little  i dont know what ive said he answered from the depth of his swift reaction moren i had any business to say probably  i thought likely you cant afford to marry a girl out of pity for her bradleyit wont do ive seen how things stood for some time but i thought i wouldnt say anything she paused and considered a moment standing there by his side its a good thing for both of you that youre going away you hadnt ought to have let it go on so long  i couldnt help it he replied with more sharpness in his voice than he had ever used in speaking to her  her hand dropped from his shoulder no i dont spose you could it aint natural for young people to stop an think about these things i dont suppose you knew yrself just where it was all leading to well now dont worry and dont let it interfere with your plans shell outgrow it girls often go through two or three such attacks just go on with your studies and when you come back if you find her unmarried why then decide what to do  her touch of cynicism was accounted for perhaps by the fact that she had never had a daughter     xiii  bradley sees ida again   bradley felt that the world was widening for him as he took the train for iowa city a few days later he was now very nearly thirty years of age and was maturing more rapidly than his friends and neighbors knew for the processes of his mind like those of an intricate coil of machinery were hidden deep away from the casual acquaintance  he had secured in the two years at the seminary a fairly good groundwork of the common english branches and his occasional reading and especially his attendance upon lawsuits had given him a really creditable understanding of common law the judge always insisted that law was simple but it wasnt as profitable aschicanery  any man from his fund of common sense can settle nine tenths of all lawsuits but that aint what were here for a successful lawyer is the fellow who tangles things up and keeps common law and common sense subordinated to chicanery and precedent damn precedent anyway it means referring to a past that didnt know and didnt want to know what justice was  in the atmosphere of lectures like these bradley had unconsciously absorbed a great deal of radical thought about lawcodes and now went about the study of the history of enactments and change of statutes without any servile awe of the past the judges irreverence had its uses for it put a law on its merits before the young student  he found the lawschool a very congenial place to study he passed the examinations quite decently  his life there was quiet and studious for he felt that he had less time than the younger men his age seemed excessive to him by contrast he was very generally respected as a quiet decent fellow who might be a fine consulting lawyer but not a good man in the courts they changed this opinion very suddenly upon hearing him present his first plea  his life consisted for the most part of passing to and fro from his boardingplace to his recitationroom or to long hours of digging in the library he saw from time to time notices of miss wilburs lectures in the interests of the grange and upon literary topics he determined to hear her if she came into any neighboring city there was no one to spy upon him if he made an expedition of that sort  one beautiful winter day he read in the weekly paper of the town that she was about to appear at the congregational church in a lecture entitled the real womanquestion he had an impulse to sing which he wisely repressed for he couldnt singthat is nothing which the hearer would recognize as singing the fates seemed working in his favor  he had preserved a marked sweetness and purity of thought through all his hard life that made him a good type of man his clear steady eyes never gave offence to any woman for nothing but sympathy and admiration ever looked out of them the very thought that she was coming so near brought a curious numbness into his muscles and a tremor into his hands he looked forward now to the evening of the lecture with the keenest interest he had ever felt  the dazzling winter day seemed more radiant than ever before when he heard some ladies in the postoffice say ida was in town the blue shadows lay on the newfallen snow vivid as steel the warm sun showered down through the clear air a peculiar warmth that made the eaves begin to drop in the early morning sleighs were moving to and fro in the streets and bright bits of color on the girls hoods and in the broad knit scarfs which the young men wore formed pleasing reliefs from the dazzling blue and white bells filled the air with jocund music  bradley walked straight away into the country he wanted to be alone it seemed so strange and sweet to be thus shaken by the coming of a woman in the first few minutes he gave himself up to the thought that she was near and that he was going to hear her speak again it made his hand shake and his heart beat quick  he wondered if she would be changed she would be older a little but she would look just the same he saw her stand again under the waving branches of the oaks the flickering shadow on her brown hair speaking again the words which had become the measure of his ambition the prophecy of a social condition  i want to have everything i do to help us all on toward that time when the country will be filled with happy young people and hale and hearty old people when the moon will be brighter and the stars thicker in the skies  this was his thought he had not risen yet to the conception of the real barrenness and squalor of the life he had lived  his studies had made him a little more selfanalytical but there were inner deeps where he did not penetrate and there was one sacred place which he dared not enter a whirl of thought confused him but out of it all he returned constantly to the thought that he should hear her speak again  that evening he dressed himself with as much care as if he were to call upon her alone and he dressed very well now his clothes were substantial and fitted him well his years immunity from hard work had left his large hands supple and delicate of touch and his face had attained refinement and mobility his eyes had become more introspective and had lost entirely the oxlike roll of the countryborn man he was a handsome and dignified young man his bearing on the street was noticeably manly and unaffected  the lecture was in the church and the seats were all filled it gratified him at the same time that it hopelessly abased him to observe all this evidence of her power as he waited for her to appear that tremor came into his hands again and that breathlessness and curiously enough he felt that horrible familiar sinking of the heart which he always felt just before he himself rose to speak  somebody started to clap hands and the rest joined in as two or three ladies entered the back part of the church and passed up the aisle he looked up as they went by him and caught a glimpse of a stately head of brown hair modestly bent in acknowledgment of the applause and he caught a whiff of the delicate odor of violets his eyes followed the strong firm steps of the young woman who walked between the two older women there was something fine and dignified in her walk and the odor of her dress as she passed lingered with him but he did not feel that this was the same woman till she turned and faced him on the platform  he sat impassively but his pulse leaped when her clear brown eyes running calmly over the audience seemed to fall upon him she was the same woman his ideal and more she was fuller of form and the poise of her head was more womanly but she was the same spirit that had come to be such a power and inspiration in his life  as a matter of fact she had grown also if she had not she would have seemed girlish to him now growing as he grew she seemed the same distance beyond him her selfpossession in the face of the audience appealed to him strongly something in her manner of dress pleased him it was so individual so like her simple dignified beautiful self in every line  she spoke more quietly more conversationally than when he heard her before but her voice made him shudder with associated emotions its cadences reached deep and the words she spoke opened long vistas in his mind she was defending the right of women to live as human beings to act as human beings and to develop as freely as men  i claim the right to be an individual human being first and a woman afterward why should the accident of my sex surround me with conventional and arbitrary limitations i claim the same right to find out what i can do and cant do that a man has who is to determine what my sphere ismen and mens laws or my own nature these are vital questions i deny the right of any man to mark out the path in which i shall walk i claim the same right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that men are demanding  it is not a question of suffrage merelysuffrage is the smaller part of the womanquestionit is a question of equal rights it is a question of whether the law of liberty applies to humanity or to men only absolute liberty bounded only by the equal liberties of the rest of humanity is the real goal of the racenot of man only but woman too  the ladies dimly feeling that liberty was a safe thing to cheer clapped their hands softly under the cover of the nosier clapping of a few radicals who knew what the speaker was really saying bradley did not cheerhe was thinking too deeply  the woman question is not a political one merely it is an economic one the real problem is the wage problem the industrial problem the real question is womans dependence upon man as the breadwinner so long as that dependence exists there will be weakness no individual can stand at their strongest and best while leaning upon some other i believe with browning and ruskin that the development of personality is the goal of the race  the ladies took it for granted that this was true as it was bolstered by two great names a few however sat with wrinkled brows scenting something heretical in all that  the time is surely coming when women can no longer bear to be dependent to be pitied or abused by men they will want to stand upright and independent by their husbands claiming the same rights to freedom of action and demanding equal pay for equal work she must be able to earn her own living in an honorable way at a moments notice then she will be a free woman even if she never leaves her kitchen  it was trite enough to a few of the audience but to others it was new and to many it was revolutionary she was destined to again set a stake in bradleys mental horizon the woman question had not engaged his attention at least not in any serious way he had not thought of woman as having any active part in living in the thoughtless way of the average man he had ignored or idealized women according as they appealed to his eye he had not risen to the point of pitying or condemning or in any way consciously placing them in the social economy  the speaker had appealed to his imagination before and now again he sat absolutely motionless while great new thoughts and impersonal emotions sprang up in his brain he saw women in a new light and the aloofness of the speaker grew upon him again he felt that she was holding her place as his teacher around him he heard the rustle of approval upon the gown she wore upon her voice and some few favorable comments upon her ideas he saw some of the people crowd forward to shake her hand while others went out talking excitedly  he lingered as long as he dared longing to go forward to greet her but he went slowly out at last home to his boarding place and sat down in his habitual attitude when in deep thought his elbow on his knee his chin in his palm he wanted to see her he must see her and tell her how much she had done for him  how to do it was the question which absorbed him now he got away from the noisy merriment of the house out into the street again the stars were more congenial company to him now under their passionless serenity he could think better he felt that he must come to an understanding with himself soon but he put it off and turned his attention to his future and more immediately to the plans which must be carried out of seeing her  when he came in he was desperately resolved he would go to see her on the next day in her hotel he justified himself by saying that she was a lecturer a person before the public and that she would not think it strange anyhow he was going to do it                                                 in the broad daylight however it was not so easy as it seemed under the magic of the moon the conventions of the world always count for less in the company of the moon and the stars he heard during the morning that she was going away in the afternoon and he was made desperate he started out to go straight to the hotel and he did but he walked by it once twice a half dozen times each time feeling weaker and more desperate in his resolution  at length he deliberately entered and astonished himself by walking up to the clerk and asking for miss wilbur  the clerk turned briskly and looked at the pigeonholes for the keys i think she is send up a card  true he hadnt thought of that he had no cards he received one from the clerk that looked as if it had done duty before and scrawled his name upon it and gave it to the insolent little darky who served as front  tell her id like to see her just a few minutes  on the stairs he tried to prepare what he should say to her his mouth already felt dry and his brain was a mere swirl of gray and white matter almost without knowing how he found himself seated in the ladies parlor to which the boy had conducted him it was a barren little place in spite of its excessively florid gilt and crimson paper and its ostentatious harsh redplush furniture  his heart sent the blood into his throat till it ached with the tension his lips quivered and turned pale as he heard the slow sweep of a womans dress and there she stood before him with smiling face and extended hand are you mr talcott did you want to see me  she had the frank gesture and ready smile a kindly man would have used instantly his brain cleared his heart ceased to pound and the numbness left his limbs he forgot himself utterly he only saw and heard her he found himself saying  i wanted to come in and tell you how much i liked your speech last night and how much i liked a speech you made up at rock river at the grange picinic  oh did you hear me up there that was one of my old speeches ive quite outgrown that now youll be shocked to know i dont believe in a whole lot of things that i used to believe in as she talked she looked at him precisely as one man looks at another without the slightest false modesty or coquettishness she evidently considered him a fellowstudent on social affairs im glad you liked my talk on the woman question it was dreadfully radical to the most of my audience  it was right bradley said and their minds seemed to come together at that point as if by an electrical shock i never thought of it before women have been kept down we do claim to know better what she ought to do than she knows herself the trouble is we men dont think about it at all we need to have you tell us these things  yes thats true as soon as i made that discovery i began talking the woman question one radicalism opened the way to the other being a radical is like opening the door to the witches are you one she asked with a sudden smile i mean a radical not a witch  i dont know he replied simply im a student i know i cant agree with some people on these things  some people sometimes i feel it would be good to meet with a single persona single onei could agree with but tell me of yourselfare you in the grange movement  well not exactly but ive helped all i could  what is the condition of the grange in your county  it seems to be going down  she was silent for some time her face saddened with deep thought yes im afraid it is the farmers cant seem to hold together strange aint it other trades and occupations have their organizations and stand by each other but the farmer cant seem to feel his kinship well i suppose he must suffer greater hardships before he learns his lesson but god help the poor wives while he learns but he must learn she ended firmly he must come some day to see that to stand by his fellowman is to stand by himself thats what civilization means to stand by each other  bradley did not reply he was looking upon her with eyes filled with adoration he had never heard such words from the lips of anyone he had never seen a woman sit lost in philosophic thought like this her bent head seemed incredibly beautiful to him and her simple flowing dress royal purple her presence destroyed his power of thought he simply waited for her to go on  the farmer lacks comparative ideas she went on he dont know how poor he is if he once finds it out let the politicians and their masters the moneychangers beware but while hes finding it out his children will grow up in ignorance and his wife die of overwork oh sometimes i lose heart her voice betrayed how strongly she perceived the almost hopeless immensity of the task the farmer must learn that to help himself he must help others that is the great lesson of modern society dont you think so  i dont know im losing my hold on things that i used to believe in ive come to believe the system of protection is wrong he said this in a tone absurdly solemn as if he had somehow questioned the law of gravity  of course it is wrong she said the moment i got east i found freetrade in the air and my uncle who is a manufacturer admitted it was all right in theory but it wouldnt do as a practical measure that finished me im a woman you know and when a thing appears right in theory i believe itll be right in practice expediency dont count with me you see but tell me do you still live in rock river  yes im only studying law down here  oh i see i suppose you know many of the people at rock river she asked about milton whom she remembered and about mr deering then she returned again to the subject of the grange yes it has been already a great force but i begin to suspect that the time is coming when it must include more or fail i dont know just whati aint quite clear upon itbut as it stands now it seems inadequate  she ended very slowly her chin in her palm her eyes on the floor she made a grand picture of thought something more active than meditation her dress trailed in long sweeping lines and against its rich dark purple folds her strong white hands lay in vivid contrast the most wonderful charm of her personality was her complete absorption in thought or the speech of her visitor she was interested in this keeneyed stronglimbed young fellow as a possible convert and reformer she wanted to state herself clearly and fully to him he was a fine listener  im afraid i see a tendency that is directly away from my ideal of a farming community there is a force operating to destroy the grange and all other such movements  you mean politics  no i mean land monopoly i believe in thickly settled farming communities communities where every man has a small highly cultivated farm thats what ive been advocating and prophesying but i now begin to see that our system of ownership in land is directly against this security and directly against thicklysettled farming communities the big land owners are swallowing up the small farmers and turning them into renters or laborers dont you think so  i hadnt though of it before but i guess thats soup in our county at least  its so everywhere ive been i dont understand it yet but im going to in the meantime i am preaching union and education i dont see the end of it but i knowhere she threw off her doubti know that the human mind cannot be chained i know the love of truth and justice cannot be destroyed and marches on from age to age and thats why i am full of confidence the farmer is beginning to compare his mortgaged farm with the bankers mansion and his safe and no one can see the end of his thinking the great thing is his thinking  she arose and gave him her hand im glad you came in give my regards to mr deering and other friends wont you tell them not to think im not working because im no longer their lecturer you ought to be in the field will you read something which ill send she asked the zeal of the reformer getting the upper hand again  certainly i should be very glad to  ill send you some pamphlets ive been reading her voice seemed to say the interview was ended but bradley did not go he was struggling to speak after a significant pause he said in a low voice  idid like to write to youif you dontmind  her eyes widened just a line but they did not waver i should like to hear from you she said cordially id like to know what you think of those pamphlets which ill surely send  he had the courage to look once more into her brown eyes with their redgold deeps as he shook hands the clasp of her hand was firm and frank  goodby i hope i shall see you again my address is always des moines though im on the road a great deal  out into the open air again he passed like a man sanctified it seemed impossible that he had not only seen her but had retained his selfpossession and had actually dared to ask permission to write to her  the redgold sunlight was flaming across the snow and the shadows stood out upon the shining expanse vivid as stains in ink the sky aflame with orange and gold clouds was thrown into loftier relief by the serrate blue rim of trees that formed the western horizon as he walked he had a reckoning with himself it could not longer be delayed  he had been a boy to this day but that hour made him a man and he knew he was a lover not that he used that word for like the farmborn man that he was he did not say i love her but he lifted his face to the sky in an unuttered resolution to be worthy her  he had come under the spell of her womanly presence he had seen her in her housedress and his admiration for her intellect and beauty had added to itself a subtle quality which rose from the potential husbandship and fatherhood within him  now that he was out of her immediate presence thoughts came thick and fast every word she had spoken seemed to have a magical power of arousing long trains of speculation he walked far out into the quiet evening walked until he grew calmer and the emotion of the hour faded to a luminous golden dusk in his mind as the day changed into the beautiful winter night  as he sat down at his desk an hour later he saw a letter lying there it was one of netties poor little schoolgirl love letters a feeling of disgust and shame seized him he crumpled the letter in his hands and was on the point of throwing it away when his mood changed and he softened by the side of miss wilbur poor little nettie was a willful child                                                 a few days after there came to him a pamphlet directed in a womans hand its title page struck him as something utterly new but it was only the first of a flood of similar publications  the coming conflict a series of lectures prophetic of the coming revolution of the poor when they will rise against the national banks and against all indirect taxation  its dedication was marked with a pencil and he read it over and over to the toiling millions who produce all the wealth yet because they have never controlled legislation have been impoverished by unjust laws made in the interests of the landholder and the moneychanger who seize upon and hold the surplus wealth of the nation by the same right that the slavemaster held his slave legal right and that alone this tract is inscribed by the author  it was bradleys first intimation of the mighty forces beginning to stir in the deeps of american society he found the pamphlet filled with great confusing thoughts he confessed frankly in his letter to miss wilbur that he got nothing satisfactory out of it though it made him think  it was astonishing to himself to find his thoughts flowing out to her upon paper with the greatest ease he was stricken with fear after he had mailed his letter it was so bulky he was appalled at the length of time which must pass before he might reasonably expect to hear from her he counted the days the hours that intervened her note came at last and it made his blood leap as the clerk flung it out with a grin shes blessed yeh this time it was a redheaded clerk and his grin by reason of a quid of tobacco in his thin cheek was particularly offensive bradley felt an impulse to call him out of his box and whip him  when he opened the letter in his own room he felt a sort of fear how would she reply the letter gave out a faint perfume like that he remembered floated with her dress it was a rather brief note but very kind she called his attention to two or three passages in the pamphlet and especially asked him to read the chapters touching on the land and money questions but the part over which he spent the most time was the paragraph at the close      i liked your letter very much it shows a sincere desire for the     truth you will never stop short of the truth im sure but you     will have sacrifices to makeyou must expect that i shall take     great interest in your work      very sincerely      ida wilbur     xiv  bradley changes his political views   the west had always been republican its states had come into the union as republican states it met the solid south with a solid northwest year after year and it firmly believed that the salvation of the nations life depended on its fidelity to the war traditions and on the principle of protection to american industries  its orators waved the bloody shirt to keep the party together though each election placed the war and its issues farther into the background of history and an increasing number of people deprecated the action of fanning smouldering embers into flame again iowa and kansas and nebraska were stalwarts of the stalwart kansas was the battleground of the old abolition and free soil forces and their traditions kept alive a love and reverence for the republican party long after its real leaders had passed away and long after it had ceased to be the party of the people  iowa was hopelessly republican also a strong force in the rebellion dominated by new england thought its industries predominantly agricultural it held rigidly to its republicanism and trained its young men to believe that while all democrats were not thieves all thieves were democrats and when pressed to the wall admitted reluctantly that there were some good men among the democrats  in the fall of bradleys last year at iowa city another presidential campaign was coming on but few men considered that there was any change impending local fights really supplied the incitement to action among the republican leaders there was no statement of a general principle no discussion of economic issues by their political leaders they carefully avoided anything like a discussion of the real condition of the people  rock county had been the banner republican county for years the democrats of rock county had met in annual convention to nominate a ticket which they had not the slightest expectation of electing there was something pathetic in the habit it was not faithit was a sort of desperation and yet the republicans as regularly had their joke about it regardless of the pathos presented in the action of a body of men thus fighting a forlorn and hopeless battle each year some oldfashioned democrat dropped away into the grave and yet the remnant met and nominated a complete ticket and voted for it solemnly even religiously  the young republicans of the county called this remnant free traders and copperheads exactly as if the terms were synonymous the republican boys of the country felt that there was something mysteriously uncanny in the term free trader and always associated copperhead with the yellowbacked rattlesnakes that made their dens in the limestone cliffs and in their snowballing took sides with these mysterious words as shibboleths  in truth many of these democrats were very thoughtful menoldline jeffersonians who held to a principle of liberty others had been born democrats a halfcentury ago and had never been able to make any change they continued the habit of being democrats just as they continued the habit of wearing fuzzy old plug hats of oldfashioned shapes and long polished frock coats then there were a few of that perpetually crossgrained class who will never agree with anybody else if they can help it they belonged to the democracy because the democrats were in the minority and considered it wrong to belong to a majority anyhow of this sort were men like colonel peavy and old judd colwell  the colonel had been nominated for treasurer and colwell for sheriff on the democratic ticket year after year and each year the leaders of the party had prophesied decided gains but they did not come the state remained apparently hopelessly republican the forces which were really preparing for change were too far below the surface for these oldline politicians to understand and measure  as a matter of fact the schools and debating clubs and newspapers were preparing the whole country for a political revolution radicals were everywhere being educated men like radbourn who still remained nominally a republican and a host of other young men and progressive men were becoming disabused of the protective idea and were ready for a revolt there needed but a change of leadership to make a change of the relation of parties and of party names  the grange which was still nonpartisan seemed not destined to play a very strong part in politics though it was still at work wresting some advanced forms of legislation from one or the other of the old parties  but the deeper change was one which judge brown and a few of the progressive men had only just dimly perceived the war and the issues of the war were slowly drawing off the militant was being lost in the problems of the industrial each year a larger mass of people practically said the issues of today are not the issues of twentyfive years ago the bloody shirt is an anachronism  here and there a young man coming to maturity caught the spirit of the new era and turned away from the talk of the solid south and addressed himself to a consideration of the questions of taxation and finance these men formed a growing power in the state and chafed under the restraint of their leaders  and above all death the great pacificator unlooser of bonds and aider of progress was doing his work the old men were dying and carrying their prejudices with them while each year thousands of young voters to whom the war was an echo of passion sprang to the polls and faced the future policy of the parties not their past not only all over the state of iowa but all over the west they were silent factors in many cases kept so by the allcompelling power of party ties but they represented a growing power and they were to become leaders in their turn  this spreading radicalism reached bradley in the quiet of his life in iowa city the young fellows in the school were debating it with fierce enthusiasm and several of them capitulated they all recognized that the liquor question once out of the way the tariff was the next great state issue at the judges suggestion bradley did not return to rock river during vacation but spent the time reading with a prominent lawyer of the town who had a very fine law library  he did not care to return particularly for the quiet studious life he led almost lonely had grown to be very pleasant to him he read a great deal outside his law and enjoyed his days as he had never done before unconsciously he had fallen into a mode of life and a habit of thought which were unfitting him for a politicians career he gave very little thought to that however his ambition for the time had taken a new form he wished to be well read to be a scholar such as he imagined miss wilbur to be  he began reading for that purpose and kept at it because he really had the literary perception he wrote to her of his reading and when in her reply she mentioned some book which he had not read he searched for it and read it as soon as possible in this quiet way he spent his days the happiest he had ever known  he had just two disturbing factors one was netties relation to him and the other was his desire to see miss wilbur nettie wrote quite often at first letters all very much alike and very short sending love and kisses she was not a good letter writer and even under the inspiration of love could not write above two pages of repetitious matter its dreadfully hard work to write she kept saying i wish you was to home when are you coming back  it was very curious to see the different way in which he came to the writing of letters to these two persons  dear nettie he would begin with a scowling brow i cant write any oftener because in the first place im too busy and in the second place nothing happened here that you would care to hear about i dont know when ill be home i ought to finish my course here no i dont expect you to mope i expect you to have a good time go to parties and dances all you want to  but when miss wilburs letters arrived he devoured them with tremulous eagerness and sat up half the night writing an elaborate answer while netties letters lay unanswered for days  miss ida wilbur dear miss that was the way he addressed her he was afraid to call her dear miss wilbur it seemed a little too familiar in the body of his letters there was no expressed word of his regard for her it was only put indirectly into the length of his letters and was shown in the eager promptness of his reply she wrote kindly scholarly replies giving him a great deal to think about her letters were very far apart however as she was moving about so much she advised him to read the modern books  im always on the wrong side of everything she wrote once so im on the side of the modern novel i champion mr howells are you reading his story in the century i like it because it isnt like anybody else and mr cable too you should read and henry james and miss jewett theyre all of this modern school that most western people know nothing about the west is so afraid of its own judgments my friends go about praising the classics because they know its safe to do so i suppose while i am an image breaker to them mr howells says the idea of progress in art does not admit of the conception that any art is finished just like the question of social advance there is always new work to be done and new victories to be won  but more often she wrote upon economic subjects as being more impersonal and then her wish to make bradley a reformer was greater than her desire to make him a lover of modern art  the spirit of reform is beginning to move over the face of the great deep she wrote at another time no one who travels about as i do can fail to see it the labor question in the cities and the farmer question in the country will soon be the great disturbing factors in politics the protective theory will go down it is based on a privilege and the new war like the old war is going to be against all kinds of special privileges  it was with a peculiar feeling of pain and relief that he read miss wilburs renunciation of her homemarket idea it seemed as if something sweet and fine had gone with it and yet it strengthened him for he had come to believe that a homemarket built up by legislation was unnatural and a mistake judge browns constant hammerings had left a mark  he wrote to her something of his hesitation and she replied substantially that there was no abandonment of the homemarket idea only the method of bringing it about had changed she had come to believe in what was free and natural not what was artificial and forced  if you will study the past she went on you will find that advance in legislation has always been in the direction of less law less granting of special privileges take the time of the stuarts for example when the king granted monopolies in the sale of all kinds of goods it is abhorrent to us and yet i suppose those protected merchants believed their monopolies to be rights slowly these rights have come to be considered wrongs and the people have abolished them so all other monopolies will be abolished when people come to see that it is an infringement of liberty to have a class of men enjoying any special privilege whatever the way to build up a homemarket is to make our own people able to buy what they want  there never was a time when our own people were not too poor to buy what they wanted goods lie rotting in our eastern factories and we export many products which the farmer would be very glad to consume if he were able the farmer is poor but it isnt because he needs protection it isnt because he doesnt produce enoughits because what he does produce is taken from him by bankers and corporations  bradley read her letters over and over again every word which she uttered had more significance than words from any one else she seemed a marvellous being to him he looked eagerly in every letter for some personal expression but she seemed carefully to avoid that and though his own letters were filled with personalities she remained studiously impersonal she replied cordially and kindly but with a reserve that should have been a warning to him but he would not accept warnings nowhe was too deeply moved under the influence of her letters he developed a tremendous capacity for work the greatest stimulus in the world had come to him and remained with him if it should be withdrawn at any time it would weaken him he did not speculate on that     xv  home again with the judge   the day that came to close his work at iowa city had something of an awakening effect in it the mere motion of the train brought back again in intensified form the feelings he had experienced on the day he left rock river life was really before him at last his studies were ended and he was prepared for his entrance into law he looked forward to a political career indefinitely he left that in the hands of the judge  it was in june and the country was very beautiful groves heavy with foliage rivers curving away into the glooms of bending elm and basswood trees fields of wheat and corn alternating with smooth pastures where the cattle feda long panorama of glorified landscape which his escape from manual labor now enabled him to see the beauty of its associations of toil and dirt no longer acutely painful  he thought of the june day in which he had first met miss wilburjust such a day then he thought of nettie with a sudden twinge she had not written for several weeks he really didnt remember just when she had written last he wondered what it meant was she forgetting him he hardly dared hope for it it was such an easy way out of his difficulty  the judge met him at the depot with a carriage there were a number of people he knew at the station but they did not recognize him his brown beard had changed him so and his silk hat made him so tall  right this way colonel said the judge in a calm nasal he was filled with delight at bradleys appearance he shook hands with dignified reserve all for the benefit of the crowd standing about you paralyzed em he chuckled as they got in and drove off that beard and hat will fix em sure i was afraid you wouldnt carry out my orders on the hat  the hat was an extravagance for your benefit alone it goes into a bandbox tomorrow replied bradley hows mrs brown  quite well thank you little older of course she caught a bad cold somewhere last winter and she hasnt been quite so well since we keep a girl now i forced the issue mrs brown had done her own work so long she considered it a sort of high treason to let any one else in  mrs brown met him at the door and she looked so good and motherly and there was such a peculiar wistful look in her eyes that he put his arm around her in a sudden impulse and kissed her it made her lips tremble and she was obliged to wipe her glasses before she could see him clearly supper was on the table for him and she made him sit right down  how that beard changes you bradley i would hardly have known you what will nettie think  how is nettie  havent you heard from her lately  not for some weeks  then i suppose the neighborhood gossip is true he looked at her inquiringly and she went on studying his face carefully they say shes soured on you and is sweet on her fathers new bookkeeper  bradley took refuge in silence as usual his face became thoughtful and his eyes fell  ive hoped it was true bradley because she was no wife for you youd outgrown her and shed be a drag about your neck i see her out riding a good deal with this young fellow hes just her sort so i guess she isnt heartbroken over your absence  there was a certain shock in all this he recurred to his last evening with her when in her paroxysm of agony she had thrown herself at his feet much as he had desired such an outcome it puzzled him to find her in love with some one else it was not at all like books  well mrs brown what do you think of my junior partner said the judge coming in and looking down on bradley with a fatherly pride  i suppose mr brown you refer to our adopted son  bradley dressed for church the next day with a new sort of embarrassment he felt very conscious of his beard and of his tailormade clothes for he knew everybody would observe any change in him he knew he would be the object of greater attention than the service but he determined to go and have the whole matter over at once  the windows were open and the sound of the bell came in mingled with the scent of the sunlit flowers the soft rustle of the maple leaves and the sound of the insects in the grass his heart turned toward miss wilbur now whenever any keen enjoyment came to him instinctively turned to her with the wish that she might share his pleasure with him he sat by the open window dreaming until the last bell sounded through the heavy leafscented air  wont you go to church with me judge he said going out  the judge turned a slow look upon him he was seated on the shady porch his feet on the railing a chicago daily paper in his lap he said very gravely mrs brown our boy is going to church  cant you let him mr brown itll do him good maybe said mrs brown who was at work near the window  goes to see the girls know all about it myself go ahead young man and remember the text now or well put a stop to thisbradley went off down the walk he passed by a tiny little box of a house where a man in his shirt sleeves was romping with some children  hello milton called bradley cheerily  the young man looked up his face flashed into a broad smile hello brad talcott by thunder well well whend you get back  last night yours he inquired nodding toward the children  yep well how are you old man you look well couldnt fool me with that beard come in and sit down wont yeh  no im on my way to church cant you come  great cæsar no not with these young hyenas to attend to he had grown fat and his chin beard made him look like a methodist minister but his sunny blue eyes laughed up into bradleys face just as in the past say he exclaimed you struck it with the old judge didnt you hes goin to run you for governor one of these days county treasurer aint good enough for you but say he said as a final word i guess youd better not wear that suit much its too soft altogether stop in when you come back eileenll be glad to see you he called after him  the audience had risen to sing as he entered and he took his place without attracting much attention as he stood there listening to the familiar moody and sankey hymn there came again the touch of awe which the church used to put upon him he was not a religious man he had no more thought of his soul or his future state than a powerful young greek his feeling of awe arose from the association of beauty music and love with a church it was feminine some way and shared his reverence for a beautiful woman  the churches of the town were the only things of a public nature which had any touch of beauty or grace they were poor little wooden boxes at best and yet they had colored windows which seemed to hush the dazzling summer sun into a dim glory transfiguring the shabby interior and making the bent heads of the girls more beautiful than words can tell it was the one place which was set apart for purposes not utilitarian and a large part of what these people called religious reverence was in fact a pathetic homage to beauty and poetry and rest  when they all took their seats and while the preacher was praying bradley was absorbing the churchy smell of fresh linen buoyant perfumes camphor cinnamon violets rose and the hot sweet odor of newlymown grass lying under the sun just outside of the windows the wind pulsed in through the halfswung window a bee came buzzing wildly along a butterfly rested an instant on the window sill and the preacher prayed on in an oratorical way for the various departments of government  bradley felt a sharp eye fixed upon him and turning cautiously caught nettie looking at him she nodded and smiled in her audacious way two or three of the young fellows saw him and nodded at him but mainly the people sat with bowed heads feeling some presence that was full of grace and power to banish for a short time at least the stress of the struggle to live  the young fellows were mainly in the back seats and while they were decorously quiet it was evident that they had very little interest in the prayer death and hell and the grave why should one trouble himself about such things when the red blood leaped in the heart and the june wind was flinging a flickering flight of leaf shadows across the window pane there sat the girls with roguish eyes the rounded outline of their cheeks as tempting as peaches displayed with miraculous skill at just their most taking angle their sunday gowns and gloves and hats transfigured them into something too dainty and fine to be touched and yet every glance and motion was an invitation and a lure  here was the proper function of the church to enable these young people to see each other at their best and to bring into their sordid lives some hint at least of music and beauty  bradley did not hear the sermon he was wondering just what netties smile meant and what he was going to say to her he was not subtle enough to take a halfway or an ambiguous stand he must either treat her tenderness as a forgotten thing or hold himself to his promise as something which he was under orders from his conscience to fulfill  when the service was over he went out into the anteroom with the young fellows who were anxious to meet him quite a number of farmers were in from the country and they all crowded about shaking his hand with great heartiness he moved on with them to the sidewalk where many of the congregation stood talking in groups the women came by in their starched neatness leading rebellious boys in torturing suits of winter thickness topped with collars stiff as sauce pans while the little girls walked as upright as dolls looking disdainfully at their sulking brothers some of the merchants passing by discussed the sermon some talked about crops with the farmers and those around bradley dipped into the political situation guardedly  while he was talking to some of the town people he saw nettie come up and join a young man at the door whom he had recognized as the tenor in the choir and they sauntered off together under the fullleafed maplesshe in dainty white and pink he in a miraculously modish suit of gray a rose in his lapel bradley looked after them without special wonder it was only as he went back to his room that he began to see how fully nettie had outgrown her passion for him                                                 he met her the next day as he was going home from the office  hello bradley she said without blushing though her eyes wavered before his  he held out his hand with a frank smile hello nettie which way are you going  going home now been up to the grocery want to go long  i dont mind how are you anyway  oh im all right say that beard of yours makes you look as funny as old fun  does it he said  you bet it makes you look old enough to go to congress say heard from radbourn lately bradley shook his head well i havent but lily has hes writingwriting for the newspapers she said  is that so i havent heard it  ehuh say do you know lilys all bent on him yet funny aint it i aint that way am i she ended with her customary audacity  no its out o sight out o mind with you he replied with equal frankness  oh not quite so bad as that aint yeh comin in they were at the gate  guess not you remember your fathers command i must never darken his door  she laughed heartily i guess that dont count now  dont it well some other time then  all right but gimme that basket goin to lug that off with you     xvi  nomination   on the monday evening following bradleys return there was quite a gathering at robies along about sundown colonel peavy and judge brown came down together and ridings and deering were there also seated comfortably under the awning in mild discussion with robie who had taken the side of free trade to be contrary as deering said  no sir i take that side for its right there was something sincere in his reply and ridings stared  how long since  about a week  whats got into yeh anyhow  a little horse sense said robie ive been a readin the other side an if a few more of yehd do the same youd lose some of your damn pigheaded nonsense the democrats cheered but the republicans stared at robie as if he had suddenly become insane  well ill be dinged said smith his brotherinlaw id like to know what youd been a readin to make a blazin old copperhead of you  robie held up two or three tracts the judge took them looked them over and read the titles out loud to the wondering crowd  the power of money to oppress free trade philosophy the money question the right to the use of the earth by herbert spencer land and labor library progress and poverty by henry george  oh so youve got hold of spencer and george have you said the judge  no theyve got hold f me  spencer said smith in vast disgust what the hell has he to do with it the rest sat in silence the occasion was too momentous for jokes  whered you get hold o these said the judge fingering the leaves  radbourn sent em out  ill bet yeh if there was a rank rotten book anywhere on gods green footstool that fellerd have it said smith  the judge ruminated well if thats the effect guess ill circulate a few copies mong the young republicans of the county gentlemen this is our year  youve been a sayin that for ten years judge said ridings  and its been a comin all the time gentlemen i tell you ive had my ear to the ground and theres something moving the river is shifting its bed look out for a flood im going to make an entirely new move this fall im going to put up a man for legislature thatll sweep the county and youll all vote for im too hes young hes got brains hes an orator and he cant be bought  robie brought his fist down on the counter in an excitement such as he had never before manifested brad talcott well elect him sure as hell  amos hastened to put in a word brads a republican  hes a free trade republican said the judge quietly  how do yeh know  oh i know havent i been a workin im for these last two years did you expect a man to live with me and not become inoculated with the simonpure jeffersonian democracy  i dont believe it amos replied and i wont till i hear him say so himself i want to see him go to des moines but i want to see him go as a republican  well you attend the independent convention next week and youll hear something thatll set you thinking your grange is losing force you failed to elect your candidate last year now if we put up a man who is a farmer and a clean mana man that can sweep the county and carry rock riverwhy not join in and elect him  the railroad interest was the great opposing factor and the judge who was a great politician had calculated upon a fusion of the farmer republicans and the democrats he was really the ablest man in that part of the state and could wield the democratic party like a pistol he succeeded in getting amos councill jennings and a few other leading grangers to sign his call for a peoples convention to nominate county officers and the member of the legislature it really amounted to a union of the independent republicans and the young democrats  the old liners however were there and set out from the first to control the convention as was shown in the opening words of the chairman old man colwell whom the judge had kindly allowed in the chair in order that he might have a chance to speak on the floor  this is a great day for us said the chairman weve waited a long time for the people to see that republican rings were sapping the foundations of political honesty but they see it now this crowded convention fellowcitizens shows that the deathless principles of jacksonian democracy still slumber under the ashes of defeat  he went on in this strain calmly taking to himself and the other old mossbacks as young mason contemptuously called them all the credit of the meeting and bespeaking at the same time all the offices  following this intimation colonel peavy presented a slate wherein all the leading places on the ticket had been given to the men who stood so long for the principles of jackson and jefferson it was fitting that these men should be honored for their heroic waiting outside the gates of emolument  young mason was on his feet in an instant mr chairman he said penetratingly  mr mason  while i appreciate sir the fortitude the patience of the men who have been waiting outside the gates of emolument so long i want to say distinctly that if that slate is not broken well all wait outside the gates of emolument twenty years longer but i want to say further mr chairman that the strength of this new movement is in its freedom from spoilsseeking is in its independence from the old party lines its strength is in its appeal to the farmer in its support of his war against unjust tariff and against railway domination its strength also is in its appeal to the young men of this county sir  applause showed that the young orator had his audience with him he was a small man but his voice was magnificent and his oratory powerful selfcontained full of telling points  if we win gentlemen of this convention he said turning we must put at the head of this movement a man who is absolutely incorruptiblea man who can command the granger vote the temperance vote the young mans vote and the independent vote that man  mr chairman snarled colonel peavy rising with impressive dignity and drawing his coat around him with ominous deliberation  colonel peavy acknowledged the chairman  mr chairman shouted young mason i have the floor i deny the right of your recognition of another member while im speaking  mr chairman i rise to a point of information said the colonel  state your point colonel  i would like to ask this young gentleman who holds the floor how many votes he has cast in his whole life  young mason colored with anger but his voice was cool and decisive for the gentlemans information mr chairman i will say that i have voted once but that vote entitles me to stand here as a delegate and i have the floor  the delegates were mainly with young mason and the colonel sat down grimly in the midst of the old guard milton and bradley sitting together rejoiced in the glorious attitude of the young champion who went on  i say mr chairman and gentlemen that we cannot win this election on old party lines im a democrat applause but we are not strong enough as a party in this district to elect and im willing to work with the independents there is just one man who can be elected from this convention he is a young man he is sound on the tariff he is an orator he can sweep the county i present as nominee for our next representative bradley talcott of rock river  bradley sat still stunned by the applause which burst forth at the mention of his name brown had prepared him for the presentation of his name but he had not dared to hope that any considerable number of delegates would support him  judge brown rose to his feet i second the nomination mr chairman i am a democratan old democrat but im damned if im a mossback i don allow any young man to get ahead of me on radicalism i stand for progress and because i know bradley talcott stands for progress i second his nomination his canvass will be an honor to himself and a historical event in this county  amos ridings arose mr chairman i second that nomination as a grangerrepublican i second it because i know brad talcott cant be bought and because i know hes honest in his convictions ill stand by him as long as he stands by principle  this practically brought to bradleys support the winning force for amos was a power in the county somebody called for milton jennings and after some hesitation he got upon his feet  mr chairman im not a delegate to this convention and so it isnt my place to speak here but i want to say that if i was i should second this nomination its a complete surprise to me to have him nominated if i had known of it before i would have been working for him all along im pledged in another direction but if i could honorably withdraw my support from the regular nominee i would do everything i could to elect my old classmate and esteemed colleague  with this boom the vote was wildly enthusiastic the chairman pronounced it unanimous  give us a speech shouted the crowd  young mason leaped up a sardonic gleam in his eye mr chairman i move that colonel peavy and amos ridings escort the nominee to the platform  the motion was put and carried amid laughter as they dragged bradley out of his chair and pushed him up the aisle everybody laughed and cheered william councill kicked the colonel as he went past and robie hit him a sounding slap between the shoulders the colonel bore it all with astonishing good nature as they reached the platform young mason stepped into the aisle and shouted  three cheers for the honorable bradley talcott  with the roar of these cheers in his ears bradley turned and faced his fellowcitizens his knees shook and his voice was so weak he could hardly be heard  fellowcitizens do you know what youre doing he said in a curiously colloquial tone  you bet we do roared the crowd what dye think weve done  youve nominated a man for your legislature who hasnt got a dollar in the world  so much the better the campaign ll be honest shouted young mason  bradleys throat was too full to speak and his head whirled i cant make a speech now gentlemen i am all out o breath all i can say is im very thankful to have such friends and ill try to do my duty in the campaign and in the legislature if im elected  the delegates swarmed about him to shake his hand and promise him their support bradley dazed by the suddenness of it could only smile and grip each mans hand the judge was jubilant had bradley been his son he couldnt have felt more sincerely pleased  well see such a campaign this fall as this county never had he said to everybody a campaign with a principle a campaign that will be educational  bradley had now a greater work before him than he had ever undertaken before he had now to go to his old friends and neighbors in a new light practically as a democrat he had to face audiences mainly hostile to his ideas and defend opinions which he knew not only cut athwart the judgment of the farmers of the county but squarely across their prejudices  but he had something irresistible on his side he was debating a principle he was widening the discussion and he made men feel that he rose above local factions and local questions to the discussion of the principles of justice and freedom he voiced this in his speech of acceptance in the opera house the next day the house was packed to its anteroom with people from every part of the county a curious feeling of expectancy was abroad men seemed to feel instinctively that this was the beginning of a change in the thought of rock river everybody remarked on the change in bradley and his beard made him look so much older  judge brown and dr carver sat on the stage with the speakers young mason and bradley the judge was very dignified but there was an exultant strut in his walk and a special deliberation in his voice which proclaimed his pride in his junior partner he alluded in his dry nasal way to the pleasure it gave him to inaugurate the new era in politics in rock river the liquor question i regard as settled in this state he said and now the discussion of the tariff has free sailing but you dont want to hear us old fellows with our prejudices you want to hear our young leaders with their principles  he introduced young mason who made one of his audacious speeches death is a great friend of youth and progress he said the old men die off thank god and give young men and new principles a chance i tell you friends and neighbors the democratic party is being born againit must be born again in order to be worth saving  when bradley stepped forward he was very pale  friends and fellowcitizens he began after the applause had ended i cant find words to express my feeling for the great honor you have done me i thank the citizens of rock river for their aid but i want to sayim going to run this campaign in the farmers interest because the interests of this county and of this state are agricultural and whatever hurts the farmer hurts every other man in the state there is no war between the town and the country the war is between the people and the monopolist wherever he is whether he is in the country or in the town it is not true that the interests of the town dweller and of the farmer are necessarily antagonistic the cause of the people is the same everywhere its like the condition of affairs between england and ireland people say that ireland is fighting englandfighting the english people but that is not the fact the antagonism is between the irish people and the english landlord so the fight in america is the people against the special privileges enjoyed by a few its because these few generally live in towns that we seem to be fighting the towns  as the judge said weve settled the liquor question in this state it wont come up again unless office seekers drag it up it has been our state issuethat and the railroads and now that is settled we can turn our attention to the finishing up of the railway problem and to the discussion of the tariff  and the money shouted some one abolish the national banks  bradley hesitated a little no we cant do that but we can destroy any special privilege they hold but the first thing that stares us in the face is the war tariff that is eating us up im going to state just what i think in this campaign and you can vote for me or not it is sheer robbery to continue a tariff that was laid at a time when we needed enormous revenue see the surplus piling up in the public vault you say its better to have a surplus than a deficit yes but id rather have the surplus in the pockets of the people this taxing the people to death in order to have a surplus to expend in senseless appropriations is poor policy  in this strain his whole speech ran and it had an electrical effect they cheered him tremendously and the meeting broke up and discussion burst out all over the hall with appalling fury and continued each day thereafter the railroad question and the tariff question began right there to divide the county into two camps the young leader carried the same disturbing influence into every township in which he spoke and the whole county became a debating school it took a position far ahead of the other counties of the state in the questions  men stopped each other and talked from plow to plow across the line fence they met in the road upon dusty loads of wheat and sat hours at a time under the burning august sun to discuss the matter of railroad commissions and the fixing of rates and the question of reducing the surplus in the treasury  the old greenbackers came out of their temporary retirement and helped bradleys cause simply because he was young and a dissenter they were a power for most of them were deeply read on the tariff and on the railroad problem in fact were all round radicals and fluent speakers  judge brown kept out of it i dont want to seem too prominent in this campaign he said to colonel peavey we old mohawks are a damage to any mans campaign just now the time is coming colonel when well help but not now weve set the mischief afoot now let the young fellows and the farmers do the rest of it besides my young man here is quite able to look out for himself all that scares me is hell get too radical even for the democracy one of these days if he does all is well have to build a party up to his principle for hell be right colonel theres no two ways about that     xvii  election   the interest of the election was very great and as the vote of rock river practically settled the contest the centre of interest was the court house which was crowded to suffocation on election night there was a continual jam and a continual change crowds stood around the doorway or moved up and down the sidewalk crowds were constantly running up and down the stairway and crowding in and out the dingy dimly lighted courtroom which was roaring with voices blue with smoke and foul as a dungeonwith tobacco and vitiated breaths  all the men of the town seemed to be present from old man dickey the chicken thief and fisherman to cold aristocratic r f russell the banker rowdyish boys pushed and banged and howled playing at hideandseek among the legs of the men who filled every foot of standing space or were perched on the railings or tables near the judges bench from which the returns were being called the kerosene lamp shed a dim light through the smoke there was no fire and the excited partisans kept their hats and coats on and warmed themselves by wild gestures and stamping  occasionally a boys shrill yell or whistle or some excited democrats calling its a whack ill take yeh rose above the clamor upon the benches piled up along the wall to leave the middle space free groups of the less demonstrative citizens of both parties sat discussing the chances of the different candidates bradley was not there but young mason and milton were considered his representatives and were surrounded by a constant crowd of sympathizers it was about nine oclock at night before the decisive returns began to come in  occasionally the sound of furious pounding was heard and a momentary lull was enforced while the clerk read some telegraphic message or report of a neighboring town while he stood upon the judges bench at about nine oclock the crowd aware in some mysterious way of the arrival of decisive news made a wild surge toward the clerk and shouted for silence while he announced in a high nasal key rock river gives a hundred and ninetyone for kimball two hundred and twentyfive for talcott at this a wild cheer broke forth led by milton and young mason  that means victory said milton  dont be too sure of it wait for cedarville  the reading went on with occasional yells from either the democrats or republicans according to the special quality of the report but it was plain that the most interest was centered in the contest for representative  as the evening wore on messengers clattered up on horseback from other towns of the county and amid yells and cheers were hustled up the stairway through the crowd to the clerk carrying in their hands envelopes filled with election returns these returns from the townships were almost entirely in bradleys favor but cedarville was the decisive vote messengers from the little telegraph station dashed to and fro and the excitement was fanned into greater fury by the accounts of democratic gains from other counties and other states it is a political landslide exclaimed mason the democrats are in it this time  at length there rose the cry of cedarville cedarville and a messenger bearing a telegraph blank was rushed through to the readingdesk where his message was snatched by the clerk again there was a wild surge toward the desk and a silence broken only by derisive cheers from the boys while the clerk glanced over it  cedarville gives seventy votes for kimball and a hundred and ten for talcott  the independents shouted themselves hoarse and flung their caps in the air talcott had carried both of the towns of the county he was sure of the farmers the boys howled like savages and tripped each other over the railings and seats boxed hats punched the men in the back and hid around their legs while the clerk went on with his reading at more and more frequent intervals of reports from other states and districts of the congressional field the oldline democrats were delirious with joy the promised land was in sight  it was about half past twelve oclock when colonel russell conceded bradleys election and two stout men toiled up the stairs bringing his forfeit of two barrels of apples amid wild yells from the crowd they threw the barrels to the floor where they burst and sent northern spys rolling in every direction  then came a wilder roar and scramble that outdid everything that had gone before and a surging mass of struggling men and boys covered the apples they threw themselves upon each others backs they clawed like wildcats barked like wolves they kicked each other out of the way and scratched and mauled each other crushing hats tearing coats bruising shins as fast as one man filled his hands or arms or pockets the others set upon him struck them from his arm snatched them from his hands tore them from his pockets or tripped him headlong to the floor where he rolled in the filthy sawdust under the feet of the crazy mob  the wrestle of starving wild hogs for corn or potatoes could not have been more tumultuous or earsplitting than this ferocious jovial scramble it ceased only when the last apple was secured so that none could snatch it away then began the fusilade of cores and parings shining stovepipe hats were choice game and to throw a core clean through a silk hat was a distinction which everybody seemed to covet in five minutes not a tall hat was to be seen colonel peavy wrapped his handkerchief around his thus drawing upon himself the attack of the entire crowd and he was forced to retreat  then they threw at faces and bald heads the uproar redoubled no one was drunk no one was mad but the scene was furious with mirth it was contagious word spread outside and the whole male population of the town jammed into the stairway and struggled furiously to reach the courtroom where the fun was going on a stranger would have imagined it the loosing of the hordes of hell  in the streets of the town the boys without the slightest care about who was elected were stealing kerosene barrels and drygoods boxes in order to keep the bonfire going when they heard of the free apples which they had missed by their zeal in bonfiring a bitterness came upon them and they came together and tried to organize a committee to go down and see judge brown and state their grievance  at last one desperate young fellow took the lead and the rest marched after he moved off down the street shouting through his closed lips bum bum bum bum bum the rest took up the drumlike cry and marched after him two and two they made straight toward judge browns office where they knew bradley was they halted and raised a great shout  three cheers for the honorable brad and gave them wildly  this brought the judge out and when they saw him they yelled in lugubrious tones as if they were starving apples apples  the judge shouted down all right boys ill send robie up hell roll out all the apples you want the boys gave another cheer and left  bradley sat there in the judges office in a sort of daze he could not say a word his thought was not clear he was not at all anxious somehow he could not feel that it was his fate that was being decided on the contrary it seemed to be some other person he was not excited he was only puzzled and wondering  at last the crowd was heard coming from the court house wild cheers sounded faintly far up the street the sound of a band was heard and the marching of feet rhythmic on the sidewalks there came the sound of rapid footsteps and so familiar was bradley with the sidewalk that he knew exactly where the runners were by the different note given out by each section of planking they were crossing the street now they came across the warped and clattering length before the butcher shop then over the crisp solid planking before robies then came a rush up the stairway and milton and young mason burst into the room  hurrah weve carried you through youre elected sure as guns  three cheers for democracy and progress shouted the judge in high excitement from the open windows they were given with tremendous vigor by the crowd from below and the band struck up hail columbia                                                 it was two oclock when bradley and the judge got away from the crowd and went home to bed they found mrs brown sitting up with the customary thoughtlessness of men neither of them had taken her anxiety into account  well mrs brown are you up  yes mr brown i wanted to hear the news you didnt suppose i could go to bed without it she replied calmly though she was trembling with eagerness  well were elected mrs brown said the judge proudly  she came up to bradley timidly a longing mixed with pride expressed in her face bradley took her in his arms and laid her cheek on his shoulder she stood before him like a mother now he felt her pride in him and she had grown very dear to him     xviii  dont blow out the gas   des moines appeared to bradley to be very great and very noisy it was the largest city he had ever seen he was born in eastern wisconsin on a farm and his early life had been spent far from any populous centre very largely indeed in the timberlands he had been in lacrosse that is to say he changed cars there and rock river and iowa city were the only towns he had ever lived in  he had the preconception that des moines was a fine city but its streets seemed endless to him that cold clear night that he got off the train and walked up the sidewalk he had been told to go right to the windom house because there was the legislative headquarters he walked carrying his valise in his hand and looking furtively about him he knew he ought not to do so but the life about him and the endless rows of vast buildings fascinated himdrew his attention constantly  the portico of the hotel awed him with its red sandstone magnificence and he moved timidly on toward the centre of the rotunda with hesitating and uncertain steps it seemed to be the realization of his imaginings of chicago it subdued him into absolute clownishness and the porter who rushed toward him and took his valise from his hands classified him offhand as another one of those country fellows who must be watched and prevented from blowing out the gas bradley signed his name on the book without any flourishes and without writing the honorable before his name as most of the other members had done  front yelled the clerk in an imperative voice bradley started and then grew hot over his foolishness show this gentleman to no 30 like dinner the clerk asked in a kindly interest bradley nodded suddenly remembering that in fashionable life dinner came at six oclock all ready in about ten minutes the clerk said looking at the clock  bradley followed the boy to the elevator he noticed that the darkey did not enter with him but ran up the stairs he could see him rushing around the curves his hands sliding on the railings he met him at the door of the elevator and motioned to himthis way suh there was something in his tone that puzzled bradley and as he walked along the hall he thought of the soft carpet under his feet it must have been two inches thick and of that tone in the boys voice  a dull fire of soft coal was burning on the grate and the boy punched it up and said nother gent jes left i git some mo coal  the room like all hotel rooms was a desolate place notwithstanding its one or two elaborate pieces of furniture its fine carpet and its easy chair it had a distinctly homeless quality bradley sat down in the big chair before the fire and took time to think it all over he was really here as a legislator for a great state the responsibility and honor of the position came upon him strongly as he sat there alone in this great hotel looking at the fire that he of all the men in his county should have been selected for this office was magnificent he drew a long sigh and said inwardly  ill be true to my trust and he meant in addition to be so dignified and serious that he would not seem young to the other legislators  he was reading from a little frame on the wall the rules of the house when the boy knocked on the door and started away toward the fire so that the boy should not suspect what he had been doing he returned to the reading however after the boy had gone out he read dont blow out the gas without feeling it an impertinence and went over to read the code of signals posted above the bell punch      ring once for bell boy     ring twice for ice water     ring three for fire     ring four for chambermaid  his mind went off in a pursuit of trivial matters concerning this code what would happen if he rang three timeswhich he thought stood for alarm of fire in imagination he heard the outcries throughout the various floors and rooms of the house then his mind went back to the fact that the boy was not allowed to ride in the elevator he wondered if this touch of southern feeling would ever get any farther north for the first time in his life he had met the question of caste  he went down to supper as he called it himself in the diningroom which he found to be a very large and splendid apartment a waiter in a dress coat he had never seen a live figure in a dress coat before met him at the door and with elaborate authority called another darkey in a similar dress coat to show him to a chair  the second darkey led his way down the polished floor which bradley walked with difficulty his coat tails wagging in a curious fashion by reason of the action of his bow legs he was obliged to take the uncomprehending bradley by the arm while he shoved the chair under him but he did it so courteously that no one noticed it he was accustomed to give this silent instruction in ceremonials bradley noticed that notwithstanding the splendor of his shirtfront collar and dresscoat his shoes were badly broken though highly polished  a man sat at the opposite side of the table reading a paper over his coffee he attracted bradleys attention because he had a scowl on his face and his hair was tumbled picturesquely about his forehead even his brown moustache contrived to have an oddly dishevelled look  they ate in silence for some time or rather bradley did the other man read and sipped his coffee and continued to frown and swear under his breath at length he burst forth in a suppressed exclamation well ill be damned when he looked at bradley his eyes were friendly and he seemed to require some one to talk to  these devilish railroads will own the country body and breeches yet  what are they up to now said bradley  theyve secured joe manley as their attorney one of the best lawyers in the state its too cussed bad he looked sad i cant account for it i suppose he got hard up and couldnt stand the pressure i wonder if you know how these infernal corporations capture a state  no but id like to know im down here to fight em  that so from where  from rock county im the representative talcott is my name bradley said seizing an excuse to announce himself  is that so well now im an old cock in the pit and i want to warn you ive known many a fine honest fellow to get involved now ill tell you how its done before you have been here a week some of these railroads will send for you and tell you theyve heard of you as a prominent young lawyer of the state oh theyve heard of you weve all heard of your canvass and as they are in need of an attorney in your county theyd like very much to have you take charge etc of any legislation that may arise there and so on there may not be a weeks work during the year and there may be a great deal etc but they will be glad to pay you six hundred dollars or eight hundred dollars if you will take the position  well well suppose you take it you go back to rock there is very little business for the railroad but your salary comes in regularly you say to yourself that in case any work comes in which is dishonorable youll refuse to take hold of it but that money comes in nicely you marry on the expectations of its continuance you get to depending upon it you live up to it you dont find anything which they demand of you really dishonest and you keep on but really cases of the railroad against the people do come up and your sense of justice isnt so acute as it used to be you manage to argue yourself into doing it if you dont do it somebody else will etc and so you keep on  after an impressive pause during which the speaker gazed in his face he finished suddenly the war of the corporation against the people is on us and you find you are the paid tool of the corporation and that the people are distrustful of you and that you are practically helpless  the man spoke in a low voice but somehow his words had the quality of exciting the imagination bradley thrilled at the picture of moral disintegration hinted at the imaginative tragedy was brought very close to him  do they really do that he asked  thats a part of their plan the proof of it will be in the offer which theyll make to you in less than ten days theyre always on the lookout for such men especially men who have the confidence of the farmers the next war in this state and in the nation is to be a railway war  you think so i think the tariff  what is the tariff compared to the robbery that makes gould and sage and vanderbilt i tell you young man the corporations in this country are eating the life out of it this power of three men to get together steal the privilege from the people and by their joint action to produce a fourth body corpus behind which they hide and push their schemesan intangible something which outlives them allthat is the power that is undermining this government its against the constitution old chief justice marshall in his verdict which ushered in the reign of corporations in this country distinctly said that it was based on usurpation dating back to the stuarts or the georges and the hint in that was that it was unamerican and unconstitutional  bradley perceived that he was in the presence of another reformer like himself he wondered if he seemed so cranky to other men he was interested by the mans evident thought and honesty of purpose and by the sympathy of a city man with a farmers fight  youre with us in our fight against the railroads  the man threw one arm back over the top of his chair and looked at bradley out of his halfclosed eyes of course only youre so damned narrow excuse me you dont see that youve got to kill every corporation every corporation is an infringement of individual rights when three men go into business as a firm they should every one be liable for every contract which they make the creation of an intangible corporate personality is a trick to evade liability make war against the whole system he said rising dont go fooling about with regulating fares and forming commissions declare corporations illegal and let the people know their practices  they went down to the rotunda floor together the electric lights flooded the brilliant marbles with a dazzling light groups of men were gathered around spittoons talking earnestly gesticulating with fists and elaborate broadhand freearm movementspolitical gestures as bradley recognized  these are your colleagues and their parasites said bradleys companion whose name was cargill know any of em  no i dont know any of the legislators  cargill led bradley up to a group which surrounded a gigantic old man who leaned on a cane and gesticulated with his powerful left hand  senator wood let me introduce hon bradley talcott of rock  ah glad to see you sir glad to see you gentlemen this is the young man who made that gallant fight up in rock this is the hon jones of boone mr talcott and this is sam wells of cerro gordo one of the most remorseless jokers in the house look out for him  after shaking hands all about bradley hastened to say dont let me interrupt go on senator i want to listen this made a fine impression on the senator who loved dearly to hear the sound of his own voice he proceeded to enlarge upon his plan for gerrymandering the stateto the advantage of the democratic party of course  in the talk which followed bradley was brought face to face with the fact that these men were more earnest in maintaining the hold of their parties upon the offices than principles of legislation they were not legislators in any instances they were gamesters  now let me tell you something more said cargill as he led his way back to a settee near the wall he drew up a chair for his feet lighted his cigar pulled his little soft hat down to the bridge of his nose put one thumb behind his vest and began in a peculiarly sardonic tone now here is where the legislation really takes placehere and at the iowa house see those fellows he waved his hand in a circle around the rotunda now filled with stalwart men laughing loudly or talking in confidential deeply interested groups with their heads close together there are the supposed lawmakers of the state what do you think of them anyway  bradley was silent he was so filled with new sensations and ideas that he could not talk  cargill mused a little i suppose it all appears to you as something very fine and very important now dont make a mistake the most of these fellows are not even average men i have a theory that take it one ten years with another the legislatures of our country must be necessarily beneath the average because the man who is a thinker or a moralist necessarily represents a minority anyhow these men support my theory dont they  there was a distinct bitterness in his tone that made his words sink deep there was a touch of literary grace also in his phrases quite unlike anything bradley had ever heard you imagine these men honest you say they differ from me honestly but i know there is no question of principle in their action they simply say no 1 first party next and principle last of all i remember how awestruck i was during my first term now dont waste any nervous energy on admiring these men or standing in awe of them jump right in and take care of yourself vote for party but make arrangements before you voteno i forgot you stand for a real principle and success may lie for you in standing by it yes on the whole i believe i would stand by principle it will bring you out in greater relief from the rest of them and then the people may begin to think i doubt it however  you are a pessimist then said bradley feeling that there was an undercurrent of dark philosophy in cargills voice  i am the whole damned thing is a botch in my opinion you may find it different he said with a mocking gleam in his eyes as he rose and walked away bradley did not believe the man meant half he said and yet his bitterness had thrown a sombre shadow over his heart the vista ahead was not quite so bright as it had been except where miss wilbur seemed to walk he longed to go out and find her and tried to content himself with walking up and down the street which seemed incredibly brilliant with its lighted windows and streams of gay young people coming and going  at last he came to a corner where he saw the name of her street upon the lamp post and the hunger to see her was irresistible he rushed up the street with desperate haste he wished he had started sooner it was eight oclock and there was danger that she might be gone out the electric cars hardly diverted him as they came floating weirdly down the linethe trolley invisible the wheels emitting green sheets of light at the crossings  the street grew more quiet as it climbed the hill and at last became quite like rock river with its rows of small wooden houses on each side of the maplelined streets through which the keen wind went hissing the stars glittered through the clear cold air like crystals of green and gold and white fire as he walked along his newly acquired honors fell away from him together with his war for the grange and his ambitious plans displayed their warmer side he began to feel that all he was and was to do must be shared with a woman in order that he could enjoy it himself and he had known for a long time that ida was that woman  his face lifted to the stars as he implored their aid in a vast and dangerous enterprise it meant all or nothing to him he was in the mood to risk all his life and plans that night if she had been with him the strangeness of the city had exalted him to the mood where his timidity was gone  when he came to the house he found it all dark save a dim light in the rear and it made him shiver with a premonition of failure a servant girl answered his ring he had the hope that this was the wrong house after all  can you tell me if miss wilbur lives here  yassir but she nat haar answered the girl with the norwegian accent  where is she  ay nat know ay tank she ees good ways off her moder she ees gawn to churtz  bradley no longer looked at the stars as he walked along the street all his doubts and fears and his timidity and his reticence came back upon him and something warm and sweet seemed to go out of the far vista of his life he felt that he had lost her     xix  cargill takes bradley in hand   cargill was not at the table the next morning but he came in later and greeted bradley brusquely as he flung his rag of a hat on the floor  well legislator what is on the tapis this morning anything i can do for you  no i guess not i am going to look up a new boardinghouse  whats the matter with this  too rich for my blood  just repeat that please  cant stand the expense  cargill poured the cream on his oatmeal before he replied but dear sir nothing is too good for a representative young man you dont seem to know how to farm yourself out  all day saturday the windom rotunda was crowded with men the speakerships the house offices were being contested for here the real battle was being fought here and under cargills cynical comment the scene assumed great significance to bradleys uninitiated eyes they took seats on the balcony which ran around the bear pit as he called it around them flitting to and fro were dozens of bright rather selfsufficient young women  this is one of the most dangerous and demoralizing features of each legislature he said to bradley these girls come down here from every part of the state to cajole and flatter their way into a state house office you see them down there buttonholing every man they can get an introduction to and some of them dont even wait for an introduction theyd be after you if you were a republican  bradley looked out upon it all with a growing shadow in his eyes he suddenly saw terrible results of this unwomanly struggle for office he saw back of it also the need for employment which really forced these girls into such a contest  they soon learn cargill was saying where their strength lies the pretty ones and the bold ones succeed where the plain and timid ones fail it has its abuses good god how could it be otherwise its a part of our legislative rottenness legal labor pays so little and vice and corruption pay so well now see those two girls buttonholing that leprous old goat bergheim if it dont mean ruin to them both it will be because theyre as knowing as he is every year this thing goes on what the friends and parents of these girls are thinking of ill be damned if i know  bradley was dumb with the horror of it all he had such an instinctive reverence for women that this scene produced in him a profound almost despairing sorrow he sat there after cargill left him and gazed upon it all with stern eyes there was no more tragical thing to him than the woman who could willingly allure men for pay it made him shudder to see those bright pretty girls go down among those men whose hard peculiar savage stare he knew almost as well as a woman  they did not know that he was a legislator and he escaped their importunities but he overheard several of them as they came up with some membersometimes a married manand took seats on the balcony near him  but you had no business to promise miss jones how could you when i was living  but i didnt know you then  well then now youve seen me you can tell miss jones your contract dont go laughed the girl  oh that wouldnt do shed kick  leter kick she aint got any people who are constituents my people are your constituents  bradley walked away sick at heart as he passed a settee near the stairway he saw another girl with a childish face looking up at a hardfeatured young man and saying with eager wistful voice her hands clasped oh i hope you can help me i need it so much  her sweet face haunted him because of its suggested helplessness and its danger his heart swelled with an indefinable and bitter rebellion everywhere was a scramble for officeeverywhere a pouring into the city from the farms and villages why was it was he not a part of the movement as well as these girls did it not all spring from the barrenness and vacuity of rural life  bradley went to church for the reason that he had nothing better to do and in order to get as much out of it as possible went to the largest sanctuary in the city the hotels were thronged by men who took little thought of the day the rotunda echoed with roaring laughter and the tramp of feet every new member was being introduced and manipulated but bradley shrank from declaring himself his name b talcott conveyed no information to those who saw it on the register and so he sat aside from the crowd all day untouched by the male lobbyist or the girl office seekers  he went next day according to promise to call at cargills office which was on the fifth floor of a large sixstory building on the main street there were two ornamental groundglass doors opening from the end of a narrow hall one was marked bergen  cargill commission merchants private and bradley entered a man seated at a low table was operating a telegraphic machine he was in his shirt sleeves and wore blue checked oversleeves and carried a handkerchief under his chin to keep his collar from getting soiled he sat near two desks which separated the private room from the larger room in which were seated several men looking at one side of the wall which was a blackboard checked off in small squares by red lines columns of figures in chalk were there displayed  cargill did not seem to be about and the busy operator did not see the visitor a brisk young man of scandinavian type was walking about in the larger office with a piece of chalk in his hand he came to the desk and looked inquiringly at bradley who started to speak but the sonorous voice of the operator interrupted him  three eighths bid on wheat he called and handed a little slip of paper to the brisk young man with the flaxen mustache  wheat three eighths he repeated in a resonant tone and proceeded to put the figures in a small square under the section marked wheat on the blackboard when he came back bradley asked for cargill  hell be in soon take a seat  three eighths bid they still hammer the market as they sold short shouted the operator  bergen repeated the telegram to the crowd of course theyll do that said one of the smokers a young man with an assumption of great wisdom on all matters relating to wheat he looked prematurely knowing and spit with a manly air  as bradley took a seat at the desk bergen was calling into the telephone in a high sonorous monotonous voice wheat opened at ninetythree three quarters sold as high as ninetyfour is now ninetythree and three eighths corn opened at fortytwo is now fortyone and seven eighths bradstreets decrease on both coasts the past week two and a quarter millions cables very strong  cargill came in a little later and greeted bradley with a nod while crossing the room to look at the blackboard  draw up a chair he said and they took a seat at the table while the business of the office went on youll be interested in knowing something about this business he said to bradley its as legitimate as buying or selling real estate on a commission but so far as the popular impression goes there is no difference between this and a bucketshop  its all very new to me said bradley i dont know the difference between this and the bucketshop  ninetythree and seven eighths bid on wheat called bergen from a slip as he walked back and chalked the latest intelligence upon the board  well there is a difference in this case we simply buy and sell on commission these are real purchases and sales the order for wheat is transmitted to chicago and registered and has its effect upon the market whereas in a bucketshop the sale does not go out of the office and if there is a loss to the customer the proprietor gains it in other words we buy and sell for others with no personal interest in the sale the bucketshop is a pure gambling establishment where men bet on what other men are going to do but that aint what i had you call to talk over i want you to meet bergen chris come over here he called i want to introduce the honorable talcott of rock river hes started in like yourself to reform politics  the reason why i wanted you to meet bergen cargill went on is because he is a sincerer lover of literature than myself and like yourself i imagine believes thoroughly in the classics hes translating ibsen for the square table club his idea of amusement aint mine i neednt say  new york still hammers away on the market partridge quietly buying to cover on the decline  excuse me a moment said bergen returning to business  cargill took an easy position i dont know why i have sized you up as literary in general effect but i have thats one reason why i took to you its so damned unusual to find a politician that has a single idea above votes and then im literary myself he said his face a mask of impenetrable gravity i wrote up the sheep industry of iowa for the agricultural encyclopædia that puts me in the front rank of des moines literary aspirants  towns like this he said going off on a speculative side track have a twopercent population who are inordinately literary they recognize my genius the other ninetyeight per cent dont care a continental damn for shakespeare or anybody else barring mary jane holmes of course and the fivecent story papers but literary des moines is literary they stand by shakespeare and homer i can tell you and they recognize genius when they see it by the way bergen he said calling his brotherinlaw to him again we must make this young man acquainted with our one literary girl  wheat is ninetyfour bid new york strong it was impossible to hold bergens attention however with a sharp bulge on the market and cargill was forced to turn to bradley again  there is a girl in this town who has the literary quality true she has recognized my ability which prejudices me in her favor of course in turn i presented her with my report on the sheep industry  bradley laughed but cargill proceeded as if there were nothing funny in the situation  and she read it actually and quoted it in one of her great speeches it made the reporter bug out his eyes he said he had observed of late quite a vein of poetry running through miss wilburs speeches which lifted them out of the common rut  bradley lost sight of the humor in this speech at the sound of idas name and his face flushed he had not heard her name spoken by a third person in months and had never dared to say it out loud himself  cargill went on shes an infernal heretic and suffragist and all that but shes a power her name is wilburida wilbur used to lecture for the grange or something of that kind is still lecturing i believe but the grange has snuffed out  six or eight men came into the larger room talking loudly and excitedly about the market and cargills attention was drawn off by the resonant reports of the chicago market  the market shows great elasticity western advices contribute to the bull feeling  do you know miss wilbur bradley asked when cargill came back being afraid cargill might forget the topic of conversation  yes i meet her occasionally i meet her at the square table club where we fight on literature they call it the square table club because they disagree with the opinions of the most of us real literary people of the town  bradley managed to say in a comparatively firm tone of voice that he had heard of miss wilbur as a grange lecturer and that he would like to know more about her  well ill introduce you she aint very easy to understand she is one of these infernal advanced women now i like thinkers but what right has a woman to think to think is our manly prerogative im free to admit that we dont exercise it to much better advantage than we do our prerogative to vote but then damn it how could we stand wives that think  bradley had given up trying to understand when cargill was joking and when he was in earnest he knew this was either merciless sarcasm or the most pigheaded bigotry anyhow he did not care to say anything for fear of drawing him off into a discussion of an impersonal subject just when he seemed likely to tell something about idas early life  it was a singular place to receive this information he sat there with his elbow on the desk leaning his head on his palm studying cargills face as he talked over at the other end of the room the operator was feeding himself on a pickle with his left hand and receiving the telegrams from the faroff roaring tumultuous wheat exchange every repeated message being a sort of distant echo of the ocean of cries and the tumult of feet in the city they were as much alone and talking in private as if they were in cargills own room at the hotel cargill talked on unmindful of the telephone the telegraphic ticking and the brisk businesslike action of his partner  yes i have known her ever since she was a girl her father was a queer old seed of a farmer just out of town here cranky on religiona universalist i believe had the largest library of his town i dont know but the largest private library outside of a city in the state his house was literally walled with books how he got em i dont know it was currently believed that he was full of information but i never heard of any one who was able to get very much out of him his wife had been a beauty that was her dowry to her daughter  the girl went to school here at sixteen i was a student then six or seven years older than she and i remember there were about six of us who used to stand around the schoolhouse door to carry her books for her but she just walked past us all without a turn of the head she didnt seem to know what ailed us she was one of these girls born all brains some way i never saw her face flushed in my life and her big eyes always made me shiver when she turned them on me  wheat falls to ninetythree and a fourth there is a break in the market new york is still hammering called the operator his mouth full of pie  cargill was distinctly talking to himself almost as much as to bradley the hardness had gone out of his eyes and his voice had a touch of unconscious sadness in it  does miss wilbur live here bradley asked to start him off again  yes she went into the grange when she was eighteen just after she graduated from our university here had a good deal of your enthusiasm i should judge expected to revolutionize things some way i dont take very much interest in her public work but i thoroughly appreciate her literary perception he had got back to his usual humor  chris when does the club meet next  friday night i believe  all right ill take you up and introduce you into the charmed circle they pride themselves on being modern up there though i dont see much glory in being modern  bradley stood for a moment at the door looking at this strange scene it appealed to him with its strangeness and its suggestion of the great battles on the street which he had read of in the papers the telegraph machine clicked out every important movement in chicago and new york the manager called up his customers and bawled into the telephone the condition of the market and the significant gossip of the faroff exchange halls it was so strange and yet so familiar that he went away with his head full of those cabalistic sentences  new york still hammering away partridge quietly buying to cover on the decline     xx  at the state house   that the invitation to attend the square table club overshadowed the importance and significance of bradleys entrance into public life was an excellent commentary upon his real character the state house however appealed to his imagination very strongly as he walked up its unfinished lawn amid the heaps of huge limestone blocks his eyes upon the looming façade of the west front he walked the echoing rotunda with a timid air and the beautiful soaring vault was so majestic in his eyes he wondered if washington could be finer there were a few other greenhorns like himself looking the building over with the same minute scrutiny he entered all of the rooms into which it was possible to penetrate and at last into the library a cheerful rectangular room into which the sun streamed plenteously  there was hardly any one in either the senate or the representative halls except farmerlike groups of people sometimes a family group of four or five including the grandmother or grandfather they were mainly in rough best suits of gray or ostentatiously striped cassimere the young men wore wide hats pushed back in some cases to display a smooth curling wave of hair carefully combed down over their foreheads he was able to catalogue them by reference to his old companions ed blackler shep watson sever anderson and others  soon the crowds thickened and groups of men entered talking and laughing loudly they were wholly at their ease being plainly old and experienced members they greeted each other with boisterous cries and powerful handshaking  hello stineberg i hoped youd git snowed under back again eh  well ill be damned aint your county got any more sense than to send such a specimen as you back why werent you around to the caucus  bradley stood around awkwardly alone not knowing just what to do perhaps some of these men would be glad to see him if they knew him but he could not think of going to introduce himself being new in politics there was not a man there whose face he recognized the few that he had met at the hotel were not in sight he felt as if he had been thrust into this jovial company and was unwelcome  the house was called to order by one of the members of the capital county and prayer was offered he sat quietly in his seat as things went on the session adjourned after electing temporary speaker clerk etc bradley felt so alien to it all that he scarcely took the trouble to vote and when the committee on credentials was appointed he felt nervously in his pocket to see that his papers were safe he felt very much as he used to when as a boy he went to have his hair cut and sat in torture during the whole operation in the fear that his quarter all he had with him might be lost and trembling to think what would happen in such a case  that night he moved to a new boardingplace he secured a room near the capitol and went to supper in a small private house near by which had a most astonishing amplitude of diningroom he felt quite at home there for the food was put on the table in the good old way and passed around from hand to hand the mashed potato tasted better piled high with a lump of butter in the top of it and the slices of roast beef outspread on the platter enabled him to get the crisp outside if it happened to start from his end of the table there were judges and generals and senators and legislators of various ranks all about him crude rough wholesome fellows most of them with big brawny hands like his own and loud hearty voices it was impossible to stand in awe of a judge who handled his knife more deftly than his fork and spooned the potato out of the big earthenware dish with a resounding slap he began to see that these men were exactly like the people he had been with all his life he argued however that they were perhaps the poorer and the more honorable part of the legislature  he wrote a note to judge brown telling him that he was settled but was taking very little part in the organizing of the house he did not say that he was disappointed in his reception but he was his vanity had been hurt his canvass had attracted considerable attention from the democratic press of the country and he expected to be received with great favor by them he had come out of republicanism for their sake and they ought to recognize him he did not consider that no one knew him by sight and that recognition was impossible  he was at the capitol again early the next morning and found the same scene being reenacted straggling groups of roughlydressed farmers loitered timidly along the corridors brisk clerks dashed to and fro and streams of men poured in and out the doors of the legislative halls bradley entered unobserved and took a seat at the rear of the hall on a sofa he did not feel safe in taking a seat  it was a solemn moment to the new legislator as he stood before the clerk and with lifted hand listened to the oath of office read in the clerks sounding voice he swore solemnly with the help of god to support the constitution and serve his people to the best of his ability and he meant it it did not occur to him that this oath was a shuffling and indefinite obligation the room seemed to grow a little dimmer as he stood there the lofty ceiling rich in its colors grand and spacious to him seemed to gather new majesty just as his office as lawmaker gathered a vast and sacred significance  but as he came back to his seat he heard a couple of old members laugh comin down to save their country theyll learn to save their bacon before their term is up that young feller looks like one of those retrenchment and reform cusses one of the fellers who never want to adjourndown here for business ye know  their laughter made bradley turn hot with indignation  the selection of seats was the next great feature the names of all the members were written upon slips of paper and shaken together in a box while the members stood laughing and talking in the back part of the house a blindfolded messenger boy selected the slips and as the clerk read in a sounding voice the name on each slip the representative so called went forward and selected his seat  bradleys name was called about the tenth and he went forward timidly and took a seat directly in the centre of the house he did not care to seem anxious for a front seat the democratic members looked at him closely and he stepped out of his obscurity as he went forward  a young man of about his own age a stalwart fellow reached about and shook hands my name is nelson floyd i wanted to see you  floyd took the first opportunity to introduce him to two or three of the democratic members but he sat quietly in his seat during the whole session and took very little interest in the speakership contest which seemed to go off very smoothly he believed the speaker implicitly when he stated the usual lie about having no pledges to redeem and that he was free to choose his committee with regard only to superior fitness etc and was shocked when floyd told him that a written contract had been drawn up and signed before the legislature met wherein the principal clerkships had been disposed of to party advantage it was his second introduction to the hypocrisy of officialism  if he had been neglected before he was not now all sorts of people came about him with axes to grind  is this mr talcott ah yes i have heard of your splendid canvasssplendid canvass nowahemid like you to speak a good word for my girl for the assistant clerkship of the ways and means while another wanted his son mr john smith for page  he told them that he had nothing to say about those things i am counted with the democrats anyhow i havent any influence  they patted him on the shoulder and winked slyly oh we know all about that but every word helps you know  going out at the close of the session he met cargill  well legislator how goes it  oh i dont know smoothly i guess ive kept pretty quiet  thats right the republicans have everything in their hands this session  hello cargill called a smooth jovial voice  ah barney talcott this is an excellent opportunity this is barney the great railway lobbyist barney here is a new victim for youtalcott of rock  glad to see you mr talcott  bradley shook hands with moderate enthusiasm looking into barneys face with great interest the lobbyist was large and portly and smiling his moustache drooped over his mouth and his chin had a jollylooking hollow in it his hazel eyes once frank and honest were a little clouded with drink  cargill is an infernal old cynic he exclaimed and he is corporation mad dont size us up according to his estimate  it did not seem possible that this man could be the great tool of the railway interest and yet that was his reputation  cargill moralized on the members as they walked on barneys on his rounds getting hold of the new members he scents a corruptible man as the buzzard does carrion every session young fellows like you come down here with high and beautiful ideas of office and start in to reform everything and end by becoming meat for barney and his like there is something destructive in the atmosphere of politics  bradley listened to cargill incredulously these things could not be true these groups of jovial candidlooking men could not be the moral wrecks they were represented he had expected to see men who looked villainous in some way with bloated facesdisreputable beery fellows he had not risen to the understanding that the successful villain is always plausible  when he left the capitol and went down the steps with cargill he felt that he had fairly entered upon the work of his term  now young man said cargill as they parted let me advise you the fight of this session is going to be the people against the corporations there are two positions and only two you take your choice if you side with the corporation your success will be instantaneous you can rig out and board at the richwood and be dined out and taken to see the town saturday nights and retire with a nice little boost and a record to apologize for when you go back to rock river that is you can go in for all that there is in it or you can take your chances with the people  i will take the chances with the people  well now hold on dont deceive yourself the people are a mob yet they are fickle as the flames o hell they dont know what they do want but in the end the man that leads them and stands by them is sure of success  the daily walk down from the capitol was very beautiful as the sun sank low it struck through the smoke of the city and flooded the rotunda of the building with a warm red light which lay along the floor in great streams of gold and warmed each pillar till it glowed like burnished copper at such moments the muddy streets the poor hovels the ugly bricks lost to sight beneath the majesty and mystery of the suntransfigured smoke and the purple deeps of the lower levels out of which the searching pitiless light had gone became a sombre and engulfing flood of luminous darkness  here here cargill said one day when bradley called his attention to the view a man can swear and get drunk and be a politician but when he likes flowers or speaks of a sunset his goose is cooked it is political death     xxi  bradley and cargill call on ida   bradley had come to like cargill very much he was very thoughtful in his haphazard way but not at all like radbourn bradley compared every man he met with radbourn and judge brown and every woman suffered comparison with ida wilbur  he went down to meet cargill on the night of the promised call he found him seated on the small of his back his hands in his pockets his absurd little hat that seemed to partake of his every mood was rolled into a point in front and pulled down aggressively over his eyes he was particularly violent and paid no attention whatever to bradley  no sir i am not a prohibitionist my position is just this if we vote prohibition in iowa the government has no business to license men to sell contrary to our regulations  thats states rights burst in the other man who was trembling with rage and excitement  cargill slowly rose transfixing him with a glare go way now i wont waste any more time on you he said walking off with bradley let me see we were going to the club tonight he looked down at his boots yes they are shined that puts a dress suit on me as he walked along he referred to miss wilbur she is a great woman but she is abnormal from my point of view  why so inquired bradley  well look at the life she leads on the road constantly living at hotels a woman cant hold herself up against such things  it depends upon the woman was bradleys succinct protest against sweeping generalizations  it was crisp and clear and the sound of their feet rang out in the still air as if they trod on glass at every step they talked very little bradley wanted to tell cargill that he had already met miss wilbur but he could not see his way clear to make the explanation cargill was unwontedly silent  the norwegian girl ushered them into a pretty little parlor where a beautiful fire of coal was burning in an open grate while they stood warming their stiffened hands at the cheerful blaze ida entered  mr cargill this is an unexpected pleasure  i wonder how sincere you are in that this is my friend mr talcott  ida moved toward bradley with her hand cordially extended i think we have met before she said  i call him my friend said cargill because he has not known me long enough to become my enemy  that is very good mr cargill sit down wont you please give me your coats she moved about in that pleasant bustle of reception so natural to women  cargill slid down into a chair in his disjointed fashion we came to attend the intellectual sitdown  why that doesnt meet tonight it meets every other friday and this is the other friday  oh is it so much the better we will see you alone  ida turned gravely to bradley mr cargill is not often in this mood i generally draw him off into a fight on mr howells thackeray or scott  she prefers me in armor cargill explained and on horseback my intellectual bowleggedness so to say and my moral squint are less obtrusive at an altitude  ida laughed appreciatively your extraordinary choice of figures would distinguish you among the symbolists of paris she replied  this all seemed very brilliant and droll to bradley and he sat with unwavering eyes fixed upon ida who appeared to him in a new light more softly alluring than everthat of the hostess she was dressed in some loose richcolored robe which had the effect of drapery  when did you get back cargill inquired a little more humanly  yesterday and i am just in the midst of the luxury of feeling at home with no journeys to make tomorrow i have a friend i would like to introduce to you she said rising and going out she returned in a few moments with a tall young lady in street dress whom she introduced as miss cassiday  in a short time cargill had involved miss cassiday in a discussion of the decline of literature which left ida free to talk with bradley it was the most beautiful evening in his life he talked as never before he told her of his reading and of his plans he told her of his election to the legislature  ah that is good she said then we have one more champion of women in our state house  yes i will do what i can he said  i will be here to hear you i am one of the committee in charge of the bill  the firelight fell upon her face flushing its pallor into a beauty that exalted the young farmer out of his fear and reticence they talked upon high things he told her how he had studied the social question since hearing her speak in iowa city he called to her mind great passages in the books she had sent him and quoted paragraphs which touched upon the fundamental questions at issue he spoke of his hopes of advancement  i want to succeed he said in order that i may teach the new doctrine of rights i want to carry into the party i have joined the real democracy i believe a new era has come in our party  i am afraid not she said looking at the fire i begin to believe that we must wait till a new party rises out of the needs of people just as the old freesoil party rose to free the slaves dont deceive yourself about your party in this state it is after the offices just the same as the party you have left they juggle with the tariffs and the license question because it helps them they will drop any question and any man when they think they are going to lose by retaining him they will drop you if you get too radical i warn you she said looking up at him and smiling with a touch of bitterness in her smile i am dangerous my counsel does not keep men in office i belong to the minority i am very dangerous  im not afraid he said thrilling with the intensity of his own voice i will trust human reason im not afraid of youi mean you cant harm me by giving me new thoughts and thats what youve done ever since that day i heard you first at the picnic youve helped me to get where i am  i have she asked in surprise his eyes fell before hers it will be strange if i have helped any one to political success  bradley was silent how could he tell her what she had become to him how could he tell her that she was woven into the innermost mesh of his intellectual fibre  youve taught me to think he said at last you gave me my first ambition to do something  i am very glad she replied simply sometimes i get discouraged i speak and people applaud and i go away and that seems to be all there is to it i never hear a word afterwards but once in a while some one comes to me or writes to me as you have done and that gives me courage to go on otherwise id think people came to hear me simply to be amused  she was looking straight into the fire and the light streaming up along her dress transfigured her into something alien and unapproachable the easy flex of her untrammelled waist was magnificent she had the effect of a statue draped and flooded with color  cargills penetrating voice cut through that sacred pause like the rasp of a saw file he had been listening to his companion till he was full of rebellion he was a bad listener  but what is success why my dear young woman  dont patronize us please ida interposed i speak for poor miss cassiday because shes too timid to rebel nothing angers me more than that tone call us comrades or friends but dont say my dear young woman she was smiling but she was more than half in sober earnest  cargill bowed low and proceeded with scowling brow and eyes halfclosed and fixed obliquely upon ida dear comrades in lifebattle what is success you remember the two lords in lilliput who could leap the pack thread half its width higher  dont drag swift into our discussion ida cried mr cargills a sort of american swift turning to bradley dont let him spoil your splendid optimism there is a kind of pessimism which is really optimism that is to say people who believe the imperfect and unjust can be improved upon they are called pessimists because they dare to tell the truth about the present but the pessimism of mr cargill im afraid is the pessimism of personal failure  there was a terrible truth in this and it drove straight into cargills heart bradley was pleased to see ida dominate a man who was accustomed to master every one who came into his presence there was a look on her face which meant battle she did not change her attitude of graceful repose but her face grew stern and accusing cargill looked at her wearing the same inscrutable expression of scowling attention but a slow flush rising to his face showed that he had been struck hard  there was a moments pause full of intense interest to bradley the combatants were dealing with each other oblivious of every one else  i admire you friend cargill ida went on but your attitude is not right your influence upon young people is not good you are always crying out against things but you never try to help what are you doing to help things  crying out against them he replied curtly  ida dropped her glance yes thats so ill admit that it has that effect or it would if you didnt talk of the hopelessness of trying to do anything dont feel alarmed she said turning to the others mr cargill and i understand each other very well weve known each other so long that we can afford to talk plain  this is the first time she ever let into me so directly cargill explained understand we generally fight on literature or music or the woman question this really is the first encounter on my personal influence im going home to stanch my wounds he rose with a return to his usual manner  ida made no effort to detain them come and see me again mr talcott and dont let mr cargill spoil you  after leaving the house the two men walked on a block in silence facing the wind their overcoats drawn up about their ears  theres a woman i like cargill said when they turned a corner and were shielded from the bitter wind she can forget her sex occasionally and become an intellect most women are morbid on their sex they cant seem to escape it as a man does part of the time they cant rise as this woman does into the sexless region of affairs and of thought  bradley lacked the courage to ask him to speak lower and he went on shes had suitors enough and flattery enough to turn her into a simpering fashionplate but you can not spoil brains what the women want is not votes its brains and less morbid emotions  shes a free woman said bradley  free yes theyd all be free if they had her brains  i dont know about that conditions might still  theyd make their own conditions  thats true it all comes back to a question of human thinking doesnt it  this seemed a good point to leave off the discussion and they walked on mainly in silence though two or three times during the walk cargill broke out in admiration i never saw a woman grow as that woman has thats the kind of a woman a man would never get tired of ive never married he went on with a sort of confession because i knew perfectly well id get sick of my choice but  he did not finishit was hardly necessary perhaps he felt he had gone too far they said goodnight at the door of the windom and bradley went on up the avenue his brain whirling with his new ideas and emotions  ida had rushed away again into the far distance it was utter foolishness to think she could care for him she was surrounded with brilliant and wealthy men while he was a poor young lawyer in a little country town he looked back upon the picture of himself sitting by her side there in the light of the fire with deepening bewilderment he remembered the strange look upon her face as she rebuked cargill he wondered if she did not care for him     xxii  the judge plans a new campaign   the first three or four weeks of legislative life sickened and depressed bradley he learned in that time not only to despise but to loath some of the legislators the stench of corruption got into his nostrils and jovial vice passed before his eyes the duplicity the monumental hypocrisy of some of the leaders of legislation made him despair of humankind and to doubt the stability of the republic  he was naturally a pureminded simplehearted man and when one of the leaders of the moral party of his state was dragged out of a low resort drunk and disorderly in company with a leader of the senate his heart failed him he was ready to resign and go home  trades among the committees came obscurely to his ears hints of jobs getting each day more definite reached him railway lobbyists swarmed about and began to lay their cajoling persuasive hands upon members and he could not laugh when the newspaper said for a joke that the absentminded speaker called the house to order one morning by saying agents of the k c  q will please be in order it seemed too near the simple fact to be funny the school book lobby the university lobby the armour lobby each had its turn with him through its smooth convincing agent  he reached his lowest deep one night after a conversation with lloyd smith an exclerk and a couple of young fellows who called upon him at his room lloyd noticed his gloomy face and asked what the trouble was he told them frankly that he was disgusted  oh youll get used to it the exclerk said when i first went into the house i believed in honesty and sincerity like yourself but i came out of my term of office knowing the whole gang to be thieves my experience taught me that legislators in america think its a christian virtue to break into the government treasury  the others broke out laughing believing him to be joking but there was a ferocious look on his face and bradley felt that he might be mistaken but he was not joking  they stole stationery spittoons waste baskets by god they stole everything that was loose and at the end of the term they seemed to be looking around unsatisfied and i told em there was just one thing leftthe gold leaf on the dome  the others roared with laughter and bradley was forced to join in but the face of the exclerk did not lose its dark intensity  take salary grabbing why they wanted me to certify to their demands for sunday pay for themselves and their clerks and i refused and they were wild im not an angel nor a christian man but i wont sign my name to a lie and blamed if they didnt pass the order without my signature yes sir its there on the record  take nepotism the members bring their wives and daughters down here put them in as pages and clerks or divide the proceeds when they have no relatives every device every imaginable chicanery every possible scheme to break into the state money box is legitimate in their eyes and worthy of being patented public money is fair game and yet he said with a change of manner we have the fairest purest and most honorable legislators take it as a whole that there is in the united states because our state is rural and were comparatively free from liquor our legislature is a sunday school compared to the leprous rascals that swarm about the capitol at albany or springfield  what is the cure asked bradley whose mind had been busy with the problem  god almighty there is no cure except the abolition of government government means that kind of thing look at it here we enthrone the hungry vicious uneducated mob of incapables and then wonder why they steal and gorge and riot like satyrs the wonder is they dont scrape the paint off the walls  oh you go too far a legislator wouldnt steal a spittoon  no but the fellow he recommends for clerkship does  my idea is that there are very few men who take money  i admit that but theyll all trade their job for another job honesty is impossible the angel gabriel would become a boodler under our system of government the cure is to abolish government  this conclusion impotent to bradley was practically all the savage critic had to offer either go back to despotism or go ahead to no government at all  after they went out bradley sat down and wrote a letter to judge brown embodying the main part of this conversation its enough to make a man curse his country and his god to see how things run he said at the end of writing out the exclerks terrible indictment i feel that he is right im ready to resign and go home and never go into politics again the whole thing is rotten to the bottom  but as the weeks wore on he found that the indictment was only true of a certain minority but it was terribly true of them but down under the halfdozen corruptible agents under the roar of their voices there were many others speaking for truth and purity the obscure mass meant to be just and honest they were good fathers and brothers and yet they were forced to bear the odium that fell on the whole legislature whenever the miscreant minority rolled in the mire and walked the public streets  there was one count however that remained good against nearly all of the legislators they seemed to lack conscience as regards public money bradley remembered that this dishonesty extended down to the matter of working on the roads in the country he remembered that every man esteemed it a virtue to be lazy and to do as little for a days pay as possible because it came out of the town he was forced to admit that this was the most characteristic american crime to rob the commonwealth was a joke  he ended by philosophizing upon it with the judge who came down in late february to attend the session during the great railway fight  the judge put his heels on the window sill and folded his arms over the problem  well now this thing must be looked at from another standpoint the power of redress is with the voter if the voter is a boodler he will countenance boodling here is the mission of our party he said with the zeal of an oldfashioned democrat to come in here and educate the common man to be an honest man we have got a duty to perform now we mustnt talk of resigning or going out of politics weve got to stay right in the lump and help leaven it it will only make things worse if we leave it the judge had grown into the habit of speaking of bradley as if he were a partner  bradley going about with him on the street suddenly discovered that the judges hat was just a shade too wide in the brim and his coat a little bit frayed around the buttonholes he had never noticed before that the judge was a little oldfashioned in his manners no thought of being ashamed of him came into his mind but it gave him a curious sensation when they entered a car together for the first time and he discovered that the judge was a type  when bradley made his great speech on the railroad question arraigning monopoly the judge had a special arrangement with a stenographer he was going to have that speech in pamphlet form to distribute if it took a leg he was already planning a congressional campaign  ida sat in the balcony on the day he spoke for womans suffrage and he could not resist the temptation of looking up there as he spoke everything combined to give great effect to his speech it was late in the afternoon and the western sun thrust bars of light across the dim chamber which the fresh young voice of the speaker had hushed into silence ida had sent a bunch of flowers to his desk and upon that bouquet the intrusive sunray fell like something wild that loved the rose but as the speaker went on it clambered up his stalwart side and rested at last upon his head as though to crown him with victory  but defeat came as usual the legislators saw nothing in the sunray except a result of negligence on the part of the doorkeeper they all cheered the speech but a majority tabled the matter as usual the galleries cheered and the women swarmed about the young champion ida among them her handshake and smile was his greatest reward  come and see me she said i want to thank you  the judge was immensely proud of him a great speech brad if i wasnt so oldfashioned and setyoud have converted me in private i admit all you say but it aint policy for me to advocate it just now  policy im sick of policy cried bradley lets try being right awhile  the judge changed the subject he told the members at the boardinghouse that it wouldnt hurt bradleys chances people wont down a man on that point any more  perhaps not in your county but i dont want to experiment down in my county said major root of macintosh  i dont believe the people of iowa will down any man for stating what he believes is right  dont bet too high on that said the major in final reply  the judge dined with bradley at the diningroom in the little cottage and it gave bradley great satisfaction to see that he used his fork more gracefully than the supreme judge who sat beside him and better than the senator who sat opposite they had a most delightful time in talking over old legal friends and the judge was beaming as he came to pudding he assured them all that the honorable talcott would be heard on the floor of congress  were the winning party now he said were the party of the future  the others laughed good naturedly dont be too certain of that they all rose you surprised us sleeping on our arms the general said but were awake now and weve got pickets out  the judge enjoyed his visit very much and only once did he present himself to bradley with a suspicious heaviness in his speech he had reformed entirely since he had adopted a son he explained to his old cronies  on the day when the judge was to return as they walked down to the train together he said well brad well go right into the congressional campaign  i dont believe wed better do that judge  why not  well i could not be electedthats one thing  the judge allowed an impressive silence to intervene  why not i tell you young man theyre on the run we can put you through youve made a strong impression down here  i dont believe i want to be put through im sick of it i dont believe im a politician im sick all through with the whole cursed business i neverd be here only for you pulling wires i cant pull wires  you neednt pull wires ill do that you talk and thats what put you here and itll put you in congress  bradley was in a bad mood  whats the good of my going there i cant do anything ive done nothing here  yes y have youve been right on the railroad question on the oleo question and the bank question its going to count that speech of yours yesterday im going to send broadcast in rock county the district convention will meet in june early foster will pave the way for your nomination by saying rock county should have a congressman well go into the convention with a clear twothirds majority and then declare your nomination unanimous you see your youth will be in your favor your election will follow sure the only fight will be in the convention  looks like spring today bradley said it was his way of closing an argument  well goodby youll find the whole pot boiling when you come home the judge said as the train started  as february drew on and the snow fled the earthlonging got hold upon bradley it was almost seed time with its warm mellow soil its sweeping flights of prairie pigeons its innumerable swarms of tiny clamorous sparrows its whistling plovers and its passing wild fowl the thought came to him there for the first time that nature was not malignant nor hard that life on a farm might be the most beautiful and joyous life in the world the meaning of idas words at last took definite and individual shape in his mind he had assimilated them now                                                 bradley gave himself up to the judges plans he went home in april with eagerness and with reluctance he was eager to escape the smoke of the city and reluctant to leave behind him all chance to see ida this feeling of hungry disappointment dominated him during his days ride he had seen her but twice during his stay in des moines and nowwhen would he see her again  this terrible depression and sharp pain wore away a little by the time he reached home and the active campaign which followed helped him to bear it he still wrote to her and she replied without either encouragement and without explicit displeasure the campaign was really the judges fight bradley was his field officer victory in the convention only foreshadowed the sweeping victory in october he resigned as legislator to become a congressman     xxiii  on to washington   in the west as in rural america anywhere the three types of great men in the peoples eyes are the soldier the politician and the minister the whole people appear to revere the great soldier the men admire the successful politician and the women bow down before the noted preacher  these classes of heroworshipers melt into each other of course but broadly they may be said to separately exist in colonial days the minister came first the soldier second the politician last since the revolution the soldier has been the first figure in the triumvirate and in these later times the politician and his organ of voice the newspaper have placed the preacher last  and there is something wholesome in such an atmosphere the atmosphere of the west at least by contrast the worship of political success low as it may seem is less deplorable than the worship of wealth which is already weakening the hold of the middleclass eastern man upon the american idea in the west mere wealth does not carry assurance of respect much less can it demand subservience  bradley never dreamed of getting rich but under radbourn and the judge he had developed a growing love for the orators dominion he hungered to lead men notwithstanding his fits of disgust and bitterness he loved to be a part of the political life of his time it had a powerful fascination for him the deference which his old friends and neighbors paid him as things due a rising young man pleased him  he looked now to washington and it fired his imagination to think of sitting in the hall where the mighty legislators of generations now dead had voiced their epochmarking thoughts it amazed the judge to see how the wings of his young eagle expanded the transformation from a farmers hired man to a national representative appealed to him as characteristically american and he urged bradley to do his best  the election which the young orator expected to be another moment of great interest really came as a matteroffact ending to a long and triumphant canvass he had held victory in his hand until she was tamed the election simply confirmed the universal prophecy he was elected and while the democrats went wild with joy bradley slept quietly in his bed at homewhile the brass band played itself quiescent under his window  now he fixed his eyes on washington as an actuality it was a long time before his term began and at the advice of judge brown and others he packed his trunk in january to go on and look around a little in the usual way of new members he went alone the judge couldnt spare the time  the ride from chicago to washington was an epic to him it was his next great departure his entrance into another widening circle of thinking he had never seen a mountain before and the wild plunging ride among the alleghany mountains was magnificent he sat for hours at a time looking out of the window while the train drawn by its two tremendous engines crawled toward the summit he saw the river drop deeper and deeper and get whiter and wilder and then came the wooded level of the summit and then began the descent  while the reeling train alternately flung him to the window and against the seat he gazed out at the wheeling peaks the snowladen pines and the mighty gorges through which the icy river ran green as grass in its quiet eddies on every side were wild hillsides meshed with fallen trees and each new vista contained its distant peak it was the realization of his imagination of the alleghanies  as the train swooped round its curves dropping lower and lower the valley broadened out and the great mountains moved away into ampler distances the river ran in a wide and sinuous band to the east and the south he realized it to be the potomac whose very name is history he began to look ahead to seeing harpers ferry and in the nearing distance was washington  he had the western mans intensity of feeling for washington to him it was the centre of american life because he supposed the laws were made there the western man knows boston as the centre of art which he affects to despise and new york appeals to him as the home of the millionaire of the moneylender but in washington he recognizes the great nerve centre of national life it is the political ganglion of the body politic it appeals to the romantic in him as well it is historical it is the city that makes history  slowly the night fell after leaving harpers ferry the outside world vanished and when the brakeman called washington it was nearly eight oclock of a damp chilly night he was so eager to see the capitol which the kindly fat man behind him had assured him was but a few steps away from the station that he took his valise in his hand and started directly for the dome which a darkey with a pushcart pointed out to him with oppressive courtesy  there was an allpervasive impalpable bluegray mist in the air cold and translucent and when he came to the foot of the grounds and faced the western front of the capitol building he drew a deep breath of delight it thrilled him there it loomed in the misty winter night the mightiest building on the continent bluewhite sharply outlined massive as a mountain yet seemingly as light as a winter cloud weighing myriads of tons it seemed quite as insubstantial as the mist which transfigured it against the coldwhite of its marble and out of the graywhite enveloping mist bloomed the warm light of lamps like vast lilies with hearts of fire and halos of faint light  he stood for a long time looking upon it musing upon its historic associations around him he heard the grinding wheels the click of the horses hoofs upon the asphalt pavement and heard the shouts of drivers somewhere near him water was falling with a musical sound in a subterranean sluiceway at last he came to himself with a start and found his arm aching with the fatigue of his heavy valise he struck off down the avenue it seemed to swarm with colored people they were selling papers calling with musical belllike voices  evenin styah evenin styah  horse cars tinkled along and a peculiar form of elongated bus with the word carette painted upon it rolled along noiselessly over the asphalt pavement an old man in business dress with rather aristocratic sidewhiskers came toward him walking briskly through the crowd an open handbag swung around his neck and as he walked he chanted a peculiar cry  doctor fergusons sellybrated double x philadelphia coughdrops for coughs and colds sore throat or hoarseness five cents a package  innumerable signs invited him to meals at 15 and 25 cts rolls and french drip coffee 10 cts oysters in every style etc  the oyster saloons were in general very attractive to him as a western man but specifically he did not like the looks of the places in which they were served he came at last to a place which seemed clean and free from a bar and ventured to call for a twentyfive cent stew  after eating this he again took his way to the street and walked along looking for a moderatepriced hotel he did not think of going to a hotel that charged more than seventyfive cents for a room he came at length to quite a decentlooking place which advertised rooms for fifty cents and upwards he registered under the clerks calm misprision and the brown and wonderfully freckled colored boy showed him to his room  it was all quite familiar to himthis hotel to which a man of moderate means is forced to go in the city the dingy walls and threadbare carpet got geometrically shabbier at each succeeding flight of stairs until at length the boy ushered him into a little room at the head of the stairway it was unwarmed and had no lock on the door but the bed was clean and as he soon found very comfortable     xxiv  radbourn shows bradley about the capital   he woke in the morning from his dreamless sleep with that peculiar familiar sensation of not knowing where he had lain down the night before there was something boyish in the soundness of his sleep he heard the newsboys calling outside although it was apparently the early dawn their voices made him think of des moines for the reason that des moines was the only city in which he had ever heard the newsboys cry he sprang from his bed at the thought of radbourn he would hunt him up at once he was surprised to find that it had snowed during the night and everywhere the darkies were cleaning the walks  walking thus a perfect stranger in what seemed to him a great city he did not feel at all like a rising young man in fact the farther he got from rock river the smaller his importance grew for he had the imagination that comprehends relative values  on the street he passed a window where a big negro was cooking griddlecakes dressed in a snowy apron and a paper cap he looked so clean and wholesome that bradley decided upon getting his breakfast there and going in took his seat at one of the little tables a colored boy came up briskly  id like some of those cakes said bradley to whom all this was very new  brown the wheats yelled the boy and added in a low voice buckwheat or batter  buckwheat i guess  make it bucks the boy yelled by the way of correction and asked again in a low voice coffee  if you please  one up light  while bradley was eating his cakes which were excellent others came in and the waiters dashed to and fro shouting their weird orders  ham and two up coff a pair bootleg white wings  bradley had a curiosity to see what this order would bring forth and watching carefully found that it secured ham and eggs two cups of coffee a beefsteak and an omelet he was deeply interested in the discovery  he recognized the most of the men around him as western or southern types many of them had chin whiskers and wore soft crush hats the negroes interested and fascinated him they were so grimly ugly of face and yet apparently so good natured and light hearted  on the street again he saw the same types of men he wondered if they were not his colleagues as for them they probably took him for a boston or new york man with his full brown beard and clear complexion  the negroes attracted his eyes constantly they drifted along the street apparently aimlessly many of them their faces were mostly smiling but in a meaningless way as if it were a habit he soon found that they were swift to struggle for a chance to work they asked to carry his valise to black his boots the newsboys ran by his side in their eagerness to sell  as he went along he noticed the very large number of rooms to let and the equally large number of signs of meals fifteen and twentyfive cents evidently there would be no trouble in finding a place to board  as he entered radbourns office he saw a young lady seated at a desk manipulating a typewriter she had the ends of a forked rubber tube hung in her ears and did not see bradley he observed that the tube connected with a sewingmachinelike table and a swiftly revolving little cylinder which he recognized as a phonograph at the window sat radbourn talking in a measured monotonous voice into the mouthpiece of a large flexible tube which connected with another phonograph his back was toward bradley and he stood for some time looking at the curious scene and listening to radbourns talk  congress brings to washington a fulness of life which no one can understand who has not spent the summer here radbourn went on in a slow measured voice his lips close to the belllike opening of the tube it had a ludicrous effect upon bradleylike a person talking to himself  the city may be said to die when congress adjourns its life is political and when its political motor ceases to move the city lies sprawled out like a dead thing its streets are painfully quiet its street cars shuttle to and fro under the burning sun and its teamsters loaf about the corners drowsily the storekeepers keep shop of course but they open lazily of a morning and close early at night the whole city yawns and rests and longs for the coming of the autumn and congress  it is amusing and amazing to see it begin to wake up at the beginning of the session then begins the scramble of the hotels and boardinghouses to secure members of congress then begins  the girl suddenly saw bradley standing there and called out some one to see you mr radbourn  radbourn stopped the cylinder and turned  ah how do you do he said as if greeting a stranger  bradley smiled in reply knowing that radbourn did not recognize him im very well i dont suppose you remember me but im brad talcott  radbourn rose with great cordiality well well im glad to see you he said his sombre face relaxing in a smile as he seized bradley by the hand sit down sit down im glad to see an old classmate  dont let me interrupt your work i was interested in hearing you talk into that thing there  oh yes i was just getting off my syndicate letter for this week sit down and talk you dont interrupt me at all now tell me all about yourself of course i have heard of your success state legislature and congress and all that but i would like to have you tell me all about it  there aint very much to tell i had very little to do with it said bradley  they took seats near the window looking out upon the square and upon the vast squat egyptian tomblike structure that rose out of the centre of the smooth snowcovered plat across which the sun streamed with vivid white radiance  there was a little pause after they sat down radbourn leaned his head on his arm and studied bradley earnestly he seemed older and more bitter than bradley expected to see him he asked of the old friends in a slow way as if one name called up another in a slowly moving chain of association they talked on for an hour thus sitting in the same position at last radbourn said  how far ive got from all those scenes and people and yet the memory of that little old town and its people has a powerful fascination i neverll go back of course to tell the truth i am afraid to go back it would drive me crazy i am a city man naturally i am gregarious i like to be in the centre of things itll get hold of you too this city is full of ruined young men and women who came here from the slowmoving life of inland towns and villages and after two or three years of a richer life find it impossible to go back and here they are struggling along on fortyfive cents a day at hashhouses living in hall bedrooms preferring to pick up such a living at all kinds of jobs than to go back home id do it myself if i were  he broke off suddenly and looked at bradley in a keen steady way and so youre a congressman talcott well im glad of your success because it shows a man can succeed on the right linesin a measure at least  well ive tried to live up to most of your principles smiled bradley ive read all the things youve sent me  well youre the wildest and most dangerous lunatic that ever got into congress radbourn said gravely do you expect to talk any of that stuff on the floor  well ii hoped to be able to say something before the session closes  if you do it will be a miracle the house is under the rule of a republican czar and men with your ideas or any ideas are to be shut out remorselessly let me tell you something right here it will save time and worry you want to know the speaker cultivate him hes the real power thats the reason the speakership becomes such a terrible struggle it decides the most tremendous question in his hand is the appointing of committees which should be chosen by the legislators themselves the power of these committees is unlimited youll find they can smother bills of the utmost importance theoretically they are the servants of the house actually they are its autocrats  i didnt realize that  i dont suppose it is realized by the people this appointing of the committee is supposed to save time and yet the speakership contest consumes weeks sometimes months it will grow in ferocity  cant something be done  try and see he said rising well suppose we got out and walk about a little i infer youre on to see the town where are you stopping  bradley named the hotel with a little reluctance he knew how cheap it was and since he had discovered that congressmen were at a premium in boardinghouses he saw that he must get more sumptuous quarters than he had hitherto occupied they went out into the open air together the sun was very brilliant and warm the eaves were running briskly the sky was gentle beautiful and springlike the fact that he was in washington came upon bradley again as he saw the soaring dome of the capitol at the head of the avenue  what you want to do is to get on good social terms with the socalled leaders radbourn was saying recognition goes by favor on the floor of the house we might go up to the capitol and look about radbourn suggested  they walked up the steps leading to the west front of the building everywhere the untrodden snow lay white and level  this is the finest part of the whole thing radbourn remarked as they reached the level of esplanade it has more beauty and simple majesty than the main building itself or any structure in the city  it was magnificent bradley turned and looked at it right and left with admiring eyes it gleamed with snow and all about was the sound of dripping water and in the distance the roll of wheels and click of hoofs the esplanade was a broad walk extending the entire width of the building and conforming to it it was bottomed with marble squares and bordered with a splendid wall breasthigh on one side and by the final terrace running to the basement wall on the other here and there along the wall gigantic brazen pots sat filled with evergreens whose color seemed to have gradually dropped down and entered into the marble beneath them the bronze had stained with rich dull green each pedestal and irregular sections of the marble wall itself  below them the city was outspread radbourn pointed out the pension office the white house the treasury and other principal buildings with a searching word upon their architecture the monument he evidently considered required no comment  as they entered the dome they passed a group of men whose brisk bluff talk and peculiar swagger indicated their characterlegislators from small country towns  some of your colleagues radbourn said indicating them with his thumb as they paused a moment in the centre of the dome one of the group a handsome fellow with a waxed mustache and hard black eyes gave a stretching gesture and said im in the world now  his words thrilled bradley to the heart he was in the world now des moines and its capitol were dwarfed and overshadowed by this great national city to which all roads ran like veins to a mighty heart he lifted his shoulders in a deep breath it was glorious to be a congressman but still more glorious to be a citizen of the world  they passed through the corridors in upon the house floor which swarmed with legislators lobbyists pages newspaper men and visitors radbourn led the way down to the open space before the speakers desk and together they turned and swept the semicircular rows of seats  everywhere the visitor abounds said radbourn western and southern men predominate its surprising what deep interest the negro takes in legislation he went on lifting his eyes to the gallery which was black with their intent and solemn faces see this old fellow with his hat off as if he were in the midst of a temple he said nodding at a group before the speakers desk  bradley looked at the poor bent meek old man with a thrill of pity he observed that many of the negroes were splashed with orangecolored clay  members began to take their seats and to call pages by clapping their hands the cloakrooms and barbershop resounded with laughter newspaper men sauntered by addressing radbourn and asking for news and here and there others like radbourn were acting as guides to groups of visitors  in the midst of the growing tumult a onearmed man entered the speakers desk and called out in snappy tenor  gentlemen i am requested by the doorkeeper to ask all persons not entitled to the floor to please retire  bradley started but radbourn said no hurry you have fifteen minutes yet as a memberelect you have the courtesy of the floor anyway do you want to meet anybody  no i guess not i just want to look on for today  well well go up in the gallery  looking down upon the floor and its increasing swarm of individuals bradley got a complete sense of its vastness and its complexity and noise  it makes the iowa legislature seem like a schoolroom he said to radbourn  at precisely noon the gavel fell with a single sharp stroke and the speaker called persuasively the house will please be in order the members rose and stood reluctantly some of them sharpening their pencils others reading while the chaplin prayed sonorously with many oratorical cadences taking in all the departments of government in the swing of his generous benediction  instantly at the word amen like the popping of a cork the tumult burst out again hands clapped laughter flared out desks were slammed papers were rattled feet pounded and the brazen monotonous clanging voice of the clerk sounded above it all like some new steam calliope whose sounds were words  you see how much prayer means here said radbourn  a good deal of the business which followed was similar in character to the proceedings at des moines resolutions were passed with two or three aye votes and no noes at all while the rest of the members looked over the record read the morning papers or wrote on busily the speaker declared each motion carried with glib voice  at last a special order brought up an unfinished debate upon some matter and the five minute rule was enforced  youre in luck said radbourn the whole procession is going to pass before you  as the debate went on he pointed out the great men whose names suggested history to bradley and whose actual presence amazed him there was amos b tripp whom radbourn said resembled a chinese godimmense featureless bald with a pout on his face like an enormous baby the watch dog of the house major hendricks was tall thin with the voice and manner of an old woman his eyes were invisible and his chinbeard wagged up and down as he shouted in high tenor his inevitable objection  an old man with abundant hair bluewhite under the perpendicular light arose at the back part of the room making a fine picture outlined against the deep red screen his manner was courtly his ruddy face pleasing his voice musical and impassioned  hes the dress parade orator of the house observed radbourn  i like him said bradley leaning forward to absorb the speakers torrent of impassioned utterance when he sat down the members applauded  most of the orators conformed to types familiar to bradley there was the legal type monotonously emphatic with extended forefinger which pointed threatened and delineated his speaking wore on the ear like a sawfiling then there was the political speaker the stump orator who was full of wellworn phrases who could not mention the price of wool or the number of cotton bales without using the ferocious throatysnarl of a beast of prey  he was followed by the clerical type a speaker who used the most mournful cadences in correcting the gentleman on his left as to the number of cotton bales his voice and manner formed a distinct reflection of the mournful preacher and the tune of his high voice had the power of calling up the exact phraseology of sermonsrepent my lost brother ere it be too late prepare for the last great day my brother while he actually asserted the number of cotton bales had been grossly overstated by the gentleman from alabama  on going down the stairs radbourn called his attention to the paintings hanging here and there which he called hideous daubs with the reckless presumption of a born realist to whom allegory was a personal affront radbourn showed him about the city as much as he could spare time to do and when he released him bradley went back to the capitol which exercised the profoundest fascination upon him  he had not the courage to go back to the private gallery into which radbourn had penetrated but went into the common gallery which was full of negroes unweariedly listening to the dry and almost unintelligible speeches below  he sat there the whole afternoon and went back to his hotel meek and very tired  radbourn introduced him to a few of the members the next day it was evident that nobody cared very much whether he had been elected or not each man had his own affairs to look after and greeted him with a flabby handshake and looked at him with cold and wandering eyes it was all very depressing  he grew nervous over the expenses which he was incurring although he constantly referred himself back to the fact that he was a congressman at a salary of six thousand dollars his economy was too deeply ingrained to be easily wiped out he seldom got into a streetcar that he did not hold a mental debate with himself to justify the extravagance  he went about a good deal during the next two or three days but he continued at the cheap hotel where he was obliged to keep his overcoat on in order to write a letter or read a newspaper he went twice to the theatre he bought a dollar seat the first time which worried him all through the play and he did penance the following evening by walking the twenty blocks both ways and by taking a fiftycent seat he figured it a clear saving of sixty cents he really enjoyed the play more than he would have done in a dollar seat and consoled himself with the reflection that no one knew he was a congressman anyway                                                 he told radbourn at the station that he had enjoyed every moment of his stay as the train drew out he looked back upon the city and the great dome its centre with a deep feeling of admiration almost love it had seized upon him mightily he had only to shut his eyes to see again that majestic pile with its vast rotundas its bewildering corridors and its tumultuous representative hall life there would be worth while he began to calculate how long it would be before he should return it seemed a long while to wait     xxv  ida comes into his life again   after his return home he accepted every invitation to speak because that relieved the tedium of his life in rock river he took an active part in the fall campaign in county politics and he delivered the fourth of july address at the celebration at rock river amid the usual blare of bands and bray of fakirs and icecream vendors while the small boys fired off crackers in perfect oblivion of anybody but themselves  it was magnificent to occupy a covered carriage in the parade and to sit on the platform as the centre of interest and to rise amid cheers to address the citizens of the united states to point to cloudcapped towering peaks to plant the stars and stripes upon battlements of ancient wrong and other equally patriotic things  no occasion was complete now without him the strawberry festival that secured his presence felicitated itself upon the fact and always insisted on just a few words mr congressman  the summer passed rather better than he had anticipated about a month before his return to washington he received a letter from ida asking him to be present at a suffrage meeting in des moines and he accepted the invitation with great pleasure he had been wondering how he could see her again without making the journey for that purpose which he could not bring himself to do  it was a soft hazy october day and the ride to des moines was very beautiful the landscape seemed to be in drowse halfsleeping and halfwaking the jays flew from amber and orangecolored coverts of maples and oaks across the blue haze of the open and quails piped from the hazelthickets crows flapped lazily across the fields where the ploughmen were at work the threshing machines hummed and clattered with a lower quieter note and as bradley looked upon it all the wonder of his release from the toil of reaping and threshing and ploughing came upon him again  ida was glad to see him she gave him her hand in a frank strong clasp  youll stay to tea with us of course she said there is no one here but mother and i and we can talk things all over this is my mother she said presenting an elderly lady with a broad placid face she said nothing whatever during his stay but listened to all that was said with unchanging gravity it was plain she worshipped her daughter and never questioned what she said  they sat down at the table  mr talcott this is christine said ida introducing a comely norwegian girl who came in with the tea christine takes care of mother while im away  ay tank sometime she take care of me christine smilingly replied  avoiding family matters ida talked on general subjects while the rest listened she overestimated bradleys education his reading but he was profoundly thankful for it he had never heard such talk it was literature to him she spoke with such fine deliberation and such choice of words he felt its grace and power without understanding it it seemed to him wonderful  i should like to be a novelist she said id like to treat of this womans movement  why cant you do it he asked  i lack the time the freedom from other interests but if i could be a novelist it would be a novelist of life  he never remembered all that she said but she made an impression that was almost despair upon him by her incidental mention of books that he had never read and of authors of whom he had never even heard  they walked to the church together along the sidewalks littered with fallen leaves and when they entered the side door she began to introduce him to the ladies who swarmed about her the moment they caught sight of her bradley felt embarrassed by their multiple presence but was proud to be introduced by ida they moved to the platform he had never spoken at such a meeting before and he was nervous he spoke first and spoke well but he would have done better with idas face before him when she spoke he sat looking up at the beautiful head and feeling rather than seeing the splendid lines of her broad powerful and unconfined waist the perfume of her dress and its soft rustle as she moved to and fro before him made him forget her words  cargill came up to the platform after the speaking and said jocosely well legislator youre getting ahead youre laying a foundation for postmortem fame anyway i hear youve been on to congress  yes i went on and stayed a few days  howd you like it  how do you do mr cargill said ida at his elbow arent you out of place here  not more than usual replied cargill im always out of place  do you know mr birdsell she asked presenting a powerful young man with a singularly handsome face he had clear brown eyes and a big graceful mustache for just a moment as he stood beside ida bradley shivered with a sudden suspicion that they were lovers  mr birdsell happens to be on from muscatene ida explained and happened in to see a suffrage meeting hes trying to reconcile himself to the idea of womans emancipation  hell find a sympathizer in me put in cargill  bradley studied birdsell with roundeyed steady stare he was a superb type of man it gave bradley a feeling of awkwardness to stand beside him and a consciousness of stupidity to listen to their banter but ida dismissed cargill and birdsell summarily and walked home with bradley he was not keenly perceptive enough to see that ida put birdsell off with a brusqueness that argued a perfect understanding  they walked home by the risen moon side by side he had not the courage to take her arm and she did not offer it he referred again to washington and she asked him to remember the women in his legislation  i dont know what im going to do next but i must reach the farmers wives again as i did in the days of the grange i feel for them they are today the most terrible proofs of mans inhumanity my heart aches for them there is a new farmers movement struggling forward the alliance im thinking of going into that as a lecturer do you know anything about it  no not much  they had reached the gate and they stood there like lovers in the cold clear moonlight just an instant but in that lingering action of the woman there was something tender which bradley seized upon he asked again  youll let me write to you again wont you  certainly i shall follow your career with the deepest interest i wish youd think of this alliance movement and advise me what to do goodby she extended her hand  goodby he said and his voice choked when he turned and walked away washington was very far away indeed and political honors cheap as dust     xxvi  congressional life   he found washington less lonely for him on his return there were many new members and they sought each other socially and soon managed to have a good deal of talk among themselves notwithstanding the studied slights of the old members one member clancy who grew profane at times said these old seeds think theyre hells captains but i guess we can live if they dont shake hands  most of the members were married and lived with their families in rented houses but others who were too poor to bring their families or who were bachelors like bradley lived in boarding houses bradley secured a room and board in a house near the capitol because he seemed to be nearer the centre of things when he could look out upon the dome  it surprised him to learn how humbly most of the congressmen lived they were quite ordinary humans in all ways of course some of the senators of great wealth lived in fine houses but they were the exception and the poorer members did not conceal their suspicion of these great men  it aint a question of how much a mans got clancy of iowa said but how he got it ive simmered the thing down to this living in a hashhouse aint a guarantee of honesty any more than living in a fourstory brownstone is a sure sign of robbery but its a tolerably safe inference  these rich senators and representatives owners of vast coal tracts or iron mines or factories rode up to the capitol with glittering turnouts their horses clanking bits and jingling chains warning pedestrians like clancy and talcott to get out of the way for the first time in his life bradley met great wealth with all of its power it shocked him and made him bitter  he took little interest in the organizing of the house his experience in des moines taught him to sit quietly outside the governing circle he accepted a place on one of the minor committees and waited to see what would develop  his life was very quiet nothing was done before the holidays but organize and he found a great deal of time to study radbourn came back during the early weeks of the session and resumed his work  clancy went to the theatre very often and attended all manner of shows especially all that were free or that came to him as a courtesy  ive lived where i couldnt get these things he said and i propose to improve each shining hour  attending congress was quite like attending the legislature every morning the members went up to the great building which they soon came to ignore except as a place to do business in they trooped there quite like boys going to school it was the state legislature aggrandizednoisier more tumultuous and confusing  in a little while bradley ceased to notice the difference in gilding and jimcrackery between the senate and representative ends of the corridors he no longer noticed the distances the pictures or the statues in the vaulted dome but passed through the vast rotundas with no thought of them the magnificence of it all grew common with familiarity  the vast mass and roar and motion of the hall itself soon ceased to confuse or abase him in proportion to membership he doubted whether there were more able men there than in the state legislature they were more acute politicians they were wilier and talked in larger terms manipulating states instead of countiesthat was all the routine of the day was of the same general character and gave him no trouble  some of the more famous of the leaders he absolutely loathedgreat bloated swaggering unscrupulous treacherous tricksters ill lend you my support they said as if it were something that could be loaned like a horse he often talked them over with radbourn whose experience in and about congress as a newspaper correspondent had given him an intimate knowledge of men and had rendered him contemptuous if not rebellious  the men counted party leaders are manipulators as a matter of fact they subordinate everything to party success weve got to have another great political revolution toto decentralize and demachinize the whole of our political method our system will break of its own weight it cant go on it is supposed to be popular when in fact it is getting farther and farther away from the people every year just see the departments do you know anything about them  no i dont bradley admitted  youre like all the rest every year the army of useless clerks increases every year the numbers of useless buildings increases the whole thing is appalling and yet the people are getting apparently more helpless to reform it laws pile upon laws when the real reform is to abolish laws wipe out grants and special privileges we ought to be legislating toward equality of opportunity in the world and here we go with mckinley bills and the devil knows what else by the way to change the subject what has become of milton jennings he started out to be a great republican politician  well he lives there yet hes still in politics but doesnt seem to get higher than a county office  he was a brilliant fellow but he started in on the wrong side there is no hope for him on that side in the west  hes married lives just opposite the seminary seems to be reasonably contented  radbourn turned suddenly you are not married  bradley colored no im not  radbourn mused a little seems to me i remember some talk about your marrying that littlerussell girl  well i didnt bradley had just a moments temptation to tell radbourn his whole secret but he gave it up as preposterous                                                 legislation was incredibly slow  beats the devil how little we fellows amount to here clancy said one night after they had been sitting all day in their seats while brown of georgia dixon of maine and others of their like had wasted hour after hour in all sorts of tedious discussions upon mere technicalities we cant even vote by thunder im going to make a great break one of these days and make a motion to adjourn  bradley laughed dutifully for this was the ancient joke  its an outrage clancy fumed the speaker had refused to recognize him and he was furious the speakers got everything in his hands say do you know that its all made up the day before whos goin to be recognized  yes i found that out some time ago said bradley quietly  well i feel like making a great big kick  it wouldnt do any good  yes it would it would relieve my feelings its a pretty how de do to send a man here to represent his constituents and then put the whole power of the house into the hands of the speaker and the committee on rules  bradleys seat came between two of the old members samuels of mississippi and col maxwell of south carolina and they were constantly talking across bradleys back or before his face ignoring him completely it wore on him so that he fell into the habit of sitting over beside the profane clancy in bidwells seat bidwell occupied the leathercovered lounge behind the screen so industriously that no one else felt privileged to throw himself down there  the drinking disgusted bradley and the obscene talk which he heard in snatches as he went past sickened him the same sort of attitude toward the female clerks was expressed by a certain class of the legislators he began to wonder if he were not abnormal in some way by reason of his repugnance to all this desolating derision of really holy things he found that while he had less religion than these men they had infinitely less reverence for the things which he considered sacred  some of the better class of members invited him to their houses and he went occasionally and if he found them uncongenial he never went again he could not make calls out of duty it seemed to him that they took very little interest in the higher side of politics and some of them he found were unaware of any higher side of life  he could not help noticing that washington was a city full of beautiful girls his idolatry of miss wilbur could not prevent him from admiring them as they streamed along the walk to church he sometimes looked wistfully at this flood of sunny laughing life that moved by him so near and yet so completely out of his reach he knew at such times that he had missed something sweet out of his own lonely life  but these moments were few he realized that there was no place in the social life of the city for him and the librarian knew him better than the butlers in the houses of rich senators he attended one or two public receptions and was thoroughly disgusted with the crush and felt the essential vulgarity of the whole thing  his life at the capital was not entirely that of the politician he had in him capabilities for appreciating art and literature which most of his colleagues had not he studied upon economic problems rather than upon partisan politics and tried to grasp the meaning of social change and social condition and to comprehend economic causes and tendencies he spent many hours upon problems which were unconsciously unfitting him for partisan success  his life was very full and happy save for the dull hunger at his heart whenever he thought of ida he wrote to her still but her replies still kept their calm impersonal tone one night when he returned from the capitol he found a letter from her enclosing some clippings  i have joined the farmers alliance she wrote i begin to believe that another great wave of thought is about to sweep over the farmers the spirit of the grange did not die it has passed on into this new organization the difference is going to be that this new alliance of the farmers will be deeper in thought and broader in sympathy i never believed the grange a failure it taught people by its failure im going to kansas to speak for them there the alliance is very strong there this order will become political its leaders are very enthusiastic  she passed on to write of other things but bradley was deeply affected by this news he had heard of the alliance obscurely but had felt that it was only an attempt to revive the old grange movement and that it could not succeed but her letter set him thinking  he wrote away on a speech till nine oclock and then went out for his usual walk about the capitol and its grounds which had never lost their charm as the city itself had he had grown into the habit of going out whenever he wished to escape the paltry decoration the hot colors the vitiated air of his boardingplace and the importunities of his fellowboarders he went out whenever he wanted to think great and refreshing thoughts or whenever he felt the need of beauty or the presence of life     xxvii  bradleys longcherished hope vanishes   it had been snowing all the afternoon and the shrubbery hung heavy and silent with heaped clinging feathery snow dazzling white by contrast with the dark sustaining branches and the yellow lamps flamed warmly amid the allsurrounding steely blue and glistening white the damp pavements where the snow had melted were banded with gold and crimson from the reflected light of the lamps and the warning glare of car and carriage lights  as bradley breathed the pure air and walked soundlessly along the narrow paths and looked across the unflecked untrodden snow up to the vast and silent dome he shuddered in wordless delight he hungered to share it with ida it was like fairylandso far removed from daylight reality and yet the sound of sleighbells the occasional shouts of coasters and the laughter of girls added a familiar human quality to it all and added an ache to the mysterious shuddering delight of it all it was so evanescent it would decay so quickly the wind the morning sun would destroy it  he walked up to the lonely esplanade and saw the citys lights shine below him like rubies and amethysts and saw far beyond the snowheaped highlands above which jupiter hung poised serene and lone the king of the western sky  how far away all this seemed from the brazen declamation the monotonous reiterations of the readingclerk and from the sharp clank of the speakers gavel his ear wearied his heart sick of the whole life of the farcical legislature with its flood of corrupt bills got back serenity and youth and repose in the presence of the snows the silences and the stars  again the impulse seized him to write to ida and show her his whole soul to dare and end once for all his ache of suspense he went back to his room and seized pen and paper everything he wrote seemed too formal or too presumptuous at last he finished a short letter      dear miss wilbur      i do not know how to begin to say what i want to say i am afraid     of losing you out of my life by not writing and im afraid if i     write i will lose you it is impossible for me to say what youve     done for me i never would have been anything more than a poor     farmer only for you i dont want to apologize to you for telling     you how much you are to me i want to appeal to you to give me a     chance to work for you thats all i want you to give me some     hope if you can      i know i am asking a great deal even in that i realize how     unreasonable it is youve only seen me a few times and yet im     not going to apologize for it i must have it over with i cant go     on in this way wont you write to me and tell me that i can look     forward to the future with hope yours sincerely      bradley talcott  for the next ten days he was of little service to his country except the day he made his speech on the tariff question it was his first set speech and he had twenty minutes yielded to him by the gentleman from missouri who had charge of the bill he had the close attention of the house not only for his thoughts which were fresh and direct but also for the natural manner in which he spoke he had lost a good deal of his oratory but had gained a powerful flexible and colloquial style which made most of the orators around him seem absurd the fine shadings of emotion and of thought in his voice struck upon the ear wearied with rancous yells and monotonous brazen declamations with a cool and restful effect at the close the members crowded about to congratulate him upon his efforts and for the moment he felt quite satisfied with himself  it gave him a shock to see idas fateful letter lying upon the hatrack in his boardinghouse where it had been pawed over by the whole household he hastened to his room and dropped into a chair with that familiar terrible numbness in his limbs and with his heart beating so hard it shortened his breathing he was like a man breathless with running when his eyes fell on the writing his hands ceased to shake and his quick breathing fell away into a long shuddering inspiration he read the first page twice without moving a muscle then he turned the page and finished it it was not long and it was very direct      dear mr talcott      your letter has moved me deeply very deeply i would have     prevented its being written if i could it is the greatest     tributesave onethat has ever come to me and yet i wish i had     not read it im not free to make you any promise im not free to     correspond with you any morenow ive been trying to find a way     to tell you so indirectly but your letter makes it necessary for     me to do so directly  the rest of the letter was an attempt to soften the blow but it fell upon him very hard  the possibility which he had always feared had become a fact the hope which he had kept in the obscure processes of his thought and which had filled a vital place in his action dropped out and left him purposeless this hope of somehow someway having her near to him had been the mainspring of his action and it could not be withdrawn without leaving him disabled  he returned to the letter again and again studying each word each mark he saw in it her acceptance of some otherprobably birdsell  then he saw that she had withdrawn the privilegethe blessed privilegeof writing to her she was determined to go out of his life completely at times as he imagined this strongly his throat swelled till he could hardly breathe he would have cried if nature had not denied him that relief  he saw how baseless his hope had been and he exonerated her from all blame she had been kind and helpful till he spoiled it all by a fools presumption he had always exaggerated her social position and her attainments but in the depths of his selfabasement and despair every kindness she had done him and every letter she had written took on a new significance on every one he saw her warnings every meeting he had ever had with her he now went over and over with the strange pleasure one takes in bruising an aching limb  she had never been other than reserved impersonal in his presence she had shown him again and again that her intimate life was not for him to know he remembered now the peculiar look of perfect understanding which flashed between birdsell and ida which troubled him at the time but which his cursed egotism had brushed away as of no significance  his speech lay there on the table it was waste paper now he had no one left to address it to his utter loneliness came back to him his mind went back over the line of his life till it came again into the little opening in the wisconsin woods where the pines wept or snarled ceaselesslytill his mother died in the moan and the snarl and shadow of them his heart went out to her as never before since ida came into his life  the gloom and reticence of those darkgreen forests had wrought him into the reticent serious man he was he was not gloomy naturally he was strong and hopeful but this was one of those moments which appall a man even a young manor more properly especially a young man  he did not go down to dinner but sat in his room till late then when hunger compelled he went out to a vast cafe where he could be more alone it seemed that night as if all incentive to live were gone but he went to the session next day in a mechanical sort of a way and each day thereafter in the same way though he took no interest in the proceedings  clancy had his suspicions and had to verify them  talcott youre off yr feed girl gone back on yeh  bradley refused to reply and clancy took delight in spreading the story among his gang they respected bradleys physique too much to push him unduly however  nature slowly reasserted itself and as the weeks went by he regained his interest in the work but the sparkle the allurement of life was gone and he went about with more of the purely mechanical in his actions  he read now every available bit of news relating to the farmers rising in the west in the hope that idas work would be mentioned in it the papers were getting savage in their attack upon the movement in kansas it was said to mean repudiation that it was a movement of the shiftless and unscrupulous citizens which destroyed the credit of the state and disturbed social conditions wantonly the west seemed on the point of upheaval and kansas seemed to be the centre of the feeling of unrest     xxviii  spring conventions   the session wore along monotonouslyat least to those who like bradley took no interest in the bitter partisan wranglingand suddenly it came upon him that spring was near there came a couple of sunny days after three days of warm rain and the grass grew suddenly green a robin hunting worms on the lawn laughed out audaciously one morning as bradley went across the path there seemed to be a mysterious awakening thrill in every plant and animal the distant hills grew soft in outline  a few days and the spirea japonica flamed out in yellow the quince in the hedges showed its rosecolored tips of bursting blooms and on the red buds grew wonderful garnetcolored fists soon to open into beautiful palms of flowers the gardeners got out with rakes and wheelbarrows and lazily plodded to and fro upon the beautiful seamless green of the lawns or spaded about the flowers beds in the countless little parks of the city  a few days later and the old white mule and darkey driver came out upon the springing grass with the purring mower and it made bradleys blood leap with recollections of the haying field the air began to grow sweet with the odor of flowers the sky took on a warm look the building took on a deeper blue in its shadows and the north windows became violet at noon bradley longed for the country but the orangecolored mud of the suburbs kept him confined to the sidewalks  on easter sunday the girls came out in their delicious dresses looking dainty and sweet as the lilies each church displayed new hats new grasses and springing plants announced that spring had come the leaves of absence indicated spring in the house  as june came on the question of reelection began to trouble some of the members they began to get leave of absence on important business and to go home to fix up their political fences there was no sign of adjournment it was the policy of the republicans to keep the democrats out of the field  the profane clancy was one of the first to go he came to bradley one day say talcott i wish youd ask for indefinite leave for me my fences are in a hell of a fix and besides i want to see my wife im no earthly use herethough you neednt state that in your request  whatll i say  oh important businessor sicknessthe babys cutting a toothjust as you like it all goes  i guess ill try important business the other is too much worn  all right it does beat hell the amount of sickness there is on pension bill nights and on convention week  clancy was a type of legislator whose idea of legislation was to have a good time and look out for reelection bradley however did not worry particularly about his reelection until he received a letter from the judge asking him to come home and attend the convention  its just as well to be on the ground the judge wrote there is a good deal of opposition developing in the northwest part of the district larson wants the nomination for the legislature and he is trying to swing the scandinavians for fishbein they are making a good deal of your attitude on the pension bill and that interview on the oleo business where you go back on your legislative vote is being circulated to do you harm  this letter alarmed bradley and at once showed him what a fight the judge was making suddenly he woke to the fact that defeat would be unwelcome congress had come at last to have a subtle fascination and he loved the city and its noble buildings its theatres and its libraries since that fatal letter from ida he had been forced to go more often to the theatres and concerts they seemed now like necessities to him and the thought of going back to private life was not at all pleasant he therefore got leave of absence and took the train for rock river  he did not see so much of the outside world on this return trip his trouble came back upon him mixed too with something sweet which lay in the fact of a return to the west he caught a thrill of this as the train dipped and swung round a peak on the west slope of the alleghanies and for a single instant the sea of sunillumined swells and peaks of foliage broke upon the eyes and then was lost and the train dropped down into the rising darkness of the valley  it came to him again the next afternoon as he rode away over the wide low swells of the prairies between chicago and the mississippi it was a beautiful showery june day a day of alternate warm rain and brilliant sunshine and the rushing engine plunged into trailing clouds of rain only to burst forth into sunshine again with exultant shrieks of untamed energy and listening to it one might have fancied it a living thing with capability to snuff the glorious west wind and eyes to reflect the cool green swells of pasture  it was a magnificent thing to step off the chicago sleeper into the broad morning at rock river soaring streamers of red and flamecolor arched the eastern sky like the dome of a mighty pagoda birds were singing in the cool sweet hush roosters were crowing the air was full of the scent of fresh leaves and succulent springing grain bradley abandoned himself to the spring and his walk up the quiet street was a keen delight the town seemed wofully small and shabby and lifeless but it had trees and birds and earthsmell to compensate for other things  there was no one at the station to receive him not even a bus the station agent said  guess the judge didnt know you was comin or hed been down here with a bandwagon  mrs brown was in the kitchen bent above a pan of sizzling meat a norwegian girl with vivid blue eyes and pink and white complexion was setting the table with great precision she smiled broadly as bradley put his finger to his lips and crept toward mrs brown who gave a great start as she felt the clasp of his arm  gracious sakes alive bradley talcott  did i scare yeh he inquired smiling wheres the judge  she looked at him fondly as he held her a moment in his arms  hes out by the welli think hes at work at something for ive heard him swearing and groaning out there  bradley found the judge weeding a bed of onions he had a couple of folded newspapers under his knees and was in his shirtsleeves he looked like a felon condemned for life to hard manual labor  judge how are you called bradley  the judge looked up with a scowling brow hello brad he wiped his hand on his thigh and rose with a groan to shake hands im slavin again mrs brown insists on my working on the garden hows congress  piratical as ever nothing doing that ought to be done hows everything here  the judge put on his coat i guess ill quit for this time he said referring to the onions lets wash up for breakfast  they washed at the kitchen sink as usual mrs brown watched bradley with maternal pleasure as he hung his coat on a nail and went about in his shirtsleeves scrubbing his face and combing his hair  its good to see you around again bradley  well it seems good to me seems like old times to sit down here to your cooking with the kitchen door open and the chickens singing  were all right in this county said the judge referring back to politics but as i wrote you it aint all clear sailing weve got work to do ive called the convention at cedarville in order to keep some useful people in the field well take dinner with old jake schlimgenhes a power with the germans  bradley avoided political talk as much as possible but when on the street there seemed nothing else to talk about councill and ridings assured him he was all right in the eastern part of the county and under their flattery he grew quite cheerful their simple honest admiration did him good  on the day named bradley and the judge drove off up the road in a onehorse buggy the judge talked spasmodically bradley was silent looking about him with halfshut eyes the wheat had clothed the brown fields crows were flying through the soft mist that dimmed the light of the sun but did not intercept its heat each hill and tree glimmered across the waves of warm air and seemed to pulse as if alive blackbirds and robins and sparrows everywhere gave voice to the ecstasy which the men felt but could not express  the judge roused up slapping the horse with the reins its going to be a fight but fishbein will be left on the first ballot by twentyfive votes  cedarville was wideawakefeverishly so the street was lined with knots of gesticulating politicians as he alighted bradleys friends swarmed about him with three cheers for the hon brad talcott he shook hands all round with unfeigned pleasure  hurrah boys lets all go over to the palace hotel and have some dinner said the judge at last  the rest whooped with delight thats the cooky judge  they swarmed in upon jake like the locusts into egypt they washed some of them in the washroom out of tin basins laughing and talking in hearty clamor over the water and the comb others flung their nondescript windworn hats upon the floor brushed their hair with their fingers and went into the diningroom as if going into a farmkitchen in threshing time  the girls were in a flutter of haste and giggled and bumped against each other trying to serve the dinner to order  quick as the lordll let yeh  bradleys constituents were mostly farmers cleaneyed and hearty they all felt sure of success and jeered the opposition goodnaturedly                                                 when the judge and bradley rode home that night they were silent for another cause they had been defeated on the tenth ballot and bitter things had been said by both sides  it was again beautiful around them but they did not notice it the low sun flung its level red rays of light across the flaming green of the springing grain and lighted every western windowpane into burning squares of crimson the train carrying the successful waterville crowd passed them and they waved their hats in return to their opponents salute  the judge was as badly defeated as bradley he took it very hard it seemed to give the lie to all his prophecies of democratic progress it seemed to him a defeat of jeffersonian principle he consoled himself by saying  those fellows dont represent the people the thing to do is to bolt the convention and then he went on planning an independent campaign  bradley maintained gloomy silence the comment of his friends hurt him more than his defeat their tone of pity cut him and left him raw to the gibes of his opponents the fact that an honorable honest man could have enemies in his own party was borne in upon him with merciless force what had he done that men should yell in helllike ferocity of glee over his defeat  this defeat cut closer into the judges life than anything that had come to him since the death of his son if bradley had not been so blind in his selfish suffering he would have seen how the judge had aged and saddened since the morning  but the old mans vital nature would not rest under defeat he almost forced bradley to issue a card to the public announcing his independent candidacy for congress bradley had no heart in it however the energy of youth seemed gone out of him  the judge gathered his forces together for battle but bradley fled away from rock river to escape the comments of his friends as well as his enemies he was too raw to invite strokes of the lash he dreaded the meeting with his colleagues at washington but there was a little more reserve in their comment and there were fewer who took a vital interest in his affairs  he met radbourn a few days after his return  well radbourn said i see by the papers that your defeat in the convention was due to your advocacy of cranky notions i told you the advocacy of heresies was dangerous i have no comfort for you you had your choice before you you can be a hypocrite and knuckle down to every monopoly or special act or you can be an individual andgo out of office  ill go out of office i guess whether i want to or not was his bitter reply he suffered severely for a few days with the commiseration of friends and the thinlyveiled ridicule of his political enemies but each man was too much occupied to hold bradleys defeat long in mind he soon sank back into quiet if not into repose  as the hot weather came on the city became almost as quiet as rock river itself save taking care of the few tourists who drifted through there was very little doing the cars ground along ever more thinly until they might be called occasional the trees put forth their abundance of leaf and under them the city seemed to sleep congress had settled down into a dull and drowsy succession of daily adjournments and filibustering the speaker ruled remorselessly counting the hats in the cloakroom to make up his quorum his critics said  nothing was doing but vast accumulations of appropriations were piling up waiting the hurried action of the last few days of the session the senators dawdled in and out dressed in the thinnest clothing the house looked sparse and ineffectual  bradley grew depressed and at last he became positively ill he was depressed by the incessant relentless attacks made upon him through the waterville patriot and by his apparently hopeless outlook the patriot published some of his radical utterances much garbled of course and called him an anarchist and a socialist a fit leader for the repudiating gang of alleged farmers in kansas  radbourn became alarmed for him and advised him to get indefinite leave of absence and go home go back into the hayingfield thats what you need they wont miss you here go home and go out of politics and stay out till the revolution comes then go out and chalk death on your enemies door  the advice to go home was so obviously sound that bradley took it at once it seemed as if the atmosphere of the city would destroy him as a matter of fact it was inactivity that was killing him he found it so hard to exerciseexcept by walking and that did not rest his overactive mind     xxix  bradley discouraged   the judge and mrs brown were alarmed at the change in him he was gloomy and pale but he protested he was all right  im going out on the farm i believe itll do me good to go out and help councill put up his hay it seems to me if i could get physically tired and wolfishly hungry again it would do me good  the judge drove him out to councills one afternoon everybody they met seemed delighted to see him mrs councill came out to the horseblock her bare arm held up to shield her eyes  well brad talcott how are youanyway youre jest in time to help me pick berries  bradley sprang out and shook hands with hearty force give us your dish  hyare yelled councill from the load of hay he was driving in i can use you out here  oh you go long replied mrs councill hes got better company and a better job  out in the berry patch he talked over the neighborhood affairs and picked berries and killed mosquitoes while the wind wandered by with rustling steps on the lombardy poplar leaves the locusts sang and the grasshoppers snapped their shining wings it was a blessed relief to his troubled older self for he slipped back into the more tranquil life of his boyhood  at supper he sat at the table with the men whose wet shirts showed how fierce the work of pitching the hay had been  be ye out fr play or work brad asked councill  work need a hand  theys plenty to dobut im afraid you cant take a hands place for a while  try me and see  they were all curious to hear of washington but he was more inclined to talk of the crops and the cattle  he went to sleep that night in the bare garret with the men and woke the next morning at sunrise at sound of councills voice calling him just as he used to do when he was a hired man  hello brad roll out  he went down to breakfast sloshed his face at the cistern pump and was ready to eat when the men came in  we live jest the same as ever brad said mrs councill youll haf to put up with it jest as if y want a congressman  i guess he can stand a few days what we stand all the while councill interjected  there was a good deal of banter during the meal about downing the congressman  bradleys physical pride was roused and he took his place in the field determined to show them their mistake night came bringing weariness that was exhaustion and next morning he was too lame to lift a fork it emphasized the unnatural inactivity into which he had fallen  he improved physically and by the end of the week was able to pitch hay with the rest the judge drove up for him on saturday afternoon and found him pitching hay upon the stack behind the windbreak wet with sweat and covered with timothy bloom councill was stacking  hello congressman called the judge  get off n take right hold judge said councill a judge aint no bettern a congressman not a darn bit  ill take a hand at the table the judge replied  ive had about enough of it bradley said to him privately while councill was putting his team in the barn im better but it begins to seem like a waste of time  they drove home that night through the still warm starlit air like father and son in slow talk of the future  the judge told of the plan for the fall campaign to which bradley listened silently  well win yet if you only keep your grit  he planned also a broadening out of their law business a new block had just been built and they were to take two adjoining rooms  you need a library of your own and a chance to work where you wont be disturbed ill do the consulting business and leave you the business in court for a time bradley was interested and occupied in moving into the new office and in getting in some new books and arranging the shelves  but the narrowness the quiet the mental stagnation of the life of rock river settled down on him at last there were days when he walked the floor of the office wild with dismay over his prospect how could he settle down again to this life of the country lawyer the honors and ease that accompanied his office the larger horizon of washington had ruined him for life in rock river love might have enabled him to bear it but he had given up the thought of marriage and he longed for the larger life he had left  there was a sorrowful scene when the judge read for the first time bradleys letter of withdrawal from the canvass the judge was deeply hurt because he had not been consulted and was depressed by bradleys despair he tried to reason with him but bradley was in no mood to reason  im out of it judge its of no use to go on im beaten thats all there is about it wed only get a minority vote and show how weak we are im a failure as a politician and every other way i give it up  the judge sat staring at him without words to express his terrible disappointment and alarm for the condition into which his lieutenant had sunk alarmed him and he communicated his fear to mrs brown  they discussed the matter that night in bed bradley heard their voices still mumbling on when he sank to sleep  you dont suppose mrs brown the judge said a little timidly it cant be possible its a woman  if it had been mr brown he would have told me she said convincingly its just the heat and then his defeat has told on him more than you admit  if i felt sure of that mrs brown the judge said in answer but i dont all ambition seems to have gone out of him i hate to acknowledge myself mistaken in the man ive believed in brad i am alarmed about him he isnt right ive a good mind to send him down to st louis and kansas city on some collection cases  i think hed better do that mr brown if he will go  oh hell go he wants to get away from the campaign it seems to wear upon him some way he avoids everybody and wont speak of it at all if he can help it  bradley was very glad to accept the offer and made himself ready to go with more of his oldtime interest than he had shown since his sickness the judge brightened up also and said to him as he was about to step into the train now brad dont hurry back take your time and enjoy yourself go around by chicago if you feel like it  after the train pulled out and they were riding home the judge said to his wife mrs brown you must take good care of me now i want to live to see a party grow up to the level of that young mans ideas this firm is crippled but it is not in the hands of a receiver mrs brown  ill be the receiver mrs brown said  the judge shifted the lines into his left hand  the horse fell into a walk mrs brown if this werent a public road id be tempted to put my strong right arm around you and give you a squeeze  i dont see any one looking she said and her eyes took on a pathetic suggestion of the roguishness her face must have worn in girlhood  he put his arm about her and gave her a great hug after that she laid her head against his shoulder and cried a little the judge sighed  well well have to get reconciled to being alone i suppose we cant expect to keep him always i think its a woman mrs brown     xxx  the great round up   during his stay in st louis bradley found the papers filled with the alliance movement in kansas and looked for idas name each morning she was in the western part of the state but moving eastward and when a few days later he saw her announced in the kansas city morning papers to speak at the great round up at chiquita he packed his valise on the sudden impulse and started on the next train determined to hear her speak once more at least  it was just noon when he alighted from the train at chiquita the day was dry hazy resplendent october the wind was strong but amiable and was full of the smell of corn and of that warm pungent smoky odor which forms the indian summer atmosphere of the west the wind rushed up the broad street past him carrying the dust and leaves in its powerful clutches and laying strong hands upon his broad back the sky was absolutely without speck but a pale mist seemed to dim the radiance of the sun and lent a milky white tone to the blue of the sky  as he moved slowly off up the street he studied the town and the people from the standpoint his life in the east had given him everywhere was an air of security men moved slower their faces were less anxious and more placid they had leisure to talk as they met at the shop door the boss seemed farther away but all this security did not conceal the poverty which he now saw everywhere the houses were mainly low unpainted buildings containing only three or four cramped rooms they were a little smarter in appearance than the country type but not much more commodious  i wonder if you are one of the speakers here today said a voice behind him  bradley turned and saw a small man with a stubby mustache under whose derby hatrim a pair of round black eyes shone with a keen glitter  no sir im not  beg pardon no harm done saw you get off with your valise knew you werent a native by the cut o yr jib excuse me i hope  certainly im just on to see some friends here  precisely im up from kansas city to see the big round up as they call it heres my card i represent what our alliance friends call the plutocratic press his card stated that his name was mr davis and that he represented the chronicle im afraid the parade must be over by this time but i missed my train perhaps we had better step along a little  they had reached the main street a broad avenue which ran north and south across a gentle swell in the prairie there were a great many people on the sidewalks and teams were moving in various directions slowly and in apparent confusion  lets go over here to the commercial house thats the headquarters of all the brethren said davis  they went across the street to the commercial house which they found full of men in groups talking very earnestly but quietly most of them were farmerlike looking figures big and brown and dressed in worn faded clothing but here and there a young man stood wearing a broad white hat and with a gay handkerchief knotted loosely about his neck on all sides could be heard the slightlydrawling speech of the kansan  they went up to a little balcony which projected over the walk four or five other young fellows were already seated there some of them were magnificentlooking fellows keen wholesome and picturesque in their dress  excuse me now gentlemen said davis whipping out his notebook im a reporter and here they come  up the broad street under that soaring sky from their homes upon a magnificently fertile soil came the long procession of revolting farmers there were no bands to lead them no fluttering of gay flags no cheers from the bystanders they rode in grim silence for the most part as if at a funeral of their dead hopesas if their mere presence were a protest  everywhere the same color predominateda russet brown their faces were bronzed and thin their beards were long and faded and tangled like autumn corn silk their gaunt gnarled and knotted hands held the reins over their equally sad and sober teams the women looked worn and thin and sat bent forward over the children in their laps the dust had settled upon their illfitting dresses there were no smart carriages no touch of gay paint no glittering new harnesses the whole procession was keyed down among the most desolate and sorrowful grays browns and drabs  slowly they moved past in some of the wagons banners rudely painted on cotton cloth uttered the farmers protest in words  good god said davis as he dashed away at his writing did you ever see such a funeral in your life see that banner      down with monopolies  all right down with them youre the doctor muttered davis as he wrote      free trade free land     money at cost     transportation at cost  now you are shouting brother      equal rights to all is as dear to     the heart of the farmer as it was in     the days of our forefathers  well now sure you mean thatthats all stop talking and act  bradley remained perfectly silent through it all as these farmers passed before his eyes there came into his mind vast conceptions which thrilled him till he shuddereda realization that here was an army of veterans men grown old in the ferocious struggle against injustice and the apparent niggardliness of naturea grim and terrible battleline it was made up throughout its entire length of old or middleaged men and women with stooping shoulders and eyes dim with toil and suffering there was nothing of lovely girlhood or elastic smiling boyhood not a touch of color or grace in the long line of march it was sombre silent ominous and resolute  it appeared to him the most pathetic tragic and desperate revolt against oppression and wrong ever made by the american farmer it was the grange movement broadened deepened and made more desperate and widereaching by changing conditions  at davis suggestion they went off down the street joining the crowd on the sidewalk which was streaming away towards the fair grounds a roasted ox was to be served there and speeches were to follow the road kept on to the south down over the gentle slope and turned aside under the jackoaks and led through a wooden gate into an enclosure which was used for the county fair down under the great shed by the side of the racetrack the people swarmed in thousands  they were all standing about the rude tables behind which helpers were busily hewing off great lumps of beef and mutton and slicing fat slabs of bread which were snatched and carried away in little paper plates by the hungry men here and there beside their wagons families were eating a dinner of their own  the same sober color predominated there was a little more life and gayety in their speech here their grim harsh faces relaxed a little and now and then broke into unwonted smiles as they stood about devouring their food and discussing the meeting which they counted a success everywhere were hearty handshakings and fraternal greetings  all about the grounds stood feeble women in illfitting clothes with tired children in their aching arms a painful sag in their weakened loins bradley marvelled to think why such festivals had ever seemed mirthful and happy to him he wondered if there used to be so many tired faces at the grange picnics in iowa were the farmers really less comfortable and happy or had he simply grown clearsighted  kansas as it stood there was democratic poverty has few distinctions among its victims the negro stood close beside his white brother in adversity and there was a certain relation and resemblance in their stiffened walk poor clothing and dumb imploring empty hands there lay in the whole scene something tremendous something farreaching the movement it represented had the majesty if not the volcanic energy of the rise of the peasants of the vendée  after the dinner was eaten the people gradually took their seats on the grand stand facing a platform upon which the speakers were already assembled bradley looked about for ida but she had not come the choir amused the people with a few alliance songs whose character may be indicated by their titles join the alliance step get off the fence brother were marching along etc  the people were watching eagerly for idas appearance and when she came in view escorted by the chairman the people on the platform swarmed about to greet her and hid her from bradleys eager eyes he was tremulous with emotion as the chairman introduced her it carried him back to the day when he first saw her  as she rose to speak now it was in a broad garish light no dapple of shadows was there no rustle of leaves no green mossy trunks of trees she stood on a bare platform facing five thousand faces under a shedlike roof  she was changed too she was now a mature woman there was nothing girlish about her talk or her manner there was decision in the tones of her voice and a sense of power in the poise of her head and in the lofty gesture of her hand she no longer made a set oration she talked straight at her audiences  i wish the whole world could see this meeting she said and understand it for what it is it is an expression of a movement not the movement itself it is a demand but the revolt that lies back of the demand is greater than the expression of it the demand the expression may change the form of our whole movement may pass away but the spirit that makes it great that carries it forward is invincible and imperishable all the ages have contributed to this movement it is an outgrowth of the past  the heart and centre of this movement is a demand for justice not for ourselves alone but for the toiling poor wherever found if this movement is higher and deeper and broader than the grange was it is because its sympathies are broader with me it is no longer a question of legislating for the farmer it is a question of the abolition of industrial slavery  the tremendous cheer which broke forth at this point showed that the conception of the movement had widened in the minds of the people themselves it was no longer a class movement it stirred bradley as if some swift electric wind had blown upon him  wherever a man is robbed wherever a man toils and the fruits of his toil are taken from him wherever the frosty lash of winter stings or the tear of poverty scalds there the principle of our order reaches  as she continued the people turned to each other with shining faces she was thrilling them by her passionate simple utterance of their innermost thoughts  while she spoke bradley had eyes for nothing else but when she sat down amid wild applause and the choir rose to sing he turned to look back over the audience banked there in rows on the hard wooden seats and felt again its majesty and its desolation there was the same absence of beauty youth color and grace that he had noticed in the procession everywhere worn and weary women in sombre dresses a wistful light in their faces as if they felt dimly the difference between the lithe and beautiful figure of the girl and their own stiffened joints and emaciated forms  the great throng sat silent listening intently their eyes fixed upon the speaker they were there for a purpose they were there to find out why it was that their toil their sobriety their selfdeprivation left them at middle life with distorted and stiffened limbs gray hair and empty hands they were terribly in earnest and bradley felt his kinship with them they were his kind  the music which set them wild with enthusiasm was of the simplest and most stirring sort that it pleased them so much showed all too clearly how barren their lives were of songs and color and light                                                 the people pressed forward to speak a word to ida and bradley yielding to the pressure of the crowd was carried forward with it it stirred him very deeply to see the love and admiration they all felt for her on all sides he heard words of affection which came straight from the heart their utter sincerity could not be doubted he knew he ought to turn and go away before she saw him but he could not  something in his face attracted a grizzled old farmer who was moving along beside him and he turned with a beaming look  hows that for a speech eh did y ever hear the like of it  no i never did  aint she a wonder now d you spose theres another woman like her in the world  bradley shook his head he was sure of that  a gaunt old woman who wore a dark greencheck sunbonnet hanging at the back of her head put in a word  shows what a woman can do if you give er a chance  hello sister slocum youre always on hand  like a sore thumb brother tobey an i dont know of any one got a bigger interest in downin the plutes than the farmers wivesdo you  it was pathetic it was unforgettable to see these people as they stood beside the rounded supple splendid figure of the speaker and took her strong smooth hand in their workscarred leathery palmsthese women of many children and neverending work bent by toil above the washtub and the churn shut out from all things that humanize and make living something more than a brute struggle against hunger and cold  ida greeted them smilingly but her face was quivering with a sadness which she could hardly conceal bradley pushed on desperately toward her at length as the crowd began to thin out he moved up and thrust his long arm in over the shoulders of the women  wont you shake hands with me too he said and his voice trembled  she turned quickly and her face flashed into a smilea smile different somehow from that with which she had greeted the others and they saw it it warmed his melancholy soul like a sudden ray of june sunlight  her hand met his strong and firm in its grasp ah mr talcott im glad to see you  the farmers wives began to leave saying goodby over and over again they clung to the girls hand gazing at her with wistful eyes it seemed as if they could not bear to let her go out of their lives again  we may never see you again dearie one old woman said but we neverll forgit you youve helped us i reckon life wont seem quite so hard now we kind o see a glimmer of a way out  the tears were on her face and ida put her arms about the old ladys neck and kissed her and then turned away unable to speak the chairman followed by bradley and ida made his way down the steps and out on the grounds where the streams of people were setting back toward the city the chairman placed miss wilbur in a carriage and said ill see you at the hotel  wont you ride she asked  no thank you he replied with a jovial gleam in his eyes and ida said no more in protest bradley in great trepidation took a seat beside her  well brother talcott what do you think of such a meeting as that she asked after the carriage started turning upon him with sudden intensity  it was like that first meeting of the grange when i heard you speak first only this is more earnestmore desperate i should say  yes these people are desperate it is impossible for the world to realize the earnestness of these farmers just see the interest the womenfolks take in it no other movement in historynot even the antislavery causeappealed to the women like this movement here in kansas why sometimes i go home and walk the floor like a crazy womani get so wrought up over it while our great politicians split hairs on the tariff people starve the time has come for rebellion  bradley was silent he sympathized with her feeling but he could not see very much hope in a revolt  her eyes glowed with the fire of prophecy bradley gazed at her with apprehensive eyes she seemed unwholesomely excited but she broke into a hearty laugh and said you stare well i wont lecture you any more what did you do in washington  nothing he replied and there was something silencing in his voice  she glanced at his face sharply she hesitated an instant then asked  do you go back  no my political career is ended i was knifed in the convention  you are young  im not young enough to outgrow such a defeat as that im done  this mood seemed singularly unlike him as she had known him before she seized upon the situation  come with us there is more wool and flax in the fields she quoted  i cant i dont see things as you doi mean i dont see any cure  she laid her hand on his arm im going to convert you will you attend one more meeting with me  ill go wherever you say he answered with an attempt at gallantry  i want to take you with me to show you what the people are doing and what my work is youre to ask no questions but just make yourself ready to go  bradleys mind was in a whirl ida seemed so differentnot at all like that last letter she had written to him he felt rather than perceived the change in her she left him at the hotel door and her parting handclasp quickened his breath an indefinite and unreasonable exultation filled his eyes with light in the privacy of his room he croaked a few notes before he realized that he could not sing his gloomy sky had let fall a sudden ray of dazzling sunshine     xxxi  ida shows bradley the way out   he did not see her again till the next afternoon she came out into the anteroom in the hotel looking so lovely he could hardly believe his good fortune  now you are in my hands mr talcott  he noticed that she did not call him brother talcott he was as boyish and timid as ever quite subdued by her presence and followed her out to the omnibus in a daze of delight he had forgotten all he knew but he was very content to listen  she however did not seem at all selfconscious she wore a large cloak and warm gloves and under the wide rim of her black hat her face was like silver and her eyes like stars a delicate perfume came from her dress and reached him across the carriage  it takes about an hour to go down she said as they alighted and stood waiting on the platform and then the college is some distance away from the station  it was an unspeakable pleasure to sit beside her in the train and listen to her talk it was one of the things he had dreamed of so many times but had really never dared to expect  the reason i want you to attend this meeting is because the schoolhouse after all is the place where a real reform among the farmers must have its base id like to see you working with us she said turning suddenly towards him  i would if i felt as you do about it but i cant  why not youre really one of us your letters showed me that why cant you work with us  well ill tell you because it looks like a last resort it would look as though after having been kicked out of both parties i had gone into the third party out of revenge  well i see some force in that but you cant be idle you are too strong and fine to be beaten so do you know i think it was providential that you were defeated she turned to him now and there was something in the nearness of her face that awed him your letters to me told me more than you knew i read beneath the lines i saw how nearly the atmosphere of congress had ruined you the greed of office had got hold of younow hadnt it  he dropped his eyes something got hold of me he said at length  she went on in a voice which moved him so deeply he could not reply ive wanted to see you i believed in you and it made my heart ache to hear your despondent words yesterday life is a battle at best you cant afford to surrender so early the way of the thinker is always hard take up your sword again oh its glorious to be in such a revolution i never was so happy in my life happy and sad too i never was so sad now thats like a woman isnt it what i really mean is that i never saw so clearly the poverty and helplessness of the people before and it makes me happy to think i can do something for them  bradley sat silently looking at her with his big brown eyes he was thrilling with the vibration of her voice and the touch of her hand on his arm  she colored a little and dropped her eyes suddenly there i go again i must keep the oratorical tone out of my voice dont mind my preaching at you will you  i like it said bradley smiling he had a beautiful smile she noticed and he looked so big and strong and thoughtful she suddenly grew a little timid before him  the warning whistle of the engine announced they were nearing a crossing and she said i think this is our station  the wind was strong and cold as they stepped out upon the platform it was nearly six oclock and quite dark they stood for a few moments in the lee of the oneroom depot looking about in the obscurity  well what are we to do now bradley inquired  she seemed at a loss really i dont know colonel barker was to meet me here i believe  bradley took her arm theres a light up there in the cold he said lets go for that and if youll tell me the name of the schoolhouse ill see that we get a team and get out there  in the cold and darkness she lost something of her imperiousness and yielded herself to his guidance with a delicious return to womans weakness in the face of practical material details to bradley this seemed vastly significant and his spirits rose he grew quite facetious and talkative for him  it seems to me thats a store up there must be a town near by perhaps this is the town two houses on one side and three houses on the other make a town in the west we must get some supper too any provision for that  no i left the whole matter in colonel barkers hands  the road ran up the huge treeless swell of prairie toward the lighted windows of a grocery store  together they climbed the hill and opposite the store they came upon a gate on which was a battered sign hotel meals twentyfive cents bradley knocked on the door but there was no reply  after waiting a decent while he said if its a hotel we might as well go right in without knocking  they entered a bare little room whose only resemblance to a hotel barroom was in its rusty cannon stove set in the midst of a box of sawdust and a map of kansas hanging on the wall bradley knocked on the inner door and it was opened by a faded little woman with a sad face  wed like supper for two bradley said  all right she replied moving forward to the stove which she rattled in order to give her time to scrutinize ida who sat on the lounge by the window lay off your things wont ye  bradley helped ida to lay off her cloak it was incredible what pleasure it gave him to do these little things for her he left her a few minutes to go out and look up the matter of the team when he returned he found ida leaning back wearily in a big chair her face very grave and pale he told her that a team would be ready soon  you can come right out to supper announced the landlady and they went out into the kitchen where the table sat it was lighted with a kerosene lamp that threw dullblue shadows among the dishes and dazzled the eyes of the eaters with its horizontal rays of light the table had a large quantity of boiled beef and potatoes and butter which each person was evidently expected to hew off for himself the dessert was pumpkinpie which they both greeted with smiles  ah that looks like the pie mother used to make ida said as the landlady put it down  waal id know seems to me the crust is a leetle too short ive ben havin pretty good luck lately but this pumpkin werent just the very best it was one of them thinrinded ones you know pumpkins werent extry good werent thunder enough i reckon this summer  after supper bradley went out leaving ida with the landlady who was delighted with her listener  heres our team called bradley coming to idas relief a few minutes later it aint a very gay rig but its the best i could do he explained as he helped her in and tucked the quilts about her i had to skirmish in two or three houses to get these quilts for the wind is sharp youll need them  thank you im afraid youve given me more than my share  there was only one seat and bradley took his place beside ida while the driver crouched on the bottom of the clattering old democrat wagon ida was concerned for him  havent you another seat she inquired  no mm i dont need any he replied in a slow drawl i tried to borrow one from sam smalley but theyre all usin theirs id jest as soon set here  there was something singularly attractive in his voicea simplicity and candor like a childs and a suggestion of weakness that went straight to idas tender heart  but youll get cold  oh no mm im used to it half the time i dont wear no gloves in winter less im handlin things with snow on em he said to reassure her  they moved off down the ravine to the north the keen wind in their faces there was no moon and it was very dark notwithstanding the light of the stars  how beautiful the sky is tonight said ida in a low voice  magnificent bradley replied but he thought of her not the stars the team started up and the worn old seat swayed from side to side so perilously that bradley with incredible audacity put his arm around and grasped the end of the seat on the other side of ida  im afraid youll fall out he hastened to explain she made no reply and if she smiled he did not know it  they climbed the slope on the other side of the bridge and entered upon the vast rolling prairie whose dim swells rose and fell against the stars the roads were frightfulgullied with rain and full of bowlders on the hillsides the darkness added a certain wild charm and mystery to it all  how lonesome it seems what a terrible place to live said ida with a shudder  civilization hasnt made much of an impress here thats sure how long has this prairie been settled  bout twentytwo years answered the driver and being started he prattled away telling the story of his pitiful tragic lifea life of incessant toil and hardship men cheated and trampled upon him society and government ignored him science and religion never knew him and cared nothing for himand yet this atom bore it all with unapplauded heroism  there was something in his voice which made the hearts of his hearers ache ida glanced up at bradley now and then at the most dramatic points and they seemed to grow nearer together in their sympathy  theres the schoolhouse said the driver joyously pointing at a dim red light ahead they had been riding for nearly an hour across the treeless swells of prairie and the wind had penetrated their very blood ida was shivering and bradley was suffering with her out of sympathy he longed to fold her close in his arms and shield her from the wind  suddenly the schoolhouse loomed upon their eyes it was a bare little box set on the windswept crest of a hill not a tree to shelter it from the winds of winter or the sun of summer teams were hitched about at the fences and others could be heard on the hard ground clattering along the lanes men coming across the fields on foot could be heard talking the plain seemed cold and desolate and illimitable  bradley helped ida to alight and hurried her towards the open door from which the hum of talk came forth they found the room crammed with men and womenthe women all on one side of the room and the men as decorously on the other or standing about the huge cannon stove that was filled with soft coal and sending out a flood of heat and gas they stopped talking when they saw the strangers enter and gazed at them curiously  then a tall man with a military cut of beard pushed his way forward  goodevenin sisto wilboo im right glad to see you  i am glad to see you brother barker  i must apologize fo not coming myself  this is mr talcott ida interrupted introducing bradley  glad to meet you brotho talcott as i was sayin sisto wilboo i was late and so i sent brotho williams i am ver sawry  oh no matter we got here  colonel barker introduced them to the people who stood near the crowded condition of the room did not allow of a general introduction although they all looked longingly at ida whom they knew by reputation  at first glance the effect was unpromising most of the men had their hats on all of them were fresh from the cornfields and their hands were hard as leather and cracked and seamed and lumpy with great muscles every man wore cots upon his fingers which were rasped to the quick with husking everyone had a certain unkempt look and everywhere color was in low tones browns grays drabs nothing light and gay about dress or bearing bradley noticed a few girls in the middle seats but only a few  it looked like an uncouth audience for ida to address  colonel barker called the meeting to order and made an astonishingly able and dignified speech he then asked brother williams to say a word  brother williams was a middleaged farmer with unkempt hair his clothes were faded to a russet brown his collarless neck was like wrinkled leather and his fingers were covered with cots but he was a most impressive orator his words were well chosen and his gestures dignified and appropriate he spoke in a conversational way but with great power and sincerity he ended by introducing sister wilbur  ida began to speak in a low voice as if talking to friends brothers and sisters this is not the first time ive driven across the western prairies in a wagon to speak at such a meeting as this and it isnt the last time i expect to continue to speak just as long as there is a wrong to be righted just as long as it does you good to have me come  that will be while you live said the colonel gallantly  i hope not she replied quickly i hope to see our reforms established before the gray comes into my hair if we are true to ourselves if our leaders are true to themselves if they do not become spoils of officeshe looked at bradley and the others followed her glance she saw her mistake and colored a little as she went onif they are true to their best convictions and speak the new thoughts that come to them poverty will not increase her dominion  she closed by saying we have with us tonight a very distinguished young congressman from iowathe honorable mr talcott i hope he will feel like saying something to you  while the people stamped and clapped hands ida went over to bradley and said you must talk to them tell them just what you think  bradley rose he would have done more had she asked it he began by speaking of the grange and its decline and of the apparent hopelessness of expecting the farmers to remain united  i am not quite convinced the time has come for a political movement if i were id join it even though some of the planks in your platform were objectionable for i am a farmer my people for generations have been tillers of the soil they have always been poor all the blood in my heart goes out therefore towards the farmer and the farmers movement it seems a hopeless thing to fight the privileged classes with all their power and money it can be done but it can be done only by union among all the poor of every class since coming to your state since day before yesterday my mind has been changed if i thoughtif i could believe as he paused he caught idas eyes shining into his and at the moment the one thing in all the world worth doing was to follow her wish i do believe and im with you from this time forward he ended there but he stood for a moment numb and tingling with emotion he had uttered a resolution which changed the course of his life  the people seemed to realize the importance of this confession on the part of the speaker there was a vibrant intensity in the tone of his voice which every listener felt and they broke out in wild applause as he abruptly ended and sat down  ida with her eyes shining and wet reached forward over the seat and clasped his hand and held it glorious now youre with us heart and soul in their exaltation it did not occur to either of them what a strange place this little schoolhouse was for such a farreaching compact                                                 out under the coruscating skies again into the crisp air bradley turned and looked back upon the little schoolhouse packed to suffocation it would always remain a memorable place in this wide land  oh youve done them goodmore than you can tell ida said  i begin to believe it is the beginning of the greatest reform movement in history he said at last they are searching for the truth and whenever any great body of men search for the truth they find it and the finding of it is tremendous its effect reaches every quarter of the earth  they mounted to their perilous seat once more and moved out into the night the wind seemed to have gone down there was a deep hush in the air as if the high stars listened in their illimitable spaces the plain seemed as lonely and as unlighted as the arctic ocean even the barking of a farmyard dog had a wolfish and savage suggestiveness  they rode in silence ida sighed deeply at last she said its only an incident with us we go back to our pleasant and varied lives they go back to their lonely homes and to their bleak cornfields  but you have given them something to hope for something to think of bradley said seeking to comfort her  yes that is the only consolation i can get out of it this movement has come into their lives like a new religion it is a new religionthe religion of humanity it does help them to forget mud and rain and cold and monotony  again bradleys arm seemed necessary to her safety but this time it closed around her strong and resolute yet he dared not say a word he was not sure of her it seemed impossible that this wonderful beautiful and intellectual woman should care for him and yet when he was speaking her eyes had pleaded for him  the driver talked on about the meeting but his passengers were silent under cover of listening they were both dreaming bradley was forecasting his life and wondering how much she would make up of it wondering if she would make more of it than she had of his past life how far off she had always seemed to him and yet she had always been a part of his inner life now she sat beside him in the circle of his arm and yet she seemed hopelessly out of his reach she liked him as a friend and brother reformerthat was all besides he had no right to hope now when his fortunes had become failures  she was thinking of him she was deeply gratified to think he had entered the great movement and that she had been instrumental in converting him her heart warmed to him strangely for his honesty and his sincerity and then he was so fine and earnest and stronglimbed the pressure of his arm at her side moved her and she smiled at herself unlike bradley she was selfanalytical she knew what all these things meant  theres the station the driver broke out indicating some colored lights in the valley below them were most home  at his word a vision of the plain and the significance of its life rushed over idathe serene majesty of the stars the splendor and unused wealth of the prairies the barriers to their use the limitless robbery of the poor in both city and country the pathetic homes of the renter  oh the pathos the tragedy of it all nature is so good and generous and poverty so universal can it be remedied it must be remedied every thinking sympathizing soul must help us  bradleys voice touched ida deeply as he said slowly henceforward i shall work for these people and all who suffer my life shall be given to this work  a great sudden resolution flashed into idas eyes she lifted her face to his and laid her hand on his and clasped it hard there was a little pause in which as if by some occult sense their minds read each other  well work together bradley she said and the driver did not see the timid caress which bradley put upon her lips as a sign of his unspeakable great joy     xxxii  conclusion   one winter evening ida and bradley came out of their apartments on capitol hill and struck into one of the winding walks which led downward toward the city it was the fourth week of the short session of bradleys term of office and the tenth week since their marriage he still treated ida with a certain timidity and his adoration had been increased rather than diminished by his daily association with her she seemed not to regret her compact with him and though hardly more demonstrative than he she let him know how deeply she trusted and loved him  he was transformed by her influence his life had regained direction and certainty no rebuff of the speaker no insult of a member angered him he was always in his seat ready whenever opportunity offered to do battle against wrong knowing that ida was watching him between times he went with her about the city and his quiet and dignified attentions were a source of the keenest pleasure to her he was so unobtrusively serene and gentle in all things they went often to the theatre they walked a great deal and they were already marked figures about the hill they were both so tall and strong and handsome  they always passed through the capitol grounds on their way down town for it gave them a little thrill of delight to pass the clumps of trees on this evening the grounds were specially beautiful a heavy fall of damp snow covered every twig and grassblade they walked slowly down the winding path till they reached the open lawn just before the western gate  wait a moment bradley said ida they turned to look back the untracked unstained snow swept in undulating breadth to the deep shadow of the great building which rose against the sky as cold as seamless as if it were cut from solid ice the yellow flare of lamps about its base only added to its austere majesty it was at its best and ida and bradley looked up at it in silence hearing the jingle of bells the soft voices of the negro drivers the laughter of children coasting on the mall and the muffled roll of the carettes  it is beautiful tonight said ida softly the building is like a cloud  yes but i cant think of it without its antithesis the home of the workingman and the hut of the poor negro bradley replied  they moved on again in silence darky newsboys shivering with cold met them at every corner holding out to them in their stiffened little claws their styah papahs  the avenue swarmed with sightseers mainly of the west and south every hotel door was like the vent to a hiveblack with comers and goers the old man with the cough medicine met them again they could repeat his singsong cry now and with a little impulse of funmaking ida joined in with him docter fergussons doubleex sellybrated philadelphia cough drops for coughs or colds sore throat or hoarseness five cents a package  they soon struck into the gayer streams of people making their way towards the theatre and when they took their seats in the crowded balcony poverty was lost sight of  there who says this is not a bright and gay world said ida no poor no aged no infirm no cold or hungry people here  this is the bright side of the moon replied bradley gravely they looked around and studied the people with a mental comparison with other throngs they had seen on the far prairies of kansas and iowa there were girls with eyes full of liquid light with dainty bonnets nestling on their soft hair their faces were like petals of flowers the curves of their chins were more beautiful than chalices of lilies their dresses soft shapely of exquisite tones and texture draped their perfect bodies their slender fingers held goldandpearl opera glasses the young men who sat beside them wore the latest fashions in clothing cut from the finest fabrics heavy men of brutal bulk slouched beside their dainty daughters the purple blotches on their bloated and lumpy faces showing how politics or business had debauched and undermined them everywhere was the rustle of drapery and soft musical speech all that was lacking in the round up at chiquita was hereshining fragrant and rustling                                                 the curtain rose upon the fair in nottinghamshire and with the sweet imaginative music as solvent and setting the gay lads and lassies of far romance sang and danced under the trees in garments upon which the rain had never fallen and unflecked with dust knights in splendid dress of silver and green with jewelled swords and gay sashes came and went while the merry peasant youths circled and sang taskfree and sinfree  the scene changed to sherwood forest and there in the land of robin hood where snow never falls where rains never slant through the shuddering leaves the jocund foresters met to sing and drink october ale there came little john and will scarlet and alanadale in glittering garments with smooth fair brows and tuneful voices to circle and sing fadeless and untarnished was each magnificent cloak and doublet slashed with green or purple straight and fair and supple was every back and limb no marks of toil anywhere no lines of care no hopeless hunger no threatening task nothing to do but to sing and dance and drink after the hunt among the delightfully dry and commodious forest wildsa glorious free life a beautiful childlike dreamlike paganlike life  as they looked and while the music tuneful soft and persuasive called to them a shadow fell upon ida that world of carefree changeless youth that world of love and comradeship threw into painful relief the actual world from which she came it brought up with terrible force the low cottage in the moaning pine forest of wisconsin or the equally lonely cabin on the kansas plain  when the curtain fell they rose and went sombrely out when they reached the street ida pressed bradleys arm  oh it was beautiful painfully beautiful do you know what i mean  yes replied bradley simply  o bradley if we only could discover a land like that to which all the poor could go at once and be happya land of song and plenty with no greed and no grinding need  yes bradley sighed but i am afraid you and i will never again taste anything sweet there will always be a dash of bitter in it  yes we were born to feel others cares the worst of it is we could have that land in america if we only would our forefathers thought it was coming but instead of itshe did not finish and they walked on in deep thought  yes said bradley we could have it but the way is long and weary and thousands and millions of us must die on the road i am afraid  as they walked on bradley could hear the occasional deepsighing breath of the heartburdened woman beside him again they passed by the cold and stately palace of the government lifting its dome against the glittering sky the moon had swung high into the air giving a whiter tinge to the blue and dimming the brilliancy of the stars but the crusted snow sparkled like a cloth of diamonds and each flakeburdened branch took on unearthly charm it was very still and peaceful and remote as if no city were near they stood in silence until ida shivered with cold then without a word bradley touched her arm and they walked on  when they entered their room ida sat down in a chair by the fire without removing her things and when bradley came in from the hall she still sat there her eyes shaded by her hat her chin resting on her palm her gloves in her lap he knew her too well to interrupt her and took a seat near her waiting for her to speak  at last she turned abruptly and said bradley im going home  it made him catch his breath oh no i cant let you do that ida  yes i must go i cant stay here that play tonight has wakened my sleeping conscience i must go back to the west  but ida youve only been here four weeks i dont see why  because my work calls me i am cursed i cant enjoy this life any more because i cant forget those poor souls on the lonely farms grinding out their lives in gloomy toil i must go back and help them i feel like a thief to be living in this beautiful room and hearing these plays and concerts when they are shut out from them  bradley experienced a sudden impulse of rebellion but we have done our best havent we  yes but we must continue to do our best right along the battle is only half won yet and ive enlisted to the end besides she said looking up at him with a faint smile ive got to go right into your district and pave the way for your reelection if you expect to do your part here i must do my part in electing you she looked old and careworn you know how much good it does the poor wives and mothers to meet me and to hear me now we mustnt be selfish dear we must not forget that neither of us was born to idleness i have been very happy here with you but there is something of john the baptist in me i must go forth and utter the wordthe word of the lord  they fell into silence again and bradley facing the fire felt a burning pain in his staring eyes her presence had been so inexpressibly sweet and helpful he could not bear to let her go and yet he understood her feeling slowly through years of thought he had grown till now he was level with her altruistic conception of life when he spoke again it was in his apparently passionless way  all right ida we enlisted for the whole war he was able to smile a little as he looked up at her my congressional career will soon end anyhow  she rose and came to him and put her arm about his neck as a matter of fact youll work better without me bradley and your public career must not end for many years you must keep your place for my sake as well as for the sake of the wrongedand also for the sake ofof our children bradley her voice grew tremulous toward the end and a look of singular beauty came into her face  bradley looked up at her with a questioning eager light in his eyes then his long left arm encircled her like a shield and drew her to his knee  all that i am i owe to you now nothing can defeat me   the end     the successor to looking backward  equality  by edward bellamy  12mo cloth 125   after years of preparation mr bellamy now puts forward a work which will command universal attention the new book is larger and more comprehensive than looking backward the scene is the samethat is to say the world of the twentieth centuryand the same characters reappear but while the new book tells us much that is fresh about the institutions of the world of tomorrow its especial purpose as distinguished from that of looking backward is to account for these institutions by explaining not only a righteousness and reason but likewise the course of historical evolution by which they were born out of the very different order of things existing today in this part of his work the author has much to say of the meaning of the events of our own times which he links with the future by predictions of changes now close upon us the title equality is well chosen in view of the general theme  publication will be simultaneous in the united states great britain france germany switzerland belgium spain italy and other countries it is of interest to recall that over 400000 copies of looking backward have been sold in this country the book has been translated into the language of every civilized country and its total sale is almost beyond computation quite recently the demand for literature dealing with sociological questions has led to the printing of a quarter of a million copies at a low price in england
