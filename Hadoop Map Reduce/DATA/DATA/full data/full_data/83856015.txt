83856015	the mark of cain  by andrew lang  1886     the mark of cain     chapter ia tale of two clubs       such arts the gods who dwell on high      have given to the greeklays of ancient rome  in the strangers room of the olympic club the air was thick with tobaccosmoke and despite the bitter cold outside the temperature was uncomfortably high dinner was over and the guests broken up into little groups were chattering noisily no one had yet given any sign of departing no one had offered a welcome apology for the need of catching an evening train  perhaps the civilized custom which permits women to dine in the presence of the greedier sex is the proudest conquest of culture were it not for the excuse of joining the ladies dinnerparties like the congregations in heaven as described in the hymn would neer break up and suppers like sabbaths on the same authority would never end  hang it all will the fellows never go  so thought maitland of st gatiens the founder of the feast the inhospitable reflections which we have recorded had all been passing through his brain as he rather moodily watched the twenty guests he had been feedingone can hardly say entertaining it was a duty dinner he had been givingalmost everything maitland did was done from a sense of dutyyet he scarcely appeared to be reaping the reward of an approving conscience his acquaintances laughing and gossipping round the halfempty wineglasses the olives the scattered fruit and the ashes of the weeds of their delight gave themselves no concern about the weary host even at his own party as in life generally maitland felt like an outsider he wakened from his reverie as a strong hand was laid lightly on his shoulder  well maitland said a man sitting down beside him what have you been doing this long time  what have i been doing barton maitland answered oh i have been reflecting on the choice of a life and trying to humanize myself bielby says i have not enough human nature  bielby is quite right he is the most judicious of college dons and fatherconfessors old man and how long do you mean to remain his pupil and penitent and how is the pothouse getting on  frank barton the speaker had been at school with maitland and ever since at college and in life had bullied teased and befriended him barton was a big young man with great thews and sinews and a broad breast beneath his broadcloth and wide shirtfront he was blonde prematurely bald with an aquiline commanding nose keen merry blue eyes and a short fair beard he had taken a medical as well as other degrees at the university he had studied at vienna and paris he was even what captain costigan styles a scoientific cyarkter he had written learnedly in various proceedings of erudite societies he had made a cruise in a manofwar a scientific expedition and his les tatouages Étude médicolêgale published in paris had been commended by the highest authorities yet from some whim of philanthropy he had not a home and practice in cavendish square but dwelt and labored in chelsea  how is your pothouse getting on he asked again  the pothouse oh the hit or miss you mean well im afraid its not very successful i took the lease of it you know partly by way of doing some good in a practical kind of way the working men at the waterside wont go to clubs where there is nothing but coffee to drink and little but tracts to read i thought if i gave them sound beer and looked in among them now and then of an evening i might help to civilize them a bit like that fellow who kept the thieves club in the east end and then i fancied they might help to make me a little more human but it does not seem quite to succeed i fear i am a born wet blanket but the idea is good mrs st john deloraine quite agrees with me about that and she is a high authority  mrs st john deloraine ive heard of her she is a lively widow isnt she  she is a practical philanthropist answered maitland flushing a little  pretty too i have been told  yes she is conveniently handsome as izaak walton says  i say maitland heres a chance to humanize you why dont you ask her to marry you pretty and philanthropic and richwhat better would you ask  i wish everyone wouldnt bother a man to marry maitland replied testily and turning red in his peculiar manner for his complexion was pale and unwholesome  what a queer chap you are maitland whats the matter with you here you are young entirely without encumbrances as the advertisements say no relations to worry you with plenty of money let alone what you make by writing and yet you are not happy what is the matter with you  well you should know best whats the good of your being a doctor and acquainted all these years with my moral and physical constitution what there is of it if you cant tell whats the nature of my complaint  i dont diagnose many cases like yours old boy down by the side of the water among the hardy patients of mundy  barton general practitioners there is plenty of human nature there  and do you mean to stay there with mundy much longer  well i dont know a fellow is really doing some good and it is a splendid practice for mastering surgery they are always falling off roofs or having weights fall on them or getting jammed between barges or kicking each other into most interesting jellies then the foreign sailors are handy with their knives altogether a man learns a good deal about surgery in chelsea but i say barton went on lowering his voice where on earth did you pick up  here he glanced significantly at a tall man standing at some distance the centre of half a dozen very youthful revellers  cranley do you mean i met him at the trumpet office he was writing about the coolie labor question and the eastern question he has been in the south seas like you  yes he has been in a lot of queerer places than the south seas answered the other and he ought to know something about coolies he has dealt in them i fancy  i daresay maitland replied rather wearily he seems to have travelled a good deal perhaps he has travelled in coolies whatever they may be  now my dear fellow do you know what kind of man your guest is or dont you  he seems to be a military and sporting kind of gent so to speak said maitland but what does it matter  then you dont know why he left his private tutors you dont know why he left the university you dont know why he left the ninetysecond you dont know and no one does what he did after that and you never heard of that affair with the frenchman in egypt  well maitland replied about his ancient history i own i dont know anything as to the row with the frenchman at cairo he told me himself he said the beggar was too small for him to lick and that duelling was ridiculous  they didnt take that view of it at shephards hotel  well it is not my affair said maitland one should see all sort of characters bielby says this is not an ordinary fellow why he has been a sailor before the mast he says by way of adventure and he is full of good stories i rather like him and he cant do my moral character any harm im not likely to deal in coolies at my time of life nor quarrel with warlike aliens  no but hes not a good man to introduce to these boys from oxford barton was saying when the subject of their conversation came up surrounded by his little court of undergraduates  the hon thomas cranley was a good deal older than the company in which he found himself without being one of the hoary youths who play falstaff to every fresh heirs prince harry he was a middleaged man too obviously accustomed to the society of boys his very dress spoke of a prolonged youth À large catseye circled with diamonds blazed solitary in his shirtfront and his coat was cut after the manner of the contemporary reveller his chin was clean shaven and his face though a good deal worn was ripe smooth shining with good cheer and of a purply bronze hue from exposure to hot suns and familiarity with the beverages of many peoples his full red lips with their humorous corners were shaded by a small black mustache and his twinkling bistrecolored eyes beneath mobile black eyebrows gave cranley the air of a jester and a good fellow in manner he was familiar with a kind of deference too and reserve like a dog that is always wagging his tail and deprecating a kick thought barton grimly as he watched the others genial advance  hes going to say goodnight bless him thought maitland gratefully now the others will be moving too i hope  so maitland rose with much alacrity as cranley approached him to stand up would show he thought that he was not inhospitably eager to detain the parting guest  goodnight mr maitland said the senior holding out his hand  it is still early said the host doing his best to play his part must you really go  yes the nights young it was about halfpast twelve but i have a kind of engagement to look in at the cockpit and three or four of your young friends here are anxious to come with me and see how we keep it up round there perhaps you and your friend will walk with us here he bowed slightly in the direction of barton  there will be a little bac going on he continuedun petit bac de santé and these boys tell me they have never played anything more elevating than loo  im afraid i am no good at a round game answered maitland who had played at his aunts at christmas and who now observed with delight that everyone was moving but here is barton who will be happy to accompany you i daresay  if youre for a frolic boys said barton quoting dr johnson and looking rather at the younger men than at cranley why i will not balk you goodnight maitland  and he shook hands with his host  goodnights were uttered in every direction sticks hats and umbrellas were hunted up and while maitland halfasleep was being whirled to his rooms in bloomsbury in a hansom his guests made the frozen pavement of piccadilly ring beneath their elegant heels  it is only round the corner said cranley to the four or five men who accompanied him the cockpit where i am taking you is in a fashionable slum off st jamess were just there  there was nothing either meretricious or sinister in the aspect of that favored resort the cockpit as the decade club was familiarly called by its friendsand enemies two young merton men and the freshman from new who were enjoying their christmas vacation in town and had been dining with maitland were a little disappointed in the appearance of the place they had hoped to knock mysteriously at a back door in a lane and to be shown after investigating through a loopholed wicket into a narrow staircase which again should open on halls of light full of blazing wax candles and magnificent lacqueys while a small mysterious man would point out the secret hidingroom and the passages leading on to the roof or into the next house in case of a raid by the police such was the old idea of a hell but the advance of thought has altered all these early notions the decade club was like any other small club a current of warm air charged with tobaccosmoke rushed forth into the frosty night when the swinging door was opened a sleepy porter looked out of his little nest and cranley wrote the names of the companions he introduced in a book which was kept for that purpose  now you are free of the cockpit for the night he said genially its a livelier place in the small hours than that classical olympic weve just left  they went upstairs passing the doors of one or two rooms lit up but empty except for two or three men who were sleeping in uncomfortable attitudes on sofas the whole of the breadth of the first floor all the drawingroom of the house before it became a club had been turned into a cardroom from which brilliant lights voices and a heavy odor of tobacco and alcohol poured out when the door was opened a long green baizecovered table of very light wood ran down the centre of the room while refreshments stood on smaller tables and a servant out of livery sat halfasleep behind a great desk in the remotest corner there were several empty chairs round the green baizecovered table at which some twenty men were sitting with money before them while one in the middle dealt out the cards on a broad flap of smooth black leather let into the baize every now and then he threw the cards he had been dealing into a kind of well in the table and after every deal he raked up his winnings with a rake or distributed gold and counters to the winners as mechanically as if he had been a croupier at monte carlo the players who were all in evening dress had scarcely looked up when the strangers entered the room  brought some recruits cranley asked the banker adding as he looked at his hand jen donne and becoming absorbed in his game again  the game you do not understand said cranley to one of his recruits  not quite said the lad shaking his head  all right i will soon show you all about it and i wouldnt play if i were you till you know all about it perhaps after you know all about it youll think it wiser not to play at all at least you might well think so abroad where very fishy things are often done here its all right of course  is baccarat a game you can be cheated at theni mean when people are inclined to cheat  cheat oh rather there are about a dozen ways of cheating at baccarat  the other young men from maitlands party gathered round their mentor who continued his instructions in a low voice and from a distance whence the play could be watched while the players were not likely to be disturbed by the conversation  cheating is the simplest thing in the world at nice or in paris cranley went on but to show you how it is done in case you ever do play in foreign parts i must explain the game you see the men first put down their stakes within the thin white line on the edge of the tabla then the banker deals two cards to one of the men on his left and all the fellows on that side stand by his luck then he deals two to a chappie on his right and all the punters on the right back that sportsman and he deals two cards to himself the game is to get as near nine as possible ten and court cards not counting at all if the banker has eight or nine he does not offer cards if he has less he gives the two players if they ask for them one card each and takes one himself if he chooses if they hold six seven or eight they stand if less they take a card sometimes one stands at five it depends then the banker wins if he is nearer nine than the players and they win if they are better than he and thats the whole affair  i dont see where the cheating can come in said one of the young fellows  dozens of ways as i told you a man may have an understanding with the waiter and play with arranged packs but the waiter is always the dangerous element in that little combination hes sure to peach or blackmail his accomplice then the cards may be marked i remember at ostend one fellow a big german he wore spectacles like all germans and he seldom gave the players anything better than three court cards when he dealt one evening he was in awful luck when he happened to go for his cigarcase which he had left in the hall in his greatcoat pocket he laid down his spectacles on the table and someone tried them on as soon as he took up the cards he gave a start and sang out heres a swindle nous sommes volés he could see by the help of the spectacles that all the nines and court cards were marked and the spectacles were regular patent double million magnifiers  and what became of the owner of the glasses  oh he just looked into the room saw the man wearing them and didnt wait to say goodnight he just went  here cranley chuckled  i remember another time at nice i always laugh when i think of it there was a little frenchman who played nearly every night he would take the bank for three or four turns and he almost always won well one night he had been at the theatre and he left before the end of the piece and looked in at the cercle he took the bank lost once won twice then he offered cards the man who was playing nodded to show he would take one and the frenchman laid down an eight of clubs a greasy dirty old rag with théâtre français de nice stamped on it in big letters it was his ticket of readmission at the theatre that they gave him when he went out and it had got mixed up with a nice little arrangement in cards he had managed to smuggle into the club pack ill never forget his face and the other mans when théâtre français turned up however you understand the game now and if you want to play we had better give fine gold to the waiter in exchange for bone counters and get to work  two or three of the visitors followed cranley to the corner where the white dissipatedlooking waiter of the cardroom sat and provided themselves with black and red jetons bone counters of various values to be redeemed at the end of the game  when they returned to the table the banker was just leaving his post  im cleaned out said he décavé goodnight and he walked away  no one seemed anxious to open a bank the punters had been winning all night and did not like to desert their luck  oh this will never do cried cranley if no one else will open a bank ill risk a couple of hundred just to show you beginners how it is done  cranley sat down lit a cigarette and laid the smooth silver cigarettecase before him then he began to deal  fortune at first was all on the side of the players again and again cranley chucked out the counters he had lost which the others gathered in or pushed three or four banknotes with his little rake in the direction of a more venturesome winner the newcomers who were winning thought they had never taken part in a sport more gentlemanly and amusing  i must have one shy said martin one of the boys who had hitherto stood with barton behind the banker looking on he was a gaudy youth with a diamond stud rich and not fond of losing he staked five pounds and won he left the whole sum on and lost lost again a third time and then said may i draw a cheque  of course you may cranley answered the waiter will give you tout ce quil faut pour écrire as the stage directions say but i dont advise you to plunge youve lost quite enough yet they say the devil favors beginners so you cant come to grief  the young fellow by this time was too excited to take advice his cheeks had an angry flush his hands trembled as he hastily constructed some paper currency of considerable value the parallel horizontal wrinkles of the gambler were just sketched on his smooth girlish brow as he returned with his paper the bank had been losing but not largely the luck turned again as soon as martin threw down some of his scrip thrice consecutively he lost  excuse me said barton suddenly to cranley may i help myself to one of your cigarettes  he stooped as he spoke over the table and cranley saw him pick up the silver cigarettecase it was a handsome piece of polished silver  certainly help yourself give me back my cigarettecase please when you have done with it  he dealt again and lost  what a nice case said barton examining it closely there is an arabic word engraved on it  yes yes said cranley rather impatiently holding out his hand for the thing and pausing before he dealt the case was given me by the late khédive dear old ismail bless him the word is a talisman  i thought so the case seemed to bring you luck said barton  cranley half turned and threw a quick look at him as rapid and timid as the glance of a hare in its form  come give me it back please he said  now just oblige me let me try what there is in luck go on playing while i rub up my arabic and try to read this ineffable name on the case is it the word of power of solomon  cranley glanced back again all right he said as you are so curiousjen donne  he offered cards and lost martins face brightened up his paper currency was coming back to him  its a shame grumbled cranley to rob a fellow of his fetich waiter a small brandyandsoda confound your awkwardness why do you spill it over the cards  by cranleys own awkwardness more than the waiters a little splash of the liquid had fallen in front of him on the black leather part of the table where he dealt he went on dealing and his luck altered again the rake was stretched out over both halves of the long table the gold and notes and counters with a fluttering assortment of martins i o us were all dragged in martin went to the den of the moneychanger sullenly and came back with fresh supplies  banco he cried meaning that he challenged cranley for all the money in the bank there must have been some seven hundred pounds  all right said cranley taking a sip of his soda water he had dealt two cards when his hands were suddenly grasped as in two vices and cramped to the table barton had bent over from behind and caught him by the wrists  cranley made one weak automatic movement to extricate himself then he sat perfectly still his face which he turned over his shoulder was white beneath the stains of tan and his lips were blue  damn you he snarled what trick are you after now  are you drunk barton cried some one  leave him alone shouted some of the players rising from their seats while others pressing round barton looked over his shoulder without seeing any excuse for his behavior  gentlemen said barton in a steady voice i leave my conduct in the hands of the club if i do not convince them that mr cranley has been cheating i am quite at their disposal and at his let anyone who doubts what i say look here  well im looking here and i dont see what you are making such a fuss about said martin from the group behind peering over at the table and the cards  will you kindly no it is no use the last remark was addressed to the captive who had tried to release his hands will you kindly take up some of the cards and deal them slowly to right and left over that little puddle of spilt soda water on the leather get as near the table as you can  there was a dead silence while martin made this experiment  by gad i can see every pip on the cards cried martin  of course you can and if you had the art of correcting fortune you could make use of what you see at the least you would know whether to take a card or stand  i didnt said the wretched cranley how on earth was i to know that the infernal fool of a waiter would spill the liquor there and give you a chance against me  you spilt the liquor yourself barton answered coolly when i took away your cigarettecase i saw you passing the cards over the surface of it which anyone can see for himself is a perfect mirror i tried to warn youfor i did not want a rowwhen i said the case seemed to bring you luck but you would not be warned and when the cigarettecase trick was played out you fell back on the old dodge with the drop of water will anyone else convince himself that i am right before i let mr cranley go  one or two men passed the cards as they had seen the banker do over the spilt soda water  its a clear case they said leave him alone  barton slackened his grip of cranleys hands and for some seconds they lay as if paralyzed on the table before him white and cold with livid circles round the wrists the mans face was deadly pale and wet with perspiration he put out a trembling hand to the glass of brandyandwater that stood beside him the class rattled against his teeth as he drained all the contents at a gulp  you shall hear from me he grumbled and with an inarticulate muttering of threats he made his way stumbling and catching at chairs to the door when he had got outside he leaned against the wall like a drunken man and then shambled across the landing into a readingroom it was empty and cranley fell into a large easychair where he lay crumpled up rather than sat for perhaps ten minutes holding his hand against his heart  they talk about having the courage of ones opinions confound it why havent i the nerve for my character hang this heart of mine will it never stop thumping  he sat up and looked about him then rose and walked toward the table but his head began to swim and his eyes to darken so he fell back again in his seat feeling drowsy and beaten mechanically he began to move the hand that hung over the arm of his low chair and it encountered a newspaper which had fallen on the floor he lifted it automatically and without thought it was the times perhaps to try his eyes and see if they served him again after his collapse he ran them down the columns of the advertisements  suddenly something caught his attention his whole lax figure grew braced again as he read a passage steadily through more than twice or thrice when he had quite mastered this he threw down the paper and gave a low whistle  so the old boys dead he reflected and that drunken tattooed ass and his daughter are to come in for the money and the mines theyll be clever that find him and i shant give them his address what luck some men have  here he fell into deep thought his brows and lips working eagerly  ill do it he said at last cutting the advertisement out of the paper with a penknife it isnt often a man has a chance to star in this game of existence ive lost all my own social lives one in that business at oxford one in the row at ali musjid and the third wenttonight but ill star every sinner should desire a new life he added with a sneer        starring is paying for a new life at pool  he rose steady enough now walked to the door paused and listened heard the excited voices in the cardroom still discussing him slunk downstairs took his hat and greatcoat and swaggered past the porter mechanically he felt in his pocket as he went out of the porch for his cigarettecase and he paused at the little fount of fire at the door  he was thinking that he would never light a cigarette there again  presently he remembered and swore he had left his case on the table of the cardroom where barton had laid it down and he had not the impudence to send back for it  vile damnum he muttered for he had enjoyed a classical education and so disappeared in the frosty night     chapter iiin the snow  the foul and foggy night of early february was descending some weeks after the scene in the cockpit on the river and the town night was falling from the heavens or rather night seemed to be rising from the earthsteamed up black from the dingy trampled snow of the streets and from the vapors that swam above the squalid houses there was coalsmoke and a taste of lucifer matches in the air in the previous night there had been such a storm as london seldom sees the powdery flying snow had been blown for many hours before a tyrannous northeast gale and had settled down like dust in a neglected chamber over every surface of the city drifts and snowwreathes as northern folk say were lying in exposed places in squares and streets as deep as they lie when sheep are smoored on the sides of sundhope or penchrist in the desolate borderland all day london had been struggling under her cold windingsheet like a feeble feverish patient trying to throw off a heavy white counterpane now the counterpane was dirty enough the pavements were three inches deep in a rich greasy deposit of mud and molten ice above the round glass or iron coverings of coalcellars the footpassengers slipped ricked their backs and swore as they stumbled if they did not actually fall down in the filth those who were in haste and could afford it travelled at fancy prices in hansoms with two horses driven tandem the snow still lay comparatively white on the surface of the lessfrequented thoroughfares with straight shining black marks where wheels had cut their way  at intervals in the day the fog had fallen blacker than night down by the waterside the roads were deep in a mixture of a weak graybrown or coffee color beside one of the bridges in chelsea an open slope leads straight to the stream and here in the afternoonfor a late start was madethe carts of the vestry had been led and loads of slush that had choked up the streets in the more fashionable parts of the town had been unladen into the river this may not be the most scientific of sanitary modes of clearing the streets and squares but it was the way that recommended itself to the wisdom of the contractor in the early evening the fog had lightened a little but it fell sadly again and grew so thick that the bridge was lost in mist halfway across the river like the arches of that fatal bridge beheld by mirza in his vision the masts of the vessels moored on the near bank disappeared from view and only a red lamp or two shone against the blackness of the hulks from the publichouse at the cornerthe hit or missstreamed a fanshaped flood of light soon choked by the fog  out of the muddy twilight of a street that runs at right angles to the river a cart came crawling its highpiled white load of snow was faintly visible before the brown horses they were yoked tandem came into view this cart was driven down to the wateredge and was there upturned with much shouting and cracking of whips on the part of the men engaged and with a good deal of straining slipping and stumbling on the side of the horses  one of the men jumped down and fumbled at the iron pins which kept the backboard of the cart in its place  blarmme bill he grumbled if the blessed pins aint froze  here he put his wet fingers in his mouth blowing on them afterward and smacking his arms across his breast to restore the circulation  the comrade addressed as bill merely stared speechlessly as he stood at the smoking head of the leader and the other man tugged again at the pin  it wont budge he cried at last just run into the hit or miss at the corner mate and borrow a hammer and you might get a pint o hot beer when yere at it heres fourpence i was with three that found a quid in the mac end of last week heres the last of it        a quid in the maca sovereign in the streetscrapings      called mac from macadam and employed as mortar in      building eligible freehold tenements  he fumbled in his pocket but his hands were so numb that he could scarcely capture the nimble fourpence why should the nimble fourpence have the monopoly of agility  im blue ribbon tommy dont yer know said bill with regretful sullenness his ragged greatcoat indeed was decorated with the azure badge of avowed and total abstinence  blow yer blue ribbon hold on where ye are and ill bring the bloomin hammer myself  thus growling tommy strode indifferent through the snow his legs protected by bandages of straw ropes presently he reappeared in the warmer yellow of the light that poured through the windows of the old publichouse he was wiping his mouth with the back of his hand which he then thrust into the deeps of his pockets hugging a hammer to his body under his armpit  a little hot beer would do yer bloomin temper a deal more good than ten yards o blue ribbon at sixpence blue ruins more in my line observed thomas epigrammatically much comforted by his refreshment aid with two welldirected taps he knocked the pins out of their sockets and let down the backboard of the cart  bill uncomforted by ale sulkily jerked the horses forward the cart was tilted up and the snow tumbled out partly into the shallow shorewater partly on to the edge of the slope  ullo cried tommy suddenly eres an old coatsleeve a sticking out o the snow  alves exclaimed bill with a noble eye on the main chance  alves of course alves aint we on the same lay replied the chivalrous tommy then he cried lord preserve us mate theres a cove in the coat  he ran forward and clutched the elbow of the sleeve which stood up stiffly above the frozen mound of lumpy snow he might well have thought at first that the sleeve was empty such a very stick of bone and skin was the arm he grasped within it  here bill help us to dig him out poor chap  is he dead asked bill leaving the horses heads  dead hes bound to be dead under all that weight but how the dickens did he get into the cart guess we didnt shovel him in eh wed have seen him  by this time the two men had dragged a meagre corpse out of the snow heap a rough worn old pilotcoat a shabby pair of corduroy trousers and two broken boots through which the toes could be seen peeping ruefully were all the visible raiment of the body the clothes lay in heavy swathes and folds over the miserable bag of bones that had once been a tall man the peaked blue face was half hidden by a fell of irongray hair and a grizzled beard hung over the breast  the two men stood for some moments staring at the corpse a wretched woman in a thin gray cotton dress had come down from the bridge and shivered beside the body for a moment  hes a goner was her criticism i wish i was  with this aspiration she shivered back into the fog again walking on her unknown way by this time a dozen people had started up from nowhere and were standing in a tight ring round the body the behavior of the people was typical of london gazers no one made any remark or offered any suggestion they simply stared with all their eyes and souls absorbed in the unbought excitement of the spectacle they were helpless idealess interested and unconcerned  run and fetch a peeler bill said tommy at last  peeler be hanged bloomin likely i am to find a peeler fetch him yourself  sulky devil you are answered tommy who was certainly of milder mood whereas bill seemed a most unalluring example of the virtue of temperance it is true that he had only been blue ribbon since the end of his christmas boutthat is for nearly a fortnightand virtue a precarious tenant was not yet comfortable in her new lodgings  before tommy returned from his quest the dusk had deepened into night the crowd round the body in the peacoat had grown denser and it might truly be said that the more part knew not wherefore they had come together the centre of interest was not a fight they were sure otherwise the ring would have been swaying this way and that neither was it a dispute between a cabman and his fare there was no sound of angry repartees it might be a drunken woman or a man in a fit or a lost child so the outer circle of spectators who saw nothing waited and patiently endured till the moment of revelation should arrive respectable people who passed only glanced at the gathering respectable people may wonder but they never do find out the mystery within a london crowd on the extreme fringe of the mob were some amateurs who had just been drinking in the hit or miss they were noisy curious and impatient  at last tommy arrived with two policeman who acting on his warning had brought with them a stretcher he had told them briefly how the dead man was found in the cartload of snow  before the men in blue the crowd of necessity opened one of the officers stooped down and flashed his lantern on the heap of snow where the dead face lay as pale as its frozen pillow  lord its old dicky shields cried a voice in the crowd as the peaked still features were lighted up  the man who spoke was one of the latest spectators that had arrived after the news that some pleasant entertainment was on foot had passed into the warm alcoholic air and within the swinging doors of the hit or miss  you know him do you asked the policeman with the lantern  know him rather didnt i give him sixpence for rum when he tattooed this here cross and anchor on my arm dicky was a grand hand at tattooing bless you hed tattooed himself all over  the speaker rolled up his sleeve and showed on his burly red forearm the emblems of faith and hope rather neatly executed in blue  why he was in the hit or miss the speaker went on no later nor last night  wot beats me said tommy again as the policeman lifted the light corpse and tried vainly to straighten the frozen limbs wot beats me is how he got in this here cart of ours  hes light enough surely added tommy but i warrant we didnt chuck him on the cart with the snow in belgrave square  where do you put up at night asked one of the policemen suddenly he had been ruminating on the mystery  in the yard there behind that there hoarding answered tommy pointing to a breached and battered palisade near the corner of the publichouse  at the back of this ricketty plank fence with its particolored tatters of damp and torn advertisements lay a considerable space of waste ground the old houses that recently occupied the site had been pulled down probably as condemned slums in some moment of reform when people had nothing better to think of than the housing of the poor  there had been an idea of building model lodgings for tramps with all the latest improvements on the space but the idea evaporated when something else occurred to divert the general interest now certain sheds with roofs sloped against the nearest walls formed a kind of lumberroom for the parish  at this time the scavengers carts were housed in the sheds or outside the sheds when these were overcrowded not far off were stables for the horses and thus the waste ground was not left wholly unoccupied  was this cart o yours under the sheds all night or in the open asked the policeman with an air of penetration  just outside the shed wornt it bill replied tommy  bill said nothing being a person disinclined to commit himself  if the cart was outside said the policeman then the things plain enough you started from there didnt you with the cart in the afternoon  ay answered tommy  and there was a little sprinkle o snow in the cart  may be there wos i dont remember one way or the other  then you must be a stupid if you dont see that this here cove pointing to the dead man got drinking too much last night lost hisself and wandered inside the hoarding where he fell asleep in the cart  snow do make a fellow bloomin sleepy one of the crowd assented  well he never wakened no more and the snow had covered over his body when you started with the cart and him in it unbeknown hes light enough to make no difference to the weight was it dark when you started  one of them spells of fog was on you could hardly see your hand grunted tommy  well then its as plain asas the nose on your face said the policeman without any sarcastic intentions thats how it was  bravo bobby cried one of the crowd they should make you an inspector and set you to run in them dynamiting irish coves  the policeman was not displeased at this popular tribute to his shrewdness dignity forbade him however to acknowledge the compliment and he contented himself with lifting the two handles of the stretcher which was next him a covering was thrown over the face of the dead man and the two policemen with their burden began to make their way northward to the hospital  a small mob followed them but soon dwindled into a tail of street boys and girls these accompanied the body till it disappeared from their eyes within the hospital doors then they waited for half an hour or so and at last seemed to evaporate into the fog  by this time tommy and his mate had unharnessed their horses and taken them to stable the cart was housed beneath the sheds this time and bill had so far succumbed to the genial influences of the occasion as to tear off his blue badge and follow tommy into the hit or miss  a few chance acquaintances hospitable and curious accompanied them intent on providing with refreshments and plying with questions the heroes of so remarkable an adventure it is true that they already knew all tommy and bill had to tell but there is a pleasure in moments of emotional agitation in repeating at intervals the same questions and making over and again the same profound remarks the charm of these performances was sure to be particularly keen within the very walls where the dead man had probably taken his last convivial glass and where some light was certain to be thrown by the landlady or her customers on the habits and history of poor dicky shields     chapter iiian academic pothouse  the hit or miss tavern to customers rough customers at least who entered it on a foggy winter night seemed merely a public by the rivers brim not being ravaged and parched by a thirst for the picturesque tommy and his mates failed to pause and observe the architectural peculiarities of the building even if they had been of a romantic and antiquarian turn the fog was so thick that they could have seen little to admire though there was plenty to be admired the hit or miss was not more antique in its aspect than modern in its fortunes few publichouses if any boasted for their landlord such a person as robert maitland ma fellow of st gatiens in the university of oxford  it is perhaps desirable and even necessary to explain how this arrangement came into existence we have already made acquaintance with mine host of the hit or miss and found him to be by no means the rosy genial boniface of popular tradition that a man like maitland should be the lessee of a waterside tavern like the hit or miss was only one of the anomalies of this odd age of ours an age of revivals restorations experimentsan age of dukes who are socialistsan age which sees the eastend brawling in pall mall and parties of westend tourists personally conducted down ratcliffe highwayneed not wonder at maitlands eccentric choice in philanthropy  maitland was an orphan and rich he had been an unpopular lonely boy at a public school where he was known as a sap or assiduous student and was remarked for an almost unnatural indifference to cricket and rowing at oxford as he had plenty of money he had been rather less unpopular his studies ultimately won him a fellowship at st gatiens where his services as a tutor were not needed maitland now developed a great desire to improve his own culture by acquaintance with humanity and to improve humanity by acquaintance with himself this view of life and duty had been urged on him by his college coach philosopher and friend mr joseph bielby a man of some energy of character bielby had made maitland leave his desultory reading and dull hospitalities at st gatiens and betake himself to practical philanthropy  you tell me you dont see much in life bielby had said throw yourself into the life of others who have not much to live on  maitland made a few practical experiments in philanthropy at oxford he once subsidized a number of glaziers out on strike and thereon had his own windows broken by conservative undergraduates he urged on the citizens the desirability of running a steam tramway for the people from the station to cowley through worcester johns baliol and wadham gardens and magdalene his signature headed a petition in favor of having three devils or steamwhoopers yelling in different quarters of the town between five and six oclock every morning that the artisans might be awakened in time for the labors of the day  as maitlands schemes made more noise than progress at oxford bielby urged him to come out of his alma mater and practise benevolence in town he had a great scheme for building over hyde park and creating a palace of art in poplar with the rents of the new streets while pushing this ingenious idea in the columns of the daily trumpet maitland looked out for some humbler field of personal usefulness the happy notion of taking a philanthropic publichouse occurred to him and was acted upon at the first opportunity maitland calculated that in his own barroom he could acquire an intimate knowledge of humanity in its least sophisticated aspects he would sell good beer instead of drugged and adulterated stuff he would raise the tone of his customers while he would insensibly gain some of their exuberant vitality he would shake off the prig which he knew to be a strong element in his nature and would at the same time encourage temperance by providing good malt liquor  the scheme seemed feasible and the next thing to do was to acquire a tavern now maitland had been in the oxford movement just when æstheticism was fading out like a lovely sunstricken lily while philanthropy and political economy and mr henry george were coming in like roaring lions thus in maitland there survived a little of the old leaven of the student of renaissance a touch of the amateur of impressions and of antiquated furniture he was always struggling against this side as he called it of his culture and in his hours of reaction he was all for steam tramways devils and kindergartens standing where they ought not but there were moments when his old innocent craving for the picturesque got the upper hand and in one of those moments maitland had come across the chance of acquiring the lease of the hit or miss  that ancient bridgehouse pleased him and he closed with his opportunity the hit or miss was as attractive to an artistic as most publichouses are to a thirsty soul when the embankment was made the bridgehouse had been one of a street of similar quaint and manygabled old buildings that leaned up against each other for mutual support near the rivers edge but the embankment slowly brought civilization that way the dirty rickety old houses were both condemned and demolished till at last only the tavern remained with hoardings and empty spaces and a dustyard round it  the house stood at what had been a corner the redtiled roof was so highpitched as to be almost perpendicular the dormer windows of the attics were as picturesque as anything in nuremberg the sidewalls were broken in their surface by little odd redtiled roofs covering projecting casements and the house was shored up and supported by huge wooden beams you entered supposing you to enter a publichouse by a lowbrowed door in front if you passed in as ordinary customers did at one corner was an odd little board with the oldfashioned sign       jacks bridge house      hit or misslucks all  but there was a sidedoor reached by walking down a covered way over which the strong oaken rafters revealed by the unflaking of the plaster lay bent and warped by years and the weight of the building from this door you saw the side or rather the back which the house kept for its intimates a side even more picturesque with redtiled roofs and dormer windows than that which faced the street the passage led down to a slum and on the left hand as you entered lay the empty space and the dustyard where the carts were sheltered in sheds or left beneath the sky behind the ruinous hoarding  within the hit or miss looked cosey enough to persons entering out of the cold and dark there was heat light and a barparlor with a wide oldfashioned chimneyplace provided with seats within the ingle on these little benches did tommy and his friends make haste to place themselves comfortably disposed and thawing rapidly in a room within a room as it were for the big chimneyplace was like a little chamber by itself not on an ordinary night could such a party have gained admittance to the barparlor where maitland himself was wont to appear now and then when he visited the tavern and to produce by his mere presence and without in the least intending it an early closing movement  but tonight was no common night and mrs gullick the widowed landlady or rather manager was as eager to hear all the story of the finding of poor dicky shields as any of the crowd outside had been again and again the narrative was repeated till conjecture once more began to take the place of assertion  i wonder asked one of the men how old dicky got the money for a boose  the money ay and the chance said another that daughter of hisa nicelooking girl she iskept poor dicky pretty tight  didnt let him get the epigrammatist of the company was just beginning to put in when the brilliant witticism he was about to utter burst at once on the intellect of all his friends  didnt let him get tight you was agoin to say tommy howled three or four at once and there ensued a great noise of the slapping of thighs followed by chuckles which exploded at intervals like crackers  dicky ad been avin bad times for long the first speaker went on i guess he ad about tattooed all the parish as would stand a pint for tattooing there was hardly a square inch of skin not made beautiful forever about here  ah and there was no sale for his beastesses and birdses nuther or else he was clean sold out and hadnt no capital to renew his stock of hairy cats and young parrots  the very stuffed beasts perched above old dickys shop had got to look real mangey and mouldy i think i see them now the fox in the middle the longlegged moulting foreign bird at one end and that ere shiny old rhinoceros in the porch under them picters of the dying deer and tother deer swimming poor old dicky where he raised the price o a drain let alone a booze beats me it does  why said mrs gullick who had been in the outer room during the conversation why it was a sailor gentleman that stood dicky treat a most pleasantspoken man for a sailor with a big black beard he used to meet dicky here in the private room upstairs and there dicky used to do him a turn of his tradetattooing him like im doing him to pattern mum dicky sez sez he a facsimile o myself mum it wasnt much they drank neitherjust a couple of pints for sez the sailor gentleman he sez im afeared mum our friend here cant carry much even of your capital stuff we must excuse sez he the failings of an artis but i doesnt want his hand to shake or slip when hes a doin me sez he might  spile the pattern he sez also hurt and i wouldnt have served old dicky with more than was good for him myself not if it was ever so i wouldnt i promised that poor daughter of his before mr maitland sent her to schoolyears ago nowi promised as i would keep an eye on her father and speak ofa hangel if here isnt mr maitland his very self  and mrs gullick arose with bustling courtesy to welcome her landlord the fellow of st gatiens  immediately there was a stir among the men seated in the ingle one by onesome with a muttered pretence at excuse others with shamefaced awkwardnessthey shouldered and shuffled out of the room maitlands appearance had produced its usual effect and he was left alone with his tenant  well mrs gullick said poor maitland ruefully i came here for a chat with our friendsa little social relaxationon economic questions and i seem to have frightened them all away  oh sir theyre a rough lot and dont think themselves company for the likes of you but said mrs gullick eagerlywith the delight of the oldest aunt in telling the saddest taleyou ve heard this hawful story poor miss margaret sir it makes my blood  what physiological effect on the circulation mrs gullick was about to ascribe to alarming intelligence will never be known for maitland growing a little more pallid than usual interrupted her  what has happened to miss margaret tell me quick  nothing to herself poor lamb but her poor father sir  maitland seemed sensibly relieved  well what about her father  gone sirgone in a cartload o snow this very evening he was found just outside o this very door  in a cartload of snow cried maitland do you mean that he went away in it or that he was found in it dead  yes indeed sir dead for many hours the doctor said and in this very house he had been no later than last night and quite steady sir i do assure you he had been steadyoh steady for weeks  maitland assumed an expression of regret which no doubt he felt to a certain extent but in his sorrow there could not but have been some relief for maitland in the course of his philanthropic labors had known old dicky shields the naturalist and professional tattooer as a hopeless mauvais sujet but dickys daughter margaret had been a daisy flourishing by the grimy waterside till the young social reformer transplanted her to a school in the purer air of devonshire he was having her educated there and after she was educatedwhy then maitland had at one time entertained his own projects or dreams in the way of their accomplishment dicky shields had been felt as an obstacle not that he objectedon the other hand he had made maitland put his views in writing there were timesthere had lately above all been timeswhen maitland reflected uneasily on the conditional promises in this document dicky was not an eligible fatherinlaw however good and pretty a girl his daughter might be but now dicky had ceased to be an obstacle he was no longer as he certainly had been in any mans way he was nobodys enemy now not even his own  the vision of all these circumstances passed rapidly like a sensation rather than a set of coherent thoughts through maitlands consciousness  tell me everything you know of this wretched business he said rising and closing the door which led into the outer room  well sir you have not been here for some weeks or you would know that dicky had found a friend latelyan old shipmate or pettyofficer he called hima sailorman welltodo he seemed the mate of a merchant vessel he might be he had known dicky i think long ago at sea and hed bring him here to yarn with him he said once or twice it might be in this room but mainly in the parlor upstairs he let old dicky tattoo him a bit up there to put him in the way of earning an honest penny by his tradea queer trade it was never more than a pint or a glass of hot rum and water would he give the old man most considerate and careful sir he ever was well last night he brought him in about nine and they sat rather late and about twelve the sailor comes in rubbing his eyes and goodnight mum sez he my friends been gone for an hour an early bird he is and ive been asleep by myself if you please ill just settle our little score its the last for a long time for im bound tomorrow for the china seas eastward oh mum a sailors life so he pays changing a halfsovereign like a gentleman and out he goes and thats the last i ever see o poor dicky shields till he was brought in this afternoon out of the snowcart cold and stiff sir  and how do you suppose all this happened how did shields get into the cart  well thats just what theyve been wondering at though the cart was handy and uncommon convenient for a man as ad too much if ad he ad as believe it i cannot seeing a glass of hot rum and water would not intoxicate a babe may be he felt faint and laid down a bit and never wakened but lord a mercy whats that screamed mrs gullick leaping to her feet in terror  the latched door which communicated with the staircase had been burst open and a small brown bear had rushed erect into the room and with a cry had thrown itself on mrs gullicks bosom  well if ever i ad a fright that worthy lady exclaimed turning toward the startled maitland and embracing at the same time the little animal in an affectionate clasp well if ever there was such a child as you lizer what is the matter with you now  oh mother cried the bear i dreamed of that big bird i saw on the roof and i ran downstairs before i was arf awake i was that horful frightened  well you just go upstairs againand heres a sweetcake for youand you take this nightlight said mrs gullick producing the articles she mentioned and put it in the basin careful and knock on the floor with the poker if you want me if it wasnt for that bearskin mr toopny was kind enough to let you keep youd get your death o cold you would running about in the night and look ere lizer she added patting the child affectionately on the shoulder do get that there bird out o your head its just nothing but indigestion comes o you and the other childrenhimps they may well call you and himps im sure you arealways wasting your screws on pasty and lemonade and raspberry vinegar justnothing but indigestion  thus admonished the bear once more threw its arms in a tight embrace about mrs gullicks neck and then without lavishing attention on maitland passed out of the door and could be heard skipping upstairs  im sure sir i ask your pardon exclaimed poor mrs gullick but lizers far from well just now and she did have a scare last night or else which is more likely her little inside saving your presence has been upset with a supper the manager gave all them pantermime himps  but mrs gullick why is she dressed like a bear  shes such a favorite with the manager sir and the property man and all of them at the hilarity you cant think sir said mrs gullick not in the least meaning to impugn maitlands general capacity for abstract speculation a regular little genius that child is though i says it as shouldnt ah sir she takes it from her poor father sir and mrs gullick raised her apron to her eyes  now the late mr gullick had been a clown of considerable merit but like too many artists he was addicted beyond measure to convivial enjoyment maitland had befriended him in his last days and had appointed mrs gullick and a capital appointment it was to look after his property when he became landlord of the hit or miss  what a gift sir that child always had why when she was no more than four i well remember her going to fetch the beer and her being a little late and gullick with the thirst on him when she came in with the jug he made a cuff at her not to hurt her and if the little thing didnt drop the jug and take the knap lord i thought gullick would a died laughing and him so thirsty too  take the knap said maitland who imagined that the knap must be some malady incident to childhood  oh sir its when one person cuffs at another on the stage you know and the other slaps his own hand on the far side to make the noise of a box on the ear thats what we call taking the knap in the profession and the beer was spilt and the jug broken and alllizer was that clever and this is her second season just ended as a himp at the hilarity pantermime and theyre that good to her they let her bring her bearskin home with her what she wears you know sir as the little bear in the three bears dont you know sir  maitland was acquainted with the legend of the great bear the middle bear and the little tiny small bear and had even proved in a learned paper that the three bears were the sun the moon and the multitude of stars in the aryan myth but he had not seen the pantomime founded on the traditional narrative  but what was the child saying about a big bird he asked what was it that frightened her  oh sir i think it was just tiredness and may be a little something hot at that supper last night and besides seeing so many queer things in pantermimes might put notions in a childs head but when she came home last night a little late lizer was very strange she vowed and swore she had seen a large bird far bigger than any common bird skim over the street then when i had put her to bed in the attic down she flies screaming she saw the bird on the roof i had hard work to get her to sleep today i made her lay abed and wear her theatre pantermime bearskin that fits her like another skinand shell be too big for it next yearjust to keep her warm in that cold garret thats all about it sir shell be well enough in a day or two will lizer  i am sure i hope she will mrs gullick said maitland and as i am passing his way i will ask dr barton to call and see the little girl now i must go and i think the less we say to anyone about miss shields you know the better it will be very dreadful for her to learn about her fathers death and we must try to prevent her from hearing how it happened  certainly sir said mrs gullick bobbing and being safe away at school sir well hope she wont be told no more than she neednt know about it  maitland went forth into the thick night a halfhearted london thaw was filling the shivering air with a damp brown fog  he walked to the nearest telegraph office and did not observe in the raw darkness and in the confusion of his thoughts that he was followed at no great distance by a man muffled up in a greatcoat and a woollen comforter the stranger almost shouldered against him as he stood reading his telegram and conscientiously docking off a word here and there to save threepence       from robert maitland to miss marlett      the dovecot conisbeare      tiverton      i come tomorrow leaving by 1030 train do      not let margaret see newspaper her father dead      break news  this telegram gave maitland in his excited state more trouble to construct than might have been expected we all know the wondrous badness of postoffice pens or pencils and how they tear or blot the paper when we are in a hurry and maitland felt hurried though there was no need for haste meantime the man in the woollen comforter was buying stamps and finishing his bargain before the despatch was stamped and delivered went out into the fog and was no more seen     chapter ivmiss marletts  girls schools are chilly places the unfortunate victims when you chance to meet them mostly look but halfalive and dismally cold their noses however charming these features may become in a year or two or even may be in the holidays appear somehow of a frosty temperature in the long dull months of schooltime the hands too of the fair pupils are apt to seem larger than common inclined to blue in color and generally are suggestive of inadequate circulation À tendency to get as near the fire as possible to come within the frontiers of the hearthrug is forbidden and to cower beneath shawls is also characteristic of joyous girlhoodschoolgirlhood that is in fact one thinks of a girls school as too frequently a spot where no one takes any lively exercise for walking in a funereal procession is not exercise or mutes might be athletes and where there is apt to be a pervading impression of insufficient food insufficient clothing and general unsatisfied tedium  miss marletts establishment for the highest education of girls more briefly known as the dovecot conisbeare was no exception on a particularly cold february daythe day after dicky shields was found deadto these pretty general rules the dovecot before it became a girls school was no doubt a pleasant english home where the fires wass coot as the highlandman said the redbrick house with its lawn sloping down to the fields all level with snow stood at a little distance from the main road at the end of a handsome avenue of scotch pines but the fires at miss marletts were not good on this february morning they never were good at the dovecot miss marlett was one of those people who fortunately for themselves and unfortunately for persons dwelling under their roofs never feel cold or never know what they feel therefore miss marlett never poked the fire which consequently used to grow black toward its early death and was only revived at dangerously long intervals by the most minute doses of stimulant in the shape of rather damp small coals now supplies of coal had run low at the dovecot for the very excellent reason that the roads were snowed up and that convoys of the precious fuel were scarcely to be urged along the heavy ways  this did not matter much to the equable temperature of miss marlett but it did matter a great deal to her shivering pupils three of whom were just speeding their morning toilette by the light of one candle at the pleasant hour of five minutes to seven on a frosty morning  oh dear said one maidenjaney harman by namewhose blonde complexion should have been pink and white but was mottled with alien and unbecoming hues why wont that old cat let us have fires to dress by gracious margaret how black your fingers are  yes and i cant get them clean said margaret holding up two very pretty dripping hands and quoting in mock heroic parody       ho dogs of false tarentum      are not my hands washed white  no talking in the bedrooms young ladies came a voice accompanied by an icy draught from the door which was opened just enough to admit a fleeting vision of miss mariettas personal charms  i was only repeating my lay miss marlett replied the maiden thus rebuked in a tone of injured innocence       ho dogs of false tarentum  and the door closed again on miss marlett who had not altogether the best of it in this affair of outposts and could not help feeling as if that miss shields was laughing at her  old cat the young lady went on in a subdued whisper but no wonder my hands were a little black janey you forget that its my week to be stoker already girls by an early and unexpected movement i have cut off some of the enemys supplies  so speaking miss margaret shields proudly displayed a small deposit of coals stored for secrecy in the bottom of a clothesbasket  gracious daisy how clever well you are something like a stoker exclaimed the third girl who by this time had finished dressing we shall have a blaze tonight  now it must be said that at miss marletts school by an unusual and inconsistent concession to comfort and saniitary principles the elder girls were allowed to have fires in their bedrooms at night in winter but seeing that these fires resembled the laughter of the wicked inasmuch as they were brieflived as the crackling of thorns under pots the girls were driven to make predatory attacks on fuel wherever it could be found sometimes one is sorry to say they robbed each others fireplaces and concealed the coal in their pockets but this conductresembling what is fabled of the natives of the scilly islands that they eke out a precarious livelihood by taking in each others washingled to strife and bickering so that the stoker for the week as the girl appointed to collect these supplies was called had to infringe a little on the secret household stores of miss marlett this week as it happened margaret shields was the stoker and she so bore herself in her high office as to extort the admiration of the very housemaids       even the ranks of tusculum      could scarce forbear to cheer  if we may again quote the author who was at that time miss shields favorite poet miss shields had not studied mr matthew arnold and was mercifully unaware that not to detect the pinchbeck in the lays is the sign of a grovelling nature  before she was sent to miss marletts four years ere this date margaret shields instruction had been limited the best thing that could be said for it as the old sporting prophet remarked of his own education was that it had been mainly eleemosynary the chelsea school board fees could but rarely be extracted from old dicky shields but robert maitland when still young in philanthropy had seen the clever merry browneyed child at some school treat or inspection or other function had covenanted in some sort with her shiftless parent had rescued the child from the streets and sent her as a pupil to miss marletts like mr day the accomplished author of sandford and merton and creator of the immortal mr barlow robert maitland had conceived the hope that he might have a girl educated up to his own intellectual standard and made or readymade a helpmate meet for him he was in a more or less formal way the guardian of margaret shields and the ward might be expected by anyone who did not know human nature any better to blossom into the wife  maitland could please himself as people say that is in his choice of a partner he had no relations to pleaseno one but the elect young lady who after all might not be pleased with alacrity  whether pleased or not there could be no doubt that margaret shields was extremely pleasing beside her two shivering chambermates chamberdekyns they would have been called in oxford slang four hundred years ago miss shields looked quite brilliant warm and comfortable even in the eager and the nipping air of miss marletts shuddering establishment and by the frosty light of a single candle this young lady was tall and firmly fashioned a nutbrown maid with a ruddy glow on her cheeks with glossy hair rolled up in a big tight knot and with à smile which knew when it was well off always faithful to her lips these features it is superfluous to say in speaking of a heroine were rather too large for regular beauty she was perfectly ready to face the enemy in which light she humorously regarded her mistress when the loud cracked bell jangled at seven oclock exactly and the drowsy girls came trooping from the dormitories down into the wintry classrooms  arithmetical diversions in a cold chamber were the intellectual treat which awaited margaret and her companions arithmetic and slates does anyone remembercan anyone forgethow horribly distasteful a slate can be when the icy fingers of youth have to clasp that cold educational formation silurian i believe and to fumble with the greasy slatepencil with her colenso in her lap margaret shields grappled for some time with the mysteries of tare and tret tare an ouns i call it whispered janey harman who had taken in the holidays a course of levers irish novels margaret did not make very satisfactory progress with her commercial calculations after hopelessly befogging herself she turned to that portion of colensos engaging work which is most palpitating with actuality  if ten surrey laborers in mowing a field of forty acres drink twentythree quarts of beer how much cider will thirteen devonshire laborers consume in building a stone wall of thirteen roods four poles in length and four feet six in height  this problem also proved too severe for margarets mathematical endowments and it is extraordinary how childish the very greatest girls can be she was playing at oughts and crosses with janey harman when the arithmetic master came round he sat down not unwillingly beside miss shields erased without comment the sportive diagrams and set himself vigorously to elucidate by the low cunning of algebra the difficult sum from colenso  you see it is like this he said mumbling rapidly and scribbling a series of figures and letters which the pupil was expected to follow with intelligent interest but the rapidity of the processes quite dazed margaret a result not unusual when the teacher understands his topic so well and so much as a matter of course that he cannot make allowance for the benighted darkness of the learner  ninetyfive firkins fourteen gallons three quarts you see its quite simple said mr cleghorn the arithmetic master  oh thank you i see said margaret with the kind readiness of woman who would profess to see the secret of hegel or the inmost heart of the binomial theorem or the nature of the duties of coverpoint or the latest hypothesis about the frieze of the parthenon rather than be troubled with prolonged explanations which the expositor after all might find it inconvenient to give  arithmetic and algebra were not this scholars forte and no young lady in miss marletts establishment was so hungry or so glad when eight oclock struck and the bell rang for breakfast as margaret shields  breakfast at miss marletts was not a convivial meal there was a long narrow table with crosstables at each end these high seats or dais being occupied by miss marlett and the governesses at intervals down the table were stacked huge piles of bread and butterof extremely thick bread and surprisingly thin buttereach slice being divided into four portions the rest of the banquet consisted solely of tea whether this regimen was enough to support growing girls who had risen at seven till dinnertime at halfpast one is a problem which perhaps the inexperienced intellect of man can scarcely approach with confidence but if girls do not always learn as much at school as could be desired intellectually speaking it is certain that they have every chance of acquiring spartan habits and of becoming accustomed if familiarity really breeds contempt to despise hunger and cold not that miss marletts establishment was a dothegirls hall nor a school much more scantily equipped with luxuries than others but the human race has still to learn that girls need good meals just as much as or more than persons of maturer years boys are no better off at many places but boys have opportunities of adding bloaters and chops to their breakfasts which would be considered horribly indelicate and insubordinate conduct in girls  est ce que vous aimez les tartines à langlaise said janey harman to margaret  ce que jaime dans la tartine cest la simplicité primesautière da sa nature answered miss shields  it was one of the charms of the matinal meal as the author of guy livingstone calls breakfast that the young ladies were all compelled to talk french and such french during this period of refreshment  toutes choses la cuisine exceptée sont françaises dans cet établissement peu recréatif went on janey speaking low and fast  je déteste le français margaret answered mais je le préfère infiniment à lallemand  comment accentuez vous le mot préfère marguerite asked miss marlett who had heard the word and who neglected no chance of conveying instruction  oh two accentsone this way and the other that answered margaret caught unawares she certainly did not reply in the most correct terminology  vous allez perdre dix marks remarked the schoolmistress if incorrectly perhaps not too severely but perhaps it is not easy to say offhand what word miss marlett ought to have employed for marks  voici les lettres qui arrivent whispered janey to margaret as the postbag was brought in and deposited before miss marlett who opened it with a key and withdrew the contents  this was a trying moment for the young ladies miss marlett first sorted out all the letters for the girls which came indubitably and unmistakably from fathers and mothers then she picked out the other letters those directed to young ladies whom she thought she could trust and handed them over in honorable silence these maidens were regarded with envy by the others among them was not miss harman whose letters miss marlett always deliberately opened and read before delivering them  il y a une lettre pour moi et elle va la lire said poor janey to her friend who for her part never received any letters save a few at stated intervals from maitland these miss shields used to carry about in her pocket without opening them till they were all crumply at the edges then she hastily mastered their contents and made answer in the briefest and most decorous manner  qui est votre correspondent margaret asked we are not defending her french  cest le pauvre harry wyville answered janey il est souslieutenant dans les berkshires à aldershot pourquoi ne doit il pas écrire à moi il est comme on diroit mon frère  est il votre parent  non pas du tout mais je lai connu pour des ans oh pour des ans voici elle à deux dépêches télégraphiques janey added observing two orange colored envelopes which had come in the mailbag with the letters  as this moment miss marlett finished the fraternal epistle of lieutenant wyville which she folded up with a frown and returned to the envelope  jeanne je veux vous parler à part après dans mon boudoir remarked miss marlett severely and miss herman becoming a little blanched displayed no further appetite for tartines nor for french conversation  indeed to see another and a much older lady read letters written to one by a lieutenant at aldershot whom one has known for years and who is just like ones brother is a trial to any girl  then miss marlett betook herself to her own correspondence which as janey had noticed included two telegraphic despatches in orangecolored envelopes  that she had not rushed at these and opened them first proves the admirable rigidity of her discipline any other woman would have done so but it was miss marietta rule to dispose of the pupils correspondence before attending to her own business first pleasure afterward was the motto of this admirable woman  breakfast ended as the girls were leaving the room for the tasks of the day miss marlett beckoned margaret aside  come to me dear in the boudoir after janey harman said the schoolmistress in english and in a tone to which margaret was so unaccustomed that she felt painfully uneasy and anxiousunwonted moods for this careless maiden  janey something must have happened she whispered to her friend who was hardening her own heart for the dreadful interview  somethings going to happen im sure said poor janey apprehensively and then she entered the august presence alone  margaret remained at the further end of the passage leading to what miss marlett when she spoke french called her boudoir the girl felt colder than even the weather warranted she looked alternately at miss marietta door and out of the window across the dead blank flats to the low white hills far away just under the window one of the little girls was standing throwing crumbs remains of the tartines to robins and sparrows which chattered and fought over the spoil one or two blackbirds with their yellow bills fluttered shyly on the outside of the ring of more familiar birds up from the south a miserable bluegray haze was drifting and shuddering ominous of a thaw from the eaves and the branches of the trees heavy drops kept falling making round black holes in the snow and mixing and melting here and there in a yellowish plash  margaret shivered then she heard the boudoir door open and janey came out making a plucky attempt not to cry  what is it whispered margaret forgetting the dread interview before her and her own unformed misgivings  she wont give me the letter im to have it when i go home for good and im to go home for good at the holidays whimpered janey  poor janey said margaret petting the blonde head on her shoulder  margaret shields come here cried miss marlett in a shaky voice from the boudoir  come to the back musicroom when shes done with you the other girl whispered and margaret marched with a beating heart into miss marletts chamber  my dear margaret said miss marlett holding out her hands she was standing up in the middle of the boudoir she ought to have been sitting grimly fortified behind her bureau that was the position in which she generally received pupils on these gloomy occasions  my dear margaret she repeated the girl trembled a little as the schoolmistress drew her closer and made her sit down on a sofa  what has happened she asked her lips were so dry that she could scarcely speak  you must make up your mind to be very brave your father  was it an accident asked margaret suddenly she knew pretty well what was coming often she had foreseen the end which it needed no prophet to foretell was it anything very dreadful  mr maitland does not say you are to be called for today poor daisy  oh miss marlett i am so very unhappy the girl sobbed somehow she was kneeling now with her head buried in the elder ladys lap i have been horrid to you i am so wretched  a little kindness and a sudden trouble had broken down miss margaret shields for years she had been living like dr johnson at college with a sad and hungry heart trying to carry it off by her wild talk and her wit it was bitterness they mistook for frolic she had known herself to be a kind of outcast and she determined to hold her own with the other girls who had homes and went to them in the holidays margaret had not gone home for a year she had learned much working harder than they knew she had been in the best set among the pupils by dint of her cheery rebelliousness now she suddenly felt all her loneliness and knew too that she had been living socially in that little society at the expense of this kind queer old miss marletts feelings  i have been horrid to you she repeated i wish i had never been born  the schoolmistress said nothing at all but kept stroking the girls beautiful head surreptitiously miss marlett wiped away a frosty tear  dont mind me at last miss marlett said i never thought hardly of you i understood now you must go and get ready for your journey you can have any of the girls you like to help you to pack  miss marlett carried generosity so far that she did not even ask which of the girls was to be chosen for this service perhaps she guessed that it was the other culprit  then margaret rose and dried her eyes and miss marlett took her in her arms and kissed her and went off to order a travelling luncheon and to select the warmest railway rug she could find for the teacher though she was not a very learned nor judicious schoolmistress had a heart and affections of her own she had once it is true taken the word legibus dative plural of lex a law for an adjective of the third declension legibus legiba legibum and margaret had criticised this grammatical subtlety with an unsparing philological acumen as if she had been professor moritz haupt and miss marlett orelli and this had led to the end of latin lessons at the dovecot wherefore margaret was honored as a goddess by girls averse to studying the classic languages but now miss marlett forgot these things and all the other skirmishes of the past  margaret went wearily to her room where she bathed her face with cold water it could not be too cold for her a certain numb forgetfulness seemed to steep her mind while she was thus deadening her eyes again and again she felt as if she never wished to raise her eyes from this chilling consolation then when she thought she had got lid of all the traces of her trouble she went cautiously to the back musicroom janey was there moping alone drumming on the windowpane with her fingers  come to my room janey she said beckoning  now to consort together in their bedrooms during schoolhours was forbidden to the girls  why well only get into another scrape said janey ruefully  no come away ive got leave for you youre to help me to pack  to pack cried janey why youre not expelled are you youve done nothing youve not even had a perfectly harmless letter from a boy who is just like a brother to you and whom youve known for years  margaret only beckoned again and turned away janey following in silence and intense curiosity  when they reached their room where margarets portmanteau had already been placed the girl began to put up such things as she would need for a short journey she said nothing till she had finished and then she sat down on a bed and told janey what she had learned and the pair had a good cry and comforted each other as well as they might  and what are you going to do asked janey when as homer says they had taken their fill of chilling lamentations  i dont know  have you no one else in all the world  no one at all my mother died when i was a little child in smyrna since then we have wandered all about we were a long time in algiers and we were at marseilles and then in london  but you have a guardian havent you  yes he sent me here and of course hes been very kind and done everything for me but hes quite a young man not thirty and hes so stupid and so stiff and thinks so much about oxford and talks so like a book and hes so shy and always seems to do everything not because he likes it but because he thinks he ought to and besides  but margaret did not go further in her confessions nor explain more lucidly why she had scant affection for maitland of st gatiens  and had your poor father no other friends who could take care of you janey asked  there was a gentleman who called now and then i saw him twice he had been an officer in fathers ship i think or had known him long ago at sea he found us out somehow in chelsea there was no one else at all  and you dont know any of your fathers family  no said margaret wearily ob i have forgotten to pack up my prayerbook and she took up a little worn volume in black morocco with silver clasps this was a book my father gave me she said it has a name on itmy grandfathers i supposerichard johnson linkheaton 1837 then she put the book in a pocket of her travelling cloak  your mothers father it may have belonged to said janey  i dont know margaret replied looking out of the window  i hope you wont stay away long dear said janey affectionately  but you are going too you know margaret answered without much tact and janey reminded of her private griefs was about to break down when the wheels of a carriage were heard laboring slowly up the snowladen drive  why heres some one coming cried janey rushing to the window two horses and a gentleman all in furs oh margaret this must be for you     chapter vflown  maitlands reflections as in performance of the promise he had telegraphed he made his way to the dovecot were deep and distracted the newspapers with which he had littered the railway carriage were left unread he had occupation enough in his own thoughts men are so made that they seldom hear even of a death without immediately considering its effects on their private interests now the death of richard shields affected maitlands purposes both favorably and unfavorably he had for some time repented of the tacit engagement tacit as far as the girl was concerned which bound him to margaret for some time he had been dimly aware of quite novel emotions in his own heart and of a new rather painful rather pleasant kind of interest in another lady maitland in fact was becoming more human than he gave himself credit for and a sign of his awakening nature was the blush with which he had greeted some weeks before bartons casual criticism on mrs st john deloraine  without any welldefined ideas or hopes maitland had felt that his philanthropic entanglementit was rather he said to himself an entanglement than an engagementhad become irksome to his fancy now that the unfortunate parent was out of the way he felt that the daughter would not be more sorry than himself to revise the relations in which they stood to each other vanity might have prevented some men from seeing this but maitland had not vitality enough for a healthy conceit a curious aloofness of nature permitted him to stand aside and see himself much as a young lady was likely to see him this disposition is rare and not a source of happiness  on the other hand his future relations to margaret formed a puzzle inextricable he could not at all imagine how he was to dispose of so embarrassing a protégée margaret was becoming too much of a woman to be left much longer at school and where was she to be disposed of  i might send her to girton he thought and then characteristically he began to weigh in his mind the comparative educational merits of girton and somerville hall about one thing only was he certain he must consult his college mentor bielby of st gatiens as soon as might be too long had this rasselasoccupied like the famous prince of abyssinia with the choice of lifeneglected to resort to his academic imlac in the meantime he could only reflect that margaret must remain as a pupil at miss marletts the moment would soon be arriving when some other home and a chaperon instead of a schoolmistress must be found for this peculiar object of philanthropy and outdoor relief  maitland was sorry he had not left town by the nine oclock train the early dusk began to gather gray and damp the train was late having made tardy progress through the halfmelted snow he had set out from paddington by the halfpast ten express and a glance at the harsh and crabbed page of bradshaw will prove to the most sceptical that maitland could not reach tiverton much before six half frozen and in anything but a happy temper he engaged a fly and drove off along heavy miserable roads to the dovecot  arriving at the closed and barred gates of that vestal establishment maitlands cabman pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked for a considerable time without manifest effect clearly the retainers of miss marlett had secured the position for the night and expected no visitors though maitland knew that he ought to be expected the bandogs bayed and howled as they did round the secret bower of the lady of brauksome and lights flitted about the windows when a lantern at last came flickering up to the gate the bearer of it stopped to challenge an apparently unlookedfor and unwelcome stranger  who are you what do you want said a female voice in a strong devonian accent  i want miss marlett answered maitland  there was some hesitation then the porter appeared to reflect that a burglar would not arrive in a cab and that a surreptitious lover would not ask for the schoolmistress  the portals were at length unbarred and lugged apart over the gravel and maitland followed the cook for she was no one less and the candle up to the front door he gave his card and was ushered into the chamber reserved for interviews with parents and guardians the drawingroom had the air and faint smell of a room very seldom occupied all the chairs were so elegantly and cunningly constructed that they tilted up at intervals and threw out the unwary male who trusted himself to their hospitality their backs were decorated with antimacassars wrought with glass beads and these in the light of one dip shone fitfully with a frosty lustre on the round table in the middle were volumes of the mothers of england the grandmothers of the bible blair on the grave and the epic of hades the latter copiously and appropriately illustrated in addition to these cheerful volumes there were large tomes of lake and river scenery with gilt edges and faded magenta bindings shrouded from the garish light of day in drab paper covers  the walls of a very faint lilac tint were hung with prize sketches in water colors or in pencil by young ladies who had left in the former works of art distant nature was represented as on the whole of a mauve hue while the foreground was mainly composed of burntumber rocks touched up with orange the shadows in the pencil drawings had an agreeably brilliant polish like that which when conferred on fenders by somebodys patent domeblacklead increases the attractions of the fireside according to the advertisements maitland knew all the blacklead caves broadhatted brigands and peagreen trees they were old acquaintances and as he fidgeted about the room he became very impatient  at last the door opened and miss marlett appeared rustling in silks very stiff and with an air of extreme astonishment  mr maitland she said in an interrogative tone  didnt you expect me didnt you get my telegram asked maitland  it occurred to him that the storm might have injured the wires that his message might never have arrived and that he might be obliged to explain everything and break his bad news in person  yes certainly i got both your telegrams but why have you come here  why to see margaret shields of course and consult you about her but what do you mean by both my telegrams  miss marlett turned very pale and sat down with unexpected suddenness  oh what will become of the poor girl she cried and what will become of me it will get talked about the parents will hear of it and i am ruined  the unfortunate lady passed her handkerchief over her eyes to the extreme discomfiture of maitland he could not bear to see a woman cry and that miss marlett should crymiss marlett the least melting as he had fancied of her sexwas a circumstance which entirely puzzled and greatly disconcerted him  he remained silent looking at a flower in the pattern of the carpet for at least a minute  i came here to consult you miss marlett about what is to become of the poor girl but i do not see how the parents of the other young ladies are concerned death is common to all and margarets father though his life was exposed to criticism cannot be fairly censured because he has left it and what do you mean please by receiving both my telegrams i only sent one to the effect that i would leave town by the 1030 train and come straight to you there must be some mistake somewhere can i see miss shields  see miss shields why shes gone she left this morning with your friend said miss marlett raising a face at once mournful and alarmed and looking straight at her visitor  shes gone she left this morning with my friend repeated maitland he felt like a man in a dream  you said in your first telegram that you would come for her yourself and in your second that you were detained and that your friend and her fathers friend mr lithgow would call for her by the early train so she went with him  my friend mr lithgow i have no friend mr lithgow cried maitland and i sent no second telegram  then who did send it sir if you please for i will show you both telegrams cried miss marlett now on her defence and rising she left the room  while miss marlett was absent in search of the telegrams maitland had time to reflect on the unaccountable change in the situation what had become of margaret who had any conceivable interest in removing her from school at the very moment of her fathers accidental death and by what possible circumstances of accident or fraud could two messages from himself have arrived when he was certain that he had only sent one the records of somnambulism contain no story of a person who despatched telegrams while walking in his sleep then the notion occurred to maitland that his original despatch as he wrote it might have been mislaid in the office and that the imaginative clerk who lost it might have filled it up from memory and like the examinees in the poem might       have wrote it all by rote      and never wrote it right  but the fluttering approach of such an hypothesis was dispersed by the recollection that margaret had actually departed and what was worse had gone off with his friend mr lithgow clearly no amount of accident or mistake would account for the appearance of mr lithgow and the disappearance of margaret  it was characteristic of maitland that within himself he did not greatly blame the schoolmistress he had so little human natureas he admitted on the evidence of his old college tutorthat he was never able to see things absolutely and entirely from the point of view of his own interests his own personality was not elevated enough to command the whole field of human conduct he was always making allowances for people and never felt able to believe himself absolutely in the right and everyone else absolutely in the wrong had he owned a more fullblooded life he would probably have lost his temper and spoken his mind as the saying is to poor miss marlett she certainly should never have let margaret go with a stranger on the authority even of a telegram from the girls guardian  it struck maitland finally that miss marlett was very slow about finding the despatches she had been absent quite a quarter of an hour at last she returned pale and trembling with a telegraphic despatch in her hand but not alone she was accompanied by a blonde and agitated young lady in whom maitland having seen her before might have recognized miss janey harman but he had no memory for faces and merely bowed vaguely  this is miss harman whom i think you have seen on other occasions said miss marlett trying to be calm  maitland bowed again and wondered more than ever it did occur to him that the fewer people knew of so delicate a business the better for margarets sake  i have brought miss harman here mr maitland partly because she is miss shields greatest friend here janey sobbed but chiefly because she can prove to a certain extent the truth of what i have told you  i never for a moment doubted it miss marlett but will you kindly let me compare the two telegrams this is a most extraordinary affair and we ought to lose no time in investigating it and discovering its meaning you and i are responsible you know to ourselves if unfortunately to no one else for margarets safety  but i havent got the two telegrams exclaimed poor miss marlett who could not live up to the stately tone of maitland i havent got them or rather i only have one of them and i have hunted everywhere high and low for the other  then she offered maitland a single dispatch and the flimsy pink paper fluttered in her shaking hand  maitland took it up and read aloud       sent out at 745    received 751      from robert maitland to miss marlett      the dovecot conisbeare      tiverton      i come tomorrow leaving by 1030 train      do not let margaret see the newspaper      her father dead break news  why that is my own telegram cried maitland but what have you done with the other you said you received  that is the very one i cannot find though i had both on the escritoire in my own room this morning i cannot believe anyone would touch it i did not lock them away not expecting to have any use for them but i am quite sure the last time i saw them they were lying there  this is very extraordinary said maitland you tell me miss marlett that you received two telegrams from me on the strength of the later of the two you let your pupil go away with a person of whom you know nothing and then you have not even the telegram to show me how long an interval was there between the receipt of the two despatches  i got them both at once said poor trembling miss marlett who felt the weakness of her case they were both sent up with the letters this morning were they not miss harman  yes said janey i certainly saw two telegraphic envelopes lying among your letters at breakfast i mentioned it toto poor margaret she added with a break in her voice  but why were the telegrams not delivered last night maitland asked  i have left orders miss marlett answered that only telegrams of instant importance are to be sent on at once it costs twelve shillings and parents and people are so tiresome always telegraphing about nothing in particular and costing a fortune these telegrams were very important of course but nothing more could have been done about them if they had arrived last night than if they came this morning i have had a great deal of annoyance and expense the schoolmistress added with telegrams that had to be paid for  and here most people who live at a distance from telegraph offices and are afflicted with careless friends whose touch on the wire is easy and light will perhaps sympathize with miss marlett  you might at least have telegraphed back to ask me to confirm the instructions when you read the second despatch said maitland  he was beginning to take an argumentative interest in the strength of his own case it was certainly very strong and the excuse for the schoolmistress was weak in proportion  but that would have been of no use as it happens janey put inan unexpected and welcome ally to miss marlettbecause you must have left paddington long before the question could have reached you  this was unanswerable as a matter of fact and miss marlett could not repress a grateful glance in the direction of her wayward pupil  well said maitland it is all very provoking and very serious can you remember at all how the second message ran miss marlett  indeed i know it off by heart it was directed exactly like that in your hand and was dated half an hour later it ran plans altered margaret required in town my friend and her fathers mr lithgow will call for her soon after midday i noticed there were just twenty words  and did you also notice the office from which the message was sent out  no said miss marlett shaking her head with an effort at recollection i am afraid i did not notice  that is very unfortunate said maitland walking vaguely up and down the room do you think the telegram is absolutely lost  i have looked everywhere and asked all the maids  when did you see it last for certain  i laid both despatches on the desk in my room when i went out to make sure that margaret had everything comfortable before she started  and where was this mr lithgow then  he was sitting over the fire in my room trying to warm himself he seemed very cold  clearly then mr lithgow is now in possession of the telegram which he probably or rather certainly sent himself but how he came to know anything about the girl or what possible motive he can have had muttered maitland to himself she has never been in any place miss marlett since she came to you where she could have made the mans acquaintance  it is impossible to say whom girls may meet and how they may manage it mr maitland said miss marlett sadly when janey broke in  i am sure margaret never met him here she was not a girl to have such a secret and she could not have acted a part so as to have taken me in i saw him first out of the window margaret was very unhappy she had been crying i said heres a gentleman in furs margaret he must have come for you then she looked out and said it is not my guardian it is the gentleman whom i saw twice with my father  what kind of a man was he to look at  he was tall and dark and rather goodlooking with a slight black mustache he had a fur collar that went up to his eyes almost and he was not a young man he was a gentleman said janey who flattered herself that she recognized such persons as bear without reproach that grand old namewhen she saw them  would you know him again if you met him  anywhere said janey and i would know his voice  he wore mourning said miss marlett and he told me he had known margarets father i heard him say a few words to her in a very kind way about him that seemed more comfort to margaret than anything he did not suffer at all my dear he said he spoke to her in that way as an older man might  why how on earth could he know cried maitland no one was present when her poor father died his body was found in a and maitland paused rather awkwardly there was perhaps no necessity for adding to the public information about the circumstances of mr shields decease he was overcome by the cold and snow i mean on the night of the great storm  i have always heard that the death of people made drowsy by snow and fatigue is as painless as sleep said miss marlett with some tact  i suppose that is what the man must have meant maitland answered  there was nothing more to be said on either side and yet he lingered trying to think over any circumstance which might lend a clew in the search for margaret and of the mysterious mr lithgow  at last he said goodnight after making the superfluous remark that it would be as well to let everyone suppose that nothing unusual or unexpected had happened in this view miss marlett entirely concurred for excellent reasons of her own and now she began to regret that she had taken miss harman into her counsels but there was no help for it and when maitland rejoined his cabman who had been refreshed by tea a kind of informal treaty of peace was concluded between janey and the schoolmistress after all it appeared to miss marlett and correctly that the epistle from the young officer whom janey regarded as a brother was a natural and harmless communication it chiefly contained accounts of contemporary regimental sports and pastimes in which the writer had distinguished himself and if it did end yours affectionately there was nothing very terrible or inflammatory in that all things considered so the fair owner of the letter received it into her own keeping only she was never to do it again  miss marlett did not ask janey to say nothing about margarets inexplicable adventure she believed that the girl would have sufficient sense and good feeling to hold her peace and if she did not do so of her own accord no vows would be likely to bind her in this favorable estimate of her pupils discretion miss marlett was not mistaken  janey did not even give herself airs of mystery among the girls which was an act of creditable selfdenial the rest of the school never doubted that on the death of miss shields father she had been removed by one of her friends as for maitland he was compelled to pass the night at tiverton revolving many memories he had now the gravest reason for anxiety about the girl of whom he was the only friend and protector and who was undeniably the victim of some plot or conspiracy nothing more practical than seeking the advice of bielby of st gatiens occurred to his perplexed imagination     chapter viat st gatiens  the following day was spent by maitland in travel and in pushing such inquiries as suggested themselves to a mind not fertile in expedients he was not wholly unacquainted with novels of adventure and he based his conduct as much as possible on what he could remember in these authorities for example he first went in search of the man who had driven the cab which brought the mysterious mr lithgow to flutter the dovecot so far there was no difficulty one of the cabdrivers who plied at the station perfectly remembered the gentleman in furs whom he had driven to the school after waiting at the school till the young lady was ready he had conveyed them back again to the station and they took the uptrain that was all he knew the gentleman if his opinion were asked was a scaly varmint on inquiry maitland found that this wide moral generalization was based on the limited pourboire which mr lithgow had presented to his charioteer had the gentleman any luggage yes he had a portmanteau which he left in the cloakroom and took away with him on his return to townnot in the van in the railway carriage what could he want with all that luggage maitland wondered  the next thing was of course to find the guard of the train which conveyed margaret and her mysterious friend to taunton this official had seen the gentleman and the young lady get out at taunton they went on to london  the unfortunate guardian of margaret shields was now obliged to start for taunton and thence pursue his way and his inquiries as far as paddington the position was extremely irksome to maitland although in novels gentlemen often assume the rôle of the detective with apparent relish maitland was not cast by nature for the part he was too scrupulous and too shy he detested asking guards and porters and stationmasters and people in refreshmentrooms if they remembered having seen yesterday a gentleman in a fur coat travelling with a young lady of whom he felt that he had to offer only a too suggestive description the philanthropist could not but see that everyone properly constructed in imagination a satisfactory little myth to account for all the circumstancesa myth in which maitland played the unpopular part of the avenging brother or injured husband  what other path indeed was open to conjecture a gentleman in a fur coat and a young lady of prepossessing appearance are travelling alone together one day in a carriage marked engaged next day another gentleman not prepossessing and very nervous appears on the same route asking anxious questions about the wayfarer in the notable coat bearskin it seemed to have been and about the interesting young lady clearly the pair were the fond fugitives of love while the pursuer represented the less engaging interests of property of law and of the family all the romance and all the popular interest were manifestly on the other side not on maitlands side even his tips were received without enthusiasm  maitland felt these disadvantages keenly and yet he had neither the time nor the power to explain matters even if he had told everyone he met that he was really the young ladys guardian and that the gentleman in the fur coat was he had every reason to believe a forger and a miscreant he would not have been believed his opinion would not unjustly have been looked on as distorted by what mr herbert spencer calls the personal bias he had therefore to put up with general distrust and brief discourteous replies  there are many young ladies in the refreshmentbar at swindon there they gather numerous and fair as the seanymphsdoto proto doris and panope and beautiful galatea of them maitland sought to be instructed but the young ladies were arch and uncommunicative pretending that their attention was engaged in their hospitable duties soup it was their business to minister to travellers not private information they had seen the gentleman and lady very attentive to her he seemed yes they were on the best terms very sweet on each other one young lady averred and then secured her retreat and concealed her blushes by ministering to the wants of a hungry and hurried public all this was horribly disagreeable to maitland  maitland finally reached paddington still asking questions he had telegraphed the night before to inquire whether two persons answering to the oftrepeated description had been noticed at the terminus he had received a reply in the negative before leaving tiverton here then was a check if the ticketcollector was to be credited the objects of his search had reached westbourne park where their tickets had been taken there however all the evidence proved that they had not descended nobody had seen them alight yet not a trace was to be found at paddington of a gentleman in a fur coat nor of any gentleman travelling alone with a young lady  it was nearly nine oclock when maitland puzzled worn out and disgusted arrived in town he did what he could in the way of interrogating the portersall to no purpose in the crowd and bustle of passengers who skirmish for their luggage under inadequate lights no one remembered having seen either of the persons whom maitland described there remained the chance of finding out and crossexamining all the cabdrivers who had taken up passengers by the late trains the night before but that business could not be transacted at the moment nor perhaps by an amateur  maitlands time was limited indeed he had been obliged to get out at westbourne park and prosecute his inquisition there thence he drove to paddington and with brief enough space for investigations that yielded nothing he took his ticket by the 915 evening train for oxford his whole soul was set on consulting bielby of st gatiens whom in his heart maitland could not but accuse of being at the bottom of all these unprecedented troubles if bielby had not driven him as it were out of oxford by urging him to acquire a wider knowledge of humanity and to expand his character by intercourse with every variety of our fallen species maitland felt that he might now be vegetating in an existence peaceful if not well satisfied adventures are to the adventurous it is a hard thing when they have to be achieved by a champion who is not adventurous at all if he had not given up his own judgment to bielbys maitland told himself he never would have plunged into philanthropic enterprise he never would have taken the hit or miss he never would have been entangled in the fortunes of margaret shields and he would not now be concerned with the death in the snow of a dissipated old wanderer nor obliged to hunt down a runaway or kidnapped schoolgirl nor would he be suffering the keen and wearing anxiety of speculating on what had befallen margaret  his fancy suggested the most gloomy yet plausible solutions of the mystery of her disappearance in spite of these reflections maitlands confidence in the sagacity of his old tutor was unshaken bielby had not been responsible for the details of the methods by which his pupil was trying to expand his character lastly he reflected that if he had not taken bielbys advice and left oxford he never would have known mrs st john deloraine the lady of his diffident desires  so the time passed the minutes flitting by like the telegraph posts in the dark and maitland reached the familiar oxford station he jumped into a hansom and said gatiens past worcester up carfax down the high street they struggled through the snow and at last maitland got out and kicked at the college gate the porter it was nearly midnight opened it with rather a scared face  horful row on in quad sir he said the young gentlemen as a bonfire on and theyre a larking with the snow orful a theyre a making sir  the agricultural operation thus indicated by the porter was being forwarded with great vigor a number of young men in every variety of garb from ulsters to boatingcoats were energetically piling up a huge alp of snow against the door of the masters lodge meanwhile another band had carried into the quad all the light tables and cane chairs from a lectureroom having arranged these in a graceful pyramidal form they introduced some of the firelighters called devils by the college servants and set a match to the whole  maitland stood for a moment in doubt looking in the lurid glare very like a magician who has raised an army of fiends and cannot find work for them he felt no disposition to interfere though the venerable mass of st gatiens seemed in momentary peril and the noise was enough to waken the dead let alone the bursar of oriel but maitland was a nonresident fellow known only to the undergraduates where he was known at all as a radical with any number of decorative epithets according to the taste and fancy of the speaker he did not think he could identify any of the rioters and he was not certain that they would not carry him to his room and there screw him up according to precedent maitland had too much sense of personal dignity to face the idea of owing his escape from his chambers to the resources of civilization at the command of the college blacksmith he therefore after a moment of irresolution stole off under a lowbrowed old doorway communicating with a queer black manysided little quadrangle for it is by no means necessary that a quadrangle should in this least mathematical of universities be quadrangular groping and stumbling his familiar way up the darkest of spiral staircases maitland missed his footing and fell with the whole weight of his body against the door at which he had meant to knock  come in said a gruff voice as if the knocking had been done in the most conventional manner  maitland had come in by this time and found the distinguished mr bielby fellow of st gatiens sitting by his fireside attired in a gray shootingcoat and busy with a book and a pipe this gentleman had on taking his degree gone to town and practised with singular success at the chancery bar but on some sudden disgust or disappointment he threw up his practice returned to college and there lived a retired life among his brown greek manuscripts he was a man of the world turned hermit and the first of the kind whom maitland had ever known he had coached maitland though he usually took no pupils and remained his friend and counsellor  how are you maitland said the student without rising i thought from the way in which you knocked that you were some of the young men coming to draw me as i think they call it  mr bielby smiled as he spoke he knew that the undergraduates were as likely to draw him as boys who hunt a hare are likely to draw a fierce old bear that dwells among bones and blood  mr bielbys own environment to be sure was not of the grisly and mortuary character thus energetically described by the poet his pipe was in his hand his broad bald red face ending in an auburn spadeshaped beard wore the air of content around him were old books that had belonged to famous students of oldscaliger meursius muretusand before him lay the proofsheets of his longdeferred work a new critical edition of demetrius of scepsis  looking at his friend maitland envied the learned calm of a man who had not contrived in the task of developing his own human nature to become involved like his pupil in a singular and deplorable conjuncture of circumstances  the men are making a terrible riot in quad he said answering the others remark  yes yes replied bielby genially boys will be boys and so will young men i believe our torpid has bumped keble and the event is being celebrated  here there came a terrific howl from without and a crash of broken glass  there go some windows into their battels said mr bielby they will hear of this from the provost but what brings you here maitland so unexpectedly very glad to see you whatever it is  well sir said maitland i rather want to ask your advice on an important matter the fact is to begin at the beginning of a long story that some time ago i got more or less engaged to be married  this was not a very ardent or loverlike announcement but bielby seemed gratified  ahha replied the tutor with a humorous twinkle happy to hear it indeed i had heard a rumor a whisper a little bird as they say brought a hint of iti hope maitland a happy omen a pleasant woman of the world one who can take her own part in society and your part too a littleif you will let me say sois exactly what you need i congratulate you very heartily and are we likely to see the young lady in oxford where is she just now  maitland saw that the learned bielby had indeed heard something and not the right thing he flushed all over as he thought of the truth and of mrs st john deloraine  im sure i wish i knew said maitland at last beginning to find this consulting of the oracle a little difficult the fact is thats just what i wanted to consult you about iim afraid ive lost all traces of the young lady  why what do you mean asked the don his face suddenly growing grave while his voice had not yet lost its humorous tone she has not eloped you dont mean to tell me she has run away from you  i really dont know what to say answered maitland im afraid she has been run away with that she is the victim of some plot or conspiracy  you surely cant mean what you say and now the voice was gruffer than ever people dont plot and conspire nowadays if ever they did which probably they didnt and who are the young ladys people why dont they look after her i had heard she was a widow but she must have friends  she is not a widowshe is an orphan said maitland blushing painfully i am her guardian in a kind of way  why the wrong stories have reached me altogether im sure i beg your pardon but did you tell me her name  her name is shieldsmargaret shieldsnot the name i was told muttered bielbyand her father was a man who had been rather unsuccessful in life  what was his profession what did he do  he had been a sailor i think said the academic philanthropist but when i knew him he had left the sea and was in fact as far as he was anything a professional tattooer  whats that  he tattooed patterns on sailors and people of that class for a livelihood  bielby sat perfectly silent for a few minutes and no one who saw him could doubt that his silence arose from a conscious want of words on a level with the situation  has misshm spearsshields thank you has she been an orphan long he asked at length he was clearly trying to hope that the most undesirable prospective fatherinlaw described by maitland had long been removed from the opportunity of forming his daughters character  i only heard of his death yesterday said maitland  was it sudden  why yes the fact is he was a man of rather irregular habits and he was discovered dead in one of the carts belonging to the vestry of st georges hanover square  st georges hanover square indeed said the don and once more he relapsed after a long whistle into a significant silence maitland he said at last how did you come to be acquainted with these people the father as i understand was a kind of artist but you cant surely have met them in society  he came a good deal to my publichouse the hit or miss i think i told you about it sir and you rather seemed to approve of it the tavern in chelsea if you remember where i was trying to do something for the riverside population and to mix with them for their good you know  goodnight growled bielby very abruptly and with considerable determination in his tone i am rather busy this evening i think you had better think no more about the young lady and say nothing whatever about the matter to anyone goodnight  so speaking the hermit lighted his pipe which in the astonishment caused by maitlands avowals he had allowed to go out and he applied himself to a large old silver tankard he was a scholar of the cambridge school and drank beer maitland knew his friend and mentor too well to try to prolong the conversation and withdrew to his bleak college room where a timid fire was smoking and crackling among the wet faggots with a feeling that he must steer his own course in this affair it was clearly quite out of the path of bielbys experience  and yet thought maitland if i had not taken his advice about trying to become more human and taken that infernal publichouse too i never would have been in this hole  all day maitland had scarcely tasted anything that might reasonably be called food he had eaten he had not dined to adopt the distinction of brillatsavarin he had been dependent on the gritty and flaccid hospitalities of refreshmentrooms on the sandwich and the bun now he felt faint as well as weary but rummaging amidst his cupboards he could find no provisions more tempting and nutritious than a box of potted shrimps from the college stores and a bottle of some hungarian vintage sent by an advertising firm to the involuntary bailees of st gatiens maitland did not feel equal to tackling these delicacies  he did not forget that he had neglected to answer a note on philanthropic business from mrs st john deloraine  weary as he was he took pleasure in replying at length and left the letter out for his scout to post then with a heavy headache he tumbled into bed where for that matter he went on tumbling and tossing during the greater part of the night about five oclock he fell into a sleep full of dreams only to be awakened at six by the steamwhooper or devil a sweet boon with which his philanthropy had helped to endow the reluctant and even recalcitrant university of oxford  instead of becoming human i have only become humanitarian maitland seemed to hear his own thoughts whispering to himself in a nightmare through the slowly broadening winter dawn in snatches of sleep that lasted or seemed to last five minutes at a time maitland felt the thought repeating itself like some haunting refrain with a feverish iteration     chapter viiafter the inquest  to be ill in college rooms how miserable it is mainlands scout called him at halfpast seven with the invariable question do you breakfast out sir if a man were in the condemned cell his scout if in attendance would probably arouse him on the morning of his execution with do you breakfast out sir  no said maitland in reply to the changeless inquiry in common room as usual pack my bag i am going down by the nine oclock train  then he rose and tried to dress but his head ached more than ever his legs seemed to belong to someone else and to be no subject of just complacency to their owner he reeled as he strove to cross the room then he struggled back into bed where feeling alternately hot and cold he covered himself with his ulster in addition to his blankets anywhere but in college maitland would of course have rung the bell and called his servant but in our conservative universities and especially in so reverend a pile as st gatiens there was naturally no bell to ring maitland began to try to huddle himself into his greatcoat that he might crawl to the window and shout to dakyns his scout  but at this moment there fell most gratefully on his ear the sound of a strenuous sniff repeated at short intervals in his sittingroom often had maitland regretted the chronic cold and handkerchiefless condition of his bedmaker but now her sniff was welcome as music much more so than that of two hunting horns which ambitious sportsmen were trying to blow in quad  mrs trattles cried maitland and his own voice sounded faint in his ears mrs trattles  the lady thus invoked answered with becoming modesty punctuated by sniffs from the other side of the door  yes sir can i do anything for you sir  call dakyns please said maitland falling back on his pillow i dont feel very well  dakyns appeared in due course  sorry to hear youre ill sir you do look a little flushed hadnt i better send for mr whalley sir  now mr whalley was the doctor whom oxford especially the younger generation delighted to honor  no i dont think you need bring me breakfast here i think ill be able to start for town by the 1158 and bring me my letters  very well sir answered dakyns  then with that fearless assumption of responsibility which always does an englishman credit he sent the college messenger in search of mr whalley before he brought round maitlands letters and his breakfast commons  there were no letters bearing on the subject of margarets disappearance if any such had been addressed to him they would necessarily be as maitland remembered after his first feeling of disappointment at his rooms in london neither miss marlett if she had aught to communicate nor anyone else could be expected to know that maitlands first act would be to rush to oxford and consult bielby  the guardian of margaret turned with no success to his breakfast commons even tea appeared unwelcome and impossible  maitland felt very drowsy dull indifferent when a knock came to his door and mr whalley entered he could not remember having sent for him but he felt that as an invalid once said there was a pain somewhere in the room and he was feebly pleased to see his physician  a very bad feverish cold was the verdict and mr whalley would call again next day till which time maitland was forbidden to leave his room  he drowsed through the day disturbed by occasional howls from the quadrangle where the men were snowballing a little and later by the scraping shovels of the navvies who had been sent in to remove the snow and with it the efficient cause of nocturnal disorders in st gatiens  so the time passed maitland not being quite conscious of its passage and each hour putting margaret shields more and more beyond the reach of the very few people who were interested in her existence maitlands illness took a more severe form than whalley had anticipated and the lungs were affected bielby was informed of his state and came to see him but maitland talked so wildly about the hit or miss about the man in the bearskin coat and other unintelligible matters that the hermit soon withdrew to the more comprehensible fragments of demetrius of scepsis he visited his old pupil daily and behaved with real kindness but the old implicit trust never revived with maitlands returning health  at last the fever abated maitland felt weak yet perfectly conscious of what had passed and doubly anxious about what was to be done if there was indeed a chance of doing anything  men of his own standing had by this time become aware that he was in oxford and sick consequently there was always someone to look after him  brown said maitland to a friend on the fifth day after his illness began would you mind giving me my things ill try to dress  the experiment was so far successful that maitland left the queer bare slit of a place called his bedroom formed like many oxford bedrooms by a partition added to the large single room of old times and moved into the weirdly aesthetic study decorated in the early william morris manner  now will you howl for dakyns and make him have this telegram sent to the post awfully sorry to trouble you but i cant howl yet for myself whispered maitland huskily as he scribbled on a telegraph form  delighted to howl for you said brown and presently the wires were carrying a message to barton in town maitland wanted to see him at once on very pressing business in a couple of hours there came a reply barton would be with maitland by dinnertime  the ghostly room in the early william morris manner looked cosey and even homelike when the lamp was lit when the dusky blue curtains were drawn and a monster of the deepone of the famous oxford soles larger than you ever see them elsewheresmoked between maitland and barton beside the latter stood a silver quart pot full of strong a reminiscence of the old coaching days when maitland had read with barton for greats the invalids toast and water wore an air of modest conviviality and might have been mistaken for sherry by anyone who relied merely on such information as is furnished by the sense of sight the wing of a partridge the remainder of the brace fell to bartons lot was disposed of by the patient and then over the wine which he did not touch and the walnuts which he tried nervously to crack in his thin white hands maitland made confession and sought advice  it was certainly much easier talking to barton than to bielby for barton knew so much already especially about the hit or miss but when it came to the story of the guardianship of margaret and the kind of prospective engagement to that young lady barton rose and began to walk about the room but the old beams creaked under him in the weak places and barton seeing how much he discomposed maitland sat down again and steadied his nerves with a glass of the famous st gatiens port  then when maitland in the orderly course of his narrative came to the finding of poor dick shields body in the snowcart barton cried why you dont mean to say that was the man the girls father by george i can tell you something about him at the inquest my partner old munby made out  has there been an inquest already oh of course there must have been said maitland whose mind had run so much on margarets disappearance that he had given little of his thoughts weak and inconsecutive enough of late to the death of her father  of course there has been an inquest have you not read the papers since you were ill  now maitland had the commonroom back numbers of the times since the day of his return from devonshire in his study at that very moment but his reading so far had been limited to the agony column of the advertisements where he half hoped to find some message and to all the paragraphs headed strange occurrence and mysterious disappearance none of these had cast any light on the fortunes of margaret  i have not seen anything about the inquest he said what verdict did they bring in the usual one i supposevisitation and all that kind of thing or death from exposure while under the influence of alcoholic stimulants  thats exactly what they made it said barton and i dont blame them for the medical evidence my worthy partner gave left them no other choice you can see what he said for yourself in the papers  barton had been turning over the file of the times and showed maitland the brief record of the inquest and the verdict matters so common that their chronicle might be and perhaps is kept stereotyped with blanks for names and dates  a miserable end said maitland when he had perused the paragraph and now i had better go on with my story but what did you mean by saying you didnt blame the coroners jury  have you any more story is it not enough i dont know that i should tell you it is too horrid  dont keep anything from me please said maitland moving nervously i must know everything  well answered barton his voice sinking to a tone of reluctant horrorwell your poor friend was murdered thats what i meant when i said i did not blame the jury they could have given no other verdict than they did on the evidence of my partner  murder the very word has power to startle as if the crime were a new thing not as old so all religions tell us as the first brothers as a meteoric stone falls on our planet strange and unexplained a waif of the universe from a nameless system so the horror of murder descends on us when we meet it with an alien dread as of an intrusion from some lost star some wandering world that is hell  murdered cried maitland why barton you must be dreaming who on earth could have murdered poor shields if ever there was a man who was no ones enemy but his own that man was shields and he literally had nothing that anyone could have wanted to steal i allowed him so mucha small sumpaid weekly on thursdays and it was a wednesday when he waswhen he died he could not have had a shilling at that moment in the world  i am very sorry to have to repeat it but murdered he was all the same and that by a very cunning and cautious villaina man i should say of some education  but how could it possibly have been done theres the evidence before you in the paper there was not a trace of violence on him and the circumstances which were so characteristic of his ways were more than enough to account for his death the exposure the cold the mere sleeping in the snowits well known to be fatal why said maitland eagerly in a long walk home from shooting in winter i have had to send back a beater for one of the keepers and we found him quite asleep in a snowdrift under a hedge he never would have wakened  he was naturally anxious to refute the horrible conclusion which barton had arrived at  the young doctor only shook his head his opinion was manifestly fixed  but how can you possibly know better than the jury urged maitland peevishly and the coroner and the medical officer for the district who were all convinced that his death was perfectly naturalthat he got drunk lost his way laid down in the cart and perished of exposure why you did not even hear the evidence i cant make out he went on with the querulousness of an invalid why you should have come up just to talk such nonsense the coroner and the jury are sure to have been right  well you see it was not the coroners business nor the jurys business to know better than the medical officer for the district on whose evidence they relied but it is my business for the said officer is my partner and but for me our business would be worth very little he is about as ignorant and easygoing an excellent old fellow as ever let a life slip out of his hands  then if you knew so much why didnt you keep him straight  well as it happened i was down in surrey with my people at a wedding when the death occurred and they made a rather superficial examination of the deceased  still i see less than ever how you got a chance to form such an extraordinary and horrible opinion if you were not there and had only this printed evidence said maitland waving a sheet of the times to go by and this is dead against you youre too clever  but i made a proper and most careful examination myself on my return to town the day after the inquest said barton and i found evidence enough for menever mind whereto put the matter beyond the reach of doubt the man was murdered and murdered as i said very deliberately by some one who was not an ordinary ignorant scoundrel  still i dont see how you got a chance to make your examination said maitland the man would be buried as usual  excuse me the unclaimed bodies of paupersand there was no one to claim hisare reserved if needed  i seedont go on said maitland turning rather pale and falling back on his sofa where he lay for a little with his eyes shut it is all the fault of this most unlucky illness of mine he said presently in my absence and as nobody knew where i was there was naturally no one to claim the body the kind of people who knew about him will take no trouble or risk in a case like that he was silent again for a few moments then what do you make out to have been tbe cause of death he asked  well said barton slowly i dont much care to go into details which you may say i can hardly prove and i dont want to distress you in your present state of health  why dont you speak out was he poisoned did you detect arsenic or anything he had been drinking with some one  no if in a sense he had been poisoned there was literally nothing that could be detected by the most skilled analysis but my dear fellow there are venoms that leave no internal trace if i am rightand i think i amhe was destroyed by one of these he had been a great traveller had he not  yes answered maitland  well it is strange the murderer must have been a great traveller also he must have been among the macoushi indians of guiana and well acquainted with their arts i know them too i went there botanizing  you wont be more explicit  no he said you must take it on my word after all  maitland if not convinced was silent he had knowledge enough of barton and of his healthy and joyous nature to be certain that his theory was no morbid delusion that he had good grounds for an opinion which as he said he could no longer provewhich was indeed now incapable of any proof no one had seen the commission of tbe crime and the crime was of such a nature and so cunningly planned that it could not possibly be otherwise brought home to the murderer  now maitland knowing the hit or miss and the private room upstairs with the dormer windows where the deed must have been done if done at all was certain that there could not possibly have been any eyewitness of the crime  what shall you do he asked or have you done anything in consequence of your discovery have you been to the police  no said barton where was the use how can i prove anything now it is not as if poison had been used that could be detected by analysis besides i reflected that if i was right the less fuss made the more likely was the murderer to show his hand supposing he had a secret motiveand he must have hadhe will act on that motive sooner or later the quieter everything is kept the more he feels certain he is safe the sooner he will move in some way or other then perhaps there may be a chance of detecting him but its an outside chance do you know anything of the dead mans past history  nothing except that he was from the north and had lived a wandering life  well we must wait and see but there is his daughter left under your care what do you mean to do about her  the question brought maitland back to his old perplexities which were now so terribly increased and confused by what he had just been told  i was going to tell you when you broke in with this dreadful business things were bad before now they are awful said maitland his daughter has disappeared that was what i was coming to that was the rest of my story it was difficult and distressing enough before i knew what you tell me nowgreat heavens what am i to do  he turned on the sofa quite overcome barton put his hand encouragingly on his shoulder and sat so for some minutes  tell me all about it old boy asked barton at length  he was very much interested and most anxious to aid his unfortunate friend his presence somehow was full of help and comfort maitland no longer felt alone and friendless as he had done after his consultation of bielby thus encouraged he told as clearly and fully as possible the tale of the disappearance of margaret and of his entire failure even to come upon her traces or those of her companion  and you have heard nothing since your illness  nothing to any purpose what do you advise me to do  there is only one thing certain to my mind said barton the seafaring man with whom shields was drinking on the last night of his life and the gentleman in the fur travellingcoat who sent the telegram in your name and took away margaret from miss marletts are in the same employment or by george are probably the same person now have you any kind of suspicion who they or he may be or can you suggest any way of tracking him or them  no said maitland my mind is a perfect blank on the subject i never heard of the sailor till the woman at the hit or miss mentioned him the night the body was found and i never heard of a friend of shields a friend who was a gentleman till i went down to the school  then all we can do at present is not to set the police at workthey would only prevent the man from showingbut to find out whether anyone answering to the description is wanted or is on their books at scotland yard why are we not in paris where a man whatever his social position might be who was capable of that unusual form of crime would certainly have his dossier they order these things better in france  there is just one thing about him at least about the man who was drinking with poor shields on the night of his death he was almost certainly tattooed with some marks or other indeed i remember mrs gullickthats the landlady of the hit or misssaying that shields had been occupied in tattooing him he did a good deal in that way for sailors  by jove said barton if any fellow understands tattooing and the class of jailbirds who practise it i do it is a clew after a fashion but after all many of them that go down to the sea in ships are tattooed even when they are decent fellows and besides we seldom in our stage of society get a view of a fellowcreature with nothing on but these early decorative designs  this was only too obvious and rather damping to maitland who for a moment had been inclined to congratulate himself on his flair as a detective     chapter viiithe jaffa oranges  letting i dare not wait upon i would  of all fairy gifts surely the most desirable in prospect and the most embarrassing in practice would be the magical telescope of prince ali in the arabian nights with his glass it will be remembered he could see whatever was happening on whatever part of the earth he chose and though absent was always able to behold the face of his beloved how often would one give aladdins lamp and fortunatus purse and the invisible cap which was made of a darkness that might be felt to possess for one hour the telescope of fairyland  could maitland and barton have taken a peep through the tube while they were pondering over the means of finding margaret their quest would have been aided indeed but they would scarcely have been reassured yet there was nothing very awful nor squalid nor alarming as they might have expected anticipated and dreaded in what the vision would have shown margaret was not in some foreign den of iniquity nor indeed in a den at all  the tube enchanted would have revealed to them margaret not very far off not in siberia nor teheran but simply in victoria square pimlico sw there in a bedroom not more than commonly dingy on the drawingroom floor with the rattling old green venetian blinds drawn down margaret would have been displayed the testimony of a cloud of witnesses in the form of phials and medical vessels proved that she had for some time been an invalid the pretty dusky red of health would have been seen to have faded from her cheeks and the fun and daring had died out of her eyes the cheeks were white and thin the eyes were halfclosed from sickness and fatigue and margaret a while ago so ready of speech did not even bestir herself to answer the question which a gentleman who stood almost like a doctor in an attitude of respectful inquiry was putting as to her health  he was a tall gentleman dark with a ripe kind of face and full red sensitive sensual lips not without a trace of humor near the door in a protesting kind of attitude as if there against her will was a remarkably handsome young person attired plainly as a housekeeper or upperservant the faces of some women appear to have been furnished by nature or informed by habit with an aspect that seems to say in fair members of the less educated classes i wont put up with none of them goings on such an expression this woman wears  i hope you feel better my dear the dark gentleman asks again  shes going on well enough interrupted the woman with the beautiful dissatisfied face what with peaches and grapes from covent garden and tonics as you might bathe in  heaven forbid  she ought to get well the dissatisfied woman continued as if the invalid were obstinately bent on remaining ill  i was not speaking at the moment to you mrs darling said the dark gentleman with mockery in his politeness but to the young lady whom i have entrusted to your charge  a pretty trust the woman replied with a sniff  yes as you kindly say an extremely pretty trust and now margaret my dear  the fair woman walked to the window and stared out of it with a trembling lip and eyes that saw nothing  now margaret my dear tell me for yourself how do you feel  you are very kind answered the girl at last i am sure i am better i am not very strong yet i hope i shall get up soon  is there anything you would like perhaps you are tired of peaches and grapes may i send you some oranges  oh thank you you are very good i am often thirsty when i waken or rather when i leave off dreaming i seem to dream rather than sleep just now  poor girl said the dark gentleman in a pitying voice and what do you dream  there seems to be a dreadful quiet smooth white place said the girl slowly where i am and something i feelsomething i dont know whatdrives me out of it i cannot rest in it and then i find myself on a dark plain and a great black horror a kind of blackness falling in drifts like black snow in a wind sweeps softly over me till i feel mixed in the blackness and there is always some one watching me and chasing me in the darksome one i cant see then i slide into the smooth white horrible place again and feel i must get away from it oh i dont know which is worst and they go and come all the while im asleep i suppose  i am waiting for the doctor to look in again but all i can do is to get you some jaffa oranges nice large ones myself you will oblige me mrs darling he turned to the housekeeper by placing them in miss burnsides room and then perhaps she will find them refreshing when she wakes goodby for the moment margaret  the fair woman said nothing and the dark gentleman walked into the street where a hansom cab waited for him covent garden he cried to the cabman  we have not for some time seen or rather we have for some time made believe not to recognize the hon thomas cranley whose acquaintance a very compromising one we achieved early in this narrative  mr cranley with his own substantial private purpose sunclear before him as mr carlyle would have said in apologizing for some more celebrated villain had enticed margaret from school nor had this been to a person of his experience and resources a feat of very great difficulty when he had once learned by the simplest and readiest means the nature of maitlands telegram to miss marlett his course had been dear the telegram which followed maitlands and in which cranley used maitlands name had entirely deceived miss marlett as we have seen by the most obvious ruses he had prevented maitland from following his track to london his housekeeper had entered the engaged carriage at westbourne park and shared as far as the terminus the compartment previously occupied by himself and margaret alone between westbourne park and paddington he had packed the notable bearskin coat in his portmanteau the consequence was that at paddington no one noticed a gentleman in a bearskin coat travelling alone with a young lady a gentleman in a light ulster travelling with two ladies by no means answered to the description maitland gave in his examination of the porters they moreover had paid but a divided attention to maitlands inquiries  the success of cranleys device was secured by its elementary simplicity a gentleman who for any reason wishes to obliterate his trail does wisely to wear some very notable conspicuous unmistakable garb at one point of his progress he then becomes in the minds of most who see him the man in the bearskin coat or the man in the jackboots or the man with the white hat his identity is practically merged in that of the coat or the boots or the hat and when he slips out of them he seems to leave his personality behind or to pack it up in his portmanteau or with his rugs by acting on this principle which only requires to be stated to win the assent of pure reason mr cranley had successfully lost himself and margaret in london  with margaret his task had been less difficult than it looked she recognized him as an acquaintance of her fathers and he represented to her that he had been an officer of the manofwar in which her father had served that he had lately encountered her father and pitied his povertyin poor shields an irremediable condition the father so he declared had spoken to him often and anxiously about margaret and with dislike and distrust about maitland according to mr cranley shields chief desire in life had been to see margaret entirely free from maitlands guardianship but he had been conscious that to take the girl away from school would be harmful to her prospects finally with his latest breath so mr cranley declared he had commended margaret to his old officer and had implored him to abstract her from the charge of the fellow of st gatiens  margaret as we know did not entertain a very lively kindness for maitland nor had she ever heard her father speak of that unlucky young man with the respect which his kindness his academic rank and his position in society deserved it must be remembered that concerning the manner of her fathers death she had shrunk from asking questions she knew it had been sudden she inferred that it had not been reputable often had she dreaded for him one of the accidents against which providence does not invariably protect the drunkard now the accident had arrived she was fain to be ignorant of the manner of it her new guardian again was obviously a gentleman he treated her with perfect politeness and respect and from the evening of the day when she left school she had been in the charge of that apparently correct chaperon the handsome housekeeper with the disapproving countenance mr cranley had even given up to her his own rooms in victoria square and had lodged elsewhere his exact address margaret did not know the only really delicate pointcranleys assumption of the name of mr lithgowhe frankly confessed to her as soon as they were well out of the dovecot he represented that for the fulfilment of her fathers last wish the ruse of the telegram and the assumed name had been necessary though highly repugnant to the feelings of an officer and a gentleman poor margaret had seen nothing of gentlemen except as philanthropists and as we know philanthropists permit themselves a license and discretion not customary in common society  finally even had the girls suspicions been awakened her illness prevented her from too closely reviewing the situation she was with her fathers friend an older man by far and therefore a more acceptable guardian than maitland she was fulfilling her fathers wish and hoped soon to be put in the way of independence and of earning her own livelihood and independence was margarets ideal  her fathers friend her own protectorin that light she regarded cranley when she was well enough to think consecutively there could be no more complete hallucination cranley was one of those egotists who do undoubtedly exist but whose existence when they are discovered is a perpetual surprise even to the selfish race of men in him the instinct of selfpreservation without which the race could not have endured for a week had remained absolutely unmodified as it is modified in the rest of us by thousands of years of inherited social experience cranleys temper in every juncture was precisely that of the first human being who ever found himself and other human beings struggling in a flood for a floating log that will only support one of them everything must give way to his desire he had literally never denied himself anything that he dared taka as certainly as the stone once tossed up obeys the only law it knows and falls back to earth so surely cranley would obtain what he desired if it seemed safe though a human life or a human soul stood between him and his purpose  now margaret stood at this moment between him and the aims on which his greed was desperately bent it was therefore necessary that she should vanish and to that end he had got her into his power cranleys original idea had been the obvious one of transporting the girl to the continent where under the pretence that a suitable situation of some kind had been found for her he would so arrange that england should never see her more and that her place among honest women should be lost forever but there were difficulties in the way of this tempting plan for instance the girl knew some french and was no tame unresisting fool and then margarets illness had occurred and had caused delay and given time for reflection  after all he thought as he lit his cigar and examined his mustache in the mirror kindly provided for that purpose in wellappointed hansomsafter all it is only the dead who tell no tales and make no inconvenient claims  for after turning over in his brain the various safe and easy ways of removing an inconvenient person one devilish scheme had flashed across a not uninstructed intellecta scheme which appeared open to the smallest number of objections  she shall take a turn for the worse he thought and the doctor will be an uncommonly clever man and particularly well read in criminal jurisprudence if he sees anything suspicious in it  thus pondering this astute miscreant stopped at covent garden dismissed his cab and purchased a basket of very fine jaffa oranges he then hailed another cab and drove with his parcel to the shop of an eminent firm of chemists again dismissing his cab in the shop he asked for a certain substance which it may be as well not to name and got what he wanted in a small phial marked poison mr cranley then called a third cab gave the direction of a surgicalinstrument makers also eminent and amused his leisure during the drive in removing the label from the bottle at the surgicalinstrument makers he complained of neuralgia and purchased a hypodermic syringe for injecting morphine or some such anodyne into his arm À fourth cab took him back to the house in victoria square where he let himself in with a key entered the diningroom and locked the door  nor was he satisfied with this precaution after aimlessly moving chairs about for a few minutes and prowling up and down the room he paused and listened what he heard induced him to stuff his pockethandkerchief into the keyhole and to lay the hearthrug across the considerable chink which as is usual admitted a healthy draught under the bottom of the door then the honorable mr cranley drew down the blinds and unpacked his various purchases he set them out on the table in orderthe oranges the phial and the hypodermic syringe  then he carefully examined the oranges chose half a dozen of the best and laid the others on a large dessert plate in the diningroom cupboard one orange he ate and left the skin on a plate on the table in company with a biscuit or two  when all this had been arranged to his mind mr cranley chose another orange filled a wineglass with the liquid in the phial and then drew off a quantity in the little syringe then he very delicately and carefully punctured the skin of one of the oranges and injected into the fruit the contents of the syringe this operation he elaborately completed in the case of each of the six chosen oranges and then tenderly polished their coats with a portion of the skin of the fruit he had eaten that portion of the skin he consumed to dust in the fire and observing that a strong odor remained in the room he deliberately turned on the unlighted gas for a few minutes after this he opened the window sealed his own seal in red wax on paper a great many times finally burning the collection and lit a large cigar which he smoked through with every appearance of enjoyment while engaged on this portion of his task he helped himself frequently to sherry from the glass first carefully rinsed into which he had poured the liquid from the now unlabelled phial lastly he put the phial in his pocket with the little syringe stored the six oranges wrapped in delicate paper within the basket and closed the window  next he unlocked the door and without opening it remarked in a sweet voice  now alice you may come in  the handle turned and the housekeeper entered  how is miss burnside he asked in the same silvery accents he had told margaret that she had better be known by that name for the present at least  she is asleep i hope she may never waken what do you want with her why are you keeping her in this house what devils brew have you been making that smells of gas and sherry and sealingwax  my dear girl replied mr cranley you put too many questions at once as to your first pair of queries my reasons for taking care of miss burnside are my own business and do not concern you as my housekeeper as to the devils brew which you indicate in a style worthy rather of the ages of faith and of alchemy than of an epoch of positive science did you never taste sherry and sealingwax if you did not that is one of the very few alcoholic combinations in which you have never to my knowledge attempted experiments is there any other matter on which i can enlighten an intelligent and respectful curiosity  the fair womans blue eyes and white face seemed to glitter with anger like a baleful lightning  i dont understand your chaff she said with a few ornamental epithets which in moments when she was deeply stirred were apt to decorate her conversation  i grieve to be obscure he answered brevis esse laboro the old story but as you say miss burnside is sleeping and as when she wakens she may be feverish will you kindly carry these oranges and leave them on a plate by her bedside they are jaffa oranges and finer fruit alice my dear i have seldom tasted after that go to cavendish square and leave this note at the doctors  oh nothings too good for her growled the jealous woman thinking of the fruit to which he replied by offering her several of the oranges not used in his experiment  bearing these she withdrew throwing a spiteful glance and leaving the door unshut so that her master distinctly heard her open margarets door come out again and finally leave the house  now ill give her a quarter of an hour to waken said mr cranley and he took from his pocket a fresh copy of the times he glanced rather anxiously at the second column of the outer sheet still advertising for him he said to himself and he then turned to the sporting news his calmness was extraordinary but natural in him for the reaction of terror at the possible detection of his villainy had not yet come on when he had read all that interested him in the times he looked hastily at his watch  just twenty minutes gone he said time she wakenedand tried those jaffa oranges  then he rose went up stairs stealthily paused a moment opposite margarets door and entered the drawingroom apparently he did not find any of the chairs in the diningroom comfortable enough for he chose a large and heavy fauteuil took it up in his arms and began to carry it out in the passage just opposite margarets chamber he stumbled so heavily that he fell and the weighty piece of furniture was dashed against the door of the sickroom making a terrible noise he picked it up and retired silently to the diningroom  that would have wakened the dead he whispered to himself and she is not deadyet she is certain to see the oranges and take one of them and then  the reflection did not seem to relieve him as he sat gnawing his mustache in the chair he had brought down with him now the deed was being accomplished even his craven heart awoke to a kind of criminal remorse now anxiety for the issue made him wish the act undone or frustrated now he asked himself if there were no more certain and less perilous way so intent was his eagerness that a strange kind of lucidity possessed him he felt as if he beheld and heard what was passing in the chamber of sickness which he had made a chamber of death  she has wakenedshe has looked roundshe has seen the poisoned fruitshe has blessed him for his kindness in bringing itshe has tasted the orangesshe has turned to sleep againand the unrelenting venom is at its work  oh strange forces that are about us all inevitably acting each in his hour and his place each fulfilling his law without turning aside to the right hand or to the left the raindrop running down the pane the star revolving round the sun of the furthest undiscoverable system the grains of sand sliding from the grasp the poison gnawing and burning the tissueseach seems to move in his inevitable path obedient to an unrelenting will innocence youth beautythat will spares them not the rock falls at its hour whoever is under it the deadly drug slays though it be blended with the holy elements it is a will that moves all thingsmens agitat molem and yet we can make that will a slave of our own and turn this way and that the blind steadfast forces to the accomplishment of our desires  it was not naturally with these transcendental reflections that the intellect of mr cranley was at this moment engaged if he seemed actually to be present in margarets chamber watching every movement and hearing every heartbeat of the girl he had doomed his blue lips and livid face from which he kept wiping the cold drops did not therefore speak of late ruth or the beginning of remorse  it was entirely on his own security and chances of escaping detection that he was musing  now its done it cant be undone he said but is it so very safe after all the stuff is not beyond analysis unluckily but its much more hard to detect this way mixed with the orangejuice than any other way and then theres all the horrid fuss afterward even if there is not an inquestas of course there wont betheyll ask who the girl is what the devil she was doing here perhaps theyll some of them recognize alice she has been too much before the public confound her it may not be very hard to lie through all these inquiries perhaps  and then he looked mechanically at his cold fingers and bit his thumbnail and yawned  by gad i wish i had not risked it he said to himself and his complexion was now of a curious faint blue and his heart began to flutter painfully in a manner not strange in his experience he sunk back in his chair with his hands all thrilling and pricking to the fingertips he took a large silver flask from his pocket but he could scarcely unscrew the stopper and had to manage it with his teeth a long pull at the liquor restored him and he began his round of reflections again  that french fellow who tried it this way in scotland was found out he said and he did not like even in his mind to add that the french fellow consequently suffered the extreme penalty of the law but then he was a fool and boasted beforehand and bungled it infernally still its not absolutely safe the other plan i thought of first was better by gad i wish i could be sure she had not taken the stuff perhaps she hasnt anyway she must be asleep again now and besides there are the other oranges to be substituted for those left in the room if she has taken it i must go and see i dont like the job  he filled his pockets with five unpoisoned oranges and the skin of a sixth and so crept upstairs his situation was perhaps rather novel with murder in his remorseless heart he yet hoped against hope out of his very poltroonery that murder had not been done at the girls door he waited and listened his face horribly agitated and shining wet all was silent his heart was sounding hoarsely within him like a dry pump he heard it so noisy and so distinct that he almost feared it might wake the sleeper if only after all she had not touched the fruit  then he took the doorhandle in his clammy grasp he had to cover it with a handkerchief to get a firm hold he turned discreetly and the door was pushed open in perfect stillness except for that dreadful husky thumping of his own heart at this moment the postmans hard knock at the door nearly made him cry out aloud then he entered a dreadful visitor had anyone seen him she did not see him she was asleep sound asleep in the dirty brown twilight of a london winter day he could make out that much he did not dare draw close enough to observe her face minutely or bend down and listen for her breath and the oranges eagerly he looked at them there were only five of them surelyno a sixth had fallen on the floor where it was lying with a great sigh of relief he picked up all the six oranges put them in his pockets and as shrinkingly as he had comeyet shaking his hand at the girl and cursing his own cowardice under his breathhe stole down stairs opened the diningroom door and advanced into the blind empty dusk  now ill settle with you came a voice out of the dimness and the start wrought so wildly on his nerves excited to the utmost degree as they were that he gave an inarticulate cry of alarm and despair was he trapped and by whom  in a moment he saw whence the voice came it was only alice darling in bonnet and cloak and with a face flushed with something more than anger that stood before him  not much used to shame he was yet ashamed of his own alarm and tried to dissemble it he sat down at a writingtable facing her and merely observed  now that you have returned alice will you kindly bring lights i want to read  what were you doing upstairs just now she snarled why did you send me off to the doctors out of the way  my good girl i have again and again advised you to turn that invaluable curiosity of yourscuriosity a quality which mr matthew arnold so justly views with high esteeminto wider and nobler channels disdain the merely personal accept the calm facts of domestic life as you find them approach the broader and less irritating problems of sociology pardon the term or metaphysics  it was cruel to see the enjoyment he got out of teasing this woman by an ironical jargon which mystified her into madness this time he went too far with an inarticulate snarl of passion she lifted a knife that lay on the diningroom table and made for him but this time being prepared he was not alarmed nay he seemed to take leasure in the success of his plan of tormenting the heavy escritoire at which he sat was a breastwork between him and the angry woman he coolly opened a drawer produced a revolver and remarked  no i did not ask for the carvingknife alice i asked for lights and you will be good enough to bring them i am your master you know in every sense of the word and you are aware that you had better both hold your tongue and keep your hands off meand off drink fetch the lamp  she left the room cowed like a beaten dog she returned set the lamp silently on the table and was gone then he noticed a letter which lay on the escritoire and was addressed to him it was a rather peculiar letter to look at or rather the envelope was peculiar for though bordered with heavy black it was stamped where the seal should have been with a strange device in gold and colorsa brown bun in a glory of gilt rays  mrs st john deloraine he said taking it up how in the world did she find me out well she is indeed a friend that sticketh closer than a brothera deal closer than surbiton anyhow  lord surbiton was the elder brother of mr cranley and bore the second title of the family  i dont suppose there is another woman in london he thought to himself that has not heard all about the row at the cockpit and that would write to me  then he tore the chromatic splendors of the device on the envelope and read the following epistle       early english bunhouse       chelsea friday my dear mr cranley       where are you hiding or yachting you wandering man i can      hear nothing of you from anyonenothing good and you      know i never believe anything else do come and see me at      the old bunhouse here and tell me about yourself  she has heard he muttered       and help me in a little difficulty our housekeeper you      know we are strictly blue ribbona cordon bleu i call      her has become engaged to a plumber and she is leaving      us can you recommend me another i know how interested      you are in spite of your wicked jokes in our little      enterprise and we also want a girl to be under the      housekeeper and keep the accounts surely you will come to      see me whether you can advise me or not       yours very truly       mary st john deloraine  idiot murmured mr cranley as he finished reading this document and then he added by jove its lucky too ill put these two infernal women off on her and alice will soon do for the girl if she once gets at the drink shes dangerous by jove when she has been drinking then the law will do for alice and all will be plain sailing in smooth waters     chapter ixmrs st john deloraine  mrs st john deloraine whose letter to mr cranley we have been privileged to read was no ordinary widow as parts of her character and aspects of her conduct were not devoid of the kind of absurdity which is caused by virtues out of place let it be said that a better or kinder or gentler or merrier soul than that of mrs st john deloraine has seldom inhabited a very pleasing and pretty tenement of clay and a house in cheyne walk  the maiden name of this lady was by no means so euphonious as that which she had attained by marriage miss widdicombe of chipping carby in the county of somerset was a very lively goodhearted and agreeable young woman but she was by no means favorably looked on by the ladies of the county families now in the district around chipping carby the county families are very county indeed few more so there is in their demeanor a kind of morgue so funereal and mournful that it inevitably reminds the observer who is not county of an edifice in paris designed by méryon and celebrated by mr robert browning the county families near chipping carby are far far from gay and what pleasure they do take they take entirely in the society of their equals so determined are they to drink delight of tennis with their peers and with nobody else that even the clergy are excluded ex officio and in their degrading capacity of ministers of religion from the county lawn tennis club as we all know how essential young curates fresh from college are to the very being of rural lawntennis no finer proof can be given of the inaccessibility of the county people around chipping carby and of the sacrifices which they are prepared to make to their position  now born in the very purple and indubitably despite his profession one of the gentlest born of men was some seven years ago a certain mr st john deloraine he held the sacrosanct position of a squarson being at once squire and parson of the parish of little wentley at the head of the quaint old village street stands mirrored in a moat girdled by beautiful gardens and shadowy with trees the manor house and parsonage for it is both in one of wentley deloraine  to this desirable home and opulent share of earths good things did mr st john deloraine succeed in boyhood he went to oxford he travelled a good deal he was held in great favor and affection by the county matrons and the longnosed young ladies of the county another dwelling on such heights as he might have become haughty but there was in this young man a cheery naturalness and love of mirth which often drove him from the society of his equals and took him into that of attorneys daughters fate drew him one day to an archery meeting at chipping carby and there he beheld miss widdicombe with her he paced the level turf her points he counted and he found that she at least could appreciate his somewhat apt quotation from chastelard       pray heaven we make good ends  miss widdicombe did make good ends she vanquished mrs struggles the veteran lady champion of the shaft and bow a sportswoman who was now on the verge of sixty why are ladies who almost professionally rejoice in arrows like the homeric artemiswhy are they nearly always so well stricken in years was maid marion forty at least before her performances obtained for her a place in the wellknown band of hood tuck little john and co  this however is a digression for our purpose it is enough that the contrast between miss widdicombes vivacity and the deadly stolidity of the county families between her youth and the maturity of her vanquished competitors entirely won the heart of mr st john deloraine he sawhe loved herhe was laughed athe proposedhe was acceptedand oh shame the county had to accept more or less miss widdicombe the attorneys daughter as châtelaine delightful word and dear to the author of guy livingstone of wentley deloraine  when the early death of her husband threw mrs st john deloraine almost alone on the world for her family had naturally been offended by her good fortune she left the gray old squarsonage and went to town in london mrs st john deloraine did not find people stiff with a good name an impulsive manner a kind heart a gentle tongue and plenty of money she was welcome almost everywhere except at the big county dinners which the county people of her district give to each other when they come to town  this lady like many of us had turned to charity and philanthropy in the earlier days of her bereavement but unlike most of us her benevolence had not died out with the sharpest pangs of her sorrow never surely was there such a festive philanthropist as mrs st john deloraine  she would go from a gardenparty to a mothers meeting she was great at taking children for a day in the country and had the art of keeping them amused she was on a dozen charitable committees belonged to at least three clubs at which gentlemen as well as ladies of fashion were eligible and where music and minstrelsy enlivened the afterdinner hours  so good and unsuspecting unluckily was mrs st john deloraine that she made bosom friends for life and contracted vows of eternal sympathy wherever she went at aix or on the spanish frontier she has been seen enjoying herself with acquaintances a little dubious like greek texts which if not absolutely corrupt yet stand greatly in need of explanation it is needless to say that gentlemen of fortune in the old sensethat is gentlemen in quest of a fortunepursued hotly or artfully after mrs st john deloraine but as she never for a moment suspected their wiles so these devices were entirely wasted on her and her least warrantable admirers found that she insisted on accepting them as endowed with all the christian virtues just as some amateurs of music are incapable of conceiving that there breathes a man who has no joy in popular concerts we shall have popular conic sections next so mrs st john deloraine persevered in crediting all she met with a passion for virtue their speech might bewray them as worldlings of the world but she insisted on interpreting their talk as a kind of harmless levity as a mere cynical mask assumed by a tender and pious nature thus no one ever combined a delight in good works with a taste for good things so successfully as mrs st john deloraine  at this moment the ladys favorite vanity in the matter of good works was the bunhouse this really serviceable though quaint institution was not in idea quite unlike maitlands enterprise of the philanthropic publichouse the hit or miss in a slum of chelsea there might have been observed a modest place of entertainment in the coffee and bun line with a highly elaborate chelsea bun painted on the sign this piece of art which gave its name to the establishment was the work of one of mrs st john deloraines friends an artist of the highest promise who fell an early victim to arrangements in haschisch and irish whiskey in spite of this illomened beginning the bunhouse did very useful work it was a kind of unofficial club and home not for friendly girls nor the comparatively subdued and domesticated slavery of common life but for the tameless tribes of young women of the metropolis those who disdain service who turn up expressive features at sewing machines and who decline to stand perpendicularly for fifteen hours a day in shopsall these young female outlaws not professionally vicious found in the bunhouse a kind of charitable shelter and home  they were amused they were looked after they were encouraged not to stand each other drinks nor to rival the profanity of their brothers and fathers places were found for them in the rare instances when they condescended to places sometimes they breakfasted at the bunhouse sometimes went there to supper very often they came in a state of artificial cheerfulness or ready for battle then there would arise such a disturbance as civilization seldom sees not otherwise than when boys having tied two cats by the tails hang them over the handle of a doorthey then spit and shriek and swear fur flies and the clamor goes up to heaven so did the street resound when the young patrons of the bunhouse were in a warlike humor then the stern housekeeper would intervene and check these motions of their minds haec certamina tanta turning the more persistent combatants into the street next day mrs st john deloraine would come in her carriage and try to be very severe and then would weep a little and all the girls would shed tears all would have a good cry together and finally the lady mother mrs st john deloraine would take a few of them for a drive in the park after that there would be peace for a while and presently disturbances would come again  for this establishment it was that mrs st john deloraine wanted a housekeeper and an assistant the former housekeeper as we have been told had yielded to love which subdues the hearts of all female women even of the prudent according to homer and was going to share the home and bear the children of a plumber with her usual invincible innocence mrs st john deloraine had chosen to regard the hon thomas cranley as a kind good christian in disguise and to him she appealed in her need of a housekeeper and assistant  no application could possibly have suited that gentleman better he could give his own servant an excellent character and if once she was left to herself to her passions and the society of margaret that young ladys earthly existence would shortly cease to embarrass mr cranley probably there was not one other man among the motley herds of mrs st john deloraines acquaintance who would have used her unsuspicious kindness as an instrument in a plot of any sort but mr cranley had when there was no personal danger to be run the courage of his character  shall i go and lunch with her he asked himself as he twisted her note with its characteristic black border and device of brown and gold i havent shown anywhere i was likely to meet anyone i knew not sincesince i came back from monte carlo  even to himself he did not like to mention that affair of the cockpit the man in the story who boasted that he had committed every crime in the calendar withdrew his large words when asked if he had ever cheated at cards  well mr cranley went on i dont know i dare say its safe enough she does know some of those cockpit fellows confound her she knows all sorts of fellows but none of them are likely to be up so early in the daynot up to luncheon anyhow she saysand he looked again at the notethat shell be alone but she wont everyone she sees before lunch she asks to luncheon everyone she meets before dinner she asks to dinner i wish i had her money it would be simpler and safer by a very long way than this kind of business there really seems no end to it when once you begin however here goes said mr cranley sitting down to write a letter at the escritoire which had just served him as a bulwark and breastwork ill write and accept probably shell have no one with her but some girl from chipping carby or some missionary from the solomon islands who never heard of a heathen like me  as a consequence of these reflections mr cranley arrived when the clock was pointing to halfpast one at mrs st john deloraines house in cheyne walk he had scarcely entered the drawingroom before that lady in a costume which agreeably became her pleasant english style of beauty rushed into the room tumbling over a favorite dandie dinmont terrier and holding out both her hands  the terrier howled and mrs st john deloraine had scarcely grasped the hand which mr cranley extended with enthusiasm when she knelt on the carpet and was consoling the dandie  love in which thy hound has part quoted mr cranley and the lady rising with her face becomingly flushed beneath her fuzzy brown hair smiled and did not remark the sneer  thank you so much for coming mr cranley she said and as i have put off luncheon till two do tell me that you know someone who will suit me for my dear bunhouse i know how much you have always been interested in our little project  mr cranley assured her that by a remarkable coincidence he knew the very kind of people she wanted alice he briefly described as a respectable woman of great strength of character of body too i believe which will not make her less fit for the position  no said mrs st john deloraine sadly the dear girls are sometimes a little tiresome on wednesday mrs carter the housekeeper you know went to one of the exhibitions with her fiancé and the girls broke all the windows and almost all the teathings  the woman whom i am happy to be able to recommend to you will not stand anything of that kind answered mr cranley she is quiet but extremely firm and has been accustomed to deal with a very desperate character at one time i mean she was engaged as the attendant of a person of treacherous and ungovernable disposition  this was true enough and mr cranley then began to give a more or less fanciful history of margaret she had been left in his charge by her father an early acquaintance a man who had known better days but had bequeathed her nothing save an excellent schooling and the desire to earn her own livelihood  so far he knew he was safe enough for margaret was the last girl to tell the real tale of her life and her desire to avoid maitland was strong enough to keep her silent even had she not been naturally proud and indisposed to make confidences  there is only one thing i must ask said mr cranley when he had quite persuaded the lady that margaret would set a splendid example to her young friends how soon does your housekeeper leave you and when do you need the services of the newcomers  well the plumber is rather in a hurry he really is a good man and i like him better for it though it seems rather selfish of him to want to rob me of joan he is determined to be married before next bank holidayin a fortnight that isand then they will go on their honeymoon of three days to yarmouth  mr cranley blessed the luck that had not made the plumber a yet more impetuous wooer  no laggard in love he said smiling well in a fortnight the two women will be quite ready for their new place but i must ask you to remember that the younger is somewhat delicate and has by no means recovered from the shock of her fathers sudden deatha very sad affair added mr cranley in a sympathetic voice  poor dear girl cried mrs st john deloraine with the ready tears in her eyes for this lady spontaneously acted on the injunction to weep with those who weep and also laugh with those who laugh  mr cranley who was beginning to feel hungry led her thoughts off to the latest farce in which mr toole had amused the town and when mrs st john deloraine had giggled till she wept again over her memories of this entertainment she suddenly looked at her watch  why hes very late she said and yet it is not far to come from the hit or miss  from the hit or miss cried mr cranley much louder than he was aware  yes you may well wonder if you dont know about it that i should have asked a gentleman from a publichouse to meet you but you will be quite in love with him he is such a very good young man not handsome nor very amusing but people think a great deal too much of amusingness now he is very very good and spends almost all his time among the poor he is a fellow of his college at oxford  during this discourse mr cranley was pretending to play with the terrier but stoop as he might his face was livid and he knew it  did i tell you his name mrs st john deloraine ran on he is a  here the door was opened and the servant announced mr maitland  when mrs st john deloraine had welcomed her new guest she turned and found that mr cranley was looking out of the window  his position was indeed agonizing and in the circumstances a stronger heart might have blanched at the encounter  when cranley last met maitland he had been the guest of that philanthropist and he had gone from his table to swindle his fellowrevellers what other things he had donethings in which maitland was concernedthe reader knows or at least suspects but it was not these deeds which troubled mr cranley for these he knew were undetected it was that affair of the baccarat which unmanned him  there was nothing for it but to face maitland and the situation  let me introduce you said mrs st john deloraine  there is no need interrupted maitland mr cranley and i have known each other for some time i dont think we have met he added looking at cranley since you dined with me at the olympic and we are not likely to meet again im afraid for tomorrow as i have come to tell mrs si john deloraine i go to paris on business of importance  mr cranley breathed again it was obvious that maitland living out of the world as he did and concerned as cranley well knew him to be with private affairs of an urgent character had never been told of the trouble at the cockpit or had in his absent fashion never attended to what he might have heard with the hearing of the ear as to paris he had the best reason for guessing why maitland was bound thither as he was the secret source of the information on which maitland proposed to act  at luncheonwhich like the dinner described by the american guest was luscious and abundantmr cranley was more sparkling than the champagne and made even maitland laugh he recounted little philanthropic misadventures of his owncases in which he had been humorously misled by the captain wraggs of this world or beguiled by the authors of that polite correspondencebegging letters  when luncheon was over and when maitland was obliged reluctantly to go for he liked mrs st john deloraines company very much cranley who had determined to see him out shook hands in a very cordial way with the fellow of st gatiens  and when are we likely to meet again he asked  i really dont know said maitland i have business in paris and i cannot say how long i may be detained on the continent  no more can i said mr cranley to himself but i hope you wont return in time to bother me with your blundering inquiries if ever you have the luck to return at all  but while he said this to himself to maitland he only wished a good voyage and particularly recommended to him a comedy and a comédienne at the palais royal     chapter xtraps  the day before the encounter with mr cranley at the house of the lady of the bunhouse barton when he came home from a round of professional visits had found maitland waiting in his chill unlighted lodgings of late maitland had got into the habit of loitering there discussing and discussing all the mysteries which made him feel that he was indeed moving about in worlds not realized keen as was the interest which barton took in the labyrinth of his friends affairs he now and again wearied of maitland and of a conversation that ever revolved round the same fixed but otherwise uncertain points  hullo maitland glad to see you he observed with some shade of hypocrisy anything new today  yes said maitland i really do think i have a clew at last  well wait a bit till they bring the candles said barton groaning as the bellrope came away in his hands bring lights please and tea and stir up the fire jemima my friend he remarked when the blackened but alert face of the little slavey appeared at the door  yes dr barton in a minute sir answered jemima who greatly admired the doctor and in ten minutes the dismal lodgings looked almost comfortable  now for your clew old man exclaimed barton as he handed maitland a cup of his peculiar mixture very weak with plenty of milk and no sugar oh ariadne what a boon that clew of yours has been to the detective mind to think that without the minotaur the police would probably never have hit on that invaluable expression the police have a clew  maitland thought this was trifling with the subject  this advertisement he said gravely appears to me undoubtedly to refer to the miscreant who carried off margaret poor girl  does it by jove cried barton with some eagerness this time lets have a look at it  this was what he read aloud       bearskin coatthe gentleman travelling with a young lady      who on feb 19th left a bearskin coat at the hôtel alsace      and lorraine avenue de lopéra paris is requested to      remove it or it will be sold to defray expenses       dupin  this may mean business he said or it may not in the first place is there such an hotel in paris as the alsace et lorraine and is m dupin the proprietor  thats all right said maitland i went at once to the club and looked up the bottin the paris directory dont you know  so far so good and yet i dont quite see what you can make of it it does not come to much you know even if the owner of the coat is the man you want and again is he likely to have left such a very notable article of dress behind him in an hotel anyway cant you send some detective fellow are you going over yourself in this awful weather  so barton argued but maitland was not to be easily put off the hopeful scent  why dont you see he exclaimed the people at the hotel will at least be able to give one a fuller description of the man than anything we have yet and they may have some idea of where he has gone to and at least they will have noticed how he was treating margaret and that of course is what i am most anxious to learn again he may have left other things besides the coat or there may be documents in the pockets i have read of such things happening  yes in le crime de lopéra and a very good story too answered the incredulous barton but i dont fancy that the villain of real life is quite so innocent and careless as the monster of fiction  everyone knows that murderers are generally detected through some incredible piece of carelessness said maitland and why should this elaborate scoundrel be more fortunate than the rest if he did leave the coat he will scarcely care to go back for it and i do not think the chance should be lost even if it is a poor one besides im doing no good here and i can do no harm there  this was undeniably true and though barton muttered something about a false scent he no longer attempted to turn maitland from his purpose he did however with some difficulty prevent the fellow of st gatiens from purchasing a blonde beard one of those wigs which simulate baldness and a pair of blue spectacles in these disguises maitland argued he would certainly avoid recognition and so discomfit any mischief planned by the enemies of margaret  yes but on the other hand you would look exactly like a german professor and probably be taken for a spy of bismarcks said barton  and maitland reluctantly gave up the idea of disguise he retained however certain astute notions of his own about his plan of operations and these unfortunately he did not communicate to his friend the fact is that the long dormant romance of maitlands character was now thoroughly awake and he began unconsciously to enjoy the adventure  his enjoyment did not last very long the usual troubles of a winter voyage acting on a dilapidated digestive system were not spared the guardian of margaret but everythingeven a period of waiting at the paris salle dattente and a struggle with the cochers at the station who for some reason always decline to take a faremust come to an end at last about dinnertime maitland was jolted through the glare of the parisian streets to the avenue de lopéra at the hôtel alsace et lorraine he determined not to betray himself by too precipitate eagerness in the first place he wrote an assumed name in the hotel book choosing by an unlucky inspiration the pseudonym of buchanan he then ordered dinner in the hotel and by way of propitiation it was a much better dinner than usual that maitland ordered bottles of the higher bordeaux wines reposing in beautiful baskets were brought at his command for he was determined favorably to impress the people of the house  his conduct in this matter was partly determined by the fact that for the moment the english were not popular in paris  in fact as the french newspapers declared with more truth than they suspected paris was not the place for english people especially for english women  in these international circumstances then maitland believed he showed the wisdom of the serpent when he ordered dinner in the fearless old fashion attributed by tradition to the milords of the past but he had reckoned without his appetite  a consequence of seatravel neither uncommon nor alarming is the putting away of all desire to eat and drink as the waiter carried off the untouched hors doeuvres whereof maitland only nibbled the delicious bread and butter as he bore away the huîtres undiminished in number as the bisque proved too much for the guest of the evening as he faltered over the soles and failed to appreciate the cutlets as he turned from the noblest crûs including the widows crûs those of la veuve cliquot and asked for siphon and fine champagne the waiters countenance assumed an air of owllike sagacity there was something wrong the garçon felt sure about a man who could order a dinner like maitlands and then decline to partake thereof however even in a republican country you can hardly arrest a man merely because his intentions are better than his appetite the waiter therefore contented himself with assuming an imposing attitude and whispering something to the hall porter  the fellow of st gatiens having dined with the barmecide regardless of expense went on as he hoped to ingratiate himself with the concierge from that official he purchased two large cigars which he did not dream of attempting to enjoy and he then endeavored to enter into conversation selecting for a topic the state of the contemporary drama what would monsieur advise him to go to see where was mile jane hading playing  having in this conversation broken the ice and almost every rule of french grammar maitland began to lead up craftily to the great matterthe affair of the bearskin coat did many english use the hotel had any of his countrymen been there lately he remembered that when he left england a friend of his had asked him to inquire about an article of dressa greatcoatwhich he had left somewhere perhaps in a cab could monsieur the porter tell him where he ought to apply for news about the garment a coat in peau dours  on the mention of this raiment a clerklylooking man who had been loitering in the office of the concierge moved to the neighborhood of the door where he occupied himself in study of a railway map hanging on the wall  the porter now was all smiles but certainly monsieur had fallen well in coming to him monsieur wanted a lost coat in skin of the bear it had been lost by a compatriot of monsieurs would monsieur give himself the trouble to follow the porter to the room where lost baggage was kept  maitland full of excitement and of belief that he now really was on the trail followed the porter and the clerkly man rather a liberty thought maitland followed him  the porter led them to a door marked private and they all three entered  the clerklylooking person now courteously motioned maitland to take a chair  the englishman sat down in some surprise  where he asked was the bearskin coat  would monsieur first deign to answer a few inquiries was the coat his own or a friends  a friends said maitland and then beginning to hesitate admitted that the garment only belonged to a man he knew something about  what is his name asked the clerkly man who was taking notes  his name indeed if maitland only knew that his french now began to grow worse and worse in proportion to his flurry  well he explained it was very unlucky but he did not exactly remember the mans name it was quite a common name he had met him for the first time on board the steamer but the man was going to brussels and finding that maitland was on his way to paris had asked him to make inquiries  here the clerkly person laying down his notes asked if english gentlemen usually spoke of persons whom they had just met for the first time on board the steamer as their friends  maitland at this lost his temper and observed that as they seemed disposed to give him more trouble than information he would go and see the play  hereupon the clerkly person requested monsieur to remember in his deportment what was due to justice and when maitland rose in a stately way to leave the room he also rose and stood in front of the door  however little of human nature an englishman may possess he is rarely unmoved by this kind of treatment maitland took the man by the collar sans phrase and spun him round amid the horrified clamor of the porter but the man without any passion merely produced and displayed a card containing a voucher that he belonged to the secret police and calmly asked maitland for his papers  maitland had no papers he had understood that passports were no longer required  the detective assured him that passports spoil nothing had monsieur nothing stating his identity maitland entirely forgetting that he had artfully entered his name as buchanan on the hotel book produced his card on the lower corner of which was printed st gatiens college this address puzzled the detective a good deal while the change of name did not allay his suspicions and he ended by requesting maitland to accompany him into the presence of justice as there was no choice maitland obtained leave to put some linen in his travellingbag and was carried off to what we should call the nearest policestation here he was received in a chill bleak room by a formal man wearing a decoration who after some private talk with the detective asked maitland to explain his whole conduct in the matter of the coat in the first place the detectives notes on their conversation were read aloud and it was shown that maitland had given a false name had originally spoken of the object of his quest as the coat of a friend then as the coat of a man whom he knew something about then as the coat of a man whose name he did not know and that finally he had attempted to go away without offering any satisfactory account of himself  all this the philanthropist was constrained to admit but he was not unnaturally quite unable to submit any explanation of his proceedings what chiefly discomfited him was the fact that his proceedings were a matter of interest and observation why he kept wondering was all this fuss made about a coat which had or had not been left by a traveller at the hotel it was perfectly plain that the hotel was used as a souricière as the police say as a trap in which all inquirers after the coat could be captured now if he had been given time and a french dictionary maitland might have set before the commissaire of police the whole story of his troubles he might have begun with the discovery of shields body in the snow he might have gone on to margarets disappearance enlèvement and to a description of the costume bearskin coat and all of the villain who had carried her away then he might have described his relations with margaret the necessity of finding her the clew offered by the advertisement in the times and his own too subtle and ingenious attempt to follow up that clew but it is improbable that this narrative had maitland told it ever so movingly would have entirely satisfied the suspicions of the commissaire of police it might even have prejudiced that official against maitland moreover the fellow of st gatiens had neither the presence of mind nor the linguistic resources necessary to relate the whole plot and substance of this narrative at a moments notice in a cold policeoffice to a sceptical alien he therefore fell back on a demand to be allowed to communicate with the english ambassador and that night maitland of gatiens passed for the first time during his blameless career in a policecell  it were superfluous to set down in detail all the humiliations endured by maitland do not the newspapers continually ring with the laments of the british citizen who has fallen into the hands of continental justice are not our countrymen the common butts of german french spanish and even greek and portuguese jacks in office when an englishman appears do not the foreign police usually arrest him at a venture and inquire afterward  maitland had with the best intentions done a good deal more than most of these innocents to deserve incarceration his conduct as the juge dinstruction told him without mincing matters was undeniably louche  in the first place the suspicions of m dupin of the hôtel alsace et lorraine had been very naturally excited by seeing the advertisement about the greatcoat in the times for he made a study of the journal of the city  here was a notice purporting to be signed by himself and referring to a bearskin coat said quite untruly to have been left in his own hotel a bearskin coat the very words breathe of nihilism dynamite stratagems and spoils then the advertisement was in english which is at present and till further notice the language spoken by the brave irish m dupin as a liberal had every sympathy with the brave irish in their noble struggle for whatever they are struggling for but he did not wish his hostelry to become so to speak the mountaincave of freedom and the great secret storehouse of nitroglycerine with a view to elucidating the mystery of the advertisement he had introduced the police on his premises and the police had hardly settled down in its affût when lo a stranger had been captured in most suspicious circumstances m dupin felt very clever indeed and his friends envied him the distinction and advertisement which were soon to be his  when maitland appeared as he did in due course before the juge dinstruction he attempted to fall back on the obsolete civis romanus sum he was an english citizen he had written to the english ambassador or rather to an old st gatiens man an attaché of the embassy whom he luckily happened to know but this great ally chanced to be out of town and his name availed maitland nothing in his interview with the juge dinstruction that magistrate sitting with his back to the light gazed at maitland with steady small gray eyes while the scribble of the pen of the greffier as he took down the englishmans deposition sounded shrill in the bleak torturechamber of the law  your name asked the juge dinstruction  maitland replied the fellow of st gatiens  you lie said the juge dinstruction you entered the name of buchanan in the book of the hotel  my name is on my cards and on that letter said maitland keeping his temper wonderfully  the documents in question lay on a table as pièces justificatives  these cards that letter you have robbed them from some unfortunate person and have draped afflublé yourself in the trappings of your victim where is his body  this was the working hypothesis which the juge dinstruction had formed within himself to account for the general conduct and proceedings of the person under examination  where is whose body asked maitland in unspeakable surprise  buchanan said the juge dinstruction and to hear the gallantry with which he attacked this difficult name of itself insured respect buchanan you are acting on a deplorable system justice is not deceived by your falsehoods nor eluded by your subterfuges she is calm stern but merciful unbosom yourself freely répandez franchement and you may learn that justice can be lenient it is your interest to be frank il est de votre intérêt dêtre franc  but what do you want me to say asked the prévenu what is all this pother about a greatcoat tant de fracas pour un paletot  maitland was rather proud of this sentence  it is the part of justice to ask questions not to answer them said the juge dinstruction levity will avail you nothing tell me buchanan why did you ask for the coat at the hôtel alsace et lorraine  in answer to that advertisement in the times  that is false you yourself inserted the advertisement but on your own system bad as it is what did you want with the coat  it belonged to a man who had done me an illturn  his name  i do not know his name that is just what i wanted to find out i might have found his tailors name on the coat and then have discovered for whom the coat was made  you are aware that the proprietor of the hotel did not insert the forged advertisement  so he says  you doubt his word you insult france in one of her citizens  maitland apologized  then whom do you suspect of inserting the advertisement as you deny having done it yourself for some purpose which does not appear  i believe the owner of the coat put in the advertisement  that is absurd what had he to gain by it  to remove me from london where he is probably conspiring against me at this moment  buchanan you trifle with justice  i have told you that my name is not buchanan  then why did you forge that name in the hotel book  i wrote it in the hurry and excitement of the moment it was incorrect  why did you lie pourquoi avez vous menti  maitland made an irritable movement  you threaten justice your attitude is deplorable you are consigned au secret and will have an opportunity of revising your situation and replying more fully to the inquiries of justice  so ended maitlands first and happily sole interview with a juge dinstruction lord walter brixton his old st gatiens pupil returned from the country on the very day of maitlands examination an interview during which lord walter laughed unfeelingly with his old coach was not refused to the attaché and in a few hours after some formalities had been complied with maitland was a free man his pièces justificatives his letters cards and return ticket to charing cross were returned to him intact  but maitland determined to sacrifice the privileges of the lastnamed document  i am going straight to constantinople and the greek islands he wrote to barton do you know i dont like paris my attempt at an investigation has not been a success i have endured considerable discomfort and i fear my case will get into the figaro and there will be dozens of social leaders and descriptive headers about me in all the penny papers  then maitland gave his bankers address at constantinople relinquished the quest of margaret and for a while as the sagas say is out of the story     chapter xithe night of adventures  a cold march wind whistled and yelled round the twisted chimneys of the hit or miss the day had been a trial to every sense first there would come a longdrawn distant moan a sigh like that of a querulous woman then the sigh grew nearer and became a shriek as if the same woman were working herself up into a passion and finally a gust of rainy hail mixed with dust and small stones was dashed like a parting insult on the windows of the hit or miss  then the shriek died away again into a wail and a moan and so da capo  well eliza what do you do now that the pantomime season is over said barton to miss gullick who was busily dressing a doll as she perched on the table in the parlor of the hit or miss  barton occasionally looked into the publichouse partly to see that maitlands investment was properly managed partly because the place was near the scene of his labors not least perhaps because he had still an unacknowledged hope that light on the mystery of margaret would come from the original centre of the troubles  im in no hurry to take an engagement answered the resolute eliza holding up and examining her doll it was a fashionable doll in a closefitting tweed ulster which covered a perfect panoply of other female furniture all in the latest mode as the child worked she looked now and then at the illustrations in a journal of the fashions theres two or three managers in treaty with me said eliza theres the follies and frivolities down norwood way and the varieties in the ammersmith road thirty shillings a week and my dresses thats what i ask for and ill get it too just now im taking a vacation and making an honest penny with these things and she nodded at a little basket full of the wardrobe of dolls  do you sell the dresses to the toyshops eliza asked barton  yes said eliza i am doing well with them im not sure i shant need to take on some extra hands by the job to finish my easter orders  pm glad you are successful answered barton i say eliza  yes doctor  would you mind showing me the room upstairs where poor old shields was sitting the night before he was found in the snow  it had suddenly occurred to bartonit might have occurred to him beforethat this room might be worth examining  we aint using it now ill show you it said eliza leading the way upstairs and pointing to a door  barton took hold of the handle  ladies first he said making way for eliza with a bow  no came the childs voice from halfway down the stairs i wont come in they say he walks ive heard noises there at night  a cold stuffy smell came out of the darkness of the unused room barton struck a match and seeing a candle on the table lit it the room had been left as it was when last it was tenanted on the table were an empty bottle two tumblers and a little saucer stained with dry colors blue and red part of shields stockintrade there were besides some very sharp needles of bone of a savage make which barton recognized they were the instruments used for tattooing in the islands of the southern seas  barton placed the lighted candle beside the saucer and turned over the needles presently his eyes brightened he chose one out and examined it closely it was astonishingly sharp and was not of bone like the others but of wood  barton made an incision in the hard brittle wood with his knife and carefully felt the point which was slightly crusted with a dry brown substance  i thought so he said aloud as he placed the needle in a pocket instrumentcase the stem of the leaf of the coucourite palm  then he went downstairs with the candle  did you see him asked eliza with wideopen eyes  dont be childish eliza theres no one to see why is the room left all untidy  mother dare not go in whispered the child then she asked in a low voice did you never hear no more of that awful big bird i saw the night old shields died in the snow  the bird was a dream eliza i am surprised such a clever girl as you should go on thinking about it said barton rather sternly you were tired and ill and you fancied it  no i wasnt said the child solemnly i never say no more about it to mother nor to nobody but i did see it ay and heard it too i remember it at night in my bed and i am afraid oh whats that  she turned with a scream in answer to a scream on the other side of the curtained door that separated the parlor from the bar of the hit or miss  someone seemed to fall against the door which at the same moment flew open as if the wind had burst it in a girl panting and holding her hand to her breast her face deadly white and so contorted by terror as to be unrecognizable flashed into the room oh come oh come she cried shes killing her then the girl vanished as hurriedly as she had appeared it was all over in a moment the vivid impression of a face maddened by fear and of a cry for help that was all in that moment barton had seized his hat and sped as hard as he could run after the girl he found her breaking through a knot of loafers in the bar who were besieging her with questions she turned and saw barton  come doctor come she screamed again and fled out into the night crossing another girl who was apparently speeding on the same errand barton could just see the flying skirts of the first messenger and hear her footfall ring on the pavement up a long street down another and then into a back slum she flew and lastly under a swinging sign of the oldfashioned sort and through a doorway barton following found himself for the first time within the portals of the old english bunhouse  the wide passage the house was old was crowded with girls wildly excited weeping screaming and some of them swearing they were pressed so thick round a door at the end of the hall that barton could scarcely thrust his way through them dragging one aside shouldering another it was a matter of life and death  oh shes been at the drink and shes killed her shes killed her i heard her fall one of the frightened girls was exclaiming with hysterical iteration  let me pass shouted barton and reaching the door at last he turned the handle and pushed the door was locked  give me room he cried and the patrons of the bunhouse yielding place a little barton took a little short run and drove with all the weight of his shoulders against the door it opened reluctantly with a crash and he was hurled into the room by his own impetus and by the stress of the girls behind him  what he beheld was more like some dreadful scene of ancient tragedy than the spectacle of an accident or a crime of modern life  by the windy glare of a dozen gasjets red and shaken like the flame of blown torches by the rainy gusts that swept through a broken pane barton saw a girl stretched bleeding on the sanded floor  one of her arms made a pillow for her head her soft dark hair unfastened half hid her like a veil the other arm lay loose by her side her lips were white her face was bloodless but there was blood on the deepblue folds about the bosom and on the floor at the further side of this girlwho was dead or seemingly deadsat on a low stool a woman in a crouching catlike attitude quite silent and still the knife with which she had done the deed was dripping in her hand the noise of the broken door and of the entering throng had not disturbed her  for a moment even bartons rapidity of action and resolution were paralyzed by the terrible and strange vision that he beheld he stared with all his eyes in a mist of doubt and amazement at a vision dreadful even to one who saw death every day then the modern spirit awoke in him  fetch a policeman he whispered to one of the crowding frightened troop of girls  there is a copper at the door sir here he comes said susan the young woman who had called barton from the hit or miss  the helmet of the guardian of the peace appeared welcome above the throng  and still the pale woman in white sat as motionless as the stricken girl at her feetas if she had not been an actor but a figure in a tableau  policeman said barton i give that woman in charge for an attempt at murder take her to the station  i dont like the looks of her whispered the policeman id better get her knife from her first sir  be quick whatever you do and have the house cleared i cant look after the wounded girl in this crowd  thus addressed the policeman stole round toward the seated woman whose eyes had never deigned all this time to stray from the body of her victim barton stealthily drew near outflanking her on the other side  they were just within arms reach of the murderess when she leaped with incredible suddenness to her feet and stood for one moment erect and lovely as a statue her fair locks lying about her shoulders then she raised her right hand the knife flashed and dropped like lightning into her breast and she too fell beside the body of the girl whom she had stricken  by george shes gone cried the policeman barton pushed past him and laid his hand on the womans heart she stirred once was violently shaken with the agony of death and so passed away carrying into silence her secret and her story  mr cranleys hopes had been at least partially fulfilled  drink i suppose as usual a rummy start remarked the policeman sententiously and then while barton was sounding and stanching the wound of the housekeepers victim and applying such styptics as he had within reach the guardian of social order succeeded in clearing the bunhouse of its patrons in closing the door and in sending a message by the direction of the girl who had summoned barton and who seemed not devoid of sense to mrs st john deloraine while that lady was being expected the girl who now took a kind of subordinate lead was employed by barton in helping to carry margaret to her own room and in generally restoring order  when the messenger arrived at mrs st john deloraines house with bartons brief note and with his own curt statement that murder was being done at the bunhouse he found the lady superior rehearsing for a play mrs st john deloraine was going to give a drawingroom representation of nitouche and the terrible news found her in one of the costumes of the heroine with a very brief explanation variously misunderstood by her guests and fellowamateurs mrs st john deloraine hurried off just as she was and astonished barton who had never seen her before by arriving at the bunhouse as a rather conventional shepherdess in pink and gray rouged and with a fluffy flaxen wig the versatility with which mrs st john deloraine made the best of all worlds occasionally let her into inconsequences of this description  but if she was on pleasure bent mrs st john deloraine had also not only a kind heart but a practical mind in five minutes she had heard the tragic history had dried her eyes torn off her wig and settled herself as nurse by the bedside of margaret the girls wound as barton was happily able to assure her was by no means really dangerous for the point of the weapon had been turned and had touched no vital part but the prodigious force with which the blow had followed on a scene of violent reproaches and insane threats described by one of the young women had affected most perilously a constitution already weakened by sickness and trouble mrs st john deloraine assisted by the most responsible of the bunhouse girls announced her intention to sit up all night with the patient bartonwho was moved perhaps as much by the beauty of the girl and by the excitement of the events as by professional dutyremained in attendance till nearly dawn when the lady superior insisted that he should go home and take some rest as the danger for the patient was not immediate but lay in the chances of fever barton allowed himself to be persuaded and at about five in the morning he let himself out of the bunhouse and made sleepily for his lodgings but sleep that night was to be a stranger to him and his share of adventureswhich like sorrows never come as single spies but in battalionswas by no means exhausted  the night through which the first glimpse of dawn just peered was extremely cold and barton who had left his greatcoat in the hit or miss stamped his way homeward his hands deep in his pockets his hat tight on his head and with his pipe for company  theres the gray beginning zooks he muttered to himself in halfconscious quotation he was as drowsy as a man can be who still steps along and keeps an open eye the streets were empty a sandy wind was walking them alone and hard by the sullen river flowed on the lamplights dimly reflected in the growing blue of morning barton was just passing the locked doors of the hit or missfor he preferred to go homeward by the riversidewhen a singular sound or mixture of sounds from behind the battered old hoarding close by attracted his attention in a moment he was as alert as if he had not passed a nuit blanche the sound at first seemed not very unlike that which a traction engine or any other monster that murders sleep may make before quite getting up steam then there was plainly discernible a great whirring and flapping as if a windmill had become deranged in its economy and was laboring without a conscience or an aim whir whir flap thump came the sounds and then mixed with and dominating them the choking scream of a human being in agony but strangely enough the scream appeared to be half checked and suppressed as if the sufferer whoever he might be and whatever his torment were striving with all his might to endure in silence barton had heard such cries in the rooms of the hospital to such sounds the question chambers of old prisons and palaces must often have echoed barton stopped thrilling with a halfsuperstitious dread so moving in that urban waste were the accents of pain  then whir flap came the noise again and again the human note was heard and was followed by a groan the time seemed infinite though it was only to be reckoned by moments or pulsebeatsthe time during which the torturing crank revolved and was answered by the hardwrung exclamation of agony barton looked at the palings of the hoarding they were a couple of feet higher than his head then he sprung up caught the top at a place where the rustypointed nails were few and broken and next moment with torn coat and a scratch on his arm he was within the palisade  through the crepuscular light bulks of thingsbig black formlesswere dimly seen but nearer the hoarding than the middle of the waste open ground was a spectacle that puzzled the lookeron great fans were winnowing the air a wheel was running at prodigious speed flaming vapors fled hissing forth and the figure of a man attached in some way to the revolving fans was now lifted several feet from the ground now dashed to earth again now caught in and now torn from the teeth of the flying wheel  barton did not pause long in empty speculation he shouted hold on or some other such encouragement and ran in the direction of the sufferer but as he stumbled over dustheaps piles of wood old baskets outworn hats forsaken boots and all the rubbish of the waste land the movement of the flying fans began to slacken the wheels ran slowly down and with a great throb and creak the whole engine ceased moving as a heart stops beating then just when all was over a voice came from the crumpled mass of humanity in the centre of the hideous mechanism  dont come here stop on your peril i am armed and i will shoot  the last words were feeble and scarcely audible  barton stood still even a brave man likes the old irish duelling days being over at least to know why he is to be shot at  whats the matter with you he said what on earth are you doing how can you talk about shooting have you a whole bone in your body  to this the only reply was another groan then silence  by this time there was a full measure of the light which london takes the day to be and barton had a fair view of his partner in this dialogue  he could see the crumpled form of a man weak and distorted like a victim of the rackscattered so to speakin a posture inconceivably out of drawing among the fragments of the engine the mans head was lowest and rested on an old battered box his middle was supported by a beam of the engine one of his legs was elevated on one of the fans the other hung disjointedly in the air the man was strangely dressed in a closefitting suit of clothsomething between the uniform of bicycle clubs and the tights affected by acrobats long thin gray locks fell back from a high yellow forehead there was blood on his mouth and about his beard  barton drew near and touched him the man only groaned  how am i to help you out of this said the surgeon carefully examining his patient as he might now be called a little close observation showed that the mans arms were strapped by buckles into the fans while one of his legs was caught up in some elastic coils of the mechanism  with infinite tenderness barton disengaged the victim whose stifled groans proved at once the extent of his sufferings and of his courage  finally the man was free from the machine and barton discovered that as far as a rapid investigation could show there were no fatal injuries done though a leg an arm and several ribs were fractured and there were many contusions  now i must leave you here for a few minutes while i go round to the policeoffice and get men and a stretcher said barton  the man held up one appealing hand the other was paralyzed  first hide all this he murmured moving his head so as to indicate the fragments of his engine they lay all confused a heap of spars cogs wheels fans and what not a puzzle to the science of mechanics dont let them know a word about it he said say i had an accidentthat i was sleepwalking and fell from a windowsay anything you like but promise to keep my secret in a week he murmured dreamily it would have been complete it is the second time i have just missed success and fame  i have not an idea what your secret may be said barton but here goes for the machine  and while the wounded man watched him with piteous and wistful eyes he rapidly hid different fragments of the mechanism beneath and among the heaps of rubbish which were many and for purposes of concealment meritorious  are you sure you can find them all again asked the victim of misplaced ingenuity  oh yes all right said barton  then you must get me to the street before you bring any help if they find me here they will ask questions and my secret will come out  but how on earth am i to get you to the street barton inquired very naturally even if you could bear being carried i could not lift you over the boarding  i can bear anythingi will bear anything said the man look in my breast and you will find a key of a door in the palings  barton looked as directed and fastened round the neck of the sufferer by a leather shoetie he discovered sure enough a kind of skeletonkey in strong wire  with that you can open the gate and get me into the street said the crushed man but be very careful not to open the door while anyone is passing  he only got out these messages very slowly and after intervals of silence broken by groans  wait one thing more he said as barton stooped to take him in his arms i may faint from pain my address is patersons kents hard by my name is winter then after a pause i can pay for a private room at the infirmary and i must have one lift the third plank from the end in the lefthand corner by the window and you will find enough now  then barton very carefully picked up the poor man mere bag of bones and broken bones as he was  the horrible pain that the man endured barton could imagine yet he dared not hurry for the ground was strewn with every sort of pitfall at lastit seemed hours to barton it must have been an eternity to the suffererthe hoarding was reached and after listening earnestly barton opened the door peered out saw that the coast was clear deposited his burden on the pavement and flew to the not distant policestation  he was not absent long and returning with four men and a stretcher he found of course quite a large crowd grouped round the place where he had left his charge the milkman was there several shabby women one or two puzzled policemen three cabmen though no wizard could have called up a cab at that hour and place had he wanted to catch a train there were riverside loafers workmen going to their labor and a lucky pennyaliner with his tissue and pencil  pushing his way through these gapers barton found as he expected that his patient had fainted he aided the policemen to place him on the stretcher accompanied him to the infirmary how common a sight is that motionless body on a stretcher in the streets explained as much of the case as was fitting to the surgeon in attendance and then at last returned to his rooms and a bath puzzling over the mystery  by jove he said as he helped himself to a devilled wing of a chicken at breakfast i believe the poor beggar had been experimenting with a flyingmachine     chapter xiia patient  a doctor especially a doctor actively practising among the poor and laborious soon learns to take the incidents of his profession rather calmly barton had often been called in when a revel had ended in suicide or death and if he had never before seen a man caught in a flyingmachine he had been used to heal wounds quite as dreadful caused by engines of a more familiar nature  though barton therefore could go out to his round of visits on the day after his adventurous vigil without unusual emotion it may be conceived that the distress and confusion at the bunhouse were very great the police and the gloomy attendants on death were in the place mrs st john deloraine had to see many official people to answer many disagreeable questions and suffered in every way extremely from the consequences of her beneficent enterprise but she displayed a coolness and businesslike common sense worthy of a less versatile philanthropist and found time amid the temporary ruin of her work to pay due attention to margaret she had scarcely noticed the girl before taking her very much on trust and being preoccupied with various schemes of social enjoyment but now she was struck by her beauty and her educated manner though that to be sure was amply accounted for by the explanations offered by cranley before her engagement already mrs st john deloraine was conceiving a project of perpetual friendship and had made up her mind to adopt margaret as a daughter or let us say niece and companion the girl was too refined to cope with the roughandready young patronesses of the bunhouse  if the ladys mind was even more preoccupied by the survivor in the hideous events of the evening than by the tragedy itself and the dead woman barton too found his thoughts straying to his new patientnot that he was a flirt or a sentimentalist even in the spring bartons fancy did not lightly turn to thoughts of love he was not one of those amatorious young men as milton says perhaps at too great length who cannot see a pretty girl without losing their hearts to her barton was not so prodigal of his affections yet it were vain to deny that as he went his rather drowsy round of professional visits his ideas were more apt to stray to the girl who had been stabbed than to the man who had been rescued from the machinery the man was old yellow withered and in bartons private opinion more of a lunatic charlatan than a successful inventor the girl was young beautiful and interesting enough apart from her wound to demand and secure a place in any fancy absolutely free  it was no more than bartons actual duty to call at the old english bunhouse in the afternoon here he was welcomed by mrs st john deloraine who was somewhat pale and shaken by the horrors of the night she had turned all her young customers out and had stuck up a paper bearing a legend to the effect that the old english bunhouse was closed for the present and till further notice a wistful crowd was drawn up on the opposite side of the street and was staring at the bunhouse  mrs st john deloraine welcomed barton it might almost be said with open arms she had by this time of course laid aside the outward guise of nitouche and was dressed like other ladies but better  my dear mr barton she exclaimed your patient is doing very well indeed she will be crazy with delight when she hears that you have called  barton could not help being pleased at this intelligence even when he had discounted it as freely as even a very brief acquaintance with mrs si john deloraine taught her friends to do  do you think she is able to see me he asked  ill run to her room and inquire said mrs st john deloraine fleeting nimbly up the steep stairs and leaving like astrsea as described by charles lambs friend a kind of rosy track or glow behind her from the chastened splendor of her very becoming hose  barton waited rather impatiently till the lady of the bunhouse returned with the message that he might accompany her into the presence of the invalid  a very brief interview satisfied him that his patient was going on even better than he had hoped also that she possessed very beautiful and melancholy eyes she said little but that little kindly and asked whether mr cranley had sent to inquire for her mrs st john deloraine answered the question which puzzled barton in the negative and when they had left margaret miss burnside as mrs st john deloraine called her he ventured to ask who the mr cranley might be about whom the girl had spoken  well replied mrs st john deloraine it was through mr cranley that i engaged both miss burnside and that unhappy woman whom i cant think of without shuddering the inquest is to be held tomorrow it is too dreadful when these things that have been only names come home to one now i really do not like to think hardly of anybody but i must admit that mr cranley has quite misled me about the housekeeper he gave her an excellent character especially for sobriety and till yesterday i had no fault to find with her then the girls say she became quite wild and intoxicated and it is hard to believe that this is the first time she yielded to that horrid temptation dont you think it was odd of mr cranley and i sent round a messenger with a note to his rooms but it was returned marked has left address not known i dont know what has become of him perhaps the housekeeper could have told us but the unfortunate woman is beyond reach of questions  do you mean the mr cranley who is rector of st medards in chelsea asked barton  no i mean mr thomas cranley the son of the earl of birkenhead he was a great friend of mine  mr thomas cranley exclaimed barton with an expression of face which probably spoke at least three volumes and these of a highly sensational character  now please cried mrs st john deloraine clasping her hands in a pretty attitude of entreaty like a recording angel hesitating to enter the peccadillo of a favorite saint please dont say you know anything against mr cranley i am aware that he has many enemies  barton was silent for a minute he had that good old schoolboy feeling about not telling tales out of school which is so english and so unknown in france but on the other side he could scarcely think it right to leave a lady of invincible innocence at the mercy of a confirmed scoundrel  upon my word it is a very unpleasant thing to have to say but really if you ask me i should remark that mr cranleys enemies are of his own making i would not go to him for a girls character im sure but i thought he had disappeared from society  so he had he told me that there was a conspiracy against him and that i was one of the few people who he felt sure would never desert him and i never would i never turn my back on my friends  if there was a conspiracy said barton i am the ringleader in it for as you ask me i must assure you on my honor that i detected mr cranley in the act of trying to cheat some very young men at cards i would not have mentioned it for the world he added almost alarmed at the expression of pain and terror in mrs st john deloraines face but you wished to be told and i could not honestly leave you in the belief that he is a man to be trusted what he did when i saw him was only what all who knew him well would have expected and his treatment of you in the matter of that womans character was cried barton growing indignant as he thought of it one of the very basest things i ever heard of i had seen that woman before she was not fit to be entrusted with the care of girls she was at one time very well known  mrs st john deloraines face had passed through every shade of expressiondoubt shame and indignation but now it assumed an air of hope  margaret has always spoken so well of him she said half to herself he was always very kind to her and yet she was only the poor daughter of a humble acquaintance  perhaps he deviated into kindness for once said barton but as to his general character it is certain that it was on a par with the trap he laid for you i wish i knew where to find him you must never let him get the poor girl back into his hands  certainly not said mrs si john deloraine with conviction in her voice and now i must go back to her and see whether she wants anything do you think i may soon move her to my own house in cheyne walk it is not far and she will be so much more comfortable there  the best thing you can do said barton and be sure you send for me if you want me or if you ever hear anything more of mr cranley i am quite ready to meet him anywhere  you will call tomorrow  certainly about this time said barton and he kept his promise assiduously calling often  a fortnight went by and margaret almost restored to health and in a black teagown the property of mrs st john deloraine was lying indolently on a sofa in the house in cheyne walk she was watching the struggle between the waning daylight and the fire when the door opened and the servant announced dr barton  margaret held forth a rather languid hand  im so sorry mrs st john deloraine is out she said she is at a soapbubble party i wish i could go it is so long since i saw any children or had any fun  so margaret spoke and then she sighed remembering the reason why she should not attend soapbubble parties  im selfish enough to be glad you could not go said barton for then i should have missed you but why do you sigh  i have had a good many things to make me unhappy said margaret in addition to myto my accident you must not think i am always bewailing myself but perhaps you know that i lost my father just before i entered mrs st john deloraines service and then my whole course of life was altered  i am very sorry for you said barton simply he did not know what else to say but he felt more than his conventional words indicated and perhaps he looked as if he felt it and more  margaret was still too weak to bear an expression of sympathy and tears came into her eyes followed by a blush on her pale thin cheeks she was on the point of breaking down  there is nothing in the world so trying to a young man as to see a girl crying a wild impulse to kiss and comfort her passed through bartons mind before he said awkwardly again  i cant tell you how sorry i am i wish i could do anything for you cant i help you in any way you must not give up so early in the troubles of life and then who knows but yours having begun soon are nearly over  barton would perhaps have liked to ask her to let him see that they were over as far as one mortal can do as much for another  they have been going on so long said margaret i have had such a wandering life and such changes  barton would have given much to be able to ask for more information but more was not offered  let us think of the future he said have you any idea about what you mean to do  mrs st john deloraine is very kind she wishes me to stay with her always but i am puzzled about mr cranley i dont know what he would like me to do he seems to have gone abroad  barton hated to hear her mention cranleys name  had you known him long he asked  no for a very short time only but he was an old friend of my fathers and had promised him to take care of me he took me away from school and he gave me a start in life  but surely he might have found something more worthy of you of your education said barton  what can a girl do answered margaret we know so little i could hardly even have taught very little children they thought me dreadfully backward at schoolat least miss i mean the teachers thought me backward  im sure you know as much as anyone should said barton indignantly were you at a nice school he added  he had been puzzling himself for many days over margarets history she seemed to have had at least the ordinary share of education and knowledge of the world and yet he had found her occupying a menial position at a philanthropic bunhouse even now she was a mere dependent of mrs st john deloraine though there was a stanchness in that ladys character which made her patronage not precarious  there were some nice girls at it answered margaret without committing herself  rochefoucauld declares that there are excellent marriages but no such thing as a delightful marriage perhaps schoolgirls may admit as an abstract truth that good schools exist but few would allow that any place of education is nice  it is really getting quite late barton observed reluctantly he liked to watch the girl whose beauty made wan by illness received just a touch of becoming red from the glow of the fire he liked to talk to her in fact this was his most interesting patient by far it would be miserably black and dark in his lodgings he was aware and nonpaying patients would be importunate in proportion to their poverty the poor are often the most exacting of hypochondriacs margaret noticed his reluctance to go contending with a sense of what he owed to propriety  i am sure you must want tea but i dont like to ring it is so short a time since i wore an apron and a cap and the rest of it myself at the bunhouse that i am afraid to ask the servants to do anything for me they must dislike me it is very natural  it is not natural at all said barton with conviction perfectly monstrous on the other hand this little compliment eclipsed the effect of firelight on the girls face suppose i ring he added and then you can say when mary says did you ring miss no i didnt ring but as you are here mary would you mind bringing tea  i dont know if that would be quite honest said margaret doubtfully  a pious frauda drawingroom comedy said barton have we rehearsed it enough  then he touched the bell and the little piece of private theatricals was played out though one of the artists had some difficulty as amateurs often have in subduing an inclination to giggle  now this is quite perfect said barton when he had been accommodated with a large piece of plumcake this is the very kind of cake which we specially prohibit our patients to touch and so near dinnertime too there should be a new proverb physician diet thyself you see we dont all live on a very thin slice of cold bacon and a piece of dry toast  mrs st john deloraine has never taken up that kind of life said margaret she tries a good many new things barton remarked  yes but she is the best woman in the world answered the girl oh if you knew what a comfort it is to be with a lady again and she shuddered as she remembered her late chaperon  i wonder if some dayyou wont think me very rude asked bartonyou would mind telling me a little of your history  mr cranley ordered me to say nothing about it answered margaret and a great deal is very sad and hard to tell you are all so kind and everything is so quiet here and safe and peaceful that it frightens me to think of things that have happened or may happen  they shall never happen if you will trust me cried barton when a carriage was heard to stop at the gateway of the garden outside  here is mrs st john deloraine at last cried margaret starting to run to the window but she was so weak that she tripped and would have fallen had barton not caught her lightly  oh how stupid you must think me she said blushing and barton thought he had never seen anything so pretty  once for all i dont think you stupid or backward or anything else that you call yourself  but at that very moment the door opened and mrs st john deloraine entered magnificently comfortable in furs and bringing a fresh air of hospitality and content with existence into the room  oh you are here she cried and i have almost missed you now you must stay to dinner you need not dress we are all alone margaret and i  so he did stop to dine and pauper hypochondriacs eager for his society which was always cheering knocked and rang also at his door in vain it was an excellent dinner and on the wings of the music mrs st john deloraine was playing in the front drawingroom two happy hours passed lightly over barton and margaret into the backward where all hoursgood and evilabide remembered or forgotten     chapter xiiianother patient       des ailes des ailes des ailes      comme dans le chant de ruckert      théophile gautier  so you think a flying machine impossible sir and me i presume a fanatic well well you have eusebius with you such an one he saysmeaning me and inventors like meis a little crazed with the humors of melancholy  the speaker was the man whom barton had rescued from the cogs and wheels and springs of an infuriated engine barton could not but be interested in the courage and perseverance of this sufferer whom he was visiting in hospital the young surgeon had gone to inspect the room in patersons rants and had found it as he more or less expected the conventional den of the needy inventor our large towns are full of such persons they are the treasure hunters of cities and of civilizationthe modern seekers for the philosophers stone at the end of a vista of dreams they behold the great discovery made perfect and themselves the winners of fame and of wealth incalculable  for the present most of these visionaries are occupied with electricity they intend to make the lightning a domestic slave in every house and to turn ariel into a common carrier but from the aspect of winters den in patersons rents it was easy to read that his heart was set on a more ancient foible the white deal bookshelves homemade which lined every wall were packed with tattered books on mechanics and especially on the art of flying here you saw the spoils of the fourpenny box of cheap bookvendors mixed with volumes in better condition purchased at a larger cost hereamong the litter of tattered pamphlets and wellthumbed proceedings of the linnean and the aeronautic society of great britainhere were fredericus hermannus de arte volandi and cayleys works and hatton turners astra castra and the voyage to the moon of cyrano de bergerac and bishop wilkinss dædalus and the same sanguine prelates mercury the secret messenger here were cardan and raymond lully and a shabby set of the classics mostly in french translations and a score of lucubrations by french and other inventorsponton damocourt borelli chabrier girard and marey  even if his books had not shown the direction of the new patients minda man is known by his books at least as much as by his companions and companions winter had noneeven if the shelves had not spoken clearly the models and oddsandends in the room would have proclaimed him an inventor as the walls were hidden by his library and as the floor also was littered with tomes and pamphlets and periodicals a quantity of miscellaneous gear was hung by hooks from the ceiling  barton who was more than commonly tall found his head being buffeted by big preserved wings of birds and other flying thingsfrom the sweeping pinions of the albatross to the leathery covering of the bat from the ceiling too hung models cleverly constructed in various materials and herea cork with quills stuck into it and with a kind of drillbowwas the little flying model of sir george cayley the whole place dusty and musty with a faded smell of the oil in birds feathers was almost more noisome than curious when barton left it his mind was made up as to the nature of winters secret or delusion and when he visited that queer patient in hospital he was not surprised either by his smattered learning or by his golden dreams  yes sir eusebius is against me no doubt winter went on with his eager talk an acute manrather too acute dont you think for a father of the church that habit he got into of smashing the arguments of the heathen gave him a kind of flippancy in talking of high matters  such as flying put in barton  yes such as our great aimthe aim of all the ages i may call it what does bishop wilkins say sir why he says i doubt not but that flying in the air may be easily effected by a diligent and ingenious artificer diligent i may say i have been as to ingenious i leave the verdict to others  was that peter wilkins you were quoting asked barton to humor his man  why no sir the bishop was not peter peter wilkins is the hero of a mere romance in which it is true we meet with womengoories he calls themendowed with the power of flight but they were born so we get no help from peter wilkins a mere dreamer  it doesnt seem to be so easy as the bishop fancies remarked barton leading him on  no sir cried winter all his aches and pains forgotten and his pale face flushed with the delight of finding a listener who did not laugh at him no sir the bishop though ingenious was not a practical man but look at what he says about the weight of your flying machine can anything be more sensible borne out too by the most recent researches and the authority of professor pettigrew bell himself you remember the iron fly made by begimontanus of nuremberg  the iron fly murmured barton i cant say i do  you will find a history of it in bamus this fly would leap from the hands of the great begimontanus flutter and buzz round the heads of his guests assembled at supper and then as if wearied return and repose on the finger of its maker  you dont mean to say you believe that asked barton  why not sir why not did not archytas of tarenturn one of platos acquaintances construct a wooden dove in no way less miraculous and the same regimontanus at nuremberg fashioned an eagle which by way of triumph did fly out of the city to meet charles v but where was i oh at bishop wilkins cardan doubted of the iron fly of regimontanus because the material was so heavy but bishop wilkins argues in accordance with the best modern authorities that the weight is no hindrance whatever if proportional to the motive power a flying machine says professor bell in the encyclopodia britannicayou will not question the authority of the encyclopodia britannicaa flying machine should be a compact moderately heavy and powerful structure there you see the bishop was right  yours was deuced powerful remarked barton i did not expect to see two limbs of you left together  it is powerful or rather it was answered winter with a heavy sigh but its all to do over againall to do over again yet it was a noble specimen the passive surface was reduced to a minimum as the learned author in the encyclopodia recommends  by jove the passive surface was jolly near reduced to a mummy you were the passive surface as far as i could see  dont laugh at me please sir after youve been so kind all the rest laugh at me you cant think what a pleasure it has been to talk to a scholar and there was a new flush on the poor fellows cheek and something watery in his eyes  i beg your pardon my dear sir cried barton greatly ashamed of himself pray go on the subject is entirely new to me i had not been aware that there were any serious modern authorities in favor of the success of this kind of experiment  thank you sir said winter much encouraged and taking bartons hand in his own battered claw thank you but why should we run only to modern authorities all great inventions all great ideas have been present to mens minds and hopes from the beginning of civilization did not empedocles forestall mr darwin and hit out at a stroke the hypothesis of natural selection  well he did make a shot at it admitted barton who remembered as much as that from the old coaching days and college lectures at st gatiens  well what do we find as soon as we get a whisper of civilization in greece we find dædalus successful in flying the pragmatic interpreters pretend that the fable does but point to the discovery of sails for ships but i put it to you is that probable  obvious bosh said barton  and the meteorological mycologists sir they maintain that dædalus is only the lightning flying in the breast of the storm  theres nothing those fellows wont say replied barton  im glad you are with me sir in dædalus i see either a record of a successful attempt at artificial flight or at the very least the expression of an aspiration as old as culture you wouldnt make dædalus the evening clouds accompanying minos the sun to his setting in sicily in the west added winter anxiously  i never heard of such nonsense said barton  sir frederick leighton the president of the royal academy is with me sir if i may judge by his picture of dædalus  every sensible man must be with you answered barton  well sir i wont detain you with other famous flyers of antiquity such as abaris mounted on an arrow as described by herodotus doubtless the arrow was a flying machine a novelty to the ignorant scythians  it must have been indeed  then there was the greek who flew before nero in the circus but he i admit had a bad fall as seutonius recounts that character of lucians who employed an eagles wing and a vultures in his flight i take to be a mere figment of the satirists imagination but what do you make of simon magus he i cannot doubt had invented a machine in which like myself he made use of steam or naphtha this may be gathered from arnobius our earliest authority he mentions expressly currum simonis magi et quadrigas igneas the chariot of simon magus and his vehicles of flameclearly the naphtha is alluded towhich vanished into air at the word of the apostle peter the latter circumstances being miraculous i take leave to doubt but certainly simon magus had overcome the difficulties of aerial navigation but though petrus crinitus rejects the tradition as fabulous i am prepared to believe that simon magus actually flew from the capitol to the aventine  the world knows nothing of its greatest men quoted barton  simon magus has been the victim sir of theological acrimony his character blackened his flying machine impugned or ascribed as by the credulous arnobius to diabolical arts in the dark ages naturally the science of artificial flight was either neglected or practised in secret through fear of persecution busbequius speaks of a turk at constantinople who attempted something in this way but he the turk i mean was untrammelled by ecclesiastical prejudice but why should we tarry in the past have we not mr proctor with us both in knowledge and the cornhill does not the preeminent authority professor pettigrew bell himself declare with the weight too of the encyclopodia britannica that the number of successful flying models is considerable it is not too much to expect he goes on that the problem of artificial flight will be actually solved or at least much simplified what less can we expect as he observes in the land of watt and stephenson when the construction of flying machines has been taken up in earnest by practical men  we may indeed said barton hope for the best when persons of your learning and ingenuity devote their efforts to the cause  as to my learning you flatter me said winter i am no scholar but an enthusiast will study the history of his subject did i remark that the great dr johnson in these matters so sceptical admits in a romance it is true the possibility of artificial flight the artisan of the happy valley expected to solve the problem in one years time if all men were equally virtuous said this artist i should with equal alacrity teach them all to fly  and you will keep your secret like dr johnsons artist  to you i do not mind revealing this much the vans or wings of my machine describe elliptic figures of eight  ive seen them do that said barton  like the wings of birds and have the same forward and downward stroke by a direct piston action the impetus is given after a descent in airwhich i effected by starting from a height of six feet onlyby a combination of heated naphtha and of india rubber under torsion by steam alone in 1842 philips made a model of a flyingmachine soar across two fields penauds machine relying only on india rubber under torsion flies for some fifty yards what a model can do as bishop wilkins well observes a properly weighted and proportioned flyingmachine capable of carrying a man can do also  but yours when i first had the pleasure of meeting you was not carrying you at all  something had gone wrong with the mechanism answered winter sighing it is always so an inventor has many things to contend against remember arkwright and how he was puzzled hopelessly by that trifling error in the thickness of the valves in his spinning machine he had to give half his profits to strutt the local blacksmith before strutt would tell him that he had only to chalk his valves the thickness of a coating of chalk made all the difference some trifle like that depend on it interfered with my machine you see i am obliged to make my experiments at night and in the dark for fear of being discovered and anticipated i have been on the vergenay over the vergeof success no imaginable invention bishop wilkins says could prove of greater benefit to the world or greater glory to the author a few weeks ago that glory was mine  why a few weeks ago asked barton was your machine more advanced then than when i met you  i cannot explain what had happened to check its motion said winter wearily but a few weeks ago my machine acted and i may say that i knew the sensations of a bird on the wing  do you mean that you actually flew  for a very short distance i did indeed sir  barton looked at him curiously two currents of thoughtone wild and credulous the other practical and professionalsurged and met in his brain the professional current proved the stronger for the moment  goodnight he said you are tiring and overexciting yourself i will call again soon  he did call again and winter told him a tale which will be repeated in its proper place     chapter xivfound       all precious things discovered late      to those that seek them issue forth      for love in sequel works with fate      and draws the veil from hidden worth      the sleeping beauty  that margaret and barton were losing their hearts to each other could not of course escape the keen eye of mrs st john deloraine she noticed that margaret though perfectly restored to health and lacking only the clear brown over the rose of her cheeks was by no means so light of heart as in the very earliest days of her recovery love makes men and women poor company and to speak plainly takes the fun out of them margaret was absentminded given to long intervals of silence a bad listenerall of them things hateful to mrs st john deloraine but pardoned in this instance by the benevolent lady margaret was apt to blush without apparent cause to start when a knock came to the door to leave the room hurriedly and need to be sought and brought back when barton called nor was barton himself such good company as he had been his manner was uncertain and constrained his visits began to be paid at longer intervals he seemed to have little to say or talked in fits and starts and yet he did not know how to go away  persons much less clearsighted than mrs st john deloraine could have interpreted without difficulty this awkward position of affairs  now like most women of her kindly and impulsive character when it has not been refined away into nothing by social hypocrisies mrs st john deloraine was a perfectly reckless matchmaker she believed in love with her whole heart it was a joy to her to mark the beginnings of inclination in two young souls and she simply revelled in an engagement all considerations of economy prudence and foresight melted away before the ardor of her enthusiasm to fall in love first to get engaged next and to be married as soon as possible afterward without regard to consequences of any kind were in this ladys mind heroic actions and almost the whole duty of men and women  in her position and with her opportunities she soon knew all that was to be known about margarets affections and also about bartons  hes as much in love with you as a man can be my dear she said to margaret not worthy of him your past a barrier between you and him nonsense daisy that is his affair i know you are as good a girl as ever lived your father was poor no doubt and that wretched mr cranleyyes he was a wretchhad a spite against you i dont know why and you wont help me to guess but mr barton is too much of a man to let that kind of thing disturb him im sure you are afraid of something margaret your nerves have been unstrung im sure i dont wonder at it i know what it is to lose ones nerve i could no more drive now as i used to do or go at the fences i used to think nothing of but once you are married to a man like mr barton who is there can frighten you and as to being poor and mrs st john deloraine explained her generous views as to arrangements on her part which would leave margaret far from portionless  then margaret would cry a little and lay her head on her friends shoulder and the friend would shed some natural tears for company and they would have tea and barton would call and look a great deal at his boots and fidget with his hat  ive no patience with you mr barton said mrs st john deloraine at last when she had so manouvred as to have some private conversation with him and barton had unpacked his heart ive no patience with you why where is your courage she has a history shes been persecuted well wheres your chivalry why dont you try your fortune there never was a better girl nor a pleasanter companion when shes notwhen shes not disturbed by the nervousness of an undecided young man if you dont take your courage in both hands i will carry margaret off on a yachting voyage to the solomon islands or jericho or somewhere look here i am going to take her for a drive in battersea park it is handy and looking very pretty and as lonely as tadmor in the wilderness we will get out and saunter among the ponds i shall be tired and sit down you will show margaret the marvels of natural history in the other pond and when you come back you will both have made up your minds  with this highly transparent ruse barton expressed his content the carriage was sent for and in less than half an hour barton and margaret were standing alone remote isolated from the hum of men looking at a pond where some waterhens were diving while a fish coarse but not uninteresting occasionally flopped on the surface the treesit was the last week of maywere in the earliest freshness of their foliage the air for a wonder was warm and still  how quiet and pretty it is said margaret who would think we were in london  barton said nothing like the french parrot mentioned by sir walter scott he thought the more  miss burnside he exclaimed suddenly we have known each other now for some time  this was a self evident proposition but margaret felt what was coming and trembled she turned for a moment pretending to watch the movements of one of the waterfowls inwardly she was nerving herself to face the hard part of her duty and to remind barton of the mystery in her life  yes she said at last we have known each other for some time and yetyou know nothing about me  with these words she lifted her eyes and looked him straight in the face there seemed a certain pride and nobility in her he had not seen before though her beautiful brown eyes were troubled and there was a mark of pain on her brow what was she going to tell him  barton felt his courage come back to him  i know one thing about you and that is enough for me i know i love you he said margaret cant you care for me a little dont tell me anything you think you should not say im not curious  margaret turned back again to her inspection of the pond and its inmates grasping the iron railing in front of her and gazing down into the waters so that he could not see her face  no she said at last in a very low voice it would not be fair then after another pause there is someone she murmured and stopped  this was the last thing barton had expected if she did not care for him he fancied she cared for nobody  if you like someone better he was beginning  but i dont like him at all interrupted margaret he was very kind but  then cant you like me asked barton and by this time he was very near her and was looking down into her face as curiously as she was still studying the natural history of battersea ponds  perhaps i should not it is so difficult to know murmured margaret and yet her rosy confusion and beautiful lowered eyes tender and ashamed proved that she knew very well love is not always so blind but that barton saw his opportunity and was assured that she had surrendered and he prepared a conqueror to march in with all the honors and rewards of war for the place was lonely and a covenant is no covenant until it is sealed  but when he would have kissed her margaret disengaged herself gently with a little sigh and returned to the strong defensible position by the iron railings  i must tell you about myself she said i have promised never to tell but i must i have been so tossed about and so weak and so many things have happened and she sighed  however impassioned a lover may be he does naturally prefer that there should be no mystery about her he adores barton had convinced himself aided by the eloquence and reposing on the feminine judgment of mrs st john deloraine that margaret could have nothing that was wrong to conceal he could not look at her frank eyes and kind face and suspect her though to anyone but a lover these natural advantages are no argument he therefore prepared to gratify an extreme curiosity and by way of comforting and aiding margaret was on the point of assuming an affectionate attitude but she moved a little away and still turning toward the friendly ponds began her story  the personthe gentleman whom i was thinking of was a friend of my fathers who at one time wanted himhere margaret pausedwanted me toto be his wife some day  the rapid imagination of barton conjured up the figure of a welltodo local pawnbroker or captain of a trading vessel as the selected spouse of margaret he fumed at the picture in his fancy  i didnt like him much though he certainly was very kind his namebut perhaps i should not mention his name  never mind said barton i dare say i never heard of him  but i should tell you first of all that my own name is not that which you and mrs st john deloraine know me by i had often intended to tell her but i have become so frightened lately and it seemed so mean to be living with her under a false name but to speak of it brought so many terrible things back to mind  dear margaret barton whispered taking her hand  they were both standing at this moment with their backs to the pathway and an observer might have thought that they were greatly interested in the waterfowl  my name is not burnside margaret went on glancing over her shoulder across the gardens and toward the river my name is  daisy shields cried a clear voice daisy youre found at last and ive found you how glad miss marlett will be  but by this time the astonished barton beheld margaret in the impassioned embrace of a very pretty and highlyexcited young lady while mrs st john deloraine who was with her gazed with amazement in her eyes  oh my dear miss harman for it was that enthusiast hurried on in a pleasant flow of talk like a brook with pleasant interruptions oh my dear i was walking in the park with my maid and i met mrs st john deloraine and she said she had lost her friends and i came to help her to look for them and ive found you its like stanley finding livingstone how i found daisy ill write a book about it and where have you been hiding yourself none of the girls ever knew anything was the matteronly miss mariett and me and ive left for good and she and i are quite friends and im to be presented next drawing room  while this address which at least proved that margaret had acquaintances in the highest circles was being poured forth mrs st john deloraine and barton were observing all with unfeigned astonishment and concern  they both perceived that the mystery of margarets past was about to be dispelled or rather for barton it already was dispelled the names of shields and miss marlett had told him all that he needed to know but he would rather have heard the whole story from his ladys lips and mrs st john deloraine was mentally accusing janey harman of having interrupted a proposal and spoiled a darling scheme  it was therefore with a certain most unfamiliar sharpness that mrs st john deloraine observing that the day was clouded over requested margaret to return to the carriage  and as miss harman seems to have a great deal to say to you margaret added the philanthropic lady you two had better walk on as fast as you can for you must be very careful not to catch cold i see miss harmans maid waiting for her in the distance there and you and i mr barton if you will give me your arm will follow slower im not a good walker  now said bartons companion eagerly when margaret and janey about three yards in advance might be conventionally regarded as beyond earshotnow mr barton am i to congratulate you  barton gave a little shamefaced laugh uneasily  i dont knowi hope soim not sure  oh youre not satisfactorynot at all satisfactory are you still shillyshallying what is the matter with young people cried the veteran of twentynine or was it that wretched janey rushing in like a cow in a conservatory shes a regular schoolgirl  it isnt that exactly or at least thats not all i hopei think she does care for me or will care for me a little  oh bother said mrs st john deloraine she would not for all the world reveal the secrets of the confessional and tell barton what she knew of the state of margarets heart but she was highly provoked and showed it in her manners at no time applauded for their repose  the fact is barton admitted that im so taken by surprise i hardly know where i am i do think if i may say so without seeming conceited that i have every reason to be happy but just as she was beginning to tell me about herself that young lady who seems to have known her at school rushed in and explained the whole mystery  well said mrs si john deloraine turning a little pale and looking anxiously at barton was it anything so very dreadful  she called her daisy shields said barton  well i suppose she did i always fancied after what happened at the bunhouse that that dreadful mr cranley sent her to me under a false name it was not her fault the question is what was her reason for keeping her real name concealed  thats what im coming to said barton i have a friend a mr maitland  mr maitland of st gatiens asked the widow  yes  i know him  yes i have often heard him speak of you said barton well he had a protégéea kind of ward to tell a long story in few wordsa girl whom he had educated and whom he was under some kind of promise to her father to marry the father died suddenly the girl disappeared mysteriously from school at the same moment and maitland after many efforts has never been able to find out anything about her now this girls name this girl in whom my friend was interested was margaret shields that is the very name by which your friend miss harman called margaret so you see even if i am right and if she does care for me what a dreadful position i am in i want to marry the girl to whom my friend is more or less engaged my friend after doing his best to find his ward and after really suffering a great deal of anxiety and annoyance is living abroad what am i to say to him  mr barton said mrs st john deloraine perhaps you alarm yourself too much i thinkhere she dropped her voice a littlei thinki dont think mr maitlands heart is very deeply concerned about miss shields i may be wrong but i know him pretty wellshe gave a little nervous laughand i dont think hes in love with margaret  by the time she reached the end of this interrupted and tentative discourse mrs st john deloraine was blushing like a rose in june  barton felt an enormous weight lifted from his heart and a flood of welcome light poured into his mind the two philanthropists were in love with each other  hes an awfully good fellow maitland he replied but you are right im sure you are right you must know he is not in love with margaret  mrs st john deloraine seemed not displeased at the tribute to maitlands unobtrusive virtues and replied  but he will be very glad to hear that she is found at last and quite safe and ill write to him myself this very evening i heard from himabout a charity you knowa few days ago and i have his address  by this time they had reached the carriage janey with many embraces tore herself from margaret and went off with her attendant while mrs st john deloraine with a beaming face gave the coachman the order home  we shall see you tomorrow at luncheon she cried to barton and no offer of hospitality had ever been more welcome  he began to walk home turning over his discoveries in his thoughts when he suddenly came to a dead halt  by george he said out loud ill go back and have it out with her at once ive had enough of this shillyshally  he turned and strode off in the direction of cheyne walk in a few minutes he was standing at the familiar door  will you ask missmiss burnside if she can see me for one moment he said to the servant i have forgotten something she wished me to do for her he added in a mumble  then he was taken into the boudoir and presently margaret appeared still in her bonnet and furs  i couldnt help coming back margaret he said as soon as she entered the room i want to tell you that it is all right that you neednt thinki mean that i know all about it and that there is nothing nothing to prevent usi mean» margaret if you really care for me  then he came to a dead stop  it was not a very easy situation barton could not exactly say to margaret my dear girl you need not worry yourself about maitland he does not care a pin for you hell be delighted at being released he is in love with mrs st john deloraine  that would have been a statement both adequate and explicit but it could not have been absolutely flattering to margaret and it would have been exceedingly unfair to her hostess  the girl came forward to the table and stood with her hand on it looking at barton she did not help him out in any way her attitude was safe but embarrassing  he made a charge as it were at the positiona random desperate charge  margaret can you trust me he asked  she merely put out her hand which he seized  well then believe me when i tell you that i know everything about your doubts that i know more than anyone else can do and that there is nothing to prevent us from being happy more than that if you will only agree to make me happy you will make everyone else happy too cant you take it on trust cant you believe me  margaret said nothing but she hid her face on bartons shoulder she did believe him  the position was carried     chapter xvthe mark of cain  next morning barton entered his sittingroom in very high spirits and took up his letters he had written to maitland the night before saying little but come home at once margaret is found she is going to be my wife you cant come too quickly if you wish to hear of something very much to your advantage a load was off his mind and he felt as romeo did just before the bad news about juliet reached him  in this buoyant disposition barton opened his letters the first was in a hand he knew very wellthat of a man who had been his fellowstudent in paris and vienna and who was now a prosperous young physician the epistle ran thus  dear bartonim off to the west of ireland for a fortnight people are pretty fit as the season has not run far most of my patients have not yet systematically overeaten themselves i want you to do something for me martin  wright the lawyers have a queer little bit of medical jurisprudence about which young wright who was at oriel in our time asked my opinion i recommended him to see you as it is more in your line and my line will presently be attached to that eminent general practitioner the blue doctor may he prosper with the galway salmon  thine  alfred franks  lucky beggar thought barton to himself but he was too happy to envy even a man who had a fortnight of salmonfishing before him  the next letter he opened was in a blue envelope with the stamp of messrs martin  wright the brief and and formal note which it contained requested dr barton to call that very day if possible at the chambers of the respectable firm on business of great importance  what in the world can they want thought barton nobody can have left me any money besides franks says it is a point in medical jurisprudence that sounds attractive ill go down after breakfast  he walked along the sunny embankment and that bright prospect of houses trees and ships have never seemed so beautiful in an hour he was in lincolns inn fields and had shaken hands with young wright whom he knew had been introduced to old wright a somewhat stately man of business and had taken his seat in the chair sacred to clients  dr barton said old mr wright solemnly you are i think the author of this book  he handed to barton a copy of his own volume in its gray paper cover les tatouages Étude médicolégale  certainly said barton i wrote it when i was in paris i had plenty of chances of studying tattooing in the military hospitals  i have not read it myself said old mr wright because i am not acquainted with the french language but my son tells me it is a work of great learning  barton could only bow and mutter that he was glad mr wright liked it why he should like it or what the old gentleman wanted he could not even imagine  we are at present engaged in a very curious case dr barton went on the lawyer in which we think your special studies may assist us the position is this nearly eight months ago a client of ours died a mr richard johnson of linkheaton in the north you must excuse me if i seem to be troubling you with a long story  barton mentioned that he was delighted and added not at all in the vague modern dialect  this mr richard johnson then was a somewhat singular character he was what is called a statesman in the north he had a small property of about four hundred acres on the marches as they say or boarders of the earl of birkenheads lands here he lived almost alone and in a very quiet way there was not even a village near him and there were few persons of his own position in life because his little place was almost embedded if i may say so in lord birkenheads country which is pastoral you are with me so far  perfectly said barton  this mr johnson then lived quite alone with an old housekeeper dead since his decease and with one son called richard like himself the young man was of an adventurous character a neerdoweel in fact and about twenty years ago he left linkheaton after a violent quarrel with his father it was understood that he had run away to sea two years later he returned there was another quarrel and the old man turned him out vowing that he would never forgive him but not long after that a very rich deposit of coala very rich deposit said mr wright with the air of a man tasting most excellent claretwas discovered on this very estate of linkheaton old johnson without much exertion on his part and simply through the payment of royalties by the company that worked the coal became exceedingly opulent in what you call most affluent circumstances  here mr wright paused as if to see whether barton was beginning to understand the point of the narrative which it is needless to remark he was not there is no marked connection between coal mines however lucrative and les tatouages Étude médicolégale  in spite of his wealth mr johnson in no way changed his habits he invested his money carefully under our advice and he became as i said an extremely warm man but he continued to live in the old farmhouse and did not in any way court society to tell the truth except lord birkenhead who is our client i never knew anyone who was at all intimate with the old man lord birkenhead had a respect for him as a neighbor and a person of the oldfashioned type yes mr wright added seeing that his son was going to speak and as you were about to say tom they were brought together by a common misfortune like old mr johnson his lordship has a son who is very veryunsatisfactory his lordship has not seen the honorable mr thomas cranley for many years and in that lonely country the two boys had been companions in wild amusements long before he is very unsatisfactory the honorable thomas cranley and mr wright sighed heavily in sympathy with a client so noble and so afflicted  i know the beast said barton without reflecting  mr wright looked at him in amazement and horror the beast a son of lord birkenheads called the beast  to return to our case dr barton he went on severely with some stress laid on the doctor mr johnson died leaving by a will made on his deathbed all that he possessed to his son richard or in case of his decease to the heirs of his body lawfully begotten from that day to this we have hunted everywhere for the man we have traced him all over the world we have heard of him in australia burmah guiana smyrna but at smyrna we lose sight of him this advertisement said the old gentleman taking up the outside sheet of the times and folding it so as to bring the second column into view remained for more than seven months unanswered or only answered by impostors and idiots  he tapped his finger on the place as he handed the paper to barton who read aloud  linkheatonif richard johnson of linkheaton durham last heard of at smyrna in 1875 will apply to messrs martin and wright lincolns inn fields he will hear of something very greatly to his advantage his father died forgiving him a reward of £1000 will be paid to anyone producing richard johnson or proving his decease  as a mixture of business with the home affections said old mr wright proudly for the advertisement was of his own composition i think that leaves little ta be desired  it is admirable said bartonadmirable but may i ask  where the tattooing comes in said mr wright i am just approaching that the only person from whom we received any reliable information about richard johnson was an old shipmate of his a wandering adventurous character now i believe in paraguay where we cannot readily communicate with him according to his account johnson was an ordinary seafaring man tanned and wearing a black beard but easily to be recognized for an excellent reason he was tattooed almost all over his whole body  barton nearly leaped out of his chair the clients chair so sudden a light flashed on him  what is the matter dr barton i thought i should interest you but you seem quite excited  i really beg your pardon said barton it was automatic i think besides i am extremely interested in tattooing  then sir it is a pity you could not have seen johnson he appears from what our informant tells us to have been a most remarkable specimen he had been tattooed by australian blacks by burmese by arabs and in a peculiar blue tint and to a particular pattern by the dyacks of borneo we have here a rough chart drawn by our informant of his principal decorations  here the lawyer solemnly unrolled a great sheet of drawingpaper on which was rudely outlined the naked figure of a man filled up on the breast thighs and arms with ornamental designs  the guess which made barton leap up had not been mistaken he recognized the tattooings he had seen on the dead body of dicky shields  this confirmation of what he had conjectured however did not draw any exclamation or mark of excitement from barton who was now on his guard  this is highly interesting he said as he examined the diagram and i am sure mr wright that it should not be difficult to recognize a claimant with such remarkable peculiarities  no sir it is easy enough and we have been able to dismiss scores of sham richard johnsons but one man presented himself the day before yesterdaya rough sailor fellow who went straight to the point asked if the man we wanted had any private marks said he knew what they were and showed us his wrist which exactly as far as we could verify the design corresponded to that drawing  well asked barton controlling his excitement by a great effort what did you do with him  we said to him that it would be necessary to take the advice of an expert before we could make any movement and though he told us things about old johnson and linkheaton which it seemed almost impossible that anyone but the right man could have known we put him off till we had seen you and could make an appointment for you to examine the tattooings they must be dealt with first before any other identification  i suppose you have made some other necessary inquiries did he say why he was so late in answering the advertisement it has been out for several months  yes and that is rather in his favor said mr wright if he had been an impostor on the lookout he would probably have come to us long ago but he has just returned from the cape where he had been out of the way of newspapers and he did not see the advertisement till he came across it three or four days ago  very well said barton make an appointment with the man for any time tomorrow and i will be with you  as he said this he looked very hard and significantly at the younger mr wright  very good sir thank you shall we say at noon tomorrow  with pleasure answered barton still with his eye on the younger partner  he then said goodby and was joined as he had hoped in the outer office by young wright  you had something to say to me asked the junior member of the firm  several things said barton smiling and first would you mind finding out whether the coast is clearwhether any one is watching for me  watching for you what do you mean  just take a look round the square and tell me whether any suspicious character is about  young wright much puzzled put on his hat and stood lighting a cigarette on the outer steps  not a soul in sight but lawyers clerks he reported  very well just tell your father that as it is a fine morning you are taking a turn with me  bartons friend did as he wished and presently the pair had some serious conversation  ill do exactly as you suggest and explain to my father said the young lawyer as they separated  thanks it is so much easier for you to explain than for a stranger like myself said barton and strolled westward by way of co vent garden  at the noted establishment of messrs aminadab theatrical costumiers barton stopped went in was engaged some time with the messrs aminadab and finally had a cab called for him and drove home with a pretty bulky parcel                                      at five minutes to twelve on the following day a tall burly mahoganycolored mariner attired for the occasion in a frockcoat and hat appeared in lincolns inn fields he seemed to be but ill acquainted with those coasts and mooned about for some minutes before he reached the door of messrs wright then he rang the door was opened and he was admitted into the presence of the partners  i have come gentlemen in answer to your letter he said with a northern burr bowing awkwardly and checking a disposition to salute by touching his forelock  his eyes wandered round the room where he saw no one but the partners with whom he was already acquainted and a foreignlooking gentlemana gentleman with haycolored hair a soft hat spectacles and a towcolored beard he had a mild shortsighted expression a pasty complexion and the air of one who smoked too much  good morning mrhmmr johnson said old mr wright as we told you sir we have as a necessary preliminary to the inquiry requested professor lieblein to step in and inspecthmthe personal marks of which you spoke professor lieblein of bonn is a great authority on these mattersauthor of die tattuirung a very learned work i am told  thus introduced the professor bowed  glad to meet you sir said the sailorman gruffly or any gentleman as really knows whats what  you have been a great traveller sir said the learned professor whose teutonic accent it is superfluous to reproduce you have in many lands travelled so  yes sir i have seen the world  and you are much tattooed it is to me very interesting you have by many races been decorated  most niggers have had a turn at me sir  how happy you are to have had such experiences now the burmeseah have you any little burmese marks  yes sir from the elbow to the shoulder replied the seafaring man saving your presence ill strip to the buff  the buff what is that oh thank you sir this was in reply to young mr wright the naked body why buff buff the abstract word the actual stuff the very wesen of man unclothed buffer the concrete man in the buff in the flesh it is sehr intéressant  while the learned professor muttered these metaphysical and philological reflections the seaman was stripping himself to the waist  thats the burmese style sir he said pointing to his shoulders and upper arm  these limbs were tattooed in a beautiful soft blue the pattern was a series of diminishing squares from which long narrow triangles ran down to the elbowjoints  sehr schôn sehr schôn exclaimed the delighted professor it is very hubsch very pretty very well we cannot now decorate we germans ach it is mournful and he sighed and now sir have you to show me any moko a little moko would be very instructive  moko rather the maori pattern you mean the new zealand dodge just look between my shoulders and the seaman turned a broad bare back whereon were designs of curious involuted spirals  that is right that is right whispered the professor moko schlange serpentmarks so they call it in their tongue better moko on an european man have i never seen you observe he remarked to the elder mr wright waving his hand as he followed the tattooed linesyou observe the serpentine curves very beautiful  extremely interesting said mr wright who being no anthropologist seemed nervous and uncomfortable  corresponds too with the marks in the picture he added comparing the sketch of the original shields with the body of the claimant  are you satisfied now governor asked the sailor  one little moment have you on the red sea coast been have you been at suakim have you any arab markings  oh yes here you are and the voyager pointed to his breast  the professor inspected with unconcealed delight some small tattooings of irregular form  it is it is he cried the wasm the sharat the semitic tribal mark the mark with which the arab tribes brand their cattle of old time they did tattoo it on their bodies the learned herr professor robertson smith in his leedle book do you know what he calls that very mark my dear sir        sharat or shortthe shart was in old times a tattooed      mark in the patriarchal story of cainthe institution      of blood revenge is connected with a mark which jehovah      appoints to cain can this be anything else than the      sharat or tribal mark which every man bore on his      person      robertson smith kinship in ancient arabia p215  not i said the sailor im no scholar  he says it wasi do not say he is right cried the professor in a loud voice pointing a finger at his victims breasthe says it was the mark of cain  the sailor beneath his mahogany tan turned a livid white and grasped at a bookcase by which he stood  what do you mean he cried through his chattering teeth what do you mean with your damned hebrewdutch and your mark of cain the marks all right a hadendowa woman did it in suakim years ago aint it on that chart of yours  certainly good sir it is answered the professor why do you so agitate yourself the proof is complete he added still pointing at the sailors breast  then ill put on my togs with your leave its none so warm grumbled the man  he had so far completed his dressing that he was in his waistcoat and was just looking round for his coat  stop said the professor hold mr johnsons coat for a moment  this was to young wright who laid his hands on the garment in question  you must be tired sir said the professor in a very soft voice may i offer you a leedle cigarette  he drew from his pocket a silver cigarettecase and in a thoroughly english accent he went on  i have waited long to give you back your cigarettecase which you left at your club mr thomas cranley  the sailors eye fell on it he dashed the silver box violently to the ground and trampled on it then he made one rush at his coat  hold it hold it cried barton laying aside his teutonic accenthold it theres a revolver in the pocket  but there was no need to struggle for the coat  the sailor had suddenly staggered and fallen a crumpled but not unconscious mass on the floor  call in the police said barton theyll have no difficulty in taking him  this is the man against whom you have the warrant he went on as young wright opened the door and admitted two policemen i charge the honorable thomas cranley with murder  the officers lifted the fallen man  let him be said barton he has collapsed lay him on the floor hes better so he needs a turn of my profession his hearts weak bring some brandy  young wright went for the spirits while the frightened old lawyer kept murmuring  the honorable thomas cranley was always very unsatisfactory  it had been explained to the old gentleman that an impostor would be unmasked and a criminal arrested but he had not been informed that the culprit was the son of his great client lord birkenhead  barton picked up the cigarettecase and as he for the first time examined its interior some broken glass fell out and tinkled on the floor     chapter xvithe verdict of fate  maitland did not dally long in the levant after getting bartons letter he was soon in a position to receive in turn the congratulations which he offered to margaret and barton with unaffected delight  mrs st john deloraine and he understood each other  maitland for perhaps the first time in his life was happy in a thoroughly human oldfashioned way  meanwhile the preparations for cranleys trial dragged on interest as usual was frittered away in examinations before the magistrates  but at last the day of judgment shone into a court crowded as courts are when it is the agony of a gentleman that the public has to view  when the prisoner uttering his last and latest falsehood proclaimed himself not guilty his voice was clear and strong enough though the pallor of his face attested not only the anxiety of his situation but the illhealth which during his confinement had often made it doubtful whether he could survive to plead at the bar of any earthly judgment  the counsel for the crown opening the case stated the theory of the prosecution the case against cranley his argument is here offered in a condensed form  first counsel explained the position of johnson or shields as the unconscious heir of great wealth and set forth his early and late relations with the prisoner a dishonored and unscrupulous outcast of society the prisoner had been intimately acquainted with the circumstances of johnsons early life with his history and his home his plan therefore was to kill him and then personate him a celebrated case which would be present to the minds of the jury proved that a most plausible attempt at the personation of a longmissing man might be made by an uneducated impostor who possessed none of the minute local and personal knowledge of the prisoner now to personate johnson a sailor whose body was known to have been indelibly marked by the tattooing of various barbarous races it was necessary that the prisoner should be similarly tattooed it would be shown that with unusual heartlessness he had persuaded his victim to reproduce on his body the distinctive marks of johnson and then had destroyed him with fiendish ingenuity in the very act of assuming his personality the very instrument it might be said which stamped cranley as johnson slew johnson himself and the process which hallmarked the prisoner as the heir of vast wealth stigmatized him with the brand of cain the personal marks which seemed to establish the claimants case demonstrated his guilt he was detected by the medical expert brought in to prove his identity and was recognized by that gentleman dr barton who would be called and who had once already exposed him in a grave social offencecheating at cards the same witness had made a postmortem examination of the body of richard johnson and had then suspected the method by which he had been murdered  the murder itself according to the theory of the prosecution was committed in the following manner cranley disguised as a sailor tbe disguise in which he was finally taken had been in the habit of meeting johnson and being tattooed by him in a private room of the hit or miss tavern in chelsea on the night of february 7th he met him there for the last time he left the tavern late at nearly twelve oclock telling the landlady that his friend as he called johnson had fallen asleep upstairs on closing the establishment the landlady mrs gullick found the room an upper one with dormer windows opening on the roof empty she concluded that johnsonor shields as she called himhad wakened and left the house by the back staircase which led to a sidealley this way johnson who knew the house well often took on leaving on the following afternoon however the dead body of johnson with no obvious marks of violence on it was found in a cart belonging to the vestrya cart which during the night had remained near a shed on the piece of waste ground adjoining the hit or miss a coroners jury had taken the view that johnson being intoxicated had strayed into the piece of waste ground it would be proved that the door in the palisade surrounding it was open on that night had lain down in the cart and died in his sleep of cold and exposure but evidence derived from a later medical examination would establish the presumption which would be confirmed by the testimony of an eyewitness that death had been wilfully caused by cranley employing a poison which it would be shown he had in his possessiona poison which was not swallowed by the victim but introduced by means of a puncture into the system the dead mans body had then been removed to a place where his decease would be accounted for as the result of cold and exhaustion a witness would be put in the box who by an extraordinary circumstance had been enabled to see the crime committed by the prisoner and the body carried away though at the moment he did not understand the meaning of what he saw as the circumstances by which this witness had been enabled to behold what was done at dead of night in an attic room locked and bolted and not commanded from any neighboring house nor eminence were exceedingly peculiar testimony would be brought to show that the witness really had enjoyed the opportunity of observation which he claimed  on the whole then as the prisoner had undeniably personated johnson and claimed johnsons property as he undeniably had induced johnson unconsciously to aid him in the task of personation as the motive for the murder was plain and obvious as johnson according to the medical evidence had probably been murdered and as an eyewitness professed to have seen without comprehending the operation by which death according to the medical theory was caused the counsel for the prosecution believed that the jury could find no other verdict than that the prisoner had wilfully murdered richard johnson on the night of february 7th  this opened the case for the crown it is unnecessary to recapitulate the evidence of all the witnesses who proved step by step the statements of the prosecution first was demonstrated the identity of shields with johnson to do this cost enormous trouble and expense but johnsons old crony the man who drew the chart of his tattoo marks was at length discovered in paraguay and by his aid and the testimony he collected the point was satisfactorily made out it was of course most important in another respect as establishing margarets claims on the linkheaton estate  the discovery of the body of johnson or shields in the snow was proved by our old friends bill and tommy  the prisoner was recognized by mrs gullick as the sailor gentleman who had been with johnson on the last night of his life in spite of the difference of dress and of appearance caused by the absence of beardfor cranley was now clean shavedmrs gullick was positive as to his voice and as to his eyebrows which were peculiarly black and mobile  barton who was called next and whose evidence excited the keenest interest identified the prisoner as the man whom he had caused to be arrested in the office of messrs martin and wright and whom he had known as cranley his medical evidence was given at considerable length and need not be produced in full detail on examining the body of richard johnson his attention had naturally been directed chiefly to the tattooings he had for some years been deeply interested as an ethnologist in the tattooed marks of various races he had found many curious examples on the body of the dead man most of the marks were obviously old but in a very unusual place generally left blanknamely behind and under the right shoulderhe had discovered certain markings of an irregular character clearly produced by an inexperienced hand and perfectly fresh and recent they had not healed and were slightly discolored they could not from their position possibly have been produced by the man himself microscopic examinations of these marks in which the coloring matter was brown not red or blue as on the rest of the body showed that this coloring matter was of a character familiar to the witness as a physiologist and scientific traveller it was the woorali or arrow poison of the macoushi indians of guiana  asked to explain the nature of this poison to the court the witness said that its principle to use the term of the old medical writers had not yet been disengaged by science nor had it ever been compounded by europeans he had seen it made by the macoushi indians who combined the juice of the woorali vine with that of certain bulbous plants with certain insects and with the poisonfangs of two serpents boiling the whole amidst magical ceremonies and finally straining off a thick brown paste which when perfectly dry was used to venom the points of their arrows the poison might be swallowed by a healthy man without fatal results but if introduced into the system through a wound the poison would act almost instantaneously and defy analysis its effect was to sever as it were the connection between the nerves and the muscles and the muscles used in respiration being thus gradually paralyzed death followed within a brief time proportionate to the size of the victim man or animal and the strength of the dose  traces of this poison then the witness had found in the fresh tattoo marks on johnsons body  the witness now produced the sharp wooden needle the stem of the leaf of the coucourite palm which he had found among johnsons tattooing materials in the upper chamber of the hit or miss this needle had been he said the tip of one of the arrows used for their blowpipes by the macoushi of guiana  barton also produced the oriental silver cigarettecase the instrument of his cheating at baccarat which cranley had left in the club on the evening of his detection he showed that the case had contained a small crystal receptacle intended to hold opium this crystal had been broken by cranley when he dashed down the case in the office of martin and wright but crumbs of the poisonwoorali or ouraliperfectly dry remained in this réceptacle it was thus clear that cranley himself a great traveller was possessed of the rare and perilous drug  the medical evidence having been heard and confirmed in its general bearing by various experts and barton having stood the test of a severe crossexamination william winter was called  there was a flutter in the court as a pale and partly paralyzed man was borne in on a kind of litter and accommodated in the witnessbox  where were you asked the counsel for the prosecution when the officer had sworn the witness at eleven oclock on the night of february 7th  i was on the roof of the hit or miss tavern  on which part of the roof  on the ledge below the dormer window at the back part of the house facing the waste ground behind the plank fence  will you tell the court what you saw while you were in that position  winters face was flushed with excitement but his voice though thin was clear as he said  there was a light streaming through the dormer window beside which i was lying and i looked in  what did you see  i saw a small room with a large fire a table on which were bottles and glasses and two men one seated the other standing  would you recognize either man if you saw him  i recognize the man who was seated in the prisoner at the bar but at that time he wore a beard  tell the court what happened  the men were facing me one of themthe prisonerwas naked to the waist his breast was tattooed the otherthe man who stood upwas touching him with a needle which he applied again and again to a saucer on the table  could you hear what they said  i could for the catch of the lattice window had not caught and there was a slight chink open  you listened  i could not help it the scene was so strange i heard the man with the needle give a sigh of relief and say there its finished and a pretty job too though i say it the other said you have done it beautifully dicky its a most interesting art now just out of curiosity let me tattoo you a bit the other man laughed and took off his coat and shirt while the other dressed theres scarce an inch of me plain he said but you can try your hand here pointing to the lower part of his shoulder  what happened then  they were both standing up now i saw the prisoner take out something sharp his face was deadly pale but the other could not see that he began touching him with the sharp object and kept chaffing all the time this lasted i should think about five minutes when the face of the man who was being tattooed grew very red then he swayed a little backward and forward then he stretched out his hands like a blind man and said in a strange thick voice as if he was paralyzed im very cold i cant shiver then he fell down heavily and his body made one or two convulsive movements that was all  what did the prisoner do  he looked like death he seized the bottle on the table poured out half a tumbler full of the stuff in it drank it off and then fell into a chair and laid his face between his hands he appeared ill or alarmed but the color came back into his cheek after a third or fourth glass then i saw him go to the sleeping man and bend over him listening apparently to his breathing then he shook him several times as if trying to arouse him but the man lay like a log finally about halfanhour after what i have described he opened the door and went out he soon returned took up the sleeping man in his armshis weight seemed lighter than you would expectand carried him out from the roof i saw him push the door in the palisade leading into the waste land a door which i myself had left open an hour before it was not light enough to see what he did there but he soon returned alone and walked away  such was the sum of winters evidence which if accepted entirely corroborated bartons theory of the manner of the murder  in crossexamination winter was asked the very natural question  how did you come to find yourself on the roof of the hit or miss late at night  winter nearly rose from his litter his worn faced flushed his eye sparkling  sir i flew  there was a murmur and titter through the court which was of course instantly suppressed  you flew what do you mean by saying that you flew  i am the inventor of a flying machine which for thirty years i have labored at and striven to bring to perfection on that one night as i was experimenting with it where i usually did inside the waste land bordering on the hit or miss the machine actually worked and i was projected in the machine as it were to some height in the air coming down with à fluttering motion like a falling feather on the roof of the hit or miss  here the learned counsel for the defence smiled with infinite expression at the jury  my lord said the counsel for the prosecution noting the smile and the significant grin with which it was reflected on the countenances of the twelve good men and true i may state that we are prepared to bring forward a large mass of scientific evidenceincluding a wellknown man of science the editor of wisdom a popular journal which takes all knowledge for its provinceto prove that there is nothing physically impossible in the facts deposed to by this witness he is at present suffering as you see from a serious accident caused by the very machine of which he speaks and which can be exhibited with a working model to the court  it certainly requires corroboration said the judge at present so far as i am aware it is contrary to scientific experience you can prove perhaps that in the opinion of experts these machines have only to take one step further to become practical modes of locomotion but that is the very step qui coûte nothing but direct evidence that the step has been takenthat a flying machine on this occasion actually flew they appear to be styled volantes a non volandowould really help your case and establish the credibility of this witness  with your lordships learned remarks replied the counsel for the crown i am not the less ready to agree because i have an actual eyewitness who not only saw the flight deposed to by the witness but reported it to several persons who are in court on the night of its occurrence so that her statement though disbelieved was the common talk of the neighborhood  ah that is another matter said the judge  call eliza gullick said the counsel  eliza was called and in a moment was curtsying with eagerness but perfect selfpossession  after displaying an almost technical appreciation of the nature of an oath eliza was asked  you remember the night of the 7th of february  i remember it very well sir  why do you remember it so well eliza  becos such a mort o things happened sir that night  will you tell his lordship what happened  certainly my lord mr toopny gave us a supper us himps my lord at the hilarity for he said  never mind what he said tell us what happened as you were coming home  well sir it was about eleven oclock at night and i was turning the lane into the hit or miss when i heard an awful flapping and hissing and whirring like wings working by steam in the waste ground at the side of the lane and as i was listeningoh it frightens me now to think of itoh sir  well dont be alarmed my good child what occurred  a great thing like a bird sir bigger than a man flew up over my head higher than the houses and thendid you ever see them japanese toys my lord them things with two feathers and a bit of indiarubber as you twist round and round and toss them up and they fly  well my girl i have seen them  well just as if it had been one of them things settling down the birds wings turned round and fluttered and shook and at last it all lighted quite soft like on the roof of our house the hit or miss and there i saw it crouching when i went to bed and looked out o the window but they wouldnt none o them believe me my lord  there was a dead silence in the court as eliza finished this extraordinary confirmation of winters evidence and wove the net inextricably round the prisoner  then the silence was broken by a soft crashing sound as if something heavy had dropped a short distance on some hard object  all present turned their eyes from staring at eliza to the place whence the sound had come  the prisoners head had fallen forward on the railing in front of him  one of the officers of the court touched him on the shoulder  he did not stir they lifted him he moved not  the faint heart of the man had fluttered with its last pulsation the evidence had sufficed for him without verdict or sentence as he had slain his victim so fate slew him painlessly in a moment     epilogue  and what became of them all  he who does not tell on the plea that he is competing with life which never knits up a plot but leaves all the threads loose acts unfairly  mrs st john deloraine is now mrs maitland and the happy couple are visiting the great colonies seeking a site for a new settlement of the unemployed who should lead happy lives under the peaceful sway of happy mrs maitland  barton and mrs barton have practised the endowment of research in the case of winter who has quite recovered from his injuries and still hopes to fly but he has never trusted himself again on his machine which moreover has never flown again winter like the alchemist who once made a diamond by chance in balzacs novel has never recovered the creative moment but he makes very interesting models in which mrs bartons little boy begins to take a lively interest  eliza gullick declining all offers of advancement unconnected with the british drama clings to the profession for which as mrs gullick maintains she has a hereditary genius  we hear says the athenæum that the long promised edition of demetrius of scepsis by mr bielby of st gatiens is in the hands of the delegates of the clarendon press  but fiction herself is revolted by the improbability of the statement that an oxford don has finished his magnum opus  explicit
