peacock  you touched me  samson and delilah  the primrose path  the horse dealers daughter  fanny and annie     england my england   he was working on the edge of the common beyond the small brook that ran in the dip at the bottom of the garden carrying the garden path in continuation from the plank bridge on to the common he had cut the rough turf and bracken leaving the grey dryish soil bare but he was worried because he could not get the path straight there was a pleat between his brows he had set up his sticks and taken the sights between the big pine trees but for some reason everything seemed wrong he looked again straining his keen blue eyes that had a touch of the viking in them through the shadowy pine trees as through a doorway at the greengrassed gardenpath rising from the shadow of alders by the log bridge up to the sunlit flowers tall white and purple columbines and the buttend of the old hampshire cottage that crouched near the earth amid flowers blossoming in the bit of shaggy wildness round about  there was a sound of childrens voices calling and talking high childish girlish voices slightly didactic and tinged with domineering if you dont come quick nurse i shall run out there to where there are snakes and nobody had the sangfroid to reply run then little fool it was always no darling very well darling in a moment darling darling you must be patient  his heart was hard with disillusion a continual gnawing and resistance but he worked on what was there to do but submit  the sunlight blazed down upon the earth there was a vividness of flamy vegetation of fierce seclusion amid the savage peace of the commons strange how the savage england lingers in patches as here amid these shaggy gorse commons and marshy snake infested places near the foot of the south downs the spirit of place lingering on primeval as when the saxons came so long ago  ah how he had loved it the green garden path the tufts of flowers purple and white columbines and great oriental red poppies with their black chaps and mulleins tall and yellow this flamy garden which had been a garden for a thousand years scooped out in the little hollow among the snakeinfested commons he had made it flame with flowers in a sun cup under its hedges and trees so old so old a place and yet he had recreated it  the timbered cottage with its sloping cloaklike roof was old and forgotten it belonged to the old england of hamlets and yeomen lost all alone on the edge of the common at the end of a wide grassy briarentangled lane shaded with oak it had never known the world of today not till egbert came with his bride and he had come to fill it with flowers  the house was ancient and very uncomfortable but he did not want to alter it ah marvellous to sit there in the wide black timeold chimney at night when the wind roared overhead and the wood which he had chopped himself sputtered on the hearth himself on one side the angle and winifred on the other  ah how he had wanted her winifred she was young and beautiful and strong with life like a flame in sunshine she moved with a slow grace of energy like a blossoming redflowered bush in motion she too seemed to come out of the old england ruddy strong with a certain crude passionate quiescence and a hawthorn robustness and he he was tall and slim and agile like an english archer with his long supple legs and fine movements her hair was nutbrown and all in energic curls and tendrils her eyes were nutbrown too like a robins for brightness and he was whiteskinned with fine silky hair that had darkened from fair and a slightly arched nose of an old country family they were a beautiful couple  the house was winifreds her father was a man of energy too he had come from the north poor now he was moderately rich he had bought this fair stretch of inexpensive land down in hampshire not far from the tiny church of the almost extinct hamlet stood his own house a commodious old farmhouse standing back from the road across a bare grassed yard on one side of this quadrangle was the long long barn or shed which he had made into a cottage for his youngest daughter priscilla one saw little blueandwhite check curtains at the long windows and inside overhead the grand old timbers of the highpitched shed this was prissys house fifty yards away was the pretty little new cottage which he had built for his daughter magdalen with the vegetable garden stretching away to the oak copse and then away beyond the lawns and rose trees of the housegarden went the track across a shaggy wild grass space towards the ridge of tall black pines that grew on a dykebank through the pines and above the sloping little bog under the wide desolate oak trees till there was winifreds cottage crouching unexpectedly in front so much alone and so primitive  it was winifreds own house and the gardens and the bit of common and the boggy slope were hers her tiny domain she had married just at the time when her father had bought the estate about ten years before the war so she had been able to come to egbert with this for a marriage portion and who was more delighted he or she it would be hard to say she was only twenty at the time and he was only twentyone he had about a hundred and fifty pounds a year of his ownand nothing else but his very considerable personal attractions he had no profession he earned nothing but he talked of literature and music he had a passion for old folkmusic collecting folksongs and folkdances studying the morrisdance and the old customs of course in time he would make money in these ways  meanwhile youth and health and passion and promise winifreds father was always generous but still he was a man from the north with a hard head and a hard skin too having received a good many knocks at home he kept the hard head out of sight and played at poetry and romance with his literary wife and his sturdy passionate girls he was a man of courage not given to complaining bearing his burdens by himself no he did not let the world intrude far into his home he had a delicate sensitive wife whose poetry won some fame in the narrow world of letters he himself with his tough old barbarian fighting spirit had an almost childlike delight in verse in sweet poetry and in the delightful game of a cultured home his blood was strong even to coarseness but that only made the home more vigorous more robust and christmassy there was always a touch of christmas about him now he was well off if there was poetry after dinner there were also chocolates and nuts and good little outoftheway things to be munching  well then into this family came egbert he was made of quite a different paste the girls and the father were stronglimbed thickblooded people true english as hollytrees and hawthorn are english their culture was grafted on to them as one might perhaps graft a common pink rose on to a thornstem it flowered oddly enough but it did not alter their blood  and egbert was a born rose the agelong breeding had left him with a delightful spontaneous passion he was not clever nor even literary no but the intonation of his voice and the movement of his supple handsome body and the fine texture of his flesh and his hair the slight arch of his nose the quickness of his blue eyes would easily take the place of poetry winifred loved him loved him this southerner as a higher being a higher being mind you not a deeper and as for him he loved her in passion with every fibre of him she was the very warm stuff of life to him  wonderful then those days at crockham cottage the first days all alone save for the woman who came to work in the mornings marvellous days when she had all his tall supple finefleshed youth to herself for herself and he had her like a ruddy fire into which he could cast himself for rejuvenation ah that it might never end this passion this marriage the flame of their two bodies burnt again into that old cottage that was haunted already by so much bygone physical desire you could not be in the dark room for an hour without the influences coming over you the hot blooddesire of bygone yeomen there in this old den where they had lusted and bred for so many generations the silent house dark with thick timbered walls and the big black chimneyplace and the sense of secrecy dark with low little windows sunk into the earth dark like a lair where strong beasts had lurked and mated lonely at night and lonely by day left to themselves and their own intensity for so many generations it seemed to cast a spell on the two young people they became different there was a curious secret glow about them a certain slumbering flame hard to understand that enveloped them both they too felt that they did not belong to the london world any more crockham had changed their blood the sense of the snakes that lived and slept even in their own garden in the sun so that he going forward with the spade would see a curious coiled brownish pile on the black soil which suddenly would start up hiss and dazzle rapidly away hissing one day winifred heard the strangest scream from the flowerbed under the low window of the living room ah the strangest scream like the very soul of the dark past crying aloud she ran out and saw a long brown snake on the flowerbed and in its flat mouth the one hind leg of a frog was striving to escape and screaming its strange tiny bellowing scream she looked at the snake and from its sullen flat head it looked at her obstinately she gave a cry and it released the frog and slid angrily away  that was crockham the spear of modern invention had not passed through it and it lay there secret primitive savage as when the saxons first came and egbert and she were caught there caught out of the world  he was not idle nor was she there were plenty of things to be done the house to be put into final repair after the workmen had gone cushions and curtains to sew the paths to make the water to fetch and attend to and then the slope of the deepsoiled neglected garden to level to terrace with little terraces and paths and to fill with flowers he worked away in his shirtsleeves worked all day intermittently doing this thing and the other and she quiet and rich in herself seeing him stooping and labouring away by himself would come to help him to be near him he of course was an amateura born amateur he worked so hard and did so little and nothing he ever did would hold together for long if he terraced the garden he held up the earth with a couple of long narrow planks that soon began to bend with the pressure from behind and would not need many years to rot through and break and let the soil slither all down again in a heap towards the streambed but there you are he had not been brought up to come to grips with anything and he thought it would do nay he did not think there was anything else except little temporary contrivances possible he who had such a passion for his old enduring cottage and for the old enduring things of the bygone england curious that the sense of permanency in the past had such a hold over him whilst in the present he was all amateurish and sketchy  winifred could not criticize him townbred everything seemed to her splendid and the very digging and shovelling itself seemed romantic but neither egbert nor she yet realized the difference between work and romance  godfrey marshall her father was at first perfectly pleased with the ménage down at crockham cottage he thought egbert was wonderful the many things he accomplished and he was gratified by the glow of physical passion between the two young people to the man who in london still worked hard to keep steady his modest fortune the thought of this young couple digging away and loving one another down at crockham cottage buried deep among the commons and marshes near the paleshowing bulk of the downs was like a chapter of living romance and they drew the sustenance for their fire of passion from him from the old man it was he who fed their flame he triumphed secretly in the thought and it was to her father that winifred still turned as the one source of all surety and life and support she loved egbert with passion but behind her was the power of her father it was the power of her father she referred to whenever she needed to refer it never occurred to her to refer to egbert if she were in difficulty or doubt no in all the serious matters she depended on her father  for egbert had no intention of coming to grips with life he had no ambition whatsoever he came from a decent family from a pleasant country home from delightful surroundings he should of course have had a profession he should have studied law or entered business in some way but nothat fatal three pounds a week would keep him from starving as long as he lived and he did not want to give himself into bondage it was not that he was idle he was always doing something in his amateurish way but he had no desire to give himself to the world and still less had he any desire to fight his way in the world no no the world wasnt worth it he wanted to ignore it to go his own way apart like a casual pilgrim down the forsaken sidetracks he loved his wife his cottage and garden he would make his life there as a sort of epicurean hermit he loved the past the old music and dances and customs of old england he would try and live in the spirit of these not in the spirit of the world of business  but often winifreds father called her to london for he loved to have his children round him so egbert and she must have a tiny flat in town and the young couple must transfer themselves from time to time from the country to the city in town egbert had plenty of friends of the same ineffectual sort as himself tampering with the arts literature painting sculpture music he was not bored  three pounds a week however would not pay for all this winifreds father paid he liked paying he made her only a very small allowance but he often gave her ten poundsor gave egbert ten pounds so they both looked on the old man as the mainstay egbert didnt mind being patronized and paid for only when he felt the family was a little too condescending on account of money he began to get huffy  then of course children came a lovely little blonde daughter with a head of thistledown everybody adored the child it was the first exquisite blonde thing that had come into the family a little mite with the white slim beautiful limbs of its father and as it grew up the dancing dainty movement of a wild little daisyspirit no wonder the marshalls all loved the child they called her joyce they themselves had their own grace but it was slow rather heavy they had everyone of them strong heavy limbs and darkish skins and they were short in stature and now they had for one of their own this light little cowslip child she was like a little poem in herself  but nevertheless she brought a new difficulty winifred must have a nurse for her yes yes there must be a nurse it was the family decree who was to pay for the nurse the grandfatherseeing the father himself earned no money yes the grandfather would pay as he had paid all the lyingin expenses there came a slight sense of moneystrain egbert was living on his fatherinlaw  after the child was born it was never quite the same between him and winifred the difference was at first hardly perceptible but it was there in the first place winifred had a new centre of interest she was not going to adore her child but she had what the modern mother so often has in the place of spontaneous love a profound sense of duty towards her child winifred appreciated her darling little girl and felt a deep sense of duty towards her strange that this sense of duty should go deeper than the love for her husband but so it was and so it often is the responsibility of motherhood was the prime responsibility in winifreds heart the responsibility of wifehood came a long way second  her child seemed to link her up again in a circuit with her own family her father and mother herself and her child that was the human trinity for her her husband yes she loved him still but that was like play she had an almost barbaric sense of duty and of family till she married her first human duty had been towards her father he was the pillar the source of life the everlasting support now another link was added to the chain of duty her father herself and her child  egbert was out of it without anything happening he was gradually unconsciously excluded from the circle his wife still loved him physically but buthe was almost the unnecessary party in the affair he could not complain of winifred she still did her duty towards him she still had a physical passion for him that physical passion on which he had put all his life and soul butbut  it was for a long while an everrecurring but and then after the second child another blonde winsome touching little thing not so proud and flamelike as joyceafter annabel came then egbert began truly to realize how it was his wife still loved him butand now the but had grown enormousher physical love for him was of secondary importance to her it became ever less important after all she had had it this physical passion for two years now it was not this that one lived from no nosomething sterner realer  she began to resent her own passion for egbertjust a little she began to despise it for after all there he was he was charming he was lovable he was terribly desirable butbutoh the awful looming cloud of that buthe did not stand firm in the landscape of her life like a tower of strength like a great pillar of significance no he was like a cat one has about the house which will one day disappear and leave no trace he was like a flower in the garden trembling in the wind of life and then gone leaving nothing to show as an adjunct as an accessory he was perfect many a woman would have adored to have him about her all her life the most beautiful and desirable of all her possessions but winifred belonged to another school  the years went by and instead of coming more to grips with life he relaxed more he was of a subtle sensitive passionate nature but he simply would not give himself to what winifred called life work no he would not go into the world and work for money no he just would not if winifred liked to live beyond their small incomewell it was her lookout  and winifred did not really want him to go out into the world to work for money money became alas a word like a firebrand between them setting them both aflame with anger but that is because we must talk in symbols winifred did not really care about money she did not care whether he earned or did not earn anything only she knew she was dependent on her father for threefourths of the money spent for herself and her children that she let that be the casus belli the drawn weapon between herself and egbert  what did she wantwhat did she want her mother once said to her with that characteristic touch of irony well dear if it is your fate to consider the lilies that toil not neither do they spin that is one destiny among many others and perhaps not so unpleasant as most why do you take it amiss my child  the mother was subtler than her children they very rarely knew how to answer her so winifred was only more confused it was not a question of lilies at least if it were a question of lilies then her children were the little blossoms they at least grew doesnt jesus say consider the lilies how they grow good then she had her growing babies but as for that other tall handsome flower of a father of theirs he was full grown already so she did not want to spend her life considering him in the flower of his days  no it was not that he didnt earn money it was not that he was idle he was not idle he was always doing something always working away down at crockham doing little jobs but oh dear the little jobsthe garden pathsthe gorgeous flowersthe chairs to mend old chairs to mend  it was that he stood for nothing if he had done something unsuccessfully and lost what money they had if he had but striven with something nay even if he had been wicked a waster she would have been more free she would have had something to resist at least a waster stands for something really he says no i will not aid and abet society in this business of increase and hanging together i will upset the applecart as much as i can in my small way or else he says no i will not bother about others if i have lusts they are my own and i prefer them to other peoples virtues so a waster a scamp takes a sort of stand he exposes himself to opposition and final castigation at any rate in storybooks  but egbert what are you to do with a man like egbert he had no vices he was really kind nay generous and he was not weak if he had been weak winifred could have been kind to him but he did not even give her that consolation he was not weak and he did not want her consolation or her kindness no thank you he was of a fine passionate temper and of a rarer steel than she he knew it and she knew it hence she was only the more baffled and maddened poor thing he the higher the finer in his way the stronger played with his garden and his old folksongs and morrisdances just played and let her support the pillars of the future on her own heart  and he began to get bitter and a wicked look began to come on his face he did not give in to her not he there were seven devils inside his long slim white body he was healthy full of restrained life yes even he himself had to lock up his own vivid life inside himself now she would not take it from him or rather now that she only took it occasionally for she had to yield at times she loved him so she desired him so he was so exquisite to her the fine creature that he was finer than herself yes with a groan she had to give in to her own unquenched passion for him and he came to her thenah terrible ah wonderful sometimes she wondered how either of them could live after the terror of the passion that swept between them it was to her as if pure lightning flash after flash went through every fibre of her till extinction came  but it is the fate of human beings to live on and it is the fate of clouds that seem nothing but bits of vapour slowly to pile up to pile up and fill the heavens and blacken the sun entirely  so it was the love came back the lightning of passion flashed tremendously between them and there was blue sky and gorgeousness for a little while and then as inevitably as inevitably slowly the clouds began to edge up again above the horizon slowly slowly to lurk about the heavens throwing an occasional cold and hateful shadow slowly slowly to congregate to fill the empyrean space  and as the years passed the lightning cleared the sky more and more rarely less and less the blue showed gradually the grey lid sank down upon them as if it would be permanent  why didnt egbert do something then why didnt he come to grips with life why wasnt he like winifreds father a pillar of society even if a slender exquisite column why didnt he go into harness of some sort why didnt he take some direction  well you can bring an ass to the water but you cannot make him drink the world was the water and egbert was the ass and he wasnt having any he couldnt he just couldnt since necessity did not force him to work for his bread and butter he would not work for works sake you cant make the columbine flowers nod in january nor make the cuckoo sing in england at christmas why it isnt his season he doesnt want to nay he cant want to  and there it was with egbert he couldnt link up with the worlds work because the basic desire was absent from him nay at the bottom of him he had an even stronger desire to hold aloof to hold aloof to do nobody any damage but to hold aloof it was not his season  perhaps he should not have married and had children but you cant stop the waters flowing  which held true for winifred too she was not made to endure aloof her family tree was a robust vegetation that had to be stirring and believing in one direction or another her life had to go in her own home she had known nothing of this diffidence which she found in egbert and which she could not understand and which threw her into such dismay what was she to do what was she to do in face of this terrible diffidence  it was all so different in her own home her father may have had his own misgivings but he kept them to himself perhaps he had no very profound belief in this world of ours this society which we have elaborated with so much effort only to find ourselves elaborated to death at last but godfrey marshall was of tough rough fibre not without a vein of healthy cunning through it all it was for him a question of winning through and leaving the rest to heaven without having many illusions to grace him he still did believe in heaven in a dark and unquestioning way he had a sort of faith an acrid faith like the sap of some nottobeexterminated tree just a blind acrid faith as sap is blind and acrid and yet pushes on in growth and in faith perhaps he was unscrupulous but only as a striving tree is unscrupulous pushing its single way in a jungle of others  in the end it is only this robust saplike faith which keeps man going he may live on for many generations inside the shelter of the social establishment which he has erected for himself as peartrees and currant bushes would go on bearing fruit for many seasons inside a walled garden even if the race of man were suddenly exterminated but bit by bit the wallfruittrees would gradually pull down the very walls that sustained them bit by bit every establishment collapses unless it is renewed or restored by living hands all the while  egbert could not bring himself to any more of this restoring or renewing business he was not aware of the fact but awareness doesnt help much anyhow he just couldnt he had the stoic and epicurean quality of his old fine breeding his fatherinlaw however though he was not one bit more of a fool than egbert realized that since we are here we may as well live and so he applied himself to his own tiny section of the social work and to doing the best for his family and to leaving the rest to the ultimate will of heaven a certain robustness of blood made him able to go on but sometimes even from him spurted a sudden gall of bitterness against the world and its makeup and yethe had his own willtosucceed and this carried him through he refused to ask himself what the success would amount to it amounted to the estate down in hampshire and his children lacking for nothing and himself of some importance in the world and bastabasta basta  nevertheless do not let us imagine that he was a common pusher he was not he knew as well as egbert what disillusion meant perhaps in his soul he had the same estimation of success but he had a certain acrid courage and a certain willtopower in his own small circle he would emanate power the single power of his own blind self with all his spoiling of his children he was still the father of the old english type he was too wise to make laws and to domineer in the abstract but he had kept and all honour to him a certain primitive dominion over the souls of his children the old almost magic prestige of paternity there it was still burning in him the old smoky torch or paternal godhead  and in the sacred glare of this torch his children had been brought up he had given the girls every liberty at last but he had never really let them go beyond his power and they venturing out into the hard white light of our fatherless world learned to see with the eyes of the world they learned to criticize their father even from some effulgence of worldly white light to see him as inferior but this was all very well in the head the moment they forgot their tricks of criticism the old red glow of his authority came over them again he was not to be quenched  let the psychoanalyst talk about father complex it is just a word invented here was a man who had kept alive the old red flame of fatherhood fatherhood that had even the right to sacrifice the child to god like isaac fatherhood that had lifeanddeath authority over the children a great natural power and till his children could be brought under some other great authority as girls or could arrive at manhood and become themselves centres of the same power continuing the same male mystery as men until such time willynilly godfrey marshall would keep his children  it had seemed as if he might lose winifred winifred had adored her husband and looked up to him as to something wonderful perhaps she had expected in him another great authority a male authority greater finer than her fathers for having once known the glow of male power she would not easily turn to the cold white light of feminine independence she would hunger hunger all her life for the warmth and shelter of true male strength  and hunger she might for egberts power lay in the abnegation of power he was himself the living negative of power even of responsibility for the negation of power at last means the negation of responsibility as far as these things went he would confine himself to himself he would try to confine his own influence even to himself he would try as far as possible to abstain from influencing his children by assuming any responsibility for them a little child shall lead them his child should lead then he would try not to make it go in any direction whatever he would abstain from influencing it liberty  poor winifred was like a fish out of water in this liberty gasping for the denser element which should contain her till her child came and then she knew that she must be responsible for it that she must have authority over it  but here egbert silently and negatively stepped in silently negatively but fatally he neutralized her authority over her children  there was a third little girl born and after this winifred wanted no more children her soul was turning to salt  so she had charge of the children they were her responsibility the money for them had come from her father she would do her very best for them and have command over their life and death but no egbert would not take the responsibility he would not even provide the money but he would not let her have her way her dark silent passionate authority he would not allow it was a battle between them the battle between liberty and the old bloodpower and of course he won the little girls loved him and adored him daddy daddy they could do as they liked with him their mother would have ruled them she would have ruled them passionately with indulgence with the old dark magic of parental authority something looming and unquestioned and after all divine if we believe in divine authority the marshalls did being catholic  and egbert he turned her old dark catholic bloodauthority into a sort of tyranny he would not leave her her children he stole them from her and yet without assuming responsibility for them he stole them from her in emotion and spirit and left her only to command their behaviour a thankless lot for a mother and her children adored him adored him little knowing the empty bitterness they were preparing for themselves when they too grew up to have husbands husbands such as egbert adorable and null  joyce the eldest was still his favourite she was now a quicksilver little thing of six years old barbara the youngest was a toddler of two years they spent most of their time down at crockham because he wanted to be there and even winifred loved the place really but now in her frustrated and blinded state it was full of menace for her children the adders the poisonberries the brook the marsh the water that might not be pureone thing and another from mother and nurse it was a guerilla gunfire of commands and blithe quicksilver disobedience from the three blonde neverstill little girls behind the girls was the father against mother and nurse and so it was  if you dont come quick nurse i shall run out there to where there are snakes  joyce you must be patient im just changing annabel  there you are there it was always the same working away on the common across the brook he heard it and he worked on just the same  suddenly he heard a shriek and he flung the spade from him and started for the bridge looking up like a startled deer ah there was winifredjoyce had hurt herself he went on up the garden  what is it  the child was still screamingnow it wasdaddy daddy ohoh daddy and the mother was saying  dont be frightened darling let mother look  but the child only cried  oh daddy daddy daddy  she was terrified by the sight of the blood running from her own knee winifred crouched down with her child of six in her lap to examine the knee egbert bent over also  dont make such a noise joyce he said irritably how did she do it  she fell on that sickle thing which you left lying about after cutting the grass said winifred looking into his face with bitter accusation as he bent near  he had taken his handkerchief and tied it round the knee then he lifted the still sobbing child in his arms and carried her into the house and upstairs to her bed in his arms she became quiet but his heart was burning with pain and with guilt he had left the sickle there lying on the edge of the grass and so his firstborn child whom he loved so dearly had come to hurt but then it was an accidentit was an accident why should he feel guilty it would probably be nothing better in two or three days why take it to heart why worry he put it aside  the child lay on the bed in her little summer frock her face very white now after the shock nurse had come carrying the youngest child and little annabel stood holding her skirt winifred terribly serious and woodenseeming was bending over the knee from which she had taken his bloodsoaked handkerchief egbert bent forward too keeping more sangfroid in his face than in his heart winifred went all of a lump of seriousness so he had to keep some reserve the child moaned and whimpered  the knee was still bleeding profuselyit was a deep cut right in the joint  youd better go for the doctor egbert said winifred bitterly  oh no oh no cried joyce in a panic  joyce my darling dont cry said winifred suddenly catching the little girl to her breast in a strange tragic anguish the mater dolorata even the child was frightened into silence egbert looked at the tragic figure of his wife with the child at her breast and turned away only annabel started suddenly to cry joycey joycey dont have your leg bleeding  egbert rode four miles to the village for the doctor he could not help feeling that winifred was laying it on rather surely the knee itself wasnt hurt surely not it was only a surface cut  the doctor was out egbert left the message and came cycling swiftly home his heart pinched with anxiety he dropped sweating off his bicycle and went into the house looking rather small like a man who is at fault winifred was upstairs sitting by joyce who was looking pale and important in bed and was eating some tapioca pudding the pale small scared face of his child went to egberts heart  doctor wing was out hell be here about half past two said egbert  i dont want him to come whimpered joyce  joyce dear you must be patient and quiet said winifred he wont hurt you but he will tell us what to do to make your knee better quickly that is why he must come  winifred always explained carefully to her little girls and it always took the words off their lips for the moment  does it bleed yet said egbert  winifred moved the bedclothes carefully aside  i think not she said  egbert stooped also to look  no it doesnt she said then he stood up with a relieved look on his face he turned to the child  eat your pudding joyce he said it wont be anything youve only got to keep still for a few days  you havent had your dinner have you daddy  not yet  nurse will give it to you said winifred  youll be all right joyce he said smiling to the child and pushing the blonde hair off her brow she smiled back winsomely into his face  he went downstairs and ate his meal alone nurse served him she liked waiting on him all women liked him and liked to do things for him  the doctor camea fat country practitioner pleasant and kind  what little girl been tumbling down have you theres a thing to be doing for a smart little lady like you what and cutting your knee tuttuttut that wasnt clever of you now was it never mind never mind soon be better let us look at it wont hurt you not the least in life bring a bowl with a little warm water nurse soon have it all right again soon have it all right  joyce smiled at him with a pale smile of faint superiority this was not the way in which she was used to being talked to  he bent down carefully looking at the little thin wounded knee of the child egbert bent over him  oh dear oh dear quite a deep little cut nasty little cut nasty little cut but never mind never mind little lady well soon have it better soon have it better little lady whats your name  my name is joyce said the child distinctly  oh really he replied oh really well thats a fine

me to said joyce  ah there now thats the style thats what i like to hear from a little lady in bed because shes cut her knee thats the style  the comfortable and prolix doctor dressed and bandaged the knee and recommended bed and a light diet for the little lady he thought a week or a fortnight would put it right no bones or ligatures damagedfortunately only a flesh cut he would come again in a day or two  so joyce was reassured and stayed in bed and had all her toys up her father often played with her the doctor came the third day he was fairly pleased with the knee it was healing it was healingyesyes let the child continue in bed he came again after a day or two winifred was a trifle uneasy the wound seemed to be healing on the top but it hurt the child too much it didnt look quite right she said so to egbert  egbert im sure joyces knee isnt healing properly  i think it is he said i think its all right  id rather doctor wing came againi dont feel satisfied  arent you trying to imagine it worse than it really is  you would say so of course but i shall write a postcard to doctor wing now  the doctor came next day he examined the knee yes there was inflammation yes there might be a little septic poisoningthere might there might was the child feverish  so a fortnight passed by and the child was feverish and the knee was more inflamed and grew worse and was painful painful she cried in the night and her mother had to sit up with her egbert still insisted it was nothing reallyit would pass but in his heart he was anxious  winifred wrote again to her father on saturday the elderly man appeared and no sooner did winifred see the thick rather short figure in its grey suit than a great yearning came over her  father im not satisfied with joyce im not satisfied with doctor wing  well winnie dear if youre not satisfied we must have further advice that is all  the sturdy powerful elderly man went upstairs his voice sounding rather grating through the house as if it cut upon the tense atmosphere  how are you joyce darling he said to the child does your knee hurt you does it hurt you dear  it does sometimes the child was shy of him cold towards him  well dear im sorry for that i hope you try to bear it and not trouble mother too much  there was no answer he looked at the knee it was red and stiff  of course he said i think we must have another doctors opinion and if were going to have it we had better have it at once egbert do you think you might cycle in to bingham for doctor wayne i found him very satisfactory for winnies mother  i can go if you think it necessary said egbert  certainly i think it necessary even if there if nothing we can have peace of mind certainly i think it necessary i should like doctor wayne to come this evening if possible  so egbert set off on his bicycle through the wind like a boy sent on an errand leaving his fatherinlaw a pillar of assurance with winifred  doctor wayne came and looked grave yes the knee was certainly taking the wrong way the child might be lame for life  up went the fire and fear and anger in every heart doctor wayne came again the next day for a proper examination and yes the knee had really taken bad ways it should be xrayed it was very important  godfrey marshall walked up and down the lane with the doctor beside the standing motorcar up and down up and down in one of those consultations of which he had had so many in his life  as a result he came indoors to winifred  well winnie dear the best thing to do is to take joyce up to london to a nursing home where she can have proper treatment of course this knee has been allowed to go wrong and apparently there is a risk that the child may even lose her leg what do you think dear you agree to our taking her up to town and putting her under the best care  oh father you know i would do anything on earth for her  i know you would winnie darling the pity is that there has been this unfortunate delay already i cant think what doctor wing was doing apparently the child is in danger of losing her leg well then if you will have everything ready we will take her up to town tomorrow i will order the large car from denleys to be here at ten egbert will you take a telegram at once to doctor jackson it is a small nursing home for children and for surgical cases not far from baker street im sure joyce will be all right there  oh father cant i nurse her myself  well darling if she is to have proper treatment she had best be in a home the xray treatment and the electric treatment and whatever is necessary  it will cost a great deal said winifred  we cant think of cost if the childs leg is in dangeror even her life no use speaking of cost said the elder man impatiently  and so it was poor joyce stretched out on a bed in the big closed motorcarthe mother sitting by her head the grandfather in his short grey beard and a bowler hat sitting by her feet thick and implacable in his responsibilitythey rolled slowly away from crockham and from egbert who stood there bareheaded and a little ignominious left behind he was to shut up the house and bring the rest of the family back to town by train the next day  followed a dark and bitter time the poor child the poor poor child how she suffered an agony and a long crucifixion in that nursing home it was a bitter six weeks which changed the soul of winifred for ever as she sat by the bed of her poor tortured little child tortured with the agony of the knee and the still worse agony of these diabolic but perhaps necessary modern treatments she felt her heart killed and going cold in her breast her little joyce her frail brave wonderful little joyce frail and small and pale as a white flower ah how had she winifred dared to be so wicked so wicked so careless so sensual  let my heart die let my womans heart of flesh die saviour let my heart die and save my child let my heart die from the world and from the flesh oh destroy my heart that is so wayward let my heart of pride die let my heart die  so she prayed beside the bed of her child and like the mother with the seven swords in her breast slowly her heart of pride and passion died in her breast bleeding away slowly it died bleeding away and she turned to the church for comfort to jesus to the mother of god but most of all to that great and enduring institution the roman catholic church she withdrew into the shadow of the church she was a mother with three children but in her soul she died her heart of pride and passion and desire bled to death her soul belonged to her church her body belonged to her duty as a mother  her duty as a wife did not enter as a wife she had no sense of duty only a certain bitterness towards the man with whom she had known such sensuality and distraction she was purely the mater dolorata to the man she was closed as a tomb  egbert came to see his child but winifred seemed to be always seated there like the tomb of his manhood and his fatherhood poor winifred she was still young still strong and ruddy and beautiful like a ruddy hard flower of the field strangeher ruddy healthy face so sombre and her strong heavy fullblooded body so still she a nun never and yet the gates of her heart and soul had shut in his face with a slow resonant clang shutting him out for ever there was no need for her to go into a convent her will had done it  and between this young mother and this young father lay the crippled child like a bit of pale silk floss on the pillow and a little white painquenched face he could not bear it he just could not bear it he turned aside there was nothing to do but to turn aside he turned aside and went hither and thither desultory he was still attractive and desirable but there was a little frown between his brow as if he had been cleft there with a hatchet cleft right in for ever and that was the stigma  the childs leg was saved but the knee was locked stiff the fear now was lest the lower leg should wither or cease to grow there must be longcontinued massage and treatment daily treatment even when the child left the nursing home and the whole of the expense was borne by the grandfather  egbert now had no real home winifred with the children and nurse was tied to the little flat in london he could not live there he could not contain himself the cottage was shutupor lent to friends he went down sometimes to work in his garden and keep the place in order then with the empty house around him at night all the empty rooms he felt his heart go wicked the sense of frustration and futility like some slow torpid snake slowly bit right through his heart futility futility the horrible marshpoison went through his veins and killed him  as he worked in the garden in the silence of day he would listen for a sound no sound no sound of winifred from the dark inside of the cottage no sound of childrens voices from the air from the common from the near distance no sound nothing but the old dark marshvenomous atmosphere of the place so he worked spasmodically through the day and at night made a fire and cooked some food alone  he was alone he himself cleaned the cottage and made his bed but his mending he did not do his shirts were slit on the shoulders when he had been working and the white flesh showed through he would feel the air and the spots of rain on his exposed flesh and he would look again across the common where the dark tufted gorse was dying to seed and the bits of catheather were coming pink in tufts like a sprinkling of sacrificial blood  his heart went back to the savage old spirit of the place the desire for old gods old lost passions the passion of the coldblooded darting snakes that hissed and shot away from him the mystery of bloodsacrifices all the lost intense sensations of the primeval people of the place whose passions seethed in the air still from those long days before the romans came the seethe of a lost dark passion in the air the presence of unseen snakes  a queer baffled halfwicked look came on his face he could not stay long at the cottage suddenly he must swing on to his bicycle and goanywhere anywhere away from the place he would stay a few days with his mother in the old home his mother adored him and grieved as a mother would but the little baffled halfwicked smile curled on his face and he swung away from his mothers solicitude as from everything else  always moving onfrom place to place friend to friend and always swinging away from sympathy as soon as sympathy like a soft hand was reached out to touch him away he swerved instinctively as a harmless snake swerves and swerves and swerves away from an outstretched hand away he must go and periodically he went back to winifred  he was terrible to her now like a temptation she had devoted herself to her children and her church joyce was once more on her feet but alas lame with iron supports to her leg and a little crutch it was strange how she had grown into a long pallid wild little thing strange that the pain had not made her soft and docile but had brought out a wild almost maenad temper in the child she was seven and long and white and thin but by no means subdued her blonde hair was darkening she still had long sufferings to face and in her own childish consciousness the stigma of her lameness to bear  and she bore it an almost maenad courage seemed to possess her as if she were a long thin young weapon of life she acknowledged all her mothers care she would stand by her mother for ever but some of her fathers finetempered desperation flashed in her  when egbert saw his little girl limping horriblynot only limping but lurching horribly in crippled childish way his heart again hardened with chagrin like steel that is tempered again there was a tacit understanding between him and his little girl not what we would call love but a weaponlike kinship there was a tiny touch of irony in his manner towards her contrasting sharply with winifreds heavy unleavened solicitude and care the child flickered back to him with an answering little smile of irony and recklessness an odd flippancy which made winifred only the more sombre and earnest  the marshalls took endless thought and trouble for the child searching out every means to save her limb and her active freedom they spared no effort and no money they spared no strength of will with all their slow heavy power of will they willed that joyce should save her liberty of movement should win back her wild free grace even if it took a long time to recover it should be recovered  so the situation stood and joyce submitted week after week month after month to the tyranny and pain of the treatment she acknowledged the honourable effort on her behalf but her flamy reckless spirit was her fathers it was he who had all the glamour for her he and she were like members of some forbidden secret society who know one another but may not recognize one another knowledge they had in common the same secret of life the father and the child but the child stayed in the camp of her mother honourably and the father wandered outside like ishmael only coming sometimes to sit in the home for an hour or two an evening or two beside the camp fire like ishmael in a curious silence and tension with the mocking answer of the desert speaking out of his silence and annulling the whole convention of the domestic home  his presence was almost an anguish to winifred she prayed against it that little cleft between his brow that flickering wicked little smile that seemed to haunt his face and above all the triumphant loneliness the ishmael quality and then the erectness of his supple body like a symbol the very way he stood so quiet so insidious like an erect supple symbol of life the living body confronting her downcast soul was torture to her he was like a supple living idol moving before her eyes and she felt if she watched him she was damned  and he came and made himself at home in her little home when he was there moving in his own quiet way she felt as if the whole great law of sacrifice by which she had elected to live were annulled he annulled by his very presence the laws of her life and what did he substitute ah against that question she hardened herself in recoil  it was awful to her to have to have him aboutmoving about in his shirtsleeves speaking in his tenor throaty voice to the children annabel simply adored him and he teased the little girl the baby barbara was not sure of him she had been born a stranger to him but even the nurse when she saw his white shoulder of flesh through the slits of his torn shirt thought it a shame  winifred felt it was only another weapon of his against her  you have other shirtswhy do you wear that old one that is all torn egbert she said  i may as well wear it out he said subtly  he knew she would not offer to mend it for him she could not and no she would not had she not her own gods to honour and could she betray them submitting to his baal and ashtaroth and it was terrible to her his unsheathed presence that seemed to annul her and her faith like another revelation like a gleaming idol evoked against her a vivid lifeidol that might triumph  he came and he wentand she persisted and then the great war broke out he was a man who could not go to the dogs he could not dissipate himself he was purebred in his englishness and even when he would have killed to be vicious he could not  so when the war broke out his whole instinct was against it against war he had not the faintest desire to overcome any foreigners or to help in their death he had no conception of imperial england and rule britannia was just a joke to him he was a pureblooded englishman perfect in his race and when he was truly himself he could no more have been aggressive on the score of his englishness than a rose can be aggressive on the score of its rosiness  no he had no desire to defy germany and to exalt england the distinction between german and english was not for him the distinction between good and bad it was the distinction between blue waterflowers and red or white bushblossoms just difference the difference between the wild boar and the wild bear and a man was good or bad according to his nature not according to his nationality  egbert was wellbred and this was part of his natural understanding it was merely unnatural to him to hate a nation en bloc certain individuals he disliked and others he liked and the mass he knew nothing about certain deeds he disliked certain deeds seemed natural to him and about most deeds he had no particular feeling  he had however the one deepest purebred instinct he recoiled inevitably from having his feelings dictated to him by the mass feeling his feelings were his own his understanding was his own and he would never go back on either willingly shall a man become inferior to his own true knowledge and self just because the mob expects it of him  what egbert felt subtly and without question his fatherinlaw felt also in a rough more combative way different as the two men were they were two real englishmen and their instincts were almost the same  and godfrey marshall had the world to reckon with there was german military aggression and the english nonmilitary idea of liberty and the conquests of peacemeaning industrialism even if the choice between militarism and industrialism were a choice of evils the elderly man asserted his choice of the latter perforce he whose soul was quick with the instinct of power  egbert just refused to reckon with the world he just refused even to decide between german militarism and british industrialism he chose neither as for atrocities he despised the people who committed them as inferior criminal types there was nothing national about crime  and yet war war just war not right or wrong but just war itself should he join should he give himself over to war the question was in his mind for some weeks not because he thought england was right and germany wrong probably germany was wrong but he refused to make a choice not because he felt inspired no but justwar  the deterrent was the giving himself over into the power of other men and into the power of the mobspirit of a democratic army should he give himself over should he make over his own life and body to the control of something which he knew was inferior in spirit to his own self should he commit himself into the power of an inferior control should he should he betray himself  he was going to put himself into the power of his inferiors and he knew it he was going to subjugate himself he was going to be ordered about by petty canaille of noncommissioned officersand even commissioned officers he who was born and bred free should he do it  he went to his wife to speak to her  shall i join up winifred  she was silent her instinct also was dead against it and yet a certain profound resentment made her answer  you have three children dependent on you i dont know whether you have thought of that  it was still only the third month of the war and the old prewar ideas were still alive  of course but it wont make much difference to them i shall be earning a shilling a day at least  youd better speak to father i think she replied heavily  egbert went to his fatherinlaw the elderly mans heart was full of resentment  i should say he said rather sourly it is the best thing you could do  egbert went and joined up immediately as a private soldier he was drafted into the light artillery  winifred now had a new duty towards him the duty of a wife towards a husband who is himself performing his duty towards the world she loved him still she would always love him as far as earthly love went but it was duty she now lived by when he came back to her in khaki a soldier she submitted to him as a wife it was her duty but to his passion she could never again fully submit something prevented her for ever even her own deepest choice  he went back again to camp it did not suit him to be a modern soldier in the thick gritty hideous khaki his subtle physique was extinguished as if he had been killed in the ugly intimacy of the camp his thoroughbred sensibilities were just degraded but he had chosen so he accepted an ugly little look came on to his face of a man who has accepted his own degradation  in the early spring winifred went down to crockham to be there when primroses were out and the tassels hanging on the hazelbushes she felt something like a reconciliation towards egbert now he was a prisoner in camp most of his days joyce was wild with delight at seeing the garden and the common again after the eight or nine months of london and misery she was still lame she still had the irons up her leg but she lurched about with a wild crippled agility  egbert came for a weekend in his gritty thick sandpaper khaki and puttees and the hideous cap nay he looked terrible and on his face a slightly impure look a little sore on his lip as if he had eaten too much or drunk too much or let his blood become a little unclean he was almost uglily healthy with the camp life it did not suit him  winifred waited for him in a little passion of duty and sacrifice willing to serve the soldier if not the man it only made him feel a little more ugly inside the weekend was torment to him the memory of the camp the knowledge of the life he led there even the sight of his own legs in that abhorrent khaki he felt as if the hideous cloth went into his blood and made it gritty and dirty then winifred so ready to serve the soldier when she repudiated the man and this made the grit worse between his teeth and the children running around playing and calling in the rather mincing fashion of children who have nurses and governesses and literature in the family and joyce so lame it had all become unreal to him after the camp it only set his soul on edge he left at dawn on the monday morning glad to get back to the realness and vulgarity of the camp  winifred would never meet him again at the cottageonly in london where the world was with them but sometimes he came alone to crockham perhaps when friends were staying there and then he would work awhile in his garden this summer still it would flame with blue anchusas and big red poppies the mulleins would sway their soft downy erections in the air he loved mulleins and the honeysuckle would stream out scent like memory when the owl was whooing then he sat by the fire with the friends and with winifreds sisters and they sang the folksongs he put on thin civilian clothes and his charm and his beauty and the supple dominancy of his body glowed out again but winifred was not there  at the end of the summer he went to flanders into action he seemed already to have gone out of life beyond the pale of life he hardly remembered his life any more being like a man who is going to take a jump from a height and is only looking to where he must land  he was twice slightly wounded in two months but not enough to put him off duty for more than a day or two they were retiring again holding the enemy back he was in the rearthree machineguns the country was all pleasant war had not yet trampled it only the air seemed shattered and the land awaiting death it was a small unimportant action in which he was engaged  the guns were stationed on a little bushy hillock just outside a village but occasionally it was difficult to say from which direction came the sharp crackle of riflefire and beyond the faroff thud of cannon the afternoon was wintry and cold  a lieutenant stood on a little iron platform at the top of the ladders taking the sights and giving the aim calling in a high tense mechanical voice out of the sky came the sharp cry of the directions then the warning numbers then fire the shot went the piston of the gun sprang back there was a sharp explosion and a very faint film of smoke in the air then the other two guns fired and there was a lull the officer was uncertain of the enemys position the thick clump of horsechestnut trees below was without change only in the far distance the sound of heavy firing continued so far off as to give a sense of peace  the gorse bushes on either hand were dark but a few sparks of flowers showed yellow he noticed them almost unconsciously as he waited in the lull he was in his shirtsleeves and the air came chill on his arms again his shirt was slit on the shoulders and the flesh showed through he was dirty and unkempt but his face was quiet so many things go out of consciousness before we come to the end of consciousness  before him below was the highroad running between high banks of grass and gorse he saw the whitish muddy tracks and deep scores in the road where the part of the regiment had retired now all was still sounds that came came from the outside the place where he stood was still silent chill serene the white church among the trees beyond seemed like a thought only  he moved into a lightninglike mechanical response at the sharp cry from the officer overhead mechanism the pure mechanical action of obedience at the guns pure mechanical action at the guns it left the soul unburdened brooding in dark nakedness in the end the soul is alone brooding on the face of the uncreated flux as a bird on a dark sea  nothing could be seen but the road and a crucifix knocked slanting and the dark autumnal fields and woods there appeared three horsemen on a little eminence very small on the crest of a ploughed field they were our own men of the enemy nothing  the lull continued then suddenly came sharp orders and a new direction of the guns and an intense exciting activity yet at the centre the soul remained dark and aloof alone  but even so it was the soul that heard the new sound the new deep papp of a gun that seemed to touch right upon the soul he kept up the rapid activity at the machinegun sweating but in his soul was the echo of the new deep sound deeper than life  and in confirmation came the awful faint whistling of a shell advancing almost suddenly into a piercing tearing shriek that would tear through the membrane of life he heard it in his ears but he heard it also in his soul in tension there was relief when the thing had swung by and struck away beyond he heard the hoarseness of its explosion and the voice of the soldier calling to the horses but he did not turn round to look he only noticed a twig of holly with red berries fall like a gift on to the road below  not this time not this time whither thou goest i will go did he say it to the shell or to whom whither thou goest i will go then the faint whistling of another shell dawned and his blood became small and still to receive it it drew nearer like some horrible blast of wind his blood lost consciousness but in the second of suspension he saw the heavy shell swoop to earth into the rocky bushes on the right and earth and stones poured up into the sky it was as if he heard no sound the earth and stones and fragments of bush fell to earth again and there was the same unchanging peace the germans had got the aim  would they move now would they retire yes the officer was giving the last lightningrapid orders to fire before withdrawing a shell passed unnoticed in the rapidity of action and then into the silence into the suspense where the soul brooded finally crashed a noise and a darkness and a moments flaming agony and horror ah he had seen the dark bird flying towards him flying home this time in one instant life and eternity went up in a conflagration of agony then there was a weight of darkness  when faintly something began to struggle in the darkness a consciousness of himself he was aware of a great load and a clanging sound to have known the moment of death and to be forced before dying to review it so fate even in death  there was a resounding of pain it seemed to sound from the outside of his consciousness like a loud bell clanging very near yet he knew it was himself he must associate himself with it after a lapse and a new effort he identified a pain in his head a large pain that clanged and resounded so far he could identify himself with himself then there was a lapse  after a time he seemed to wake up again and waking to know that he was at the front and that he was killed he did not open his eyes light was not yet his the clanging pain in his head rang out the rest of his consciousness so he lapsed away from consciousness in unutterable sick abandon of life  bit by bit like a doom came the necessity to know he was hit in the head it was only a vague surmise at first but in the swinging of the pendulum of pain swinging ever nearer and nearer to touch him into an agony of consciousness and a consciousness of agony gradually the knowledge emergedhe must be hit in the headhit on the left brow if so there would be bloodwas there bloodcould he feel blood in his left eye then the clanging seemed to burst the membrane of his brain like deathmadness  was there blood on his face was hot blood flowing or was it dry blood congealing down his cheek it took him hours even to ask the question time being no more than an agony in darkness without measurement  a long time after he had opened his eyes he realized he was seeing somethingsomething something but the effort to recall what was too great no no no recall  were they the stars in the dark sky was it possible it was stars in the dark sky stars the world ah no he could not know it stars and the world were gone for him he closed his eyes no stars no sky no world no no the thick darkness of blood alone it should be one great lapse into the thick darkness of blood in agony  death oh death the world all blood and the blood all writhing with death the soul like the tiniest little light out on a dark sea the sea of blood and the light guttering beating pulsing in a windless storm wishing it could go out yet unable  there had been life there had been winifred and his children but the frail deathagony effort to catch at straws of memory straws of life from the past brought on too great a nausea no no no winifred no children no world no people better the agony of dissolution ahead than the nausea of the effort backwards better the terrible work should go forward the dissolving into the black sea of death in the extremity of dissolution than that there should be any reaching back towards life to forget to forget utterly utterly to forget in the great forgetting of death to break the core and the unit of life and to lapse out on the great darkness only that to break the clue and mingle and commingle with the one darkness without afterwards or forwards let the black sea of death itself solve the problem of futurity let the will of man break and give up  what was that a light a terrible light was it figures was it legs of a horse colossalcolossal above him huge huge  the germans heard a slight noise and started then in the glare of a lightbomb by the side of the heap of earth thrown up by the shell they saw the dead face     tickets please   there is in the midlands a singleline tramway system which boldly leaves the county town and plunges off into the black industrial countryside up hill and down dale through the long ugly villages of workmens houses over canals and railways past churches perched high and nobly over the smoke and shadows through stark grimy cold little marketplaces tilting away in a rush past cinemas and shops down to the hollow where the collieries are then up again past a little rural church under the ash trees on in a rush to the terminus the last little ugly place of industry the cold little town that shivers on the edge of the wild gloomy country beyond there the green and creamy coloured tramcar seems to pause and purr with curious satisfaction but in a few minutesthe clock on the turret of the cooperative wholesale societys shops gives the timeaway it starts once more on the adventure again there are the reckless swoops downhill bouncing the loops again the chilly wait in the hilltop marketplace again the breathless slithering round the precipitous drop under the church again the patient halts at the loops waiting for the outcoming car so on and on for two long hours till at last the city looms beyond the fat gasworks the narrow factories draw near we are in the sordid streets of the great town once more we sidle to a standstill at our terminus abashed by the great crimson and creamcoloured city cars but still perky jaunty somewhat daredevil green as a jaunty sprig of parsley out of a black colliery garden  to ride on these cars is always an adventure since we are in wartime the drivers are men unfit for active service cripples and hunchbacks so they have the spirit of the devil in them the ride becomes a steeplechase hurray we have leapt in a clear jump over the canal bridgesnow for the fourlane corner with a shriek and a trail of sparks we are clear again to be sure a tram often leaps the railsbut what matter it sits in a ditch till other trams come to haul it out it is quite common for a car packed with one solid mass of living people to come to a dead halt in the midst of unbroken blackness the heart of nowhere on a dark night and for the driver and the girl conductor to call all get offcars on fire instead however of rushing out in a panic the passengers stolidly reply get onget on were not coming out were stopping where we are push on george so till flames actually appear  the reason for this reluctance to dismount is that the nights are howlingly cold black and windswept and a car is a haven of refuge from village to village the miners travel for a change of cinema of girl of pub the trams are desperately packed who is going to risk himself in the black gulf outside to wait perhaps an hour for another tram then to see the forlorn notice depot only because there is something wrong or to greet a unit of three bright cars all so tight with people that they sail past with a howl of derision trams that pass in the night  this the most dangerous tramservice in england as the authorities themselves declare with pride is entirely conducted by girls and driven by rash young men a little crippled or by delicate young men who creep forward in terror the girls are fearless young hussies in their ugly blue uniform skirts up to their knees shapeless old peaked caps on their heads they have all the sangfroid of an old noncommissioned officer with a tram packed with howling colliers roaring hymns downstairs and a sort of antiphony of obscenities upstairs the lasses are perfectly at their ease they pounce on the youths who try to evade their ticketmachine they push off the men at the end of their distance they are not going to be done in the eyenot they they fear nobodyand everybody fears them  hello annie  hello ted  oh mind my corn miss stone its my belief youve got a heart of stone for youve trod on it again  you should keep it in your pocket replies miss stone and she goes sturdily upstairs in her high boots  tickets please  she is peremptory suspicious and ready to hit first she can hold her own against ten thousand the step of that tramcar is her thermopylae  therefore there is a certain wild romance aboard these carsand in the sturdy bosom of annie herself the time for soft romance is in the morning between ten oclock and one when things are rather slack that is except marketday and saturday thus annie has time to look about her then she often hops off her car and into a shop where she has spied something while the driver chats in the main road there is very good feeling between the girls and the drivers are they not companions in peril shipments aboard this careering vessel of a tramcar for ever rocking on the waves of a stormy land  then also during the easy hours the inspectors are most in evidence for some reason everybody employed in this tramservice is young there are no grey heads it would not do therefore the inspectors are of the right age and one the chief is also goodlooking see him stand on a wet gloomy morning in his long oilskin his peaked cap well down over his eyes waiting to board a car his face is ruddy his small brown moustache is weathered he has a faint impudent smile fairly tall and agile even in his waterproof he springs aboard a car and greets annie  hello annie keeping the wet out  trying to  there are only two people in the car inspecting is soon over then for a long and impudent chat on the footboard a good easy twelvemile chat  the inspectors name is john thomas raynoralways called john thomas except sometimes in malice coddy his face sets in fury when he is addressed from a distance with this abbreviation there is considerable scandal about john thomas in half a dozen villages he flirts with the girl conductors in the morning and walks out with them in the dark night when they leave their tramcar at the depot of course the girls quit the service frequently then he flirts and walks out with the newcomer always providing she is sufficiently attractive and that she will consent to walk it is remarkable however that most of the girls are quite comely they are all young and this roving life aboard the car gives them a sailors dash and recklessness what matter how they behave when the ship is in port tomorrow they will be aboard again  annie however was something of a tartar and her sharp tongue had kept john thomas at arms length for many months perhaps therefore she liked him all the more for he always came up smiling with impudence she watched him vanquish one girl then another she could tell by the movement of his mouth and eyes when he flirted with her in the morning that he had been walking out with this lass or the other the night before a fine cockofthewalk he was she could sum him up pretty well  in this subtle antagonism they knew each other like old friends they were as shrewd with one another almost as man and wife but annie had always kept him sufficiently at arms length besides she had a boy of her own  the statutes fair however came in november at bestwood it happened that annie had the monday night off it was a drizzling ugly night yet she dressed herself up and went to the fair ground she was alone but she expected soon to find a pal of some sort  the roundabouts were veering round and grinding out their music the side shows were making as much commotion as possible in the coconut shies there were no coconuts but artificial wartime substitutes which the lads declared were fastened into the irons there was a sad decline in brilliance and luxury none the less the ground was muddy as ever there was the same crush the press of faces lighted up by the flares and the electric lights the same smell of naphtha and a few fried potatoes and of electricity  who should be the first to greet miss annie on the showground but john thomas he had a black overcoat buttoned up to his chin and a tweed cap pulled down over his brows his face between was ruddy and smiling and handy as ever she knew so well the way his mouth moved  she was very glad to have a boy to be at the statutes without a fellow was no fun instantly like the gallant he was he took her on the dragons grimtoothed roundabout switchbacks it was not nearly so exciting as a tramcar actually but then to be seated in a shaking green dragon uplifted above the sea of bubble faces careering in a rickety fashion in the lower heavens whilst john thomas leaned over her his cigarette in his mouth was after all the right style she was a plump quick alive little creature so she was quite excited and happy  john thomas made her stay on for the next round and therefore she could hardly for shame repulse him when he put his arm round her and drew her a little nearer to him in a very warm and cuddly manner besides he was fairly discreet he kept his movement as hidden as possible she looked down and saw that his red clean hand was out of sight of the crowd and they knew each other so well so they warmed up to the fair  after the dragons they went on the horses john thomas paid each time so she could but be complaisant he of course sat astride on the outer horsenamed black bessand she sat sideways towards him on the inner horsenamed wildfire but of course john thomas was not going to sit discreetly on black bess holding the brass bar round they spun and heaved in the light and round he swung on his wooden steed flinging one leg across her mount and perilously tipping up and down across the space half lying back laughing at her he was perfectly happy she was afraid her hat was on one side but she was excited  he threw quoits on a table and won for her two large paleblue hatpins and then hearing the noise of the cinemas announcing another performance they climbed the boards and went in  of course during these performances pitch darkness falls from time to time when the machine goes wrong then there is a wild whooping and a loud smacking of simulated kisses in these moments john thomas drew annie towards him after all he had a wonderfully warm cosy way of holding a girl with his arm he seemed to make such a nice fit and after all it was pleasant to be so held so very comforting and cosy and nice he leaned over her and she felt his breath on her hair she knew he wanted to kiss her on the lips and after all he was so warm and she fitted in to him so softly after all she wanted him to touch her lips  but the light sprang up she also started electrically and put her hat straight he left his arm lying nonchalantly behind her well it was fun it was exciting to be at the statutes with john thomas  when the cinema was over they went for a walk across the dark damp fields he had all the arts of lovemaking he was especially good at holding a girl when he sat with her on a stile in the black drizzling darkness he seemed to be holding her in space against his own warmth and gratification and his kisses were soft and slow and searching  so annie walked out with john thomas though she kept her own boy dangling in the distance some of the tramgirls chose to be huffy but there you must take things as you find them in this life  there was no mistake about it annie liked john thomas a good deal she felt so rich and warm in herself whenever he was near and john thomas really liked annie more than usual the soft melting way in which she could flow into a fellow as if she melted into his very bones was something rare and good he fully appreciated this  but with a developing acquaintance there began a developing intimacy annie wanted to consider him a person a man she wanted to take an intelligent interest in him and to have an intelligent response she did not want a mere nocturnal presence which was what he was so far and she prided herself that he could not leave her  here she made a mistake john thomas intended to remain a nocturnal presence he had no idea of becoming an allround individual to her when she started to take an intelligent interest in him and his life and his character he sheered off he hated intelligent interest and he knew that the only way to stop it was to avoid it the possessive female was aroused in annie so he left her  it is no use saying she was not surprised she was at first startled thrown out of her count for she had been so very sure of holding him for a while she was staggered and everything became uncertain to her then she wept with fury indignation desolation and misery then she had a spasm of despair and then when he came still impudently on to her car still familiar but letting her see by the movement of his head that he had gone away to somebody else for the time being and was enjoying pastures new then she determined to have her own back  she had a very shrewd idea what girls john thomas had taken out she went to nora purdy nora was a tall rather pale but wellbuilt girl with beautiful yellow hair she was rather secretive  hey said annie accosting her then softly whos john thomas on with now  i dont know said nora  why tha does said annie ironically lapsing into dialect tha knows as well as i do  well i do then said nora it isnt me so dont bother  its cissy meakin isnt it  it is for all i know  hasnt he got a face on him said annie i dont half like his cheek i could knock him off the footboard when he comes round at me  hell get droppedon one of these days said nora  ay he will when somebody makes up their mind to drop it on him i should like to see him taken down a peg or two shouldnt you  i shouldnt mind said nora  youve got quite as much cause to as i have said annie but well drop on him one of these days my girl what dont you want to  i dont mind said nora  but as a matter of fact nora was much more vindictive than annie  one by one annie went the round of the old flames it so happened that cissy meakin left the tramway service in quite a short time her mother made her leave then john thomas was on the quivive he cast his eyes over his old flock and his eyes lighted on annie he thought she would be safe now besides he liked her  she arranged to walk home with him on sunday night it so happened that her car would be in the depot at half past nine the last car would come in at 1015 so john thomas was to wait for her there  at the depot the girls had a little waitingroom of their own it was quite rough but cosy with a fire and an oven and a mirror and table and wooden chairs the half dozen girls who knew john thomas only too well had arranged to take service this sunday afternoon so as the cars began to come in early the girls dropped into the waitingroom and instead of hurrying off home they sat around the fire and had a cup of tea outside was the darkness and lawlessness of wartime  john thomas came on the car after annie at about a quarter to ten he poked his head easily into the girls waitingroom  prayermeeting he asked  ay said laura sharp ladies only  thats me said john thomas it was one of his favourite exclamations  shut the door boy said muriel baggaley  on which side of me said john thomas  which tha likes said polly birkin  he had come in and closed the door behind him the girls moved in their circle to make a place for him near the fire he took off his greatcoat and pushed back his hat  who handles the teapot he said  nora purdy silently poured him out a cup of tea  want a bit o my bread and drippin said muriel baggaley to him  ay give us a bit  and he began to eat his piece of bread  theres no place like home girls he said  they all looked at him as he uttered this piece of impudence he seemed to be sunning himself in the presence of so many damsels  especially if youre not afraid to go home in the dark said laura sharp  me by myself i am  they sat till they heard the last tram come in in a few minutes emma houselay entered  come on my old duck cried polly birkin  it is perishing said emma holding her fingers to the fire  butim afraid to go home in the dark sang laura sharp the tune having got into her mind  whore you going with tonight john thomas asked muriel baggaley coolly  tonight said john thomas oh im going home by myself tonightall on my lonelyo  thats me said nora purdy using his own ejaculation  the girls laughed shrilly  me as well nora said john thomas  dont know what you mean said laura  yes im toddling said he rising and reaching for his overcoat  nay said polly were all here waiting for you  weve got to be up in good time in the morning he said in the benevolent official manner  they all laughed  nay said muriel dont leave us all lonely john thomas take one  ill take the lot if you like he responded gallantly  that you wont either said muriel twos company sevens too much of a good thing  naytake one said laura fair and square all above board and say which  ay cried annie speaking for the first time pick john thomas lets hear thee  nay he said im going home quiet tonight feeling good for once  whereabouts said annie take a good un then but thas got to take one of us  nay how can i take one he said laughing uneasily i dont want to make enemies  youd only make one said annie  the chosen one added laura  oh my who said girls exclaimed john thomas again turning as if to escape wellgoodnight  nay youve got to make your pick said muriel turn your face to the wall and say which one touches you go onwe shall only just touch your backone of us go onturn your face to the wall and dont look and say which one touches you  he was uneasy mistrusting them yet he had not the courage to break away they pushed him to a wall and stood him there with his face to it behind his back they all grimaced tittering he looked so comical he looked around uneasily  go on he cried  youre lookingyoure looking they shouted  he turned his head away and suddenly with a movement like a swift cat annie went forward and fetched him a box on the side of the head that sent his cap flying and himself staggering he started round  but at annies signal they all flew at him slapping him pinching him pulling his hair though more in fun than in spite or anger he however saw red his blue eyes flamed with strange fear as well as fury and he butted through the girls to the door it was locked he wrenched at it roused alert the girls stood round and looked at him he faced them at bay at that moment they were rather horrifying to him as they stood in their short uniforms he was distinctly afraid  come on john thomas come on choose said annie  what are you after open the door he said  we shantnot till youve chosen said muriel  chosen what he said  chosen the one youre going to marry she replied  he hesitated a moment  open the blasted door he said and get back to your senses he spoke with official authority  youve got to choose cried the girls  come on cried annie looking him in the eye come on come on  he went forward rather vaguely she had taken off her belt and swinging it she fetched him a sharp blow over the head with the buckle end he sprang and seized her but immediately the other girls rushed upon him pulling and tearing and beating him their blood was now thoroughly up he was their sport now they were going to have their own back out of him strange wild creatures they hung on him and rushed at him to bear him down his tunic was torn right up the back nora had hold at the back of his collar and was actually strangling him luckily the button burst he struggled in a wild frenzy of fury and terror almost mad terror his tunic was simply torn off his back his shirtsleeves were torn away his arms were naked the girls rushed at him clenched their hands on him and pulled at him or they rushed at him and pushed him butted him with all their might or they struck him wild blows he ducked and cringed and struck sideways they became more intense  at last he was down they rushed on him kneeling on him he had neither breath nor strength to move his face was bleeding with a long scratch his brow was bruised  annie knelt on him the other girls knelt and hung on to him their faces were flushed their hair wild their eyes were all glittering strangely he lay at last quite still with face averted as an animal lies when it is defeated and at the mercy of the captor sometimes his eye glanced back at the wild faces of the girls his breast rose heavily his wrists were torn  now then my fellow gasped annie at length now thennow  at the sound of her terrifying cold triumph he suddenly started to struggle as an animal might but the girls threw themselves upon him with unnatural strength and power forcing him down  yesnow then gasped annie at length  and there was a dead silence in which the thud of heartbeating was to be heard it was a suspense of pure silence in every soul  now you know where you are said annie  the sight of his white bare arm maddened the girls he lay in a kind of trance of fear and antagonism they felt themselves filled with supernatural strength  suddenly polly started to laughto giggle wildlyhelplesslyand emma and muriel joined in but annie and nora and laura remained the same tense watchful with gleaming eyes he winced away from these eyes  yes said annie in a curious low tone secret and deadly yes youve got it now you know what youve done dont you you know what youve done  he made no sound nor sign but lay with bright averted eyes and averted bleeding face  you ought to be killed thats what you ought said annie tensely you ought to be killed and there was a terrifying lust in her voice  polly was ceasing to laugh and giving longdrawn ohhhs and sighs as she came to herself  hes got to choose she said vaguely  oh yes he has said laura with vindictive decision  do you heardo you hear said annie and with a sharp movement that made him wince she turned his face to her  do you hear she repeated shaking him  but he was quite dumb she fetched him a sharp slap on the face he started and his eyes widened then his face darkened with defiance after all  do you hear she repeated  he only looked at her with hostile eyes  speak she said putting her face devilishly near his  what he said almost overcome  youve got to choose she cried as if it were some terrible menace and as if it hurt her that she could not exact more  what he said in fear  choose your girl coddy youve got to choose her now and youll get your neck broken if you play any more of your tricks my boy youre settled now  there was a pause again he averted his face he was cunning in his overthrow he did not give in to them reallyno not if they tore him to bits  all right then he said i choose annie his voice was strange and full of malice annie let go of him as if he had been a hot coal  hes chosen annie said the girls in chorus  me cried annie she was still kneeling but away from him he was still lying prostrate with averted face the girls grouped uneasily around  me repeated annie with a terrible bitter accent  then she got up drawing away from him with strange disgust and bitterness  i wouldnt touch him she said  but her face quivered with a kind of agony she seemed as if she would fall the other girls turned aside he remained lying on the floor with his torn clothes and bleeding averted face  oh if hes chosen said polly  i dont want himhe can choose again said annie with the same rather bitter hopelessness  get up said polly lifting his shoulder get up  he rose slowly a strange ragged dazed creature the girls eyed him from a distance curiously furtively dangerously  who wants him cried laura roughly  nobody they answered with contempt yet each one of them waited for him to look at her hoped he would look at her all except annie and something was broken in her  he however kept his face closed and averted from them all there was a silence of the end he picked up the torn pieces of his tunic without knowing what to do with them the girls stood about uneasily flushed panting tidying their hair and their dress unconsciously and watching him he looked at none of them he espied his cap in a corner and went and picked it up he put it on his head and one of the girls burst into a shrill hysteric laugh at the sight he presented he however took no heed but went straight to where his overcoat hung on a peg the girls moved away from contact with him as if he had been an electric wire he put on his coat and buttoned it down then he rolled his tunicrags into a bundle and stood before the locked door dumbly  open the door somebody said laura  annies got the key said one  annie silently offered the key to the girls nora unlocked the door  tit for tat old man she said show yourself a man and dont bear a grudge  but without a word or sign he had opened the door and gone his face closed his head dropped  thatll learn him said laura  coddy said nora  shut up for gods sake cried annie fiercely as if in torture  well im about ready to go polly look sharp said muriel  the girls were all anxious to be off they were tidying themselves hurriedly with mute stupefied faces     the blind man   isabel pervin was listening for two soundsfor the sound of wheels on the drive outside and for the noise of her husbands footsteps in the hall her dearest and oldest friend a man who seemed almost indispensable to her living would drive up in the rainy dusk of the closing november day the trap had gone to fetch him from the station and her husband who had been blinded in flanders and who had a disfiguring mark on his brow would be coming in from the outhouses  he had been home for a year now he was totally blind yet they had been very happy the grange was maurices own place the back was a farmstead and the wernhams who occupied the rear premises acted as farmers isabel lived with her husband in the handsome rooms in front she and he had been almost entirely alone together since he was wounded they talked and sang and read together in a wonderful and unspeakable intimacy then she reviewed books for a scottish newspaper carrying on her old interest and he occupied himself a good deal with the farm sightless he could still discuss everything with wernham and he could also do a good deal of work about the placemenial work it is true but it gave him satisfaction he milked the cows carried in the pails turned the separator attended to the pigs and horses life was still very full and strangely serene for the blind man peaceful with the almost incomprehensible peace of immediate contact in darkness with his wife he had a whole world rich and real and invisible  they were newly and remotely happy he did not even regret the loss of his sight in these times of dark palpable joy a certain exultance swelled his soul  but as time wore on sometimes the rich glamour would leave them sometimes after months of this intensity a sense of burden overcame isabel a weariness a terrible ennui in that silent house approached between a colonnade of tallshafted pines then she felt she would go mad for she could not bear it and sometimes he had devastating fits of depression which seemed to lay waste his whole being it was worse than depressiona black misery when his own life was a torture to him and when his presence was unbearable to his wife the dread went down to the roots of her soul as these black days recurred in a kind of panic she tried to wrap herself up still further in her husband she forced the old spontaneous cheerfulness and joy to continue but the effort it cost her was almost too much she knew she could not keep it up she felt she would scream with the strain and would give anything anything to escape she longed to possess her husband utterly it gave her inordinate joy to have him entirely to herself and yet when again he was gone in a black and massive misery she could not bear him she could not bear herself she wished she could be snatched away off the earth altogether anything rather than live at this cost  dazed she schemed for a way out she invited friends she tried to give him some further connexion with the outer world but it was no good after all their joy and suffering after their dark great year of blindness and solitude and unspeakable nearness other people seemed to them both shallow prattling rather impertinent shallow prattle seemed presumptuous he became impatient and irritated she was wearied and so they lapsed into their solitude again for they preferred it  but now in a few weeks time her second baby would be born the first had died an infant when her husband first went out to france she looked with joy and relief to the coming of the second it would be her salvation but also she felt some anxiety she was thirty years old her husband was a year younger they both wanted the child very much yet she could not help feeling afraid she had her husband on her hands a terrible joy to her and a terrifying burden the child would occupy her love and attention and then what of maurice what would he do if only she could feel that he too would be at peace and happy when the child came she did so want to luxuriate in a rich physical satisfaction of maternity but the man what would he do how could she provide for him how avert those shattering black moods of his which destroyed them both  she sighed with fear but at this time bertie reid wrote to isabel he was her old friend a second or third cousin a scotchman as she was a scotchwoman they had been brought up near to one another and all her life he had been her friend like a brother but better than her own brothers she loved himthough not in the marrying sense there was a sort of kinship between them an affinity they understood one another instinctively but isabel would never have thought of marrying bertie it would have seemed like marrying in her own family  bertie was a barrister and a man of letters a scotchman of the intellectual type quick ironical sentimental and on his knees before the woman he adored but did not want to marry maurice pervin was different he came of a good old country familythe grange was not a very great distance from oxford he was passionate sensitive perhaps oversensitive wincinga big fellow with heavy limbs and a forehead that flushed painfully for his mind was slow as if drugged by the strong provincial blood that beat in his veins he was very sensitive to his own mental slowness his feelings being quick and acute so that he was just the opposite to bertie whose mind was much quicker than his emotions which were not so very fine  from the first the two men did not like each other isabel felt that they ought to get on together but they did not she felt that if only each could have the clue to the other there would be such a rare understanding between them it did not come off however bertie adopted a slightly ironical attitude very offensive to maurice who returned the scotch irony with english resentment a resentment which deepened sometimes into stupid hatred  this was a little puzzling to isabel however she accepted it in the course of things men were made freakish and unreasonable therefore when maurice was going out to france for the second time she felt that for her husbands sake she must discontinue her friendship with bertie she wrote to the barrister to this effect bertram reid simply replied that in this as in all other matters he must obey her wishes if these were indeed her wishes  for nearly two years nothing had passed between the two friends isabel rather gloried in the fact she had no compunction she had one great article of faith which was that husband and wife should be so important to one another that the rest of the world simply did not count she and maurice were husband and wife they loved one another they would have children then let everybody and everything else fade into insignificance outside this connubial felicity she professed herself quite happy and ready to receive maurices friends she was happy and ready the happy wife the ready woman in possession without knowing why the friends retired abashed and came no more maurice of course took as much satisfaction in this connubial absorption as isabel did  he shared in isabels literary activities she cultivated a real interest in agriculture and cattleraising for she being at heart perhaps an emotional enthusiast always cultivated the practical side of life and prided herself on her mastery of practical affairs thus the husband and wife had spent the five years of their married life the last had been one of blindness and unspeakable intimacy and now isabel felt a great indifference coming over her a sort of lethargy she wanted to be allowed to bear her child in peace to nod by the fire and drift vaguely physically from day to day maurice was like an ominous thundercloud she had to keep waking up to remember him  when a little note came from bertie asking if he were to put up a tombstone to their dead friendship and speaking of the real pain he felt on account of her husbands loss of sight she felt a pang a fluttering agitation of reawakening and she read the letter to maurice  ask him to come down he said  ask bertie to come here she reechoed  yesif he wants to  isabel paused for a few moments  i know he wants tohed only be too glad she replied but what about you maurice how would you like it  i should like it  wellin that casebut i thought you didnt care for him  oh i dont know i might think differently of him now the blind man replied it was rather abstruse to isabel  well dear she said if youre quite sure  im sure enough let him come said maurice  so bertie was coming coming this evening in the november rain and darkness isabel was agitated racked with her old restlessness and indecision she had always suffered from this pain of doubt just an agonizing sense of uncertainty it had begun to pass off in the lethargy of maternity now it returned and she resented it she struggled as usual to maintain her calm composed friendly bearing a sort of mask she wore over all her body  a woman had lighted a tall lamp beside the table and spread the cloth the long diningroom was dim with its elegant but rather severe pieces of old furniture only the round table glowed softly under the light it had a rich beautiful effect the white cloth glistened and dropped its heavy pointed lace corners almost to the carpet the china was old and handsome creamyyellow with a blotched pattern of harsh red and deep blue the cups large and bellshaped the teapot gallant isabel looked at it with superficial appreciation  her nerves were hurting her she looked automatically again at the high uncurtained windows in the last dusk she could just perceive outside a huge firtree swaying its boughs it was as if she thought it rather than saw it the rain came flying on the window panes ah why had she no peace these two men why did they tear at her why did they not comewhy was there this suspense  she sat in a lassitude that was really suspense and irritation maurice at least might come inthere was nothing to keep him out she rose to her feet catching sight of her reflection in a mirror she glanced at herself with a slight smile of recognition as if she were an old friend to herself her face was oval and calm her nose a little arched her neck made a beautiful line down to her shoulder with hair knotted loosely behind she had something of a warm maternal look thinking this of herself she arched her eyebrows and her rather heavy eyelids with a little flicker of a smile and for a moment her grey eyes looked amused and wicked a little sardonic out of her transfigured madonna face  then resuming her air of womanly patienceshe was really fatally selfdeterminedshe went with a little jerk towards the door her eyes were slightly reddened  she passed down the wide hall and through a door at the end then she was in the farm premises the scent of dairy and of farmkitchen and of farmyard and of leather almost overcame her but particularly the scent of dairy they had been scalding out the pans the flagged passage in front of her was dark puddled and wet light came out from the open kitchen door she went forward and stood in the doorway the farmpeople were at tea seated at a little distance from her round a long narrow table in the centre of which stood a white lamp ruddy faces ruddy hands holding food red mouths working heads bent over the teacups men landgirls boys it was teatime feedingtime some faces caught sight of her mrs wernham going round behind the chairs with a large black teapot halting slightly in her walk was not aware of her for a moment then she turned suddenly  oh is it madam she exclaimed come in then come in were at tea and she dragged forward a chair  no i wont come in said isabel im afraid i interrupt your meal  nononot likely madam not likely  hasnt mr pervin come in do you know  im sure i couldnt say missed him have you madam  no i only wanted him to come in laughed isabel as if shyly  wanted him did ye get you boyget up now  mrs wernham knocked one of the boys on the shoulder he began to scrape to his feet chewing largely  i believe hes in top stable said another face from the table  ah no dont get up im going myself said isabel  dont you go out of a dirty night like this let the lad go get along wi ye boy said mrs wernham  no no said isabel with a decision that was always obeyed go on with your tea tom id like to go across to the stable mrs wernham  did ever you hear tell exclaimed the woman  isnt the trap late asked isabel  why no said mrs wernham peering into the distance at the tall dim clock no madamwe can give it another quarter or twenty minutes yet goodyes every bit of a quarter  ah it seems late when darkness falls so early said isabel  it do that it do bother the days that they draw in so answered mrs wernham proper miserable  they are said isabel withdrawing  she pulled on her overshoes wrapped a large tartan shawl around her put on a mans felt hat and ventured out along the causeways of the first yard it was very dark the wind was roaring in the great elms behind the outhouses when she came to the second yard the darkness seemed deeper she was unsure of her footing she wished she had brought a lantern rain blew against her half she liked it half she felt unwilling to battle  she reached at last the just visible door of the stable there was no sign of a light anywhere opening the upper half she looked in into a simple well of darkness the smell of horses and ammonia and of warmth was startling to her in that full night she listened with all her ears but could hear nothing save the night and the stirring of a horse  maurice she called softly and musically though she was afraid mauriceare you there  nothing came from the darkness she knew the rain and wind blew in upon the horses the hot animal life feeling it wrong she entered the stable and drew the lower half of the door shut holding the upper part close she did not stir because she was aware of the presence of the dark hindquarters of the horses though she could not see them and she was afraid something wild stirred in her heart  she listened intensely then she heard a small noise in the distancefar away it seemedthe chink of a pan and a mans voice speaking a brief word it would be maurice in the other part of the stable she stood motionless waiting for him to come through the partition door the horses were so terrifyingly near to her in the invisible  the loud jarring of the inner doorlatch made her start the door was opened she could hear and feel her husband entering and invisibly passing among the horses near to her in darkness as they were actively intermingled the rather low sound of his voice as he spoke to the horses came velvety to her nerves how near he was and how invisible the darkness seemed to be in a strange swirl of violent life just upon her she turned giddy  her presence of mind made her call quietly and musically  maurice mauricedeaar  yes he answered isabel  she saw nothing and the sound of his voice seemed to touch her  hello she answered cheerfully straining her eyes to see him he was still busy attending to the horses near her but she saw only darkness it made her almost desperate  wont you come in dear she said  yes im coming just half a minute stand overnow traps not come has it  not yet said isabel  his voice was pleasant and ordinary but it had a slight suggestion of the stable to her she wished he would come away whilst he was so utterly invisible she was afraid of him  hows the time he asked  not yet six she replied she disliked to answer into the dark presently he came very near to her and she retreated out of doors  the weather blows in here he said coming steadily forward feeling for the doors she shrank away at last she could dimly see him  bertie wont have much of a drive he said as he closed the doors  he wont indeed said isabel calmly watching the dark shape at the door  give me your arm dear she said  she pressed his arm close to her as she went but she longed to see him to look at him she was nervous he walked erect with face rather lifted but with a curious tentative movement of his powerful muscular legs she could feel the clever careful strong contact of his feet with the earth as she balanced against him for a moment he was a tower of darkness to her as if he rose out of the earth  in the housepassage he wavered and went cautiously with a curious look of silence about him as he felt for the bench then he sat down heavily he was a man with rather sloping shoulders but with heavy limbs powerful legs that seemed to know the earth his head was small usually carried high and light as he bent down to unfasten his gaiters and boots he did not look blind his hair was brown and crisp his hands were large reddish intelligent the veins stood out in the wrists and his thighs and knees seemed massive when he stood up his face and neck were surcharged with blood the veins stood out on his temples she did not look at his blindness  isabel was always glad when they had passed through the dividing door into their own regions of repose and beauty she was a little afraid of him out there in the animal grossness of the back his bearing also changed as he smelt the familiar indefinable odour that pervaded his wifes surroundings a delicate refined scent very faintly spicy perhaps it came from the potpourri bowls  he stood at the foot of the stairs arrested listening she watched him and her heart sickened he seemed to be listening to fate  hes not here yet he said ill go up and change  maurice she said youre not wishing he wouldnt come are you  i couldnt quite say he answered i feel myself rather on the qui vive  i can see you are she answered and she reached up and kissed his cheek she saw his mouth relax into a slow smile  what are you laughing at she said roguishly  you consoling me he answered  nay she answered why should i console you you know we love each otheryou know how married we are what does anything else matter  nothing at all my dear  he felt for her face and touched it smiling  youre all right arent you he asked anxiously  im wonderfully all right love she answered its you i am a little troubled about at times  why me he said touching her cheeks delicately with the tips of his fingers the touch had an almost hypnotizing effect on her  he went away upstairs she saw him mount into the darkness unseeing and unchanging he did not know that the lamps on the upper corridor were unlighted he went on into the darkness with unchanging step she heard him in the bathroom  pervin moved about almost unconsciously in his familiar surroundings dark though everything was he seemed to know the presence of objects before he touched them it was a pleasure to him to rock thus through a world of things carried on the flood in a sort of bloodprescience he did not think much or trouble much so long as he kept this sheer immediacy of bloodcontact with the substantial world he was happy he wanted no intervention of visual consciousness in this state there was a certain rich positivity bordering sometimes on rapture life seemed to move in him like a tide lapping and advancing enveloping all things darkly it was a pleasure to stretch forth the hand and meet the unseen object clasp it and possess it in pure contact he did not try to remember to visualize he did not want to the new way of consciousness substituted itself in him  the rich suffusion of this state generally kept him happy reaching its culmination in the consuming passion for his wife but at times the flow would seem to be checked and thrown back then it would beat inside him like a tangled sea and he was tortured in the shattered chaos of his own blood he grew to dread this arrest this throwback this chaos inside himself when he seemed merely at the mercy of his own powerful and conflicting elements how to get some measure of control or surety this was the question and when the question rose maddening in him he would clench his fists as if he would compel the whole universe to submit to him but it was in vain he could not even compel himself  tonight however he was still serene though little tremors of unreasonable exasperation ran through him he had to handle the razor very carefully as he shaved for it was not at one with him he was afraid of it his hearing also was too much sharpened he heard the woman lighting the lamps on the corridor and attending to the fire in the visitors room and then as he went to his room he heard the trap arrive then came isabels voice lifted and calling like a bell ringing  is it you bertie have you come  and a mans voice answered out of the wind  hello isabell there you are  have you had a miserable drive im so sorry we couldnt send a closed carriage i cant see you at all you know  im coming no i liked the driveit was like perthshire well how are you youre looking fit as ever as far as i can see  oh yes said isabel im wonderfully well how are you rather thin i think  worked to deatheverybodys old cry but im all right ciss hows pervinisnt he here  oh yes hes upstairs changing yes hes awfully well take off your wet things ill send them to be dried  and how are you both in spirits he doesnt fret  nono not at all no on the contrary really weve been wonderfully happy incredibly its more than i can understandso wonderful the nearness and the peace  ah well thats awfully good news  they moved away pervin heard no more but a childish sense of desolation had come over him as he heard their brisk voices he seemed shut outlike a child that is left out he was aimless and excluded he did not know what to do with himself the helpless desolation came over him he fumbled nervously as he dressed himself in a state almost of childishness he disliked the scotch accent in berties speech and the slight response it found on isabels tongue he disliked the slight purr of complacency in the scottish speech he disliked intensely the glib way in which isabel spoke of their happiness and nearness it made him recoil he was fretful and beside himself like a child he had almost a childish nostalgia to be included in the life circle and at the same time he was a man dark and powerful and infuriated by his own weakness by some fatal flaw he could not be by himself he had to depend on the support of another and this very dependence enraged him he hated bertie reid and at the same time he knew the hatred was nonsense he knew it was the outcome of his own weakness  he went downstairs isabel was alone in the diningroom she watched him enter head erect his feet tentative he looked so strongblooded and healthy and at the same time cancelled cancelledthat was the word that flew across her mind perhaps it was his scars suggested it  you heard bertie come maurice she said  yesisnt he here  hes in his room he looks very thin and worn  i suppose he works himself to death  a woman came in with a trayand after a few minutes bertie came down he was a little dark man with a very big forehead thin wispy hair and sad large eyes his expression was inordinately sadalmost funny he had odd short legs  isabel watched him hesitate under the door and glance nervously at her husband pervin heard him and turned  here you are now said isabel come let us eat  bertie went across to maurice  how are you pervin he said as he advanced  the blind man stuck his hand out into space and bertie took it  very fit glad youve come said maurice  isabel glanced at them and glanced away as if she could not bear to see them  come she said come to table arent you both awfully hungry i am tremendously  im afraid you waited for me said bertie as they sat down  maurice had a curious monolithic way of sitting in a chair erect and distant isabels heart always beat when she caught sight of him thus  no she replied to bertie were very little later than usual were having a sort of high tea not dinner do you mind it gives us such a nice long evening uninterrupted  i like it said bertie  maurice was feeling with curious little movements almost like a cat kneading her bed for his place his knife and fork his napkin he was getting the whole geography of his cover into his consciousness he sat erect and inscrutable remoteseeming bertie watched the static figure of the blind man the delicate tactile discernment of the large ruddy hands and the curious mindless silence of the brow above the scar with difficulty he looked away and without knowing what he did picked up a little crystal bowl of violets from the table and held them to his nose  they are sweetscented he said where do they come from  from the gardenunder the windows said isabel  so late in the yearand so fragrant do you remember the violets under aunt bells south wall  the two friends looked at each other and exchanged a smile isabels eyes lighting up  dont i she replied wasnt she queer  a curious old girl laughed bertie theres a streak of freakishness in the family isabel  ahbut not in you and me bertie said isabel give them to maurice will you she added as bertie was putting down the flowers have you smelled the violets dear dothey are so scented  maurice held out his hand and bertie placed the tiny bowl against his large warmlooking fingers maurices hand closed over the thin white fingers of the barrister bertie carefully extricated himself then the two watched the blind man smelling the violets he bent his head and seemed to be thinking isabel waited  arent they sweet maurice she said at last anxiously  very he said and he held out the bowl bertie took it both he and isabel were a little afraid and deeply disturbed  the meal continued isabel and bertie chatted spasmodically the blind man was silent he touched his food repeatedly with quick delicate touches of his knifepoint then cut irregular bits he could not bear to be helped both isabel and bertie suffered isabel wondered why she did not suffer when she was alone with maurice bertie made her conscious of a strangeness  after the meal the three drew their chairs to the fire and sat down to talk the decanters were put on a table near at hand isabel knocked the logs on the fire and clouds of brilliant sparks went up the chimney bertie noticed a slight weariness in her bearing  you will be glad when your child comes now isabel he said  she looked up to him with a quick wan smile  yes i shall be glad she answered it begins to seem long yes i shall be very glad so will you maurice wont you she added  yes i shall replied her husband  we are both looking forward so much to having it she said  yes of course said bertie  he was a bachelor three or four years older than isabel he lived in beautiful rooms overlooking the river guarded by a faithful scottish manservant and he had his friends among the fair sexnot lovers friends so long as he could avoid any danger of courtship or marriage he adored a few good women with constant and unfailing homage and he was chivalrously fond of quite a number but if they seemed to encroach on him he withdrew and detested them  isabel knew him very well knew his beautiful constancy and kindness also his incurable weakness which made him unable ever to enter into close contact of any sort he was ashamed of himself because he could not marry could not approach women physically he wanted to do so but he could not at the centre of him he was afraid helplessly and even brutally afraid he had given up hope had ceased to expect any more that he could escape his own weakness hence he was a brilliant and successful barrister also littérateur of high repute a rich man and a great social success at the centre he felt himself neuter nothing  isabel knew him well she despised him even while she admired him she looked at his sad face his little short legs and felt contempt of him she looked at his dark grey eyes with their uncanny almost childlike intuition and she loved him he understood amazinglybut she had no fear of his understanding as a man she patronized him  and she turned to the impassive silent figure of her husband he sat leaning back with folded arms and face a little uptilted his knees were straight and massive she sighed picked up the poker and again began to prod the fire to rouse the clouds of soft brilliant sparks  isabel tells me bertie began suddenly that you have not suffered unbearably from the loss of sight  maurice straightened himself to attend but kept his arms folded  no he said not unbearably now and again one struggles against it you know but there are compensations  they say it is much worse to be stone deaf said isabel  i believe it is said bertie are there compensations he added to maurice  yes you cease to bother about a great many things again maurice stretched his figure stretched the strong muscles of his back and leaned backwards with uplifted face  and that is a relief said bertie but what is there in place of the bothering what replaces the activity  there was a pause at length the blind man replied as out of a negligent unattentive thinking  oh i dont know theres a good deal when youre not active  is there said bertie what exactly it always seems to me that when there is no thought and no action there is nothing  again maurice was slow in replying  there is something he replied i couldnt tell you what it is  and the talk lapsed once more isabel and bertie chatting gossip and reminiscence the blind man silent  at length maurice rose restlessly a big obtrusive figure he felt tight and hampered he wanted to go away  do you mind he said if i go and speak to wernham  nogo along dear said isabel  and he went out a silence came over the two friends at length bertie said  nevertheless it is a great deprivation cissie  it is bertie i know it is  something lacking all the time said bertie  yes i know and yetand yetmaurice is right there is something else something there which you never knew was there and which you cant express  what is there asked bertie  i dont knowits awfully hard to define itbut something strong and immediate theres something strange in maurices presenceindefinablebut i couldnt do without it i agree that it seems to put ones mind to sleep but when were alone i miss nothing it seems awfully rich almost splendid you know  im afraid i dont follow said bertie  they talked desultorily the wind blew loudly outside rain chattered on the windowpanes making a sharp drumsound because of the closed mellowgolden shutters inside the logs burned slowly with hot almost invisible small flames bertie seemed uneasy there were dark circles round his eyes isabel rich with her approaching maternity leaned looking into the fire her hair curled in odd loose strands very pleasing to the man but she had a curious feeling of old woe in her heart old timeless nightwoe  i suppose were all deficient somewhere said bertie  i suppose so said isabel wearily  damned sooner or later  i dont know she said rousing herself i feel quite all right you know the child coming seems to make me indifferent to everything just placid i cant feel that theres anything to trouble about you know  a good thing i should say he replied slowly  well there it is i suppose its just nature if only i felt i neednt trouble about maurice i should be perfectly content  but you feel you must trouble about him  welli dont know she even resented this much effort  the evening passed slowly isabel looked at the clock i say she said its nearly ten oclock where can maurice be im sure theyre all in bed at the back excuse me a moment  she went out returning almost immediately  its all shut up and in darkness she said i wonder where he is he must have gone out to the farm  bertie looked at her  i suppose hell come in he said  i suppose so she said but its unusual for him to be out now  would you like me to go out and see  wellif you wouldnt mind id go but she did not want to make the physical effort  bertie put on an old overcoat and took a lantern he went out from the side door he shrank from the wet and roaring night such weather had a nervous effect on him too much moisture everywhere made him feel almost imbecile unwilling he went through it all a dog barked violently at him he peered in all the buildings at last as he opened the upper door of a sort of intermediate barn he heard a grinding noise and looking in holding up his lantern saw maurice in his shirtsleeves standing listening holding the handle of a turnippulper he had been pulping sweet roots a pile of which lay dimly heaped in a corner behind him  that you wernham said maurice listening  no its me said bertie  a large halfwild grey cat was rubbing at maurices leg the blind man stooped to rub its sides bertie watched the scene then unconsciously entered and shut the door behind him he was in a high sort of barnplace from which right and left ran off the corridors in front of the stalled cattle he watched the slow stooping motion of the other man as he caressed the great cat  maurice straightened himself  you came to look for me he said  isabel was a little uneasy said bertie  ill come in i like messing about doing these jobs  the cat had reared her sinister feline length against his leg clawing at his thigh affectionately he lifted her claws out of his flesh  i hope im not in your way at all at the grange here said bertie rather shy and stiff  my way no not a bit im glad isabel has somebody to talk to im afraid its i who am in the way i know im not very lively company isabels all right dont you think shes not unhappy is she  i dont think so  what does she say  she says shes very contentonly a little troubled about you  why me  perhaps afraid that you might brood said bertie cautiously  she neednt be afraid of that he continued to caress the flattened grey head of the cat with his fingers what i am a bit afraid of he resumed is that shell find me a dead weight always alone with me down here  i dont think you need think that said bertie though this was what he feared himself  i dont know said maurice sometimes i feel it isnt fair that shes saddled with me then he dropped his voice curiously i say he asked secretly struggling is my face much disfigured do you mind telling me  there is the scar said bertie wondering yes it is a disfigurement but more pitiable than shocking  a pretty bad scar though said maurice  oh yes  there was a pause  sometimes i feel i am horrible said maurice in a low voice talking as if to himself and bertie actually felt a quiver of horror  thats nonsense he said  maurice again straightened himself leaving the cat  theres no telling he said then again in an odd tone he added i dont really know you do i  probably not said bertie  do you mind if i touch you  the lawyer shrank away instinctively and yet out of very philanthropy he said in a small voice not at all  but he suffered as the blind man stretched out a strong naked hand to him maurice accidentally knocked off berties hat  i thought you were taller he said starting then he laid his hand on bertie reids head closing the dome of the skull in a soft firm grasp gathering it as it were then shifting his grasp and softly closing again with a fine close pressure till he had covered the skull and the face of the smaller man tracing the brows and touching the full closed eyes touching the small nose and the nostrils the rough short moustache the mouth the rather strong chin the hand of the blind man grasped the shoulder the arm the hand of the other man he seemed to take him in the soft travelling grasp  you seem young he said quietly at last  the lawyer stood almost annihilated unable to answer  your head seems tender as if you were young maurice repeated so do your hands touch my eyes will youtouch my scar  now bertie quivered with revulsion yet he was under the power of the blind man as if hypnotized he lifted his hand and laid the fingers on the scar on the scarred eyes maurice suddenly covered them with his own hand pressed the fingers of the other man upon his disfigured eyesockets trembling in every fibre and rocking slightly slowly from side to side he remained thus for a minute or more whilst bertie stood as if in a swoon unconscious imprisoned  then suddenly maurice removed the hand of the other man from his brow and stood holding it in his own  oh my god he said we shall know each other now shant we we shall know each other now  bertie could not answer he gazed mute and terrorstruck overcome by his own weakness he knew he could not answer he had an unreasonable fear lest the other man should suddenly destroy him whereas maurice was actually filled with hot poignant love the passion of friendship perhaps it was this very passion of friendship which bertie shrank from most  were all right together now arent we said maurice its all right now as long as we live so far as were concerned  yes said bertie trying by any means to escape  maurice stood with head lifted as if listening the new delicate fulfilment of mortal friendship had come as a revelation and surprise to him something exquisite and unhopedfor he seemed to be listening to hear if it were real  then he turned for his coat  come he said well go to isabel  bertie took the lantern and opened the door the cat disappeared the two men went in silence along the causeways isabel as they came thought their footsteps sounded strange she looked up pathetically and anxiously for their entrance there seemed a curious elation about maurice bertie was haggard with sunken eyes  what is it she asked  weve become friends said maurice standing with his feet apart like a strange colossus  friends reechoed isabel and she looked again at bertie he met her eyes with a furtive haggard look his eyes were as if glazed with misery  im so glad she said in sheer perplexity  yes said maurice  he was indeed so glad isabel took his hand with both hers and held it fast  youll be happier now dear she said  but she was watching bertie she knew that he had one desireto escape from this intimacy this friendship which had been thrust upon him he could not bear it that he had been touched by the blind man his insane reserve broken in he was like a mollusk whose shell is broken     monkey nuts   at first joe thought the job ok he was loading hay on the trucks along with albert the corporal the two men were pleasantly billeted in a cottage not far from the station they were their own masters for joe never thought of albert as a master and the little sidings of the tiny village station was as pleasant a place as you could wish for on one side beyond the line stretched the woods on the other the near side across a green smooth field red houses were dotted among flowering apple trees the weather being sunny work being easy albert a real good pal what life could be better after flanders it was heaven itself  albert the corporal was a cleanshaven shrewdlooking fellow of about forty he seemed to think his one aim in life was to be full of fun and nonsense in repose his face looked a little withered old he was a very good pal to joe steady decent and grave under all his mischief for his mischief was only his laborious way of skirting his own ennui  joe was much younger than albertonly twentythree he was a tallish quiet youth pleasant looking he was of a slightly better class than his corporal more personable careful about his appearance he shaved every day i havent got much of a face said albert if i was to shave every day like you joe i should have none  there was plenty of life in the little goodsyard three porter youths a continual come and go of farm wagons bringing hay wagons with timber from the woods coal carts loading at the trucks the black coal seemed to make the place sleepier hotter round the big white gate the stationmasters children played and his white chickens walked whilst the stationmaster himself a young man getting too fat helped his wife to peg out the washing on the clothes line in the meadow  the great boatshaped wagons came up from playcross with the hay at first the farmmen waggoned it on the third day one of the landgirls appeared with the first load drawing to a standstill easily at the head of her two great horses she was a buxom girl young in linen overalls and gaiters her face was ruddy she had large blue eyes  now thats the waggoner for us boys said the corporal loudly  whoa she said to her horses and then to the corporal which boys do you mean  we are the pick of the bunch thats joe my pal dont you let on that my names albert said the corporal to his private im the corporal  and im miss stokes said the landgirl coolly if thats all the boys you are  you know you couldnt want more miss stokes said albert politely joe who was bareheaded whose grey flannel sleeves were rolled up to the elbow and whose shirt was open at the breast looked modestly aside as if he had no part in the affair  are you on this job regular then said the corporal to miss stokes  i dont know for sure she said pushing a piece of hair under her hat and attending to her splendid horses  oh make it a certainty said albert  she did not reply she turned and looked over the two men coolly she was pretty moderately blonde with crisp hair a good skin and large blue eyes she was strong too and the work went on leisurely and easily  now said the corporal stopping as usual to look round pleasant company makes work a pleasuredont hurry it boys he stood on the truck surveying the world that was one of his great and absorbing occupations to stand and look out on things in general joe also standing on the truck also turned round to look what was to be seen but he could not become blankly absorbed as albert could  miss stokes watched the two men from under her broad felt hat she had seen hundreds of alberts khaki soldiers standing in loose attitudes absorbed in watching nothing in particular she had seen also a good many joes quiet goodlooking young soldiers with halfaverted faces but there was something in the turn of joes head and something in his quiet tenderlooking form young and freshwhich attracted her eye as she watched him closely from below he turned as if he felt her and his darkblue eye met her straight lightblue gaze he faltered and turned aside again and looked as if he were going to fall off the truck a slight flush mounted under the girls full ruddy face she liked him  always after this when she came into the sidings with her team it was joe she looked for she acknowledged to herself that she was sweet on him but albert did all the talking he was so full of fun and nonsense joe was a very shy bird very brief and remote in his answers miss stokes was driven to indulge in repartee with albert but she fixed her magnetic attention on the younger fellow joe would talk with albert and laugh at his jokes but miss stokes could get little out of him she had to depend on her silent forces they were more effective than might be imagined  suddenly on saturday afternoon at about two oclock joe received a bolt from the bluea telegram meet me belbury station 600 pm today ms he knew at once who ms was his heart melted he felt weak as if he had had a blow  whats the trouble boy asked albert anxiously  nono troubleits to meet somebody joe lifted his darkblue eyes in confusion towards his corporal  meet somebody repeated the corporal watching his young pal with keen blue eyes its all right then nothing wrong  nonothing wrong im not going said joe  albert was old and shrewd enough to see that nothing more should be said before the housewife he also saw that joe did not want to take him into confidence so he held his peace though he was piqued  the two soldiers went into town smartened up albert knew a fair number of the boys round about there would be plenty of gossip in the marketplace plenty of lounging in groups on the bath road watching the saturday evening shoppers then a modest drink or two and the movies they passed an agreeable casual nothinginparticular evening with which joe was quite satisfied he thought of belbury station and of ms waiting there he had not the faintest intention of meeting her and he had not the faintest intention of telling albert  and yet when the two men were in their bedroom half undressed joe suddenly held out the telegram to his corporal saying what dyou think of that  albert was just unbuttoning his braces he desisted took the telegram form and turned towards the candle to read it  meet me belbury station 600 pm today ms he read sotto voce his face took on its funandnonsense look  whos ms he asked looking shrewdly at joe  you know as well as i do said joe noncommittal  ms repeated albert blamed if i know boy is it a woman  the conversation was carried on in tiny voices for fear of disturbing the householders  i dont know said joe turning he looked full at albert the two men looked straight into each others eyes there was a lurking grin in each of them  well imblamed said albert at last throwing the telegram down emphatically on the bed  whaat said joe grinning rather sheepishly his eyes clouded none the less  albert sat on the bed and proceeded to undress nodding his head with mock gravity all the while joe watched him foolishly  what he repeated faintly  albert looked up at him with a knowing look  if that isnt coming it quick boy he said what the blazes what ha you bin doing  nothing said joe  albert slowly shook his head as he sat on the side of the bed  dont happen to me when ive bin doin nothing he said and he proceeded to pull off his stockings  joe turned away looking at himself in the mirror as he unbuttoned his tunic  you didnt want to keep the appointment albert asked in a changed voice from the bedside  joe did not answer for a moment then he said  i made no appointment  im not saying you did boy dont be nasty about it i mean you didnt want to answer theunknown persons summonsshall i put it that way  no said joe  what was the deterring motive asked albert who was now lying on his back in bed  oh said joe suddenly looking round rather haughtily i didnt want to he had a wellbalanced head and could take on a sudden distant bearing  didnt want todidnt cotton on like wellthey be artful the women he mimicked his landlord come on into bed boy dont loiter about as if youd lost something  albert turned over to sleep  on monday miss stokes turned up as usual striding beside her team her whoa was resonant and challenging she looked up at the truck as her steeds came to a standstill joe had turned aside and had his face averted from her she glanced him oversave for his slender succulent tenderness she would have despised him she sized him up in a steady look then she turned to albert who was looking down at her and smiling in his mischievous turn she knew his aspects by now she looked straight back at him though her eyes were hot he saluted her  beautiful morning miss stokes  very she replied  handsome is as handsome looks said albert  which produced no response  now joe come on here said the corporal dont keep the ladies waitingits the sign of a weak heart  joe turned and the work began nothing more was said for the time being as the week went on all parties became more comfortable joe remained silent averted neutral a little on his dignity miss stokes was offhand and masterful albert was full of mischief  the great theme was a circus which was coming to the market town on the following saturday  youll go to the circus miss stokes said albert  i may go are you going  certainly give us the pleasure of escorting you  no thanks  thats what i call a flat refusalwhat joe you dont mean that you have no liking for our company miss stokes  oh i dont know said miss stokes how many are there of you  only me and joe  oh is that all she said satirically  albert was a little nonplussed  isnt that enough for you he asked  too many by half blurted out joe jeeringly in a sudden fit of uncouth rudeness that made both the others stare  oh ill stand out of the way boy if thats it said albert to joe then he turned mischievously to miss stokes he wants to know what m stands for he said confidentially  monkeys she replied turning to her horses  whats ms said albert  monkey nuts she retorted leading off her team  albert looked after her a little discomfited joe had flushed dark and cursed albert in his heart  on the saturday afternoon the two soldiers took the train into town they would have to walk home they had tea at six oclock and lounged about till half past seven the circus was in a meadow near the rivera great redandwhite striped tent caravans stood at the side a great crowd of people was gathered round the ticketcaravan  inside the tent the lamps were lighted shining on a ring of faces a great circular bank of faces round the green grassy centre along with some comrades the two soldiers packed themselves on a thin plank seat rather high they were delighted with the flaring lights the wild effect but the circus performance did not affect them deeply they admired the lady in black velvet with rosepurple legs who leapt so neatly on to the galloping horse they watched the feats of strength and laughed at the clown but they felt a little patronizing they missed the sensational drama of the cinema  halfway through the performance joe was electrified to see the face of miss stokes not very far from him there she was in her khaki and her felt hat as usual he pretended not to see her she was laughing at the clown she also pretended not to see him it was a blow to him and it made him angry he would not even mention it to albert least said soonest mended he liked to believe she had not seen him but he knew fatally that she had  when they came out it was nearly eleven oclock a lovely night with a moon and tall dark noble trees a magnificent may night joe and albert laughed and chaffed with the boys joe looked round frequently to see if he were safe from miss stokes it seemed so  but there were six miles to walk home at last the two soldiers set off swinging their canes the road was white between tall hedges other stragglers were passing out of the town towards the villages the air was full of pleased excitement  they were drawing near to the village when they saw a dark figure ahead joes heart sank with pure fear it was a figure wheeling a bicycle a land girl miss stokes albert was ready with his nonsense miss stokes had a puncture  let me wheel the rattler said albert  thank you said miss stokes you are kind  oh id be kinder than that if youd show me how said albert  are you sure said miss stokes  doubt my words said albert thats cruel of you miss stokes  miss stokes walked between them close to joe  have you been to the circus she asked him  yes he replied mildly  have you been albert asked her  yes i didnt see you she replied  whatyou say so didnt see us didnt think us worth looking at began albert arent i as handsome as the clown now and you didnt as much as glance in our direction i call it a downright oversight  i never saw you reiterated miss stokes i didnt know you saw me  that makes it worse said albert  the road passed through a belt of dark pinewood the village and the branch road was very near miss stokes put out her fingers and felt for joes hand as it swung at his side to say he was staggered is to put it mildly yet he allowed her softly to clasp his fingers for a few moments but he was a mortified youth  at the crossroad they stoppedmiss stokes should turn off she had another mile to go  youll let us see you home said albert  do me a kindness she said put my bike in your shed and take it to bakers on monday will you  ill sit up all night and mend it for you if you like  no thanks and joe and ill walk on  ohho ohho sang albert joe joe what do you say to that now boy arent you in lucks way and i get the bloomin old bike for my pal consider it again miss stokes  joe turned aside his face and did not speak  oh well i wheel the grid do i i leave you boy  im not keen on going any further barked out joe in an uncouth voice she haint my choice  the girl stood silent and watched the two men  there now said albert think o that if it was me now but he was uncomfortable well miss stokes have me he added  miss stokes stood quite still neither moved nor spoke and so the three remained for some time at the lane end at last joe began kicking the groundthen he suddenly lifted his face at that moment miss stokes was at his side she put her arm delicately round his waist  seems im the one extra dont you think albert inquired of the high bland moon  joe had dropped his head and did not answer miss stokes stood with her arm lightly round his waist albert bowed saluted and bade goodnight he walked away leaving the two standing  miss stokes put a light pressure on joes waist and drew him down the road they walked in silence the night was full of scentwild cherry the first bluebells still they walked in silence a nightingale was singing they approached nearer and nearer till they stood close by his dark bush the powerful notes sounded from the cover almost like flashes of lightthen the interval of silencethen the moaning notes almost like a dog faintly howling followed by the long rich trill and flashing notes then a short silence again  miss stokes turned at last to joe she looked up at him and in the moonlight he saw her faintly smiling he felt maddened but helpless her arm was round his waist she drew him closely to her with a soft pressure that made all his bones rotten  meanwhile albert was waiting at home he put on his overcoat for the fire was out and he had had malarial fever he looked fitfully at the daily mirror and the daily sketch but he saw nothing it seemed a long time he began to yawn widely even to nod at last joe came in  albert looked at him keenly the young mans brow was black his face sullen  all right boy asked albert  joe merely grunted for a reply there was nothing more to be got out of him so they went to bed  next day joe was silent sullen albert could make nothing of him he proposed a walk after tea  im going somewhere said joe  wheremonkey nuts asked the corporal but joes brow only became darker  so the days went by almost every evening joe went off alone returning late he was sullen taciturn and had a hangdog look a curious way of dropping his head and looking dangerously from under his brows and he and albert did not get on so well any more with one another for all his fun and nonsense albert was really irritable soon made angry and joes standoffish sulkiness and complete lack of confidence riled him got on his nerves his fun and nonsense took a biting sarcastic turn at which joes eyes glittered occasionally though the young man turned unheeding aside then again joe would be full of odd whimsical fun outshining albert himself  miss stokes still came to the station with the wain monkeynuts albert called her though not to her face for she was very clear and goodlooking almost she seemed to gleam and albert was a tiny bit afraid of her she very rarely addressed joe whilst the hayloading was going on and that young man always turned his back to her he seemed thinner and his limber figure looked more slouching but still it had the tender attractive appearance especially from behind his tanned face a little thinned and darkened took a handsome slightly sinister look  come on joe the corporal urged sharply one day whatre you doing boy looking for beetles on the bank  joe turned round swiftly almost menacing to work  hes a different fellow these days miss stokes said albert to the young woman whats got him is it monkey nuts that dont suit him do you think  choked with chaff more like she retorted its as bad as feeding a threshing machine to have to listen to some folks  as bad as what said albert you dont mean me do you miss stokes  no she cried i dont mean you  joes face became dark red during these sallies but he said nothing he would eye the young woman curiously as she swung so easily at the work and he had some of the look of a dog which is going to bite  albert with his nerves on edge began to find the strain rather severe the next saturday evening when joe came in more blackbrowed than ever he watched him determined to have it out with him  when the boy went upstairs to bed the corporal followed him he closed the door behind him carefully sat on the bed and watched the younger man undressing and for once he spoke in a natural voice neither chaffing nor commanding  whats gone wrong boy  joe stopped a moment as if he had been shot then he went on unwinding his puttees and did not answer or look up  you can hear cant you said albert nettled  yes i can hear said joe stooping over his puttees till his face was purple  then why dont you answer  joe sat up he gave a long sideways look at the corporal then he lifted his eyes and stared at a crack in the ceiling  the corporal watched these movements shrewdly  and then what he asked ironically  again joe turned and stared him in the face the corporal smiled very slightly but kindly  therell be murder done one of these days said joe in a quiet unimpassioned voice  so long as its by daylight replied albert then he went over sat down by joe put his hand on his shoulder affectionately and continued what is it boy whats gone wrong you can trust me cant you  joe turned and looked curiously at the face so near to his  its nothing thats all he said laconically  albert frowned  then whos going to be murderedand whos going to do the murderingme or youwhich is it boy he smiled gently at the stupid youth looking straight at him all the while into his eyes gradually the stupid hunted glowering look died out of joes eyes he turned his head aside gently as one rousing from a spell  i dont want her he said with fierce resentment  then you neednt have her said albert what do you go for boy  but it wasnt as simple as all that joe made no remark  shes a smartlooking girl whats wrong with her my boy i should have thought you were a lucky chap myself  i dont want er joe barked with ferocity and resentment  then tell her so and have done said albert he waited awhile there was no response why dont you he added  because i dont confessed joe sulkily  albert ponderedrubbed his head  youre too softhearted thats where it is boy you want your mettle dipping in cold water to temper it youre too softhearted  he laid his arm affectionately across the shoulders of the younger man joe seemed to yield a little towards him  when are you going to see her again albert asked for a long time there was no answer  when is it boy persisted the softened voice of the corporal  tomorrow confessed joe  then let me go said albert let me go will you  the morrow was sunday a sunny day but a cold evening the sky was grey the new foliage very green but the air was chill and depressing albert walked briskly down the white road towards beeley he crossed a larch plantation and followed a narrow byroad where blue speedwell flowers fell from the banks into the dust he walked swinging his cane with mixed sensations then having gone a certain length he turned and began to walk in the opposite direction  so he saw a young woman approaching him she was wearing a wide hat of grey straw and a loose swinging dress of niggergrey velvet she walked with slow inevitability albert faltered a little as he approached her then he saluted her and his roguish slightly withered skin flushed she was staring straight into his face  he fell in by her side saying impudently  not so nice for a walk as it was is it  she only stared at him he looked back at her  youve seen me before you know he said grinning slightly perhaps you never noticed me oh im quite nice looking in a quiet way you know what  but miss stokes did not speak she only stared with large icy blue eyes at him he became selfconscious lifted up his chin walked with his nose in the air and whistled at random so they went down the quiet deserted grey lane he was whistling the air im gilbert the filbert the colonel of the nuts  at last she found her voice  wheres joe  he thought youd like a change they say varietys the salt of lifethats why im mostly in pickle  where is he  am i my brothers keeper hes gone his own ways  where  nay how am i to know not so far but hell be back for supper  she stopped in the middle of the lane he stopped facing her  wheres joe she asked  he struck a careless attitude looked down the road this way and that lifted his eyebrows pushed his khaki cap on one side and answered  he is not conducting the service tonight he asked me if id officiate  why hasnt he come  didnt want to i expect i wanted to  she stared him up and down and he felt uncomfortable in his spine but maintained his air of nonchalance then she turned slowly on her heel and started to walk back the corporal went at her side  youre not going back are you he pleaded why me and you we should get on like a house on fire  she took no heed but walked on he went uncomfortably at her side making his funny remarks from time to time but she was as if stone deaf he glanced at her and to his dismay saw the tears running down her cheeks he stopped suddenly and pushed back his cap  i say you know he began  but she was walking on like an automaton and he had to hurry after her  she never spoke to him at the gate of her farm she walked straight in as if he were not there he watched her disappear then he turned on his heel cursing silently puzzled lifting off his cap to scratch his head  that night when they were in bed he remarked say joe boy strikes me youre welloff without monkey nuts gord love us beans aint in it  so they slept in amity but they waited with some anxiety for the morrow  it was a cold morning a grey sky shifting in a cold wind and threatening rain they watched the wagon come up the road and through the yard gates miss stokes was with her team as usual her whoa rang out like a warwhoop  she faced up at the truck where the two men stood  joe she called to the averted figure which stood up in the wind  what he turned unwillingly  she made a queer movement lifting her head slightly in a sipping halfinviting halfcommanding gesture and joe was crouching already to jump off the truck to obey her when albert put his hand on his shoulder  half a minute boy where are you off works work and nuts is nuts you stop here  joe slowly straightened himself  joe came the womans clear call from below  again joe looked at her but alberts hand was on his shoulder detaining him he stood half averted with his tail between his legs  take your hand off him you said miss stokes  yes major retorted albert satirically  she stood and watched  joe her voice rang for the third time  joe turned and looked at her and a slow jeering smile gathered on his face  monkey nuts he replied in a tone mocking her call  she turned whitedead white the men thought she would fall albert began yelling to the porters up the line to come and help with the load he could yell like any noncommissioned officer upon occasion  some way or other the wagon was unloaded the girl was gone joe and his corporal looked at one another and smiled slowly but they had a weight on their minds they were afraid  they were reassured however when they found that miss stokes came no more with the hay as far as they were concerned she had vanished into oblivion and joe felt more relieved even than he had felt when he heard the firing cease after the news had come that the armistice was signed     wintry peacock   there was thin crisp snow on the ground the sky was blue the wind very cold the air clear farmers were just turning out the cows for an hour or so in the midday and the smell of cowsheds was unendurable as i entered tible i noticed the ashtwigs up in the sky were pale and luminous passing into the blue and then i saw the peacocks there they were in the road before me three of them and tailless brown speckled birds with darkblue necks and ragged crests they stepped archly over the filigree snow and their bodies moved with slow motion like small light flatbottomed boats i admired them they were curious then a gust of wind caught them heeled them over as if they were three frail boats opening their feathers like ragged sails they hopped and skipped with discomfort to get out of the draught of the wind and then in the lee of the walls they resumed their arch wintry motion light and unballasted now their tails were gone indifferent they were indifferent to my presence i might have touched them they turned off to the shelter of an open shed  as i passed the end of the upper house i saw a young woman just coming out of the back door i had spoken to her in the summer she recognized me at once and waved to me she was carrying a pail wearing a white apron that was longer than her preposterously short skirt and she had on the cotton bonnet i took off my hat to her and was going on but she put down her pail and darted with a swift furtive movement after me  do you mind waiting a minute she said ill be out in a minute  she gave me a slight odd smile and ran back her face was long and sallow and her nose rather red but her gloomy black eyes softened caressively to me for a moment with that momentary humility which makes a man lord of the earth  i stood in the road looking at the fluffy darkred young cattle that mooed and seemed to bark at me they seemed happy frisky cattle a little impudent and either determined to go back into the warm shed or determined not to go back i could not decide which  presently the woman came forward again her head rather ducked but she looked up at me and smiled with that odd immediate intimacy something witchlike and impossible  sorry to keep you waiting she said shall we stand in this cartshedit will be more out of the wind  so we stood among the shafts of the open cartshed that faced the road then she looked down at the ground a little sideways and i noticed a small black frown on her brows she seemed to brood for a moment then she looked straight into my eyes so that i blinked and wanted to turn my face aside she was searching me for something and her look was too near the frown was still on her keen sallow brow  can you speak french she asked me abruptly  more or less i replied  i was supposed to learn it at school she said but i dont know a word she ducked her head and laughed with a slightly ugly grimace and a rolling of her black eyes  no good keeping your mind full of scraps i answered  but she had turned aside her sallow long face and did not hear what i said suddenly again she looked at me she was searching and at the same time she smiled at me and her eyes looked softly darkly with infinite trustful humility into mine i was being cajoled  would you mind reading a letter for me in french she said her face immediately black and bitterlooking she glanced at me frowning  not at all i said  its a letter to my husband she said still scrutinizing  i looked at her and didnt quite realize she looked too far into me my wits were gone she glanced round then she looked at me shrewdly she drew a letter from her pocket and handed it to me it was addressed from france to lancecorporal goyte at tible i took out the letter and began to read it as mere words mon cher alfredit might have been a bit of a torn newspaper so i followed the script the trite phrases of a letter from a frenchspeaking girl to an english soldier i think of you always always do you think sometimes of me and then i vaguely realized that i was reading a mans private correspondence and yet how could one consider these trivial facile french phrases private nothing more trite and vulgar in the world than such a loveletterno newspaper more obvious  therefore i read with a callous heart the effusions of the belgian damsel but then i gathered my attention for the letter went on notre cher petit bébéour dear little baby was born a week ago almost i died knowing you were far away and perhaps forgetting the fruit of our perfect love but the child comforted me he has the smiling eyes and virile air of his english father i pray to the mother of jesus to send me the dear father of my child that i may see him with my child in his arms and that we may be united in holy family love ah my alfred can i tell you how i miss you how i weep for you my thoughts are with you always i think of nothing but you i live for nothing but you and our dear baby if you do not come back to me soon i shall die and our child will die but no you cannot come back to me but i can come to you come to england with our child if you do not wish to present me to your good mother and father you can meet me in some town some city for i shall be so frightened to be alone in england with my child and no one to take care of us yet i must come to you i must bring my child my little alfred to his father the big beautiful alfred that i love so much oh write and tell me where i shall come i have some money i am not a penniless creature i have money for myself and my dear baby  i read to the end it was signed your very happy and still more unhappy Élise i suppose i must have been smiling  i can see it makes you laugh said mrs goyte sardonically i looked up at her  its a loveletter i know that she said theres too many alfreds in it  one too many i said  oh yesand what does she sayeliza we know her names eliza thats another thing she grimaced a little looking up at me with a mocking laugh  where did you get this letter i said  postman gave it me last week  and is your husband at home  i expect him home tonight hes been wounded you know and weve been applying for him home he was home about six weeks agohes been in scotland since then oh he was wounded in the leg yes hes all right a great strapping fellow but hes lame he limps a bit he expects hell get his dischargebut i dont think he will we married weve been married six yearsand he joined up the first day of the war oh he thought hed like the life hed been through the south african war no he was sick of it fed up im living with his father and motherive no home of my own now my people had a big farmover a thousand acresin oxfordshire not like hereno oh theyre very good to me his father and mother oh yes they couldnt be better they think more of me than of their own daughters but its not like being in a place of your own is it you cant really do as you like no theres only me and his father and mother at home before the war oh he was anything hes had a good educationbut he liked the farming better then he was a chauffeur thats how he knew french he was driving a gentleman in france for a long time  at this point the peacocks came round the corner on a puff of wind  hello joey she called and one of the birds came forward on delicate legs its grey speckled back was very elegant it rolled its full darkblue neck as it moved to her she crouched down joey dear she said in an odd saturnine caressive voice youre bound to find me arent you she put her face forward and the bird rolled his neck almost touching her face with his beak as if kissing her  he loves you i said  she twisted her face up at me with a laugh  yes she said he loves me joey doesthen to the birdand i love joey dont i i do love joey and she smoothed his feathers for a moment then she rose saying hes an affectionate bird  i smiled at the roll of her birrrd  oh yes he is she protested he came with me from my home seven years ago those others are his descendantsbut theyre not like joeyare they deeurr her voice rose at the end with a witchlike cry  then she forgot the birds in the cartshed and turned to business again  wont you read that letter she said read it so that i know what it says  its rather behind his back i said  oh never mind him she cried hes been behind my back long enoughall these four years if he never did no worse things behind my back than i do behind his he wouldnt have cause to grumble you read me what it says  now i felt a distinct reluctance to do as she bid and yet i beganmy dear alfred  i guessed that much she said elizas dear alfred she laughed how do you say it in french eliza  i told her and she repeated the name with great contemptÉlise  go on she said youre not reading  so i begani have been thinking of you sometimeshave you been thinking of me  of several others as well beside her ill wager said mrs goyte  probably not said i and continued a dear little baby was born here a week ago ah can i tell you my feelings when i take my darling little brother into my arms  ill bet its his cried mrs goyte  no i said its her mothers  dont you believe it she cried its a blind you mark its her own right enoughand his  no i said its her mothers he has sweet smiling eyes but not like your beautiful english eyes  she suddenly struck her hand on her skirt with a wild motion and bent down doubled with laughter then she rose and covered her face with her hand  im forced to laugh at the beautiful english eyes she said  arent his eyes beautiful i asked  oh yesvery go onjoey dear deeurr joeythis to the peacock  erwe miss you very much we all miss you we wish you were here to see the darling baby ah alfred how happy we were when you stayed with us we all loved you so much my mother will call the baby alfred so that we shall never forget you  of course its his right enough cried mrs goyte  no i said its the mothers ermy mother is very well my father came home yesterdayon leave he is delighted with his son my little brother and wishes to have him named after you because you were so good to us all in that terrible time which i shall never forget i must weep now when i think of it well you are far away in england and perhaps i shall never see you again how did you find your dear mother and father i am so happy that your wound is better and that you can nearly walk  how did he find his dear wife cried mrs goyte he never told her he had one think of taking the poor girl in like that  we are so pleased when you write to us yet now you are in england you will forget the family you served so well  a bit too welleh joey cried the wife  if it had not been for you we should not be alive now to grieve and to rejoice in this life that is so hard for us but we have recovered some of our losses and no longer feel the burden of poverty the little alfred is a great comfort to me i hold him to my breast and think of the big good alfred and i weep to think that those times of suffering were perhaps the times of a great happiness that is gone for ever  oh but isnt it a shame to take a poor girl in like that cried mrs goyte never to let on that he was married and raise her hopesi call it beastly i do  you dont know i said you know how anxious women are to fall in love wife or no wife how could he help it if she was determined to fall in love with him  he could have helped it if hed wanted  well i said we arent all heroes  oh but thats different the big good alfreddid ever you hear such tommyrot in your life go onwhat does she say at the end  erwe shall be pleased to hear of your life in england we all send many kind regards to your good parents i wish you all happiness for your future days your very affectionate and evergrateful Élise  there was silence for a moment during which mrs goyte remained with her head dropped sinister and abstracted suddenly she lifted her face and her eyes flashed  oh but i call it beastly i call it mean to take a girl in like that  nay i said probably he hasnt taken her in at all do you think those french girls are such poor innocent things i guess shes a great deal more downy than he  oh hes one of the biggest fools that ever walked she cried  there you are said i  but its his child right enough she said  i dont think so said i  im sure of it  oh well i said if you prefer to think that way  what other reason has she for writing like that  i went out into the road and looked at the cattle  who is this driving the cows i said she too came out  its the boy from the next farm she said  oh well said i those belgian girls you never know where their letters will end and after all its his affairyou neednt bother  oh she cried with rough scornits not me that bothers but its the nasty meanness of itme writing him such loving lettersshe put her hand before her face and laughed malevolentlyand sending him parcels all the time you bet he fed that gurrl on my parcelsi know he did its just like him ill bet they laughed together over my letters i bet anything they did  nay said i hed burn your letters for fear theyd give him away  there was a black look on her yellow face suddenly a voice was heard calling she poked her head out of the shed and answered coolly  all right then turning to me thats his mother looking after me  she laughed into my face witchlike and we turned down the road  when i awoke the morning after this episode i found the house darkened with deep soft snow which had blown against the large west windows covering them with a screen i went outside and saw the valley all white and ghastly below me the trees beneath black and thin looking like wire the rockfaces dark between the glistening shroud and the sky above sombre heavy yellowishdark much too heavy for this world below of hollow bluey whiteness figured with black i felt i was in a valley of the dead and i sensed i was a prisoner for the snow was everywhere deep and drifted in places so all the morning i remained indoors looking up the drive at the shrubs so heavily plumed with snow at the gateposts raised high with a foot or more of extra whiteness or i looked down into the whiteandblack valley that was utterly motionless and beyond life a hollow sarcophagus  nothing stirred the whole dayno plume fell off the shrubs the valley was as abstracted as a grove of death i looked over at the tiny halfburied farms away on the bare uplands beyond the valley hollow and i thought of tible in the snow of the black witchlike little mrs goyte and the snow seemed to lay me bare to influences i wanted to escape  in the faint glow of the halfclear light that came about four oclock in the afternoon i was roused to see a motion in the snow away below near where the thorn trees stood very black and dwarfed like a little savage group in the dismal white i watched closely yes there was a flapping and a strugglea big bird it must be labouring in the snow i wondered our biggest birds in the valley were the large hawks that often hung flickering opposite my windows level with me but high above some prey on the steep valleyside this was much too big for a hawktoo big for any known bird i searched in my mind for the largest english wild birds geese buzzards  still it laboured and strove then was still a dark spot then struggled again i went out of the house and down the steep slope at risk of breaking my leg between the rocks i knew the ground so welland yet i got well shaken before i drew near the thorntrees  yes it was a bird it was joey it was the greybrown peacock with a blue neck he was snowwet and spent  joeyjoey deurr i said staggering unevenly towards him he looked so pathetic rowing and struggling in the snow too spent to rise his blue neck stretching out and lying sometimes on the snow his eye closing and opening quickly his crest all battered  joey deeuur deeurr i said caressingly to him and at last he lay still blinking in the surged and furrowed snow whilst i came near and touched him stroked him gathered him under my arm he stretched his long wetted neck away from me as i held him none the less he was quiet in my arm too tired perhaps to struggle still he held his poor crested head away from me and seemed sometimes to droop to wilt as if he might suddenly die  he was not so heavy as i expected yet it was a struggle to get up to the house with him again we set him down not too near the fire and gently wiped him with cloths he submitted only now and then stretched his soft neck away from us avoiding us helplessly then we set warm food by him i put it to his beak tried to make him eat but he ignored it he seemed to be ignorant of what we were doing recoiled inside himself inexplicably so we put him in a basket with cloths and left him crouching oblivious his food we put near him the blinds were drawn the house was warm it was night sometimes he stirred but mostly he huddled still leaning his queer crested head on one side he touched no food and took no heed of sounds or movements we talked of brandy or stimulants but i realized we had best leave him alone  in the night however we heard him thumping about i got up anxiously with a candle he had eaten some food and scattered more making a mess and he was perched on the back of a heavy armchair so i concluded he was recovered or recovering  the next day was clear and the snow had frozen so i decided to carry him back to tible he consented after various flappings to sit in a big fishbag with his battered head peeping out with wild uneasiness and so i set off with him slithering down into the valley making good progress down in the pale shadow beside the rushing waters then climbing painfully up the arrested white valleyside plumed with clusters of young pine trees into the paler white radiance of the snowy upper regions where the wind cut fine joey seemed to watch all the time with wide anxious unseeing eye brilliant and inscrutable as i drew near to tible township he stirred violently in the bag though i do not know if he had recognized the place then as i came to the sheds he looked sharply from side to side and stretched his neck out long i was a little afraid of him he gave a loud vehement yell opening his sinister beak and i stood still looking at him as he struggled in the bag shaken myself by his struggles yet not thinking to release him  mrs goyte came darting past the end of the house her head sticking forward in sharp scrutiny she saw me and came forward  have you got joey she cried sharply as if i were a thief  i opened the bag and he flopped out flapping as if he hated the touch of the snow now she gathered him up and put her lips to his beak she was flushed and handsome her eyes bright her hair slack thick but more witchlike than ever she did not speak  she had been followed by a greyhaired woman with a round rather sallow face and a slightly hostile bearing  did you bring him with you then she asked sharply i answered that i had rescued him the previous evening  from the background slowly approached a slender man with a grey moustache and large patches on his trousers  youve gotim back gain ah see he said to his daughterinlaw his wife explained how i had found joey  ah went on the grey man it wor our alfred scared him off back your life he musta flyed ower tvalley tha ma thank thy stars as e wor fun maggie ed a bin froze they a bit nesh you know he concluded to me  they are i answered this isnt their country  no it isna replied mr goyte he spoke very slowly and deliberately quietly as if the soft pedal were always down in his voice he looked at his daughterinlaw as she crouched flushed and dark before the peacock which would lay its long blue neck for a moment along her lap in spite of his grey moustache and thin grey hair the elderly man had a face young and almost delicate like a young mans his blue eyes twinkled with some inscrutable source of pleasure his skin was fine and tender his nose delicately arched his grey hair being slightly ruffled he had a debonair look as of a youth who is in love  we mun tell im its come he said slowly and turning he called alfredalfred wheers ter gotten to  then he turned again to the group  get up then maggie lass get up wi thee tha maes too much o thbod  a young man approached wearing rough khaki and kneebreeches he was danish looking broad at the loins  is come back then said the father to the son leastwise hes bin browt back flyed ower the griff low  the son looked at me he had a devilmaycare bearing his cap on one side his hands stuck in the front pockets of his breeches but he said nothing  shall you come in a minute master said the elderly woman to me  ay come in an hae a cup o tea or summat youll do wi summat carrin that bod come on maggie wench lets go in  so we went indoors into the rather stuffy overcrowded livingroom that was too cosy and too warm the son followed last standing in the doorway the father talked to me  maggie put out the teacups the mother went into the dairy again  thalt rouse thysen up a bit again now maggie

notice ont ty what can y expect  the mother came in again and the talk became general maggie flashed her eyes at me from time to time complacent and satisfied moving among the men i paid her little compliments which she did not seem to hear she attended to me with a kind of sinister witchlike graciousness her dark head ducked between her shoulders at once humble and powerful she was happy as a child attending to her fatherinlaw and to me but there was something ominous between her eyebrows as if a dark moth were settled thereand something ominous in her bent hulking bearing  she sat on a low stool by the fire near her fatherinlaw her head was dropped she seemed in a state of abstraction from time to time she would suddenly recover and look up at us laughing and chatting then she would forget again yet in her hulked black forgetting she seemed very near to us  the door having been opened the peacock came slowly in prancing calmly he went near to her and crouched down coiling his blue neck she glanced at him but almost as if she did not observe him the bird sat silent seeming to sleep and the woman also sat hulked and silent seemingly oblivious then once more there was a heavy step and alfred entered he looked at his wife and he looked at the peacock crouching by her he stood large in the doorway his hands stuck in front of him in his breeches pockets nobody spoke he turned on his heel and went out again  i rose also to go maggie started as if coming to herself  must you go she asked rising and coming near to me standing in front of me twisting her head sideways and looking up at me cant you stop a bit longer we can all be cosy today theres nothing to do outdoors and she laughed showing her teeth oddly she had a long chin  i said i must go the peacock uncoiled and coiled again his long blue neck as he lay on the hearth maggie still stood close in front of me so that i was acutely aware of my waistcoat buttons  oh well she said youll come again wont you do come again  i promised  come to tea one dayyes do  i promisedone day  the moment i went out of her presence i ceased utterly to exist for heras utterly as i ceased to exist for joey with her curious abstractedness she forgot me again immediately i knew it as i left her yet she seemed almost in physical contact with me while i was with her  the sky was all pallid again yellowish when i went out there was no sun the snow was blue and cold i hurried away down the hill musing on maggie the road made a loop down the sharp face of the slope as i went crunching over the laborious snow i became aware of a figure striding down the steep scarp to intercept me it was a man with his hands in front of him half stuck in his breeches pockets and his shoulders squarea real farmer of the hills alfred of course he waited for me by the stone fence  excuse me he said as i came up  i came to a halt in front of him and looked into his sullen blue eyes he had a certain odd haughtiness on his brows but his blue eyes stared insolently at me  do you know anything about a letterin frenchthat my wife openeda letter of mine  yes said i she asked me to read it to her  he looked square at me he did not know exactly how to feel  what was there in it he asked  why i said dont you know  she makes out shes burnt it he said  without showing it you i asked  he nodded slightly he seemed to be meditating as to what line of action he should take he wanted to know the contents of the letter he must know and therefore he must ask me for evidently his wife had taunted him at the same time no doubt he would like to wreak untold vengeance on my unfortunate person so he eyed me and i eyed him and neither of us spoke he did not want to repeat his request to me and yet i only looked at him and considered  suddenly he threw back his head and glanced down the valley then he changed his positionhe was a horsesoldier then he looked at me confidentially  she burnt the blasted thing before i saw it he said  well i answered slowly she doesnt know herself what was in it  he continued to watch me narrowly i grinned to myself  i didnt like to read her out what there was in it i continued  he suddenly flushed so that the veins in his neck stood out and he stirred again uncomfortably  the belgian girl said her baby had been born a week ago and that they were going to call it alfred i told him  he met my eyes i was grinning he began to grin too  good luck to her he said  best of luck said i  and what did you tell her he asked  that the baby belonged to the old motherthat it was brother to your girl who was writing to you as a friend of the family  he stood smiling with the long subtle malice of a farmer  and did she take it in he asked  as much as she took anything else  he stood grinning fixedly then he broke into a short laugh  good for her he exclaimed cryptically  and then he laughed aloud once more evidently feeling he had won a big move in his contest with his wife  what about the other woman i asked  who  Élise  ohhe shifted uneasilyshe was all right  youll be getting back to her i said  he looked at me then he made a grimace with his mouth  not me he said back your life its a plant  you dont think the cher petit bébé is a little alfred  it might be he said  only might  yesan theres lots of mites in a pound of cheese he laughed boisterously but uneasily  what did she say exactly he asked  i began to repeat as well as i could the phrases of the letter  mon cher alfredfiguretoi comme je suis desolée  he listened with some confusion when i had finished all i could remember he said  they know how to pitch you out a letter those belgian lasses  practice said i  they get plenty he said  there was a pause  oh well he said ive never got that letter anyhow  the wind blew fine and keen in the sunshine across the snow i blew my nose and prepared to depart  and she doesnt know anything he continued jerking his head up the hill in the direction of tible  she knows nothing but what ive saidthat is if she really burnt the letter  i believe she burnt it he said for spite shes a little devil she is but i shall have it out with her his jaw was stubborn and sullen then suddenly he turned to me with a new note  why he said why didnt you wring that b peacocks neckthat b joey  why i said what for  i hate the brute he said i had a shot at him  i laughed he stood and mused  poor little Élise he murmured  was she smallpetite i asked he jerked up his head  no he said rather tall  taller than your wife i suppose  again he looked into my eyes and then once more he went into a loud burst of laughter that made the still snowdeserted valley clap again  god its a knockout he said thoroughly amused then he stood at ease one foot out his hands in his breeches pockets in front of him his head thrown back a handsome figure of a man  but ill do that blasted joey in he mused  i ran down the hill shouting with laughter     you touched me   the pottery house was a square ugly brick house girt in by the wall that enclosed the whole grounds of the pottery itself to be sure a privet hedge partly masked the house and its ground from the potteryyard and works but only partly through the hedge could be seen the desolate yard and the manywindowed factorylike pottery over the hedge could be seen the chimneys and the outhouses but inside the hedge a pleasant garden and lawn sloped down to a willow pool which had once supplied the works  the pottery itself was now closed the great doors of the yard permanently shut no more the great crates with yellow straw showing through stood in stacks by the packing shed no more the drays drawn by great horses rolled down the hill with a high load no more the potterylasses in their claycoloured overalls their faces and hair splashed with grey fine mud shrieked and larked with the men all that was over  we like it much betteroh much betterquieter said matilda rockley  oh yes assented emmie rockley her sister  im sure you do agreed the visitor  but whether the two rockley girls really liked it better or whether they only imagined they did is a question certainly their lives were much more grey and dreary now that the grey clay had ceased to spatter its mud and silt its dust over the premises they did not quite realize how they missed the shrieking shouting lasses whom they had known all their lives and disliked so much  matilda and emmie were already old maids in a thorough industrial district it is not easy for the girls who have expectations above the common to find husbands the ugly industrial town was full of men young men who were ready to marry but they were all colliers or potteryhands mere workmen the rockley girls would have about ten thousand pounds each when their father died ten thousand pounds worth of profitable houseproperty it was not to be sneezed at they felt so themselves and refrained from sneezing away such a fortune on any mere member of the proletariat consequently bankclerks or nonconformist clergymen or even schoolteachers having failed to come forward matilda had begun to give up all idea of ever leaving the pottery house  matilda was a tall thin graceful fair girl with a rather large nose she was the mary to emmies martha that is matilda loved painting and music and read a good many novels whilst emmie looked after the housekeeping emmie was shorter plumper than her sister and she had no accomplishments she looked up to matilda whose mind was naturally refined and sensible  in their quiet melancholy way the two girls were happy their mother was dead their father was ill also he was an intelligent man who had had some education but preferred to remain as if he were one with the rest of the working people he had a passion for music and played the violin pretty well but now he was getting old he was very ill dying of a kidney disease he had been rather a heavy whiskydrinker  this quiet household with one servantmaid lived on year after year in the pottery house friends came in the girls went out the father drank himself more and more ill outside in the street there was a continual racket of the colliers and their dogs and children but inside the pottery wall was a deserted quiet  in all this ointment there was one little fly ted rockley the father of the girls had had four daughters and no son as his girls grew he felt angry at finding himself always in a household of women he went off to london and adopted a boy out of a charity institution emmie was fourteen years old and matilda sixteen when their father arrived home with his prodigy the boy of six hadrian  hadrian was just an ordinary boy from a charity home with ordinary brownish hair and ordinary bluish eyes and of ordinary rather cockney speech the rockley girlsthere were three at home at the time of his arrivalhad resented his being sprung on them he with his watchful charityinstitution instinct knew this at once though he was only six years old hadrian had a subtle jeering look on his face when he regarded the three young women they insisted he should address them as cousin cousin flora cousin matilda cousin emmie he complied but there seemed a mockery in his tone  the girls however were kindhearted by nature flora married and left home hadrian did very much as he pleased with matilda and emmie though they had certain strictnesses he grew up in the pottery house and about the pottery premises went to an elementary school and was invariably called hadrian rockley he regarded cousin matilda and cousin emmie with a certain laconic indifference was quiet and reticent in his ways the girls called him sly but that was unjust he was merely cautious and without frankness his uncle ted rockley understood him tacitly their natures were somewhat akin hadrian and the elderly man had a real but unemotional regard for one another  when he was thirteen years old the boy was sent to a high school in the county town he did not like it his cousin matilda had longed to make a little gentleman of him but he refused to be made he would give a little contemptuous curve to his lip and take on a shy charityboy grin when refinement was thrust upon him he played truant from the high school sold his books his cap with its badge even his very scarf and pockethandkerchief to his schoolfellows and went raking off heaven knows where with the money so he spent two very unsatisfactory years  when he was fifteen he announced that he wanted to leave england and go to the colonies he had kept touch with the home the rockleys knew that when hadrian made a declaration in his quiet halfjeering manner it was worse than useless to oppose him so at last the boy departed going to canada under the protection of the institution to which he had belonged he said goodbye to the rockleys without a word of thanks and parted it seemed without a pang matilda and emmie wept often to think of how he left them even on their fathers face a queer look came but hadrian wrote fairly regularly from canada he had entered some electricity works near montreal and was doing well  at last however the war came in his turn hadrian joined up and came to europe the rockleys saw nothing of him they lived on just the same in the pottery house ted rockley was dying of a sort of dropsy and in his heart he wanted to see the boy when the armistice was signed hadrian had a long leave and wrote that he was coming home to the pottery house  the girls were terribly fluttered to tell the truth they were a little afraid of hadrian matilda tall and thin was frail in her health both girls were worn with nursing their father to have hadrian a young man of twentyone in the house with them after he had left them so coldly five years before was a trying circumstance  they were in a flutter emmie persuaded her father to have his bed made finally in the morningroom downstairs whilst his room upstairs was prepared for hadrian this was done and preparations were going on for the arrival when at ten oclock in the morning the young man suddenly turned up quite unexpectedly cousin emmie with her hair bobbed up in absurd little bobs round her forehead was busily polishing the stairrods while cousin matilda was in the kitchen washing the drawingroom ornaments in a lather her sleeves rolled back on her thin arms and her head tied up oddly and coquettishly in a duster  cousin matilda blushed deep with mortification when the selfpossessed young man walked in with his kitbag and put his cap on the sewing machine he was little and selfconfident with a curious neatness about him that still suggested the charity institution his face was brown he had a small moustache he was vigorous enough in his smallness  well is it hadrian exclaimed cousin matilda wringing the lather off her hand we didnt expect you till tomorrow  i got off monday night said hadrian glancing round the room  fancy said cousin matilda then having dried her hands she went forward held out her hand and said  how are you  quite well thank you said hadrian  youre quite a man said cousin matilda  hadrian glanced at her she did not look her best so thin so largenosed with that pinkandwhite checked duster tied round her head she felt her disadvantage but she had had a good deal of suffering and sorrow she did not mind any more  the servant enteredone that did not know hadrian  come and see my father said cousin matilda  in the hall they roused cousin emmie like a partridge from cover she was on the stairs pushing the bright stairrods into place instinctively her hand went to the little knobs her front hair bobbed on her forehead  why she exclaimed crossly what have you come today for  i got off a day earlier said hadrian and his mans voice so deep and unexpected was like a blow to cousin emmie  well youve caught us in the midst of it she said with resentment then all three went into the middle room  mr rockley was dressedthat is he had on his trousers and socksbut he was resting on the bed propped up just under the window from whence he could see his beloved and resplendent garden where tulips and appletrees were ablaze he did not look as ill as he was for the water puffed him up and his face kept its colour his stomach was much swollen he glanced round swiftly turning his eyes without turning his head he was the wreck of a handsome wellbuilt man  seeing hadrian a queer unwilling smile went over his face the young man greeted him sheepishly  you wouldnt make a lifeguardsman he said do you want something to eat  hadrian looked roundas if for the meal  i dont mind he said  what shall you haveegg and bacon asked emmie shortly  yes i dont mind said hadrian  the sisters went down to the kitchen and sent the servant to finish the stairs  isnt he altered said matilda sotto voce  isnt he said cousin emmie what a little man  they both made a grimace and laughed nervously  get the fryingpan said emmie to matilda  but hes as cocky as ever said matilda narrowing her eyes and shaking her head knowingly as she handed the fryingpan  mannie said emmie sarcastically hadrians newfledged cocksure manliness evidently found no favour in her eyes  oh hes not bad said matilda you dont want to be prejudiced against him  im not prejudiced against him i think hes all right for looks said emmie but theres too much of the little mannie about him  fancy catching us like this said matilda  theyve no thought for anything said emmie with contempt you go up and get dressed our matilda i dont care about him i can see to things and you can talk to him i shant  hell talk to my father said matilda meaningful  sly exclaimed emmie with a grimace  the sisters believed that hadrian had come hoping to get something out of their fatherhoping for a legacy and they were not at all sure he would not get it  matilda went upstairs to change she had thought it all out how she would receive hadrian and impress him and he had caught her with her head tied up in a duster and her thin arms in a basin of lather but she did not care she now dressed herself most scrupulously carefully folded her long beautiful blonde hair touched her pallor with a little rouge and put her long string of exquisite crystal beads over her soft green dress now she looked elegant like a heroine in a magazine illustration and almost as unreal  she found hadrian and her father talking away the young man was short of speech as a rule but he could find his tongue with his uncle they were both sipping a glass of brandy and smoking and chatting like a pair of old cronies hadrian was telling about canada he was going back there when his leave was up  you wouldnt like to stop in england then said mr rockley  no i wouldnt stop in england said hadrian  hows that theres plenty of electricians here said mr rockley  yes but theres too much difference between the men and the employers over heretoo much of that for me said hadrian  the sick man looked at him narrowly with oddly smiling eyes  thats it is it he replied  matilda heard and understood so thats your big idea is it my little man she said to herself she had always said of hadrian that he had no proper respect for anybody or anything that he was sly and common she went down to the kitchen for a sotto voce confab with emmie  he thinks a rare lot of himself she whispered  hes somebody he is said emmie with contempt  he thinks theres too much difference between masters and men over here said matilda  is it any different in canada asked emmie  oh yesdemocratic replied matilda he thinks theyre all on a level over there  ay well hes over here now said emmie dryly so he can keep his place  as they talked they saw the young man sauntering down the garden looking casually at the flowers he had his hands in his pockets and his soldiers cap neatly on his head he looked quite at his ease as if in possession the two women fluttered watched him through the window  we know what hes come for said emmie churlishly matilda looked a long time at the neat khaki figure it had something of the charityboy about it still but now it was a mans figure laconic charged with plebeian energy she thought of the derisive passion in his voice as he had declaimed against the propertied classes to her father  you dont know emmie perhaps hes not come for that she rebuked her sister they were both thinking of the money  they were still watching the young soldier he stood away at the bottom of the garden with his back to them his hands in his pockets looking into the water of the willow pond matildas darkblue eyes had a strange full look in them the lids with the faint blue veins showing dropped rather low she carried her head light and high but she had a look of pain the young man at the bottom of the garden turned and looked up the path perhaps he saw them through the window matilda moved into shadow  that afternoon their father seemed weak and ill he was easily exhausted the doctor came and told matilda that the sick man might die suddenly at any momentbut then he might not they must be prepared  so the day passed and the next hadrian made himself at home he went about in the morning in his brownish jersey and his khaki trousers collarless his bare neck showing he explored the pottery premises as if he had some secret purpose in so doing he talked with mr rockley when the sick man had strength the two girls were always angry when the two men sat talking together like cronies yet it was chiefly a kind of politics they talked  on the second day after hadrians arrival matilda sat with her father in the evening she was drawing a picture which she wanted to copy it was very still hadrian was gone out somewhere no one knew where and emmie was busy mr rockley reclined on his bed looking out in silence over his eveningsunny garden  if anything happens to me matilda he said you wont sell this houseyoull stop here  matildas eyes took their slightly haggard look as she stared at her father  well we couldnt do anything else she said  you dont know what you might do he said everything is left to you and emmie equally youdo as you like with itonly dont sell this house dont part with it  no she said  and give hadrian my watch and chain and a hundred pounds out of whats in the bankand help him if he ever wants helping i havent put his name in the will  your watch and chain and a hundred poundsyes but youll be here when he goes back to canada father  you never know whatll happen said her father  matilda sat and watched him with her full haggard eyes for a long time as if tranced she saw that he knew he must go soonshe saw like a clairvoyant  later on she told emmie what her father had said about the watch and chain and the money  what right has hehemeaning hadrianto my fathers watch and chainwhat has it to do with him let him have the money and get off said emmie she loved her father  that night matilda sat late in her room her heart was anxious and breaking her mind seemed entranced she was too much entranced even to weep and all the time she thought of her father only her father at last she felt she must go to him  it was near midnight she went along the passage and to his room there was a faint light from the moon outside she listened at his door then she softly opened and entered the room was faintly dark she heard a movement on the bed  are you asleep she said softly advancing to the side of the bed  are you asleep she repeated gently as she stood at the side of the bed and she reached her hand in the darkness to touch his forehead delicately her fingers met the nose and the eyebrows she laid her fine delicate hand on his brow it seemed fresh and smoothvery fresh and smooth a sort of surprise stirred her in her entranced state but it could not waken her gently she leaned over the bed and stirred her fingers over the lowgrowing hair on his brow  cant you sleep tonight she said  there was a quick stirring in the bed yes i can a voice answered it was hadrians voice she started away instantly she was wakened from her lateatnight trance she remembered that her father was downstairs that hadrian had his room she stood in the darkness as if stung  it is you hadrian she said i thought it was my father she was so startled so shocked that she could not move the young man gave an uncomfortable laugh and turned in his bed  at last she got out of the room when she was back in her own room in the light and her door was closed she stood holding up her hand that had touched him as if it were hurt she was almost too shocked she could not endure  well said her calm and weary mind it was only a mistake why take any notice of it  but she could not reason her feelings so easily she suffered feeling herself in a false position her right hand which she had laid so gently on his face on his fresh skin ached now as if it were really injured she could not forgive hadrian for the mistake it made her dislike him deeply  hadrian too slept badly he had been awakened by the opening of the door and had not realized what the question meant but the soft straying tenderness of her hand on his face startled something out of his soul he was a charity boy aloof and more or less at bay the fragile exquisiteness of her caress startled him most revealed unknown things to him  in the morning she could feel the consciousness in his eyes when she came downstairs she tried to bear herself as if nothing at all had happened and she succeeded she had the calm selfcontrol selfindifference of one who has suffered and borne her suffering she looked at him from her darkish almost drugged blue eyes she met the spark of consciousness in his eyes and quenched it and with her long fine hand she put the sugar in his coffee  but she could not control him as she thought she could he had a keen memory stinging his mind a new set of sensations working in his consciousness something new was alert in him at the back of his reticent guarded mind he kept his secret alive and vivid she was at his mercy for he was unscrupulous his standard was not her standard  he looked at her curiously she was not beautiful her nose was too large her chin was too small her neck was too thin but her skin was clear and fine she had a highbred sensitiveness this queer brave highbred quality she shared with her father the charity boy could see it in her tapering fingers which were white and ringed the same glamour that he knew in the elderly man he now saw in the woman and he wanted to possess himself of it he wanted to make himself master of it as he went about through the old potteryyard his secretive mind schemed and worked to be master of that strange soft delicacy such as he had felt in her hand upon his facethis was what he set himself towards he was secretly plotting  he watched matilda as she went about and she became aware of his attention as of some shadow following her but her pride made her ignore it when he sauntered near her his hands in his pockets she received him with that same commonplace kindliness which mastered him more than any contempt her superior breeding seemed to control him she made herself feel towards him exactly as she had always felt he was a young boy who lived in the house with them but was a stranger only she dared not remember his face under her hand when she remembered that she was bewildered her hand had offended her she wanted to cut it off and she wanted fiercely to cut off the memory in him she assumed she had done so  one day when he sat talking with his uncle he looked straight into the eyes of the sick man and said  but i shouldnt like to live and die here in rawsley  nowellyou neednt said the sick man  do you think cousin matilda likes it  i should think so  i dont call it much of a life said the youth how much older is she than me uncle  the sick man looked at the young soldier  a good bit he said  over thirty said hadrian  well not so much shes thirtytwo  hadrian considered a while  she doesnt look it he said  again the sick father looked at him  do you think shed like to leave here said hadrian  nay i dont know replied the father restive  hadrian sat still having his own thoughts then in a small quiet voice as if he were speaking from inside himself he said  id marry her if you wanted me to  the sick man raised his eyes suddenly and stared he stared for a long time the youth looked inscrutably out of the window  you said the sick man mocking with some contempt hadrian turned and met his eyes the two men had an inexplicable understanding  if you wasnt against it said hadrian  nay said the father turning aside i dont think im against it ive never thought of it butbut emmies the youngest  he had flushed and looked suddenly more alive secretly he loved the boy  you might ask her said hadrian  the elder man considered  hadnt you better ask her yourself he said  shed take more notice of you said hadrian  they were both silent then emmie came in  for two days mr rockley was excited and thoughtful hadrian went about quietly secretly unquestioning at last the father and daughter were alone together it was very early morning the father had been in much pain as the pain abated he lay still thinking  matilda he said suddenly looking at his daughter  yes im here she said  ay i want you to do something  she rose in anticipation  nay sit still i want you to marry hadrian  she thought he was raving she rose bewildered and frightened  nay sit you still sit you still you hear what i tell you  but you dont know what youre saying father  ay i know well enough i want you to marry hadrian i tell you  she was dumbfounded he was a man of few words  youll do what i tell you he said  she looked at him slowly  what put such an idea in your mind she said proudly  he did  matilda almost looked her father down her pride was so offended  why its disgraceful she said  why  she watched him slowly  what do you ask me for she said its disgusting  the lads sound enough he replied testily  youd better tell him to clear out she said coldly  he turned and looked out of the window she sat flushed and erect for a long time at length her father turned to her looking really malevolent  if you wont he said youre a fool and ill make you pay for your foolishness do you see  suddenly a cold fear gripped her she could not believe her senses she was terrified and bewildered she stared at her father believing him to be delirious or mad or drunk what could she do  i tell you he said ill send for whittle tomorrow if you dont you shall neither of you have anything of mine  whittle was the solicitor she understood her father well enough he would send for his solicitor and make a will leaving all his property to hadrian neither she nor emmie should have anything it was too much she rose and went out of the room up to her own room where she locked herself in  she did not come out for some hours at last late at night she confided in emmie  the sliving demon he wants the money said emmie my fathers out of his mind  the thought that hadrian merely wanted the money was another blow to matilda she did not love the impossible youthbut she had not yet learned to think of him as a thing of evil he now became hideous to her mind  emmie had a little scene with her father next day  you dont mean what you said to our matilda yesterday do you father she asked aggressively  yes he replied  what that youll alter your will  yes  you wont said his angry daughter  but he looked at her with a malevolent little smile  annie he shouted annie  he had still power to make his voice carry the servant maid came in from the kitchen  put your things on and go down to whittles office and say i want to see mr whittle as soon as he can and will he bring a willform  the sick man lay back a littlehe could not lie down his daughter sat as if she had been struck then she left the room  hadrian was pottering about in the garden she went straight down to him  here she said youd better get off youd better take your things and go from here quick  hadrian looked slowly at the infuriated girl  who says so he asked  we say soget off youve done enough mischief and damage  does uncle say so  yes he does  ill go and ask him  but like a fury emmie barred his way  no you neednt you neednt ask him nothing at all we dont want you so you can go  uncles boss here  a man thats dying and you crawling round and working on him for his moneyyoure not fit to live  oh he said who says im working for his money  i say but my father told our matilda and she knows what you are she knows what youre after so you might as well clear out for all youll getguttersnipe  he turned his back on her to think it had not occurred to him that they would think he was after the money he did want the moneybadly he badly wanted to be an employer himself not one of the employed but he knew in his subtle calculating way that it was not for money he wanted matilda he wanted both the money and matilda but he told himself the two desires were separate not one he could not do with matilda without the money but he did not want her for the money  when he got this clear in his mind he sought for an opportunity to tell it her lurking and watching but she avoided him in the evening the lawyer came mr rockley seemed to have a new access of strengtha will was drawn up making the previous arrangements wholly conditional the old will held good if matilda would consent to marry hadrian if she refused then at the end of six months the whole property passed to hadrian  mr rockley told this to the young man with malevolent satisfaction he seemed to have a strange desire quite unreasonable for revenge upon the women who had surrounded him for so long and served him so carefully  tell her in front of me said hadrian  so mr rockley sent for his daughters  at last they came pale mute stubborn matilda seemed to have retired far off emmie seemed like a fighter ready to fight to the death the sick man reclined on the bed his eyes bright his puffed hand trembling but his face had again some of its old bright handsomeness hadrian sat quiet a little aside the indomitable dangerous charity boy  theres the will said their father pointing them to the paper  the two women sat mute and immovable they took no notice  either you marry hadrian or he has everything said the father with satisfaction  then let him have everything said matilda boldly  hes not hes not cried emmie fiercely hes not going to have it the guttersnipe  an amused look came on her fathers face  you hear that hadrian he said  i didnt offer to marry cousin matilda for the money said hadrian flushing and moving on his seat  matilda looked at him slowly with her darkblue drugged eyes he seemed a strange little monster to her  why you liar you know you did cried emmie  the sick man laughed matilda continued to gaze strangely at the young man  she knows i didnt said hadrian  he too had his courage as a rat has indomitable courage in the end hadrian had some of the neatness the reserve the underground quality of the rat but he had perhaps the ultimate courage the most unquenchable courage of all  emmie looked at her sister  oh well she said matildadont bother let him have everything we can look after ourselves  i know hell take everything said matilda abstractedly  hadrian did not answer he knew in fact that if matilda refused him he would take everything and go off with it  a clever little mannie said emmie with a jeering grimace  the father laughed noiselessly to himself but he was tired  go on then he said go on let me be quiet  emmie turned and looked at him  you deserve what youve got she said to her father bluntly  go on he answered mildly go on  another night passeda night nurse sat up with mr rockley another day came hadrian was there as ever in his woollen jersey and coarse khaki trousers and bare neck matilda went about frail and distant emmie blackbrowed in spite of her blondness they were all quiet for they did not intend the mystified servant to learn anything  mr rockley had very bad attacks of pain he could not breathe the end seemed near they all went about quiet and stoical all unyielding hadrian pondered within himself if he did not marry matilda he would go to canada with twenty thousand pounds this was itself a very satisfactory prospect if matilda consented he would have nothingshe would have her own money  emmie was the one to act she went off in search of the solicitor and brought him with her there was an interview and whittle tried to frighten the youth into withdrawalbut without avail the clergyman and relatives were summonedbut hadrian stared at them and took no notice it made him angry however  he wanted to catch matilda alone many days went by and he was not successful she avoided him at last lurking he surprised her one day as she came to pick gooseberries and he cut off her retreat he came to the point at once  you dont want me then he said in his subtle insinuating voice  i dont want to speak to you she said averting her face  you put your hand on me though he said you shouldnt have done that and then i should never have thought of it you shouldnt have touched me  if you were anything decent youd know that was a mistake and forget it she said  i know it was a mistakebut i shant forget it if you wake a man up he cant go to sleep again because hes told to  if you had any decent feeling in you youd have gone away she replied  i didnt want to he replied  she looked away into the distance at last she asked  what do you persecute me for if it isnt for the money im old enough to be your mother in a way ive been your mother  doesnt matter he said youve been no mother to me let us marry and go out to canadayou might as wellyouve touched me  she was white and trembling suddenly she flushed with anger  its so indecent she said  how he retorted you touched me  but she walked away from him she felt as if he had trapped her he was angry and depressed he felt again despised  that same evening she went into her fathers room  yes she said suddenly ill marry him  her father looked up at her he was in pain and very ill  you like him now do you he said with a faint smile  she looked down into his face and saw death not far off she turned and went coldly out of the room  the solicitor was sent for preparations were hastily made in all the interval matilda did not speak to hadrian never answered him if he addressed her he approached her in the morning  youve come round to it then he said giving her a pleasant look from his twinkling almost kindly eyes she looked down at him and turned aside she looked down on him both literally and figuratively still he persisted and triumphed  emmie raved and wept the secret flew abroad but matilda was silent and unmoved hadrian was quiet and satisfied and nipped with fear also but he held out against his fear mr rockley was very ill but unchanged  on the third day the marriage took place matilda and hadrian drove straight home from the registrar and went straight into the room of the dying man his face lit up with a clear twinkling smile  hadrianyouve got her he said a little hoarsely  yes said hadrian who was pale round the gills  ay my lad im glad youre mine replied the dying man then he turned his eyes closely on matilda  lets look at you matilda he said then his voice went strange and unrecognizable kiss me he said  she stooped and kissed him she had never kissed him before not since she was a tiny child but she was quiet very still  kiss him the dying man said  obediently matilda put forward her mouth and kissed the young husband  thats right thats right murmured the dying man     samson and delilah   a man got down from the motoromnibus that runs from penzance to st justinpenwith and turned northwards uphill towards the polestar it was only half past six but already the stars were out a cold little wind was blowing from the sea and the crystalline threepulse flash of the lighthouse below the cliffs beat rhythmically in the first darkness  the man was alone he went his way unhesitating but looked from side to side with cautious curiosity tall ruined powerhouses of tinmines loomed in the darkness from time to time like remnants of some bygone civilization the lights of many miners cottages scattered on the hilly darkness twinkled desolate in their disorder yet twinkled with the lonely homeliness of the celtic night  he tramped steadily on always watchful with curiosity he was a tall wellbuilt man apparently in the prime of life his shoulders were square and rather stiff he leaned forwards a little as he went from the hips like a man who must stoop to lower his height but he did not stoop his shoulders he bent his straight back from the hips  now and again short stump thicklegged figures of cornish miners passed him and he invariably gave them goodnight as if to insist that he was on his own ground he spoke with the westcornish intonation and as he went along the dreary road looking now at the lights of the dwellings on land now at the lights away to sea vessels veering round in sight of the longships lighthouse the whole of the atlantic ocean in darkness and space between him and america he seemed a little excited and pleased with himself watchful thrilled veering along in a sense of mastery and of power in conflict  the houses began to close on the road he was entering the straggling formless desolate mining village that he knew of old on the left was a little space set back from the road and cosy lights of an inn there it was he peered up at the sign the tinners rest but he could not make out the name of the proprietor he listened there was excited talking and laughing a womans voice laughing shrilly among the mens  stooping a little he entered the warmlylit bar the lamp was burning a buxom woman rose from the whitescrubbed deal table where the black and white and red cards were scattered and several men miners lifted their faces from the game  the stranger went to the counter averting his face his cap was pulled down over his brow  goodevening said the landlady in her rather ingratiating voice  goodevening a glass of ale  a glass of ale repeated the landlady suavely cold nightbut bright  yes the man assented laconically then he added when nobody expected him to say any more seasonable weather  quite seasonable quite said the landlady thank you  the man lifted his glass straight to his lips and emptied it he put it down again on the zinc counter with a click  lets have another he said  the woman drew the beer and the man went away with his glass to the second table near the fire the woman after a moments hesitation took her seat again at the table with the cardplayers she had noticed the man a big fine fellow well dressed a stranger  but he spoke with that cornishyankee accent she accepted as the natural twang among the miners  the stranger put his foot on the fender and looked into the fire he was handsome well coloured with welldrawn cornish eyebrows and the usual dark bright mindless cornish eyes he seemed abstracted in thought then he watched the cardparty  the woman was buxom and healthy with dark hair and small quick brown eyes she was bursting with life and vigour the energy she threw into the game of cards excited all the men they shouted and laughed and the woman held her breast shrieking with laughter  oh my itll be the death o me she panted now come on mr

khaki a short stumpy sergeant of middle age a young corporal and two young privates the woman leaned back in her chair  oh my she cried if there isnt the boys back looking perished i believe  perished ma exclaimed the sergeant not yet  near enough said a young private uncouthly  the woman got up  im sure you are my dears youll be wanting your suppers ill be bound  we could do with em  lets have a wet first said the sergeant  the woman bustled about getting the drinks the soldiers moved to the fire spreading out their hands  have your suppers in here will you she said or in the kitchen  lets have it here said the sergeant more cosierif you dont mind  you shall have it where you like boys where you like  she disappeared in a minute a girl of about sixteen came in she was tall and fresh with dark young expressionless eyes and welldrawn brows and the immature softness and mindlessness of the sensuous celtic type  ho maryann evenin maryann hows maryann now came the multiple greeting  she replied to everybody in a soft voice a strange soft aplomb that was very attractive and she moved round with rather mechanical attractive movements as if her thoughts were elsewhere but she had always this dim farawayness in her bearing a sort of modesty the strange man by the fire watched her curiously there was an alert inquisitive mindless curiosity on his wellcoloured face  ill have a bit of supper with you if i might he said  she looked at him with her clear unreasoning eyes just like the eyes of some nonhuman creature  ill ask mother she said her voice was softbreathing gently singsong  when she came in again  yes she said almost whispering what will you have  what have you got he said looking up into her face  theres cold meat  thats for me then  the stranger sat at the end of the table and ate with the tired quiet soldiers now the landlady was interested in him her brow was knit rather tense there was a look of panic in her large healthy face but her small brown eyes were fixed most dangerously she was a big woman but her eyes were small and tense she drew near the stranger she wore a rather loudpatterned flannelette blouse and a dark skirt  what will you have to drink with your supper she asked and there was a new dangerous note in her voice  he moved uneasily  oh ill go on with ale  she drew him another glass then she sat down on the bench at the table with him and the soldiers and fixed him with her attention  youve come from st just have you she said  he looked at her with those clear dark inscrutable cornish eyes and answered at length  no from penzance  penzancebut youre not thinking of going back there tonight  nono  he still looked at her with those wide clear eyes that seemed like very bright agate her anger began to rise it was seen on her brow yet her voice was still suave and deprecating  i thought notbut youre not living in these parts are you  nono im not living here he was always slow in answering as if something intervened between him and any outside question  oh i see she said youve got relations down here  again he looked straight into her eyes as if looking her into silence  yes he said  he did not say any more she rose with a flounce the anger was tight on her brow there was no more laughing and cardplaying that evening though she kept up her motherly suave goodhumoured way with the men but they knew her they were all afraid of her  the supper was finished the table cleared the stranger did not go two of the young soldiers went off to bed with their cheery  goodnight ma goodnight maryann  the stranger talked a little to the sergeant about the war which was in its first year about the new army a fragment of which was quartered in this district about america  the landlady darted looks at him from her small eyes minute by minute the electric storm welled in her bosom as still he did not go she was quivering with suppressed violent passion something frightening and abnormal she could not sit still for a moment her heavy form seemed to flash with sudden involuntary movements as the minutes passed by and still he sat there and the tension on her heart grew unbearable she watched the hands of the dock move on three of the soldiers had gone to bed only the cropheaded terrierlike old sergeant remained  the landlady sat behind the bar fidgeting spasmodically with the newspaper she looked again at the clock at last it was five minutes to ten  gentlementhe enemy she said in her diminished furious voice time please time my dears and goodnight all  the men began to drop out with a brief goodnight it was a minute to ten the landlady rose  come she said im shutting the door  the last of the miners passed out she stood stout and menacing holding the door still the stranger sat on by the fire his black overcoat opened smoking  were closed now sir came the perilous narrowed voice of the landlady  the little doglike hardheaded sergeant touched the arm of the stranger  closing time he said  the stranger turned round in his seat and his quickmoving dark jewellike eyes went from the sergeant to the landlady  im stopping here tonight he said in his laconic cornishyankee accent  the landlady seemed to tower her eyes lifted strangely frightening  oh indeed she cried oh indeed and whose orders are those may i ask  he looked at her again  my orders he said  involuntarily she shut the door and advanced like a great dangerous bird her voice rose there was a touch of hoarseness in it  and what might your orders be if you please she cried who might you be to give orders in the house  he sat still watching her  you know who i am he said at least i know who you are  oh you do oh do you and who am i then if youll be so good as to tell me  he stared at her with his bright dark eyes  youre my missis you are he said and you know it as well as i do  she started as if something had exploded in her  her eyes lifted and flared madly  do i know it indeed she cried i know no such thing i know no such thing do you think a mans going to walk into this bar and tell me offhand im his missis and im going to believe himi say to you whoever you may be youre mistaken i know myself for no missis of yours and ill thank you to go out of this house this minute before i get those that will put you out  the man rose to his feet stretching his head towards her a little he was a handsomely built cornishman in the prime of life  what you say eh you dont know me he said in his singsong voice emotionless but rather smothered and pressing it reminded one of the girls i should know you anywhere you see i should i shouldnt have to look twice to know you you see you see now dont you  the woman was baffled  so you may say she replied staccato so you may say thats easy enough my names known and respected by most people for ten miles round but i dont know you  her voice ran to sarcasm i cant say i know you youre a perfect stranger to me and i dont believe ive ever set eyes on you before tonight  her voice was very flexible and sarcastic  yes you have replied the man in his reasonable way yes you have your names my name and that girl maryann is my girl shes my daughter youre my missis right enough as sure as im willie nankervis  he spoke as if it were an accepted fact his face was handsome with a strange watchful alertness and a fundamental fixity of intention that maddened her  you villain she cried you villain to come to this house and dare to speak to me you villain you downright rascal  he looked at her  ay he said unmoved all that he was uneasy before her only he was not afraid of her there was something impenetrable about him like his eyes which were as bright as agate  she towered and drew near to him menacingly  youre going out of this house arent youshe stamped her foot in sudden madness this minute  he watched her he knew she wanted to strike him  no he said with suppressed emphasis ive told you im stopping here  he was afraid of her personality but it did not alter him she wavered her small tawnybrown eyes concentrated in a point of vivid sightless fury like a tigers the man was wincing but he stood his ground then she bethought herself she would gather her forces  well see whether youre stopping here she said and she turned with a curious frightening lifting of her eyes and surged out of the room the man listening heard her go upstairs heard her tapping at a bedroom door heard her saying do you mind coming down a minute boys i want you im in trouble  the man in the bar took off his cap and his black overcoat and threw them on the seat behind him his black hair was short and touched with grey at the temples he wore a wellcut wellfitting suit of dark grey american in style and a turndown collar he looked welltodo a fine solid figure of a man the rather rigid look of the shoulders came from his having had his collarbone twice broken in the mines  the little terrier of a sergeant in dirty khaki looked at him furtively  shes your missis he asked jerking his head in the direction of the departed woman  yes she is barked the man shes that sure enough  not seen her for a long time havent ye  sixteen years come march month  hm  and the sergeant laconically resumed his smoking  the landlady was coming back followed by the three young soldiers who entered rather sheepishly in trousers and shirt and stockingfeet the woman stood histrionically at the end of the bar and exclaimed  that man refuses to leave the house claims hes stopping the night here you know very well i have no bed dont you and this house doesnt accommodate travellers yet hes going to stop in spite of all but not while ive a drop of blood in my body that i declare with my dying breath and not if you men are worth the name of men and will help a woman as has no one to help her  her eyes sparkled her face was flushed pink she was drawn up like an amazon  the young soldiers did not quite know what to do they looked at the man they looked at the sergeant one of them looked down and fastened his braces on the second button  what say sergeant asked one whose face twinkled for a little devilment  man says hes husband to mrs nankervis said the sergeant  hes no husband of mine i declare i never set eyes on him before this night its a dirty trick nothing else its a dirty trick  why youre a liar saying you never set eyes on me before barked the man near the hearth youre married to me and that girl maryann you had by mewell enough you know it  the young soldiers looked on in delight the sergeant smoked imperturbed  yes sang the landlady slowly shaking her head in supreme sarcasm it sounds very pretty doesnt it but you see we dont believe a word of it and how are you going to prove it she smiled nastily  the man watched in silence for a moment then he said  it wants no proof  oh yes but it does oh yes but it does sir it wants a lot of proving sang the ladys sarcasm were not such gulls as all that to swallow your words whole  but he stood unmoved near the fire she stood with one hand resting on the zinccovered bar the sergeant sat with legs crossed smoking on the seat halfway between them the three young soldiers in their shirts and braces stood wavering in the gloom behind the bar there was silence  do you know anything of the whereabouts of your husband mrs nankervis is he still living asked the sergeant in his judicious fashion  suddenly the landlady began to cry great scalding tears that left the young men aghast  i know nothing of him she sobbed feeling for her pocket handkerchief he left me when maryann was a baby went mining to america and after about six months never wrote a line nor sent me a penny bit i cant say whether hes alive or dead the villain all ive heard of hims to the badand ive heard nothing for years an all now she sobbed violently  the goldenskinned handsome man near the fire watched her as she wept he was frightened he was troubled he was bewildered but none of his emotions altered him underneath  there was no sound in the room but the violent sobbing of the landlady the men one and all were overcome  dont you think as youd better go for tonight said the sergeant to the man with sweet reasonableness youd better leave it a bit and arrange something between you you cant have much claim on a woman i should imagine if its how she says and youve come down on her a bit too suddenlike  the landlady sobbed heartbrokenly the man watched her large breasts shaken they seemed to cast a spell over his mind  how ive treated her thats no matter he replied ive come back and im going to stop in my own homefor a bit anyhow there youve got it  a dirty action said the sergeant his face flushing dark a dirty action to come after deserting a woman for that number of years and want to force yourself on her a dirty actionas isnt allowed by the law  the landlady wiped her eyes  never you mind about law nor nothing cried the man in a strange strong voice im not moving out of this public tonight  the woman turned to the soldiers behind her and said in a wheedling sarcastic tone  are we going to stand it boysare we going to be done like this sergeant thomas by a scoundrel and a bully as has led a life beyond mention in those american miningcamps and then wants to come back and make havoc of a poor womans life and savings after having left her with a baby in arms to struggle as best she might its a crying shame if nobody will stand up for mea crying shame  the soldiers and the little sergeant were bristling the woman stooped and rummaged under the counter for a minute then unseen to the man away near the fire she threw out a plaited grass rope such as is used for binding bales and left it lying near the feet of the young soldiers in the gloom at the back of the bar  then she rose and fronted the situation  come now she said to the man in a reasonable coldlycoaxing tone put your coat on and leave us alone be a man and not worse than a brute of a german you can get a bed easy enough in st just and if youve nothing to pay for it sergeant would lend you a couple of shillings im sure he would  all eyes were fixed on the man he was looking down at the woman like a creature spellbound or possessed by some devils own intention  ive got money of my own he said dont you be frightened for your money ive plenty of that for the time  well then she coaxed in a cold almost sneering propitiation put your coat on and go where youre wantedbe a man not a brute of a german  she had drawn quite near to him in her challenging coaxing intentness he looked down at her with his bewitched face  no i shant he said i shant do no such thing youll put me up for tonight  shall i she cried and suddenly she flung her arms round him hung on to him with all her powerful weight calling to the soldiers get the rope boys and fasten him up alfredjohn quick now  the man reared looked round with maddened eyes and heaved his powerful body but the woman was powerful also and very heavy and was clenched with the determination of death her face with its exulting horribly vindictive look was turned up to him from his own breast he reached back his head frantically to get away from it meanwhile the young soldiers after having watched this frightful laocoon swaying for a moment stirred and the malicious one darted swiftly with the rope it was tangled a little  give me the end here cried the sergeant  meanwhile the big man heaved and struggled swung the woman round against the seat and the table in his convulsive effort to get free but she pinned down his arms like a cuttlefish wreathed heavily upon him and he heaved and swayed and they crashed about the room the soldiers hopping the furniture bumping  the young soldier had got the rope once round the brisk sergeant helping him the woman sank heavily lower they got the rope round several times in the struggle the victim fell over against the table the ropes tightened till they cut his arms the woman clung to his knees another soldier ran in a flash of genius and fastened the strange mans feet with the pair of braces seats had crashed over the table was thrown against the wall but the man was bound his arms pinned against his sides his feet tied he lay half fallen sunk against the table still for a moment  the woman rose and sank faint on to the seat against the wall her breast heaved she could not speak she thought she was going to die the bound man lay against the overturned table his coat all twisted and pulled up beneath the ropes leaving the loins exposed the soldiers stood around a little dazed but excited with the row  the man began to struggle again heaving instinctively against the ropes taking great deep breaths his face with its golden skin flushed dark and surcharged he heaved again the great veins in his neck stood out but it was no good he went relaxed then again suddenly he jerked his feet  another pair of braces william cried the excited soldier he threw himself on the legs of the bound man and managed to fasten the knees then again there was stillness they could hear the clock tick  the woman looked at the prostrate figure the strong straight limbs the strong back bound in subjection the wideeyed face that reminded her of a calf tied in a sack in a cart only its head stretched dumbly backwards and she triumphed  the boundup body began to struggle again she watched fascinated the muscles working the shoulders the hips the large clean thighs even now he might break the ropes she was afraid but the lively young soldier sat on the shoulders of the bound man and after a few perilous moments there was stillness again  now said the judicious sergeant to the bound man if we untie you will you promise to go off and make no more trouble  youll not untie him in here cried the woman i wouldnt trust him as far as i could blow him  there was silence  we might carry him outside and undo him there said the soldier then we could get the policeman if he made any bother  yes said the sergeant we could do that then again in an altered almost severe tone to the prisoner if we undo you outside will you take your coat and go without creating any more disturbance  but the prisoner would not answer he only lay with wide dark bright eyes like a bound animal there was a space of perplexed silence  well then do as you say said the woman irritably carry him out amongst you and let us shut up the house  they did so picking up the bound man the four soldiers staggered clumsily into the silent square in front of the inn the woman following with the cap and the overcoat the young soldiers quickly unfastened the braces from the prisoners legs and they hopped indoors they were in their stockingfeet and outside the stars flashed cold they stood in the doorway watching the man lay quite still on the cold ground  now said the sergeant in a subdued voice ill loosen the knot and he can work himself free if you go in missis  she gave a last look at the dishevelled bound man as he sat on the ground then she went indoors followed quickly by the sergeant then they were heard locking and barring the door  the man seated on the ground outside worked and strained at the rope but it was not so easy to undo himself even now so with hands bound making an effort he got on his feet and went and worked the cord against the rough edge of an old wall the rope being of a kind of plaited grass soon frayed and broke and he freed himself he had various contusions his arms were hurt and bruised from the bonds he rubbed them slowly then he pulled his clothes straight stooped put on his cap struggled into his overcoat and walked away  the stars were very brilliant clear as crystal the beam from the lighthouse under the cliffs struck rhythmically on the night dazed the man walked along the road past the churchyard then he stood leaning up against a wall for a long time  he was roused because his feet were so cold so he pulled himself together and turned again in the silent night back towards the inn  the bar was in darkness but there was a light in the kitchen he hesitated then very quietly he tried the door  he was surprised to find it open he entered and quietly closed it behind him then he went down the step past the barcounter and through to the lighted doorway of the kitchen there sat his wife planted in front of the range where a furze fire was burning she sat in a chair full in front of the range her knees wide apart on the fender she looked over her shoulder at him as he entered but she did not speak then she stared in the fire again  it was a small narrow kitchen he dropped his cap on the table that was covered with yellowish american cloth and took a seat with his back to the wall near the oven his wife still sat with her knees apart her feet on the steel fender and stared into the fire motionless her skin was smooth and rosy in the firelight everything in the house was very clean and bright the man sat silent too his head dropped and thus they remained  it was a question who would speak first the woman leaned forward and poked the ends of the sticks in between the bars of the range he lifted his head and looked at her  others gone to bed have they he asked  but she remained closed in silence  s a cold night out he said as if to himself  and he laid his large yet wellshapen workmans hand on the top of the stove that was polished black and smooth as velvet she would not look at him yet she glanced out of the corners of her eyes  his eyes were fixed brightly on her the pupils large and electric like those of a cat  i should have picked you out among thousands he said though youre bigger than id have believed fine flesh youve made  she was silent for some time then she turned in her chair upon him  what do you think of yourself she said coming back on me like this after over fifteen years you dont think ive not heard of you neither in butte city and elsewhere  he was watching her with his clear translucent unchallenged eyes  yes he said chaps comes an goesive heard tell of you from time to time  she drew herself up  and what lies have you heard about me she demanded superbly  i dunno as ive heard any lies at allcept as you was getting on very well like  his voice ran warily and detached her anger stirred again in her violently but she subdued it because of the danger there was in him and more perhaps because of the beauty of his head and his level drawn brows which she could not bear to forfeit  thats more than i can say of you she said ive heard more harm than good about you  ay i dessay he said looking in the fire it was a long time since he had seen the furze burning he said to himself there was a silence during which she watched his face  do you call yourself a man she said more in contemptuous reproach than in anger leave a woman as youve left me you dont care to whatand then to turn up in this fashion without a word to say for yourself  he stirred in his chair planted his feet apart and resting his arms on his knees looked steadily into the fire without answering so near to her was his head and the close black hair she could scarcely refrain from starting away as if it would bite her  do you call that the action of a man she repeated  no he said reaching and poking the bits of wood into the fire with his fingers i didnt call it anything as i know of its no good calling things by any names whatsoever as i know of  she watched him in his actions there was a longer and longer pause between each speech though neither knew it  i wonder what you think of yourself she exclaimed with vexed emphasis i wonder what sort of a fellow you take yourself to be she was really perplexed as well as angry  well he said lifting his head to look at her i guess ill answer for my own faults if everybody elsell answer for theirs  her heart beat fiery hot as he lifted his face to her she breathed heavily averting her face almost losing her selfcontrol  and what do you take me to be she cried in real helplessness  his face was lifted watching her watching her soft averted face and the softly heaving mass of her breasts  i take you he said with that laconic truthfulness which exercised such power over her to be the deuce of a fine womandarn me if youre not as fine a built woman as ive seen handsome with it as well i shouldnt have expected you to put on such handsome flesh struth i shouldnt  her heart beat fiery hot as he watched her with those bright agate eyes fixedly  been very handsome to you for fifteen years my sakes she replied  he made no answer to this but sat with his bright quick eyes upon her  then he rose she started involuntarily but he only said in his laconic measured way  its warm in here now  and he pulled off his overcoat throwing it on the table she sat as if slightly cowed whilst he did so  them ropes has given my arms something by gaard he drawled feeling his arms with his hands  still she sat in her chair before him slightly cowed  you was sharp wasnt you to catch me like that eh he smiled slowly by gaard you had me fixed proper proper you had darn me you fixed me up properproper you did  he leaned forwards in his chair towards her  i dont think no worse of you for it no darned if i do fine pluck in a womans what i admire that i do indeed  she only gazed into the fire  we fet from the start we did and my word you begin again quick the minute you see me you did darn me you was too sharp for me a darn fine woman puts up a darn good fight darn me if i could find a woman in all the darn states as could get me down like that wonderful fine woman you be truth to say at this minute  she only sat glowering into the fire  as grand a pluck as a man could wish to find in a woman true as im here he said reaching forward his hand and tentatively touching her between her full warm breasts quietly  she started and seemed to shudder but his hand insinuated itself between her breasts as she continued to gaze in the fire  and dont you think ive come back here abegging he said ive more than one thousand pounds to my name i have and a bit of a fight for a howdedo pleases me that it do but that doesnt mean as youre going to deny as youre my missis     the primrose path   a young man came out of the victoria station looking undecidedly at the taxicabs darkred and black pressing against the kerb under the glassroof several men in greatcoats and brass buttons jerked themselves erect to catch his attention at the same time keeping an eye on the other people as they filtered through the open doorways of the station berry however was occupied by one of the men a big burly fellow whose blue eyes glared back and whose redbrown moustache bristled in defiance  do you want a cab sir the man asked in a halfmocking challenging voice  berry hesitated still  are you daniel sutton he asked  yes replied the other defiantly with uneasy conscience  then you are my uncle said berry  they were alike in colouring and somewhat in features but the taxi driver was a powerful wellfleshed man who glared at the world aggressively being really on the defensive against his own heart his nephew of the same height was thin welldressed quiet and indifferent in his manner and yet they were obviously kin  and who the devil are you asked the taxi driver  im daniel berry replied the nephew  well im damnednever saw you since you were a kid  rather awkwardly at this late hour the two shook hands  how are you lad  all right i thought you were in australia  been back three monthsbought a couple of these damned thingshe kicked the tyre of his taxicab in affectionate disgust there was a moments silence  oh but im going back out there i cant stand this cankering rottenhearted hell of a country any more you want to come out to sydney with me lad thats the place for youbeautiful place oh you could wish for nothing better and money in it toohows your mother  she died at christmas said the young man  dead whatour anna the big mans eyes stared and he recoiled in fear god lad he said thats three of em gone  the two men looked away at the people passing along the pale grey pavements under the wall of trinity church  well strike me lucky said the taxi driver at last out of breath she wor th best o th bunch of em i see nowt nor hear nowt from any of emtheyre not worth it ill be damned if they areour sermonlapping adela and maud he looked scornfully at his nephew but she was the best of em our anna was thats a fact  he was talking because he was afraid  an after a hard life like shed had how old was she lad  fiftyfive  fiftyfive  he hesitated then in a rather hushed voice he asked the question that frightened him  and what was it then  cancer  cancer again like julia i never knew there was cancer in our family oh my good god our poor anna after the life shed hadwhat lad do you see any god at the back of thatim damned if i do  he was glaring very blueeyed and fierce at his nephew berry lifted his shoulders slightly  god went on the taxi driver in a curious intense tone youve only to look at the folk in the street to know theres nothing keeps it going but gravitation look at em look at hima mongrellooking man was nosing past wouldnt he murder you for your watchchain but that hes afraid of society hes got it in him look at em  berry watched the townspeople go by and sensitively feeling his uncles antipathy it seemed he was watching a sort of danse macabre of ugly criminals  did you ever see such a godforsaken crew creeping about it gives you the very horrors to look at em i sit in this damned car and watch em till i can tell you i feel like running the cab amuck among em and running myself to kingdom come  berry wondered at this outburst he knew his uncle was the blacksheep the youngest the darling of his mothers family he knew him to be at outs with respectability mixing with the looser sporting type all betting and drinking and showing dogs and birds and racing as a critic of life however he did not know him but the young man felt curiously understanding he uses words like i do he talks nearly as i talk except that i shouldnt say those things but i might feel like that in myself if i went a certain road  ive got to go to watmore he said can you take me  when dyou want to go asked the uncle fiercely  now  come on then what dyer stand gassin on th causeway for  the nephew took his seat beside the driver the cab began to quiver then it started forward with a whirr the uncle his hands and feet acting mechanically kept his blue eyes fixed on the highroad into whose traffic the car was insinuating its way berry felt curiously as if he were sitting beside an older development of himself his mind went back to his mother she had been twenty years older than this brother of hers whom she had loved so dearly he was one of the most affectionate little lads and such a curly head i could never have believed he would grow into the great coarse bully he isfor hes nothing else my father made a god of himwell its a good thing his father is dead he got in with that sporting gang thats what did it things were made too easy for him and so he thought of no one but himself and this is the result  not that joky sutton was so very black a sheep he had lived idly till he was eighteen then had suddenly married a young beautiful girl with clear brows and dark grey eyes a factory girl having taken her to live with his parents he lover of dogs and pigeons went on to the staff of a sporting paper but his wife was without uplift or warmth though they made money enough their house was dark and cold and uninviting he had two or three dogs and the whole attic was turned into a great pigeonhouse he and his wife lived together roughly with no warmth no refinement no touch of beauty anywhere except that she was beautiful he was a blustering impetuous man she was rather cold in her soul did not care about anything very much was rather capable and close with money and she had a common accent in her speech he outdid her a thousand times in coarse language and yet that cold twang in her voice tortured him with shame that he stamped down in bullying and in becoming more violent in his own speech  only his dogs adored him and to them and to his pigeons he talked with rough yet curiously tender caresses while they leaped and fluttered for joy  after he and his wife had been married for seven years a little girl was born to them then later another but the husband and wife drew no nearer together she had an affection for her children almost like a cool governess he had an emotional mans fear of sentiment which helped to nip his wife from putting out any shoots he treated his children roughly and pretended to think it a good job when one was adopted by a welltodo maternal aunt but in his soul he hated his wife that she could give away one of his children for after her cool fashion she loved him with a chaos of a man such as he she had no chance of being anything but cold and hard poor thing for she did love him  in the end he fell absurdly and violently in love with a rather sentimental young woman who read browning he made his wife an allowance and established a new ménage with the young lady shortly after emigrating with her to australia meanwhile his wife had gone to live with a publican a widower with whom she had had one of those curious tacit understandings of which quiet women are capable something like an arrangement for provision in the future  this was as much as the nephew knew he sat beside his uncle wondering how things stood at the present they raced lightly out past the cemetery and along the boulevard then turned into the rather grimy country the mud flew out on either side there was a fine mist of rain which blew in their faces berry covered himself up  in the lanes the high hedges shone black with rain the silvery grey sky faintly dappled spread wide over the low green land the elder man glanced fiercely up the road then turned his red face to his nephew  and howre you going on lad he said loudly berry noticed that his uncle was slightly uneasy of him it made him also uncomfortable the elder man had evidently something pressing on his soul  who are you living with in town asked the nephew have you gone back to aunt maud  no barked the uncle she wouldnt have me i offered toi want tobut she wouldnt  youre alone then  no im not alone  he turned and glared with his fierce blue eyes at his nephew but said no more for some time the car ran on through the mud under the wet wall of the park  that other devil tried to poison me suddenly shouted the elder man the one i went to australia with at which in spite of himself the younger smiled in secret  how was that he asked  wanted to get rid of me she got in with another fellow on the ship by jove i was bad  whereon the ship  no bellowed the other no that was in wellington new zealand i was bad and got lower an lowercouldnt think what was up i could hardly crawl about as certain as im here she was poisoning me to get to th other chapim certain of it  and what did you do  i cleared outwent to sydney  and left her  yes i thought begod id better clear out if i wanted to live  and you were all right in sydney  better in no timei know she was putting poison in my coffee  hm  there was a glum silence the driver stared at the road ahead fixedly managing the car as if it were a live thing the nephew felt that his uncle was afraid quite stupefied with fear fear of life of death of himself  youre in rooms then asked the nephew  no im in a house of my own said the uncle defiantly wi th best little woman in th midlands shes a marvelwhy dont you come an see us  i will who is she  oh shes a good girla beautiful little thing i was clean gone on her first time i saw her an she was on me her mother lives with usrespectable girl none o your  and how old is she  how old is sheshes twentyone  poor thing  shes right enough  youd marry hergetting a divorce  i shall marry her  there was a little antagonism between the two men  wheres aunt maud asked the younger  shes at the railway armswe passed it just against rollins mill crossing they sent me a note this morning to go an see her when i can spare time shes got consumption  good lord are you going  yes  but again berry felt that his uncle was afraid  the young man got through his commission in the village had a drink with his uncle at the inn and the two were returning home the elder mans subject of conversation was australia as they drew near the town they grew silent thinking both of the publichouse at last they saw the gates of the railway crossing were closed before them  shant you call asked berry jerking his head in the direction of the inn which stood at the corner between two roads its sign hanging under a bare horsechestnut tree in front  i might as well come in an have a drink said the uncle  it had been raining all the morning so shallow pools of water lay about a brewers wagon with wet barrels and warmsmelling horses stood near the door of the inn everywhere seemed silent but for the rattle of trains at the crossing the two men went uneasily up the steps and into the bar the place was paddled with wet feet empty as the barman was heard approaching the uncle asked his usual bluster slightly hushed by fear  what yer goin ta have lad same as last time  a man entered evidently the proprietor he was goodlooking with a long heavy face and quick dark eyes his glance at sutton was swift a start a recognition and a withdrawal into heavy neutrality  how are yer dan he said scarcely troubling to speak  are yer george replied sutton hanging back my nephew dan berry give us red seal george  the publican nodded to the younger man and set the glasses on the bar he pushed forward the two glasses then leaned back in the dark corner behind the door his arms folded evidently preferring to get back from the watchful eyes of the nephew  s luck said sutton  the publican nodded in acknowledgement sutton and his nephew drank  why the hell dont you get that road mended in cinder hill said sutton fiercely pushing back his drivers cap and showing his shortcut bristling hair  they cant find it in their hearts to pull it up replied the publican laconically  find in their hearts they want settin in barrows an runnin up an down it till they cried for mercy  sutton put down his glass the publican renewed it with a sure hand at ease in whatsoever he did then he leaned back against the bar he wore no coat he stood with arms folded his chin on his chest his long moustache hanging his back was round and slack so that the lower part of his abdomen stuck forward though he was not stout his cheek was healthy brownred and he was muscular yet there was about him this physical slackness a reluctance in his slow sure movements his eyes were keen under his dark brows but reluctant also as if he were gloomily apathetic  there was a halt the publican evidently would say nothing berry looked at the mahogany barcounter slopped with beer at the whiskybottles on the shelves sutton his cap pushed back showing a white brow above a weatherreddened face rubbed his cropped hair uneasily  the publican glanced round suddenly it seemed that only his dark eyes moved  going up he asked  and something perhaps his eyes indicated the unseen bedchamber  aythats what i came for replied sutton shifting nervously from one foot to the other shes been asking for me  this morning replied the publican neutral  then he put up a flap of the bar and turned away through the dark doorway behind sutton pulling off his cap showing a round shortcropped head which now was ducked forward followed after him the buttons holding the strap of his greatcoat behind glittering for a moment  they climbed the dark stairs the husband placing his feet carefully because of his big boots then he followed down the passage trying vaguely to keep a grip on his bowels which seemed to be melting away and definitely wishing for a neat brandy the publican opened a door sutton big and burly in his greatcoat went past him  the bedroom seemed light and warm after the passage there was a red eiderdown on the bed then making an effort sutton turned his eyes to see the sick woman he met her eyes direct dark dilated it was such a shock he almost started away for a second he remained in torture as if some invisible flame were playing on him to reduce his bones and fuse him down then he saw the sharp white edge of her jaw and the black hair beside the hollow cheek with a start he went towards the bed  hello maud he said why what ye been doin  the publican stood at the window with his back to the bed the husband like one condemned but on the point of starting away stood by the bedside staring in horror at his wife whose dilated grey eyes nearly all black now watched him wearily as if she were looking at something a long way off  going exceedingly pale he jerked up his head and stared at the wall over the pillows there was a little coloured picture of a bird perched on a bell and a nest among ivy leaves beneath it appealed to him made him wonder roused a feeling of childish magic in him they were wonderfully fresh green ivy leaves and nobody had seen the nest among them save him  then suddenly he looked down again at the face on the bed to try and recognize it he knew the white brow and the beautiful clear eyebrows that was his wife with whom he had passed his youth flesh of his flesh his himself then those tired eyes which met his again from a long way off disturbed him until he did not know where he was only the sunken cheeks and the mouth that seemed to protrude now were foreign to him and filled him with horror it seemed he lost his identity he was the young husband of the woman with the clear brows he was the married man fighting with her whose eyes watched him a little indifferently from a long way off and he was a child in horror of that protruding mouth  there came a crackling sound of her voice he knew she had consumption of the throat and braced himself hard to bear the noise  what was it maud he asked in panic  then the broken crackling voice came again he was too terrified of the sound of it to hear what was said there was a pause  youll take winnie the publicans voice interpreted from the window  dont you bother maud ill take her he said stupefying his mind so as not to understand  he looked curiously round the room it was not a bad bedroom light and warm there were many medicine bottles aggregated in a corner of the washstandand a bottle of three star brandy half full and there were also photographs of strange people on the chest of drawers it was not a bad room  again he started as if he were shot she was speaking he bent down but did not look at her  be good to her she whispered  when he realized her meaning that he should be good to their child when the mother was gone a blade went through his flesh  ill be good to her maud dont you bother he said beginning to feel shaky  he looked again at the picture of the bird it perched cheerfully under a blue sky with robust jolly ivy leaves near he was gathering his courage to depart he looked down but struggled hard not to take in the sight of his wifes face  i sll come again maud he said i hope youll go on all right is there anything as you want  there was an almost imperceptible shake of the head from the sick woman making his heart melt swiftly again then dragging his limbs he got out of the room and down the stairs  the landlord came after him  ill let you know if anything happens the publican said still laconic but with his eyes dark and swift  ay a right said sutton blindly he looked round for his cap which he had all the time in his hand then he got out of doors  in a moment the uncle and nephew were in the car jolting on the level crossing the elder man seemed as if something tight in his brain made him open his eyes wide and stare he held the steering wheel firmly he knew he could steer accurately to a hairs breadth glaring fixedly ahead he let the car go till it bounded over the uneven road there were three coalcarts in a string in an instant the car grazed past them almost biting the kerb on the other side sutton aimed his car like a projectile staring ahead he did not want to know to think to realize he wanted to be only the driver of that quick taxi  the town drew near suddenly there were allotmentgardens with darkpurple twiggy fruittrees and wet alleys between the hedges then suddenly the streets of dwellinghouses whirled close and the car was climbing the hill with an angry whirrupuptill they rode out on to the crest and could see the tramcars darkred and yellow threading their way round the corner below and all the traffic roaring between the shops  got anywhere to go asked sutton of his nephew  i was going to see one or two people  come an have a bit o dinner with us said the other  berry knew that his uncle wanted to be distracted so that he should not think nor realize the big man was running hard away from the horror of realization  all right berry agreed  the car went quickly through the town it ran up a long street nearly into the country again then it pulled up at a house that stood alone below the road  i sll be back in ten minutes said the uncle  the car went on to the garage berry stood curiously at the top of the stone stairs that led from the highroad down to the level of the house an old stone place the garden was dilapidated broken fruittrees leaned at a sharp angle down the steep bank right across the dim grey atmosphere in a kind of valley on the edge of the town new suburbpatches showed pinkish on the dark earth it was a kind of unresolved borderland  berry went down the steps through the broken black fence of the orchard long grass showed yellow the place seemed deserted he knocked then knocked again an elderly woman appeared she looked like a housekeeper at first she said suspiciously that mr sutton was not in  my uncle just put me down hell be in in ten minutes replied the visitor  oh are you the mr berry who is related to him exclaimed the elderly woman come income in  she was at once kindly and a little bit servile the young man entered it was an old house rather dark and sparsely furnished the elderly woman sat nervously on the edge of one of the chairs in a drawingroom that looked as if it were furnished from dismal relics of dismal homes and there was a little straggling attempt at conversation mrs greenwell was evidently a working class woman unused to service or to any formality  presently she gathered up courage to invite her visitor into the diningroom there from the table under the window rose a tall slim girl with a cat in her arms she was evidently a little more ladylike than was habitual to her but she had a gentle delicate small nature her brown hair almost covered her ears her dark lashes came down in shy awkwardness over her beautiful blue eyes she shook hands in a frank way yet she was shrinking evidently she was not sure how her position would affect her visitor and yet she was assured in herself shrinking and timid as she was  she must be a good deal in love with him thought berry  both women glanced shamefacedly at the roughly laid table evidently they ate in a rather rough and ready fashion  elaineshe had this poetic namefingered her cat timidly not knowing what to say or to do unable even to ask her visitor to sit down he noticed how her skirt hung almost flat on her hips she was young scarce developed a long slender thing her colouring was warm and exquisite  the elder woman bustled out to the kitchen berry fondled the terrier dogs that had come curiously to his heels and glanced out of the window at the wet deserted orchard  this room too was not well furnished and rather dark but there was a big red fire  he always has fox terriers he said  yes she answered showing her teeth in a smile  do you like them too  yesshe glanced down at the dogs i like tam better than sally  her speech always tailed off into an awkward silence  weve been to see aunt maud said the nephew  her eyes blue and scared and shrinking met his  dan had a letter he explained shes very bad  isnt it horrible she exclaimed her face crumbling up with fear  the old woman evidently a hardused rather downtrodden workmans wife came in with two soupplates she glanced anxiously to see how her daughter was progressing with the visitor  mother dans been to see maud said elaine in a quiet voice full of fear and trouble  the old woman looked up anxiously in question  i think she wanted him to take the child shes very bad i believe explained berry  oh we should take winnie cried elaine but both women seemed uncertain wavering in their position already berry could see that his uncle had bullied them as he bullied everybody but they were used to unpleasant men and seemed to keep at a distance  will you have some soup asked the mother humbly  she evidently did the work the daughter was to be a lady more or less always dressed and nice for when sutton came in  they heard him heavily running down the steps outside the dogs got up elaine seemed to forget the visitor it was as if she came into life yet she was nervous and afraid the mother stood as if ready to exculpate herself  sutton burst open the door big blustering wet in his immense grey coat he came into the diningroom  hello he said to his nephew making yourself at home  oh yes replied berry  hello jack he said to the girl got owt to grizzle about  what for she asked in a clear halfchallenging voice that had that peculiar twang almost petulant so female and so attractive yet she was defiant like a boy  its a wonder if you havent growled sutton and with a really intimate movement he stooped down and fondled his dogs though paying no attention to them then he stood up and remained with feet apart on the hearthrug his head ducked forward watching the girl he seemed abstracted as if he could only watch her his greatcoat hung open so that she could see his figure simple and human in the great husk of cloth she stood nervously with her hands behind her glancing at him unable to see anything else and he was scarcely conscious but of her his eyes were still strained and staring and as they followed the girl when longlimbed and languid she moved away it was as if he saw in her something impersonal the female not the woman  had your dinner he asked  we were just going to have it she replied with the same curious little vibration in her voice like the twang of a string  the mother entered bringing a saucepan from which she ladled soup into three plates  sit down lad said sutton you sit down jack an give me mine here  oh arent you coming to table she complained  no i tell you he snarled almost pretending to be disagreeable but she was slightly afraid even of the pretence which pleased and relieved him he stood on the hearthrug eating his soup noisily  arent you going to take your coat off she said its filling the place full of steam  he did not answer but with his head bent forward over the plate he ate his soup hastily to get it done with when he put down his empty plate she rose and went to him  do take your coat off dan she said and she took hold of the breast of his coat trying to push it back over his shoulder but she could not only the stare in his eyes changed to a glare as her hand moved over his shoulder he looked down into her eyes she became pale rather frightenedlooking and she turned her face away and it was drawn slightly with love and fear and misery she tried again to put off his coat her thin wrists pulling at it he stood solidly planted and did not look at her but stared straight in front she was playing with passion afraid of it and really wretched because it left her the person out of count yet she continued and there came into his bearing into his eyes the curious smile of passion pushing away even the deathhorror it was life stronger than death in him she stood close to his breast their eyes met and she was carried away  take your coat off dan she said coaxingly in a low tone meant for no one but him and she slid her hands on his shoulder and he yielded so that the coat was pushed back she had flushed and her eyes had grown very bright she got hold of the cuff of his coat gently he eased himself so that she drew it off then he stood in a thin suit which revealed his vigorous almost mature form  what a weight she exclaimed in a peculiar penetrating voice as she went out hugging the overcoat in a moment she came back  he stood still in the same position a frown over his fiercely staring eyes the pain the fear the horror in his breast were all burning away in the new fiercest flame of passion  get your dinner he said roughly to her  ive had all i want she said you come an have yours  he looked at the table as if he found it difficult to see things  i want no more he said  she stood close to his chest she wanted to touch him and to comfort him there was something about him now that fascinated her berry felt slightly ashamed that she seemed to ignore the presence of others in the room  the mother came in she glanced at sutton standing planted on the hearthrug his head ducked the heavy frown hiding his eyes there was a peculiar braced intensity about him that made the elder woman afraid suddenly he jerked his head round to his nephew  get on wi your dinner lad he said and he went to the door the dogs which had continually lain down and got up again uneasy now rose and watched the girl went after him saying clearly  what did you want dan  her slim quick figure was gone the door was closed behind her  there was silence the mother still more slavelike in her movement sat down in a low chair berry drank some beer  that girl will leave him he said to himself shell hate him like poison and serve him right then shell go off with somebody else  and she did     the horse dealers daughter   well mabel and what are you going to do with yourself asked joe with foolish flippancy he felt quite safe himself without listening for an answer he turned aside worked a grain of tobacco to the tip of his tongue and spat it out he did not care about anything since he felt safe himself  the three brothers and the sister sat round the desolate breakfast table attempting some sort of desultory consultation the mornings post had given the final tap to the family fortunes and all was over the dreary diningroom itself with its heavy mahogany furniture looked as if it were waiting to be done away with  but the consultation amounted to nothing there was a strange air of ineffectuality about the three men as they sprawled at table smoking and reflecting vaguely on their own condition the girl was alone a rather short sullenlooking young woman of twentyseven she did not share the same life as her brothers she would have been goodlooking save for the impassive fixity of her face bulldog as her brothers called it  there was a confused tramping of horses feet outside the three men all sprawled round in their chairs to watch beyond the dark hollybushes that separated the strip of lawn from the highroad they could see a cavalcade of shire horses swinging out of their own yard being taken for exercise this was the last time these were the last horses that would go through their hands the young men watched with critical callous look they were all frightened at the collapse of their lives and the sense of disaster in which they were involved left them no inner freedom  yet they were three fine wellset fellows enough joe the eldest was a man of thirtythree broad and handsome in a hot flushed way his face was red he twisted his black moustache over a thick finger his eyes were shallow and restless he had a sensual way of uncovering his teeth when he laughed and his bearing was stupid now he watched the horses with a glazed look of helplessness in his eyes a certain stupor of downfall  the great draughthorses swung past they were tied head to tail four of them and they heaved along to where a lane branched off from the highroad planting their great hoofs floutingly in the fine black mud swinging their great rounded haunches sumptuously and trotting a few sudden steps as they were led into the lane round the corner every movement showed a massive slumbrous strength and a stupidity which held them in subjection the groom at the head looked back jerking the leading rope and the calvalcade moved out of sight up the lane the tail of the last horse bobbed up tight and stiff held out taut from the swinging great haunches as they rocked behind the hedges in a motionlike sleep  joe watched with glazed hopeless eyes the horses were almost like his own body to him he felt he was done for now luckily he was engaged to a woman as old as himself and therefore her father who was steward of a neighbouring estate would provide him with a job he would marry and go into harness his life was over he would be a subject animal now  he turned uneasily aside the retreating steps of the horses echoing in his ears then with foolish restlessness he reached for the scraps of baconrind from the plates and making a faint whistling sound flung them to the terrier that lay against the fender he watched the dog swallow them and waited till the creature looked into his eyes then a faint grin came on his face and in a high foolish voice he said  you wont get much more bacon shall you you little b  the dog faintly and dismally wagged its tail then lowered his haunches circled round and lay down again  there was another helpless silence at the table joe sprawled uneasily in his seat not willing to go till the family conclave was dissolved fred henry the second brother was erect cleanlimbed alert he had watched the passing of the horses with more sangfroid if he was an animal like joe he was an animal which controls not one which is controlled he was master of any horse and he carried himself with a welltempered air of mastery but he was not master of the situations of life he pushed his coarse brown moustache upwards off his lip and glanced irritably at his sister who sat impassive and inscrutable  youll go and stop with lucy for a bit shant you he asked the girl did not answer  i dont see what else you can do persisted fred henry  go as a skivvy joe interpolated laconically  the girl did not move a muscle  if i was her i should go in for training for a nurse said malcolm the youngest of them all he was the baby of the family a young man of twentytwo with a fresh jaunty museau  but mabel did not take any notice of him they had talked at her and round her for so many years that she hardly heard them at all  the marble clock on the mantelpiece softly chimed the halfhour the dog rose uneasily from the hearthrug and looked at the party at the breakfast table but still they sat on in ineffectual conclave  oh all right said joe suddenly à propos of nothing ill get a move on  he pushed back his chair straddled his knees with a downward jerk to get them free in horsy fashion and went to the fire still he did not go out of the room he was curious to know what the others would do or say he began to charge his pipe looking down at the dog and saying in a high affected voice  going wi me going wi me are ter thart goin further than tha counts on just now dost hear  the dog faintly wagged its tail the man stuck out his jaw and covered his pipe with his hands and puffed intently losing himself in the tobacco looking down all the while at the dog with an absent brown eye the dog looked up at him in mournful distrust joe stood with his knees stuck out in real horsy fashion  have you had a letter from lucy fred henry asked of his sister  last week came the neutral reply  and what does she say  there was no answer  does she ask you to go and stop there persisted fred henry  she says i can if i like  well then youd better tell her youll come on monday  this was received in silence  thats what youll do then is it said fred henry in some exasperation  but she made no answer there was a silence of futility and irritation in the room malcolm grinned fatuously  youll have to make up your mind between now and next wednesday said joe loudly or else find yourself lodgings on the kerbstone  the face of the young woman darkened but she sat on immutable  heres jack fergusson exclaimed malcolm who was looking aimlessly out of the window  where exclaimed joe loudly  just gone past  coming in  malcolm craned his neck to see the gate  yes he said  there was a silence mabel sat on like one condemned at the head of the table then a whistle was heard from the kitchen the dog got up and barked sharply joe opened the door and shouted  come on  after a moment a young man entered he was muffled up in overcoat and a purple woollen scarf and his tweed cap which he did not remove was pulled down on his head he was of medium height his face was rather long and pale his eyes looked tired  hello jack well jack exclaimed malcolm and joe fred henry merely said jack  whats doing asked the newcomer evidently addressing fred henry  same weve got to be out by wednesdaygot a cold  i havegot it bad too  why dont you stop in  me stop in when i cant stand on my legs perhaps i shall have a chance the young man spoke huskily he had a slight scotch accent  its a knockout isnt it said joe boisterously if a doctor goes round croaking with a cold looks bad for the patients doesnt it  the young doctor looked at him slowly  anything the matter with you then he asked sarcastically  not as i know of damn your eyes i hope not why  i thought you were very concerned about the patients wondered if you might be one yourself  damn it no ive never been patient to no flaming doctor and hope i never shall be returned joe  at this point mabel rose from the table and they all seemed to become aware of her existence she began putting the dishes together the young doctor looked at her but did not address her he had not greeted her she went out of the room with the tray her face impassive and unchanged  when are you off then all of you asked the doctor  im catching the elevenforty replied malcolm are you goin down wi th trap joe  yes ive told you im going down wi th trap havent i  wed better be getting her in thenso long jack if i dont see you before i go said malcolm shaking hands  he went out followed by joe who seemed to have his tail between his legs  well this is the devils own exclaimed the doctor when he was left alone with fred henry going before wednesday are you  thats the orders replied the other  where to northampton  thats it  the devil exclaimed fergusson with quiet chagrin  and there was silence between the two  all settled up are you asked fergusson  about  there was another pause  well i shall miss yer freddy boy said the young doctor  and i shall miss thee jack returned the other  miss you like hell mused the doctor  fred henry turned aside there was nothing to say mabel came in again to finish clearing the table  what are you going to do then miss pervin asked fergusson going to your sisters are you  mabel looked at him with her steady dangerous eyes that always made him uncomfortable unsettling his superficial ease  no she said  well what in the name of fortune are you going to do say what you mean to do cried fred henry with futile intensity  but she only averted her head and continued her work she folded the white tablecloth and put on the chenille cloth  the sulkiest bitch that ever trod muttered her brother  but she finished her task with perfectly impassive face the young doctor watching her interestedly all the while then she went out  fred henry stared after her clenching his lips his blue eyes fixing in sharp antagonism as he made a grimace of sour exasperation  you could bray her into bits and thats all youd get out of her he said in a small narrowed tone  the doctor smiled faintly  whats she going to do then he asked  strike me if i know returned the other  there was a pause then the doctor stirred  ill be seeing you tonight shall i he said to his friend  aywheres it to be are we going over to jessdale  i dont know ive got such a cold on me ill come round to the moon and stars anyway  let lizzie and may miss their night for once eh  thats itif i feel as i do now  alls one  the two young men went through the passage and down to the back door together the house was large but it was servantless now and desolate at the back was a small bricked houseyard and beyond that a big square gravelled fine and red and having stables on two sides sloping dank winterdark fields stretched away on the open sides  but the stables were empty joseph pervin the father of the family had been a man of no education who had become a fairly large horse dealer the stables had been full of horses there was a great turmoil and comeandgo of horses and of dealers and grooms then the kitchen was full of servants but of late things had declined the old man had married a second time to retrieve his fortunes now he was dead and everything was gone to the dogs there was nothing but debt and threatening  for months mabel had been servantless in the big house keeping the home together in penury for her ineffectual brothers she had kept house for ten years but previously it was with unstinted means then however brutal and coarse everything was the sense of money had kept her proud confident the men might be foulmouthed the women in the kitchen might have bad reputations her brothers might have illegitimate children but so long as there was money the girl felt herself established and brutally proud reserved  no company came to the house save dealers and coarse men mabel had no associates of her own sex after her sister went away but she did not mind she went regularly to church she attended to her father and she lived in the memory of her mother who had died when she was fourteen and whom she had loved she had loved her father too in a different way depending upon him and feeling secure in him until at the age of fiftyfour he married again and then she had set hard against him now he had died and left them all hopelessly in debt  she had suffered badly during the period of poverty nothing however could shake the curious sullen animal pride that dominated each member of the family now for mabel the end had come still she would not cast about her she would follow her own way just the same she would always hold the keys of her own situation mindless and persistent she endured from day to day why should she think why should she answer anybody it was enough that this was the end and there was no way out she need not pass any more darkly along the main street of the small town avoiding every eye she need not demean herself any more going into the shops and buying the cheapest food this was at an end she thought of nobody not even of herself mindless and persistent she seemed in a sort of ecstasy to be coming nearer to her fulfilment her own glorification approaching her dead mother who was glorified  in the afternoon she took a little bag with shears and sponge and a small scrubbing brush and went out it was a grey wintry day with saddened darkgreen fields and an atmosphere blackened by the smoke of foundries not far off she went quickly darkly along the causeway heeding nobody through the town to the churchyard  there she always felt secure as if no one could see her although as a matter of fact she was exposed to the stare of everyone who passed along under the churchyard wall nevertheless once under the shadow of the great looming church among the graves she felt immune from the world reserved within the thick churchyard wall as in another country  carefully she clipped the grass from the grave and arranged the pinkywhite small chrysanthemums in the tin cross when this was done she took an empty jar from a neighbouring grave brought water and carefully most scrupulously sponged the marble headstone and the copingstone  it gave her sincere satisfaction to do this she felt in immediate contact with the world of her mother she took minute pains went through the park in a state bordering on pure happiness as if in performing this task she came into a subtle intimate connexion with her mother for the life she followed here in the world was far less real than the world of death she inherited from her mother  the doctors house was just by the church fergusson being a mere hired assistant was slave to the countryside as he hurried now to attend to the outpatients in the surgery glancing across the graveyard with his quick eye he saw the girl at her task at the grave she seemed so intent and remote it was like looking into another world some mystical element was touched in him he slowed down as he walked watching her as if spellbound  she lifted her eyes feeling him looking their eyes met and each looked again at once each feeling in some way found out by the other he lifted his cap and passed on down the road there remained distinct in his consciousness like a vision the memory of her face lifted from the tombstone in the churchyard and looking at him with slow large portentous eyes it was portentous her face it seemed to mesmerize him there was a heavy power in her eyes which laid hold of his whole being as if he had drunk some powerful drug he had been feeling weak and done before now the life came back into him he felt delivered from his own fretted daily self  he finished his duties at the surgery as quickly as might be hastily filling up the bottles of the waiting people with cheap drugs then in perpetual haste he set off again to visit several cases in another part of his round before teatime at all times he preferred to walk if he could but particularly when he was not well he fancied the motion restored him  the afternoon was falling it was grey deadened and wintry with a slow moist heavy coldness sinking in and deadening all the faculties but why should he think or notice he hastily climbed the hill and turned across the darkgreen fields following the black cindertrack in the distance across a shallow dip in the country the small town was clustered like smouldering ash a tower a spire a heap of low raw extinct houses and on the nearest fringe of the town sloping into the dip was oldmeadow the pervins house he could see the stables and the outbuildings distinctly as they lay towards him on the slope well he would not go there many more times another resource would be lost to him another place gone the only company he cared for in the alien ugly little town he was losing nothing but work drudgery constant hastening from dwelling to dwelling among the colliers and the ironworkers it wore him out but at the same time he had a craving for it it was a stimulant to him to be in the homes of the working people moving as it were through the innermost body of their life his nerves were excited and gratified he could come so near into the very lives of the rough inarticulate powerfully emotional men and women he grumbled he said he hated the hellish hole but as a matter of fact it excited him the contact with the rough stronglyfeeling people was a stimulant applied direct to his nerves  below oldmeadow in the green shallow soddened hollow of fields lay a square deep pond roving across the landscape the doctors quick eye detected a figure in black passing through the gate of the field down towards the pond he looked again it would be mabel pervin his mind suddenly became alive and attentive  why was she going down there he pulled up on the path on the slope above and stood staring he could just make sure of the small black figure moving in the hollow of the failing day he seemed to see her in the midst of such obscurity that he was like a clairvoyant seeing rather with the minds eye than with ordinary sight yet he could see her positively enough whilst he kept his eye attentive he felt if he looked away from her in the thick ugly falling dusk he would lose her altogether  he followed her minutely as she moved direct and intent like something transmitted rather than stirring in voluntary activity straight down the field towards the pond there she stood on the bank for a moment she never raised her head then she waded slowly into the water  he stood motionless as the small black figure walked slowly and deliberately towards the centre of the pond very slowly gradually moving deeper into the motionless water and still moving forward as the water got up to her breast then he could see her no more in the dusk of the dead afternoon  there he exclaimed would you believe it  and he hastened straight down running over the wet soddened fields pushing through the hedges down into the depression of callous wintry obscurity it took him several minutes to come to the pond he stood on the bank breathing heavily he could see nothing his eyes seemed to penetrate the dead water yes perhaps that was the dark shadow of her black clothing beneath the surface of the water  he slowly ventured into the pond the bottom was deep soft clay he sank in and the water clasped dead cold round his legs as he stirred he could smell the cold rotten clay that fouled up into the water it was objectionable in his lungs still repelled and yet not heeding he moved deeper into the pond the cold water rose over his thighs over his loins upon his abdomen the lower part of his body was all sunk in the hideous cold element and the bottom was so deeply soft and uncertain he was afraid of pitching with his mouth underneath he could not swim and was afraid  he crouched a little spreading his hands under the water and moving them round trying to feel for her the dead cold pond swayed upon his chest he moved again a little deeper and again with his hands underneath he felt all around under the water and he touched her clothing but it evaded his fingers he made a desperate effort to grasp it  and so doing he lost his balance and went under horribly suffocating in the foul earthy water struggling madly for a few moments at last after what seemed an eternity he got his footing rose again into the air and looked around he gasped and knew he was in the world then he looked at the water she had risen near him he grasped her clothing and drawing her nearer turned to take his way to land again  he went very slowly carefully absorbed in the slow progress he rose higher climbing out of the pond the water was now only about his legs he was thankful full of relief to be out of the clutches of the pond he lifted her and staggered on to the bank out of the horror of wet grey clay  he laid her down on the bank she was quite unconscious and running with water he made the water come from her mouth he worked to restore her he did not have to work very long before he could feel the breathing begin again in her she was breathing naturally he worked a little longer he could feel her live beneath his hands she was coming back he wiped her face wrapped her in his overcoat looked round into the dim darkgrey world then lifted her and staggered down the bank and across the fields  it seemed an unthinkably long way and his burden so heavy he felt he would never get to the house but at last he was in the stableyard and then in the houseyard he opened the door and went into the house in the kitchen he laid her down on the hearthrug and called the house was empty but the fire was burning in the grate  then again he kneeled to attend to her she was breathing regularly her eyes were wide open and as if conscious but there seemed something missing in her look she was conscious in herself but unconscious of her surroundings  he ran upstairs took blankets from a bed and put them before the fire to warm then he removed her saturated earthysmelling clothing rubbed her dry with a towel and wrapped her naked in the blankets then he went into the diningroom to look for spirits there was a little whisky he drank a gulp himself and put some into her mouth  the effect was instantaneous she looked full into his face as if she had been seeing him for some time and yet had only just become conscious of him  dr fergusson she said  what he answered  he was divesting himself of his coat intending to find some dry clothing upstairs he could not bear the smell of the dead clayey water and he was mortally afraid for his own health  what did i do she asked  walked into the pond he replied he had begun to shudder like one sick and could hardly attend to her her eyes remained full on him he seemed to be going dark in his mind looking back at her helplessly the shuddering became quieter in him his life came back in him dark and unknowing but strong again  was i out of my mind she asked while her eyes were fixed on him all the time  maybe for the moment he replied he felt quiet because his strength had come back the strange fretful strain had left him  am i out of my mind now she asked  are you he reflected a moment no he answered truthfully i dont see that you are he turned his face aside he was afraid now because he felt dazed and felt dimly that her power was stronger than his in this issue and she continued to look at him fixedly all the time can you tell me where i shall find some dry things to put on he asked  did you dive into the pond for me she asked  no he answered i walked in but i went in overhead as well  there was silence for a moment he hesitated he very much wanted to go upstairs to get into dry clothing but there was another desire in him and she seemed to hold him his will seemed to have gone to sleep and left him standing there slack before her but he felt warm inside himself he did not shudder at all though his clothes were sodden on him  why did you she asked  because i didnt want you to do such a foolish thing he said  it wasnt foolish she said still gazing at him as she lay on the floor with a sofa cushion under her head it was the right thing to do i knew best then  ill go and shift these wet things he said but still he had not the power to move out of her presence until she sent him it was as if she had the life of his body in her hands and he could not extricate himself or perhaps he did not want to  suddenly she sat up then she became aware of her own immediate condition she felt the blankets about her she knew her own limbs for a moment it seemed as if her reason were going she looked round with wild eye as if seeking something he stood still with fear she saw her clothing lying scattered  who undressed me she asked her eyes resting full and inevitable on his face  i did he replied to bring you round  for some moments she sat and gazed at him awfully her lips parted  do you love me then she asked  he only stood and stared at her fascinated his soul seemed to melt  she shuffled forward on her knees and put her arms round him round his legs as he stood there pressing her breasts against his knees and thighs clutching him with strange convulsive certainty pressing his thighs against her drawing him to her face her throat as she looked up at him with flaring humble eyes of transfiguration triumphant in first possession  you love me she murmured in strange transport yearning and triumphant and confident you love me i know you love me i know  and she was passionately kissing his knees through the wet clothing passionately and indiscriminately kissing his knees his legs as if unaware of every thing  he looked down at the tangled wet hair the wild bare animal shoulders he was amazed bewildered and afraid he had never thought of loving her he had never wanted to love her when he rescued her and restored her he was a doctor and she was a patient he had had no single personal thought of her nay this introduction of the personal element was very distasteful to him a violation of his professional honour it was horrible to have her there embracing his knees it was horrible he revolted from it violently and yetand yethe had not the power to break away  she looked at him again with the same supplication of powerful love and that same transcendent frightening light of triumph in view of the delicate flame which seemed to come from her face like a light he was powerless and yet he had never intended to love her he had never intended and something stubborn in him could not give way  you love me she repeated in a murmur of deep rhapsodic assurance you love me  her hands were drawing him drawing him down to her he was afraid even a little horrified for he had really no intention of loving her yet her hands were drawing him towards her he put out his hand quickly to steady himself and grasped her bare shoulder a flame seemed to burn the hand that grasped her soft shoulder he had no intention of loving her his whole will was against his yielding it was horrible and yet wonderful was the touch of her shoulders beautiful the shining of her face was she perhaps mad he had a horror of yielding to her yet something in him ached also  he had been staring away at the door away from her but his hand remained on her shoulder she had gone suddenly very still he looked down at her her eyes were now wide with fear with doubt the light was dying from her face a shadow of terrible greyness was returning he could not bear the touch of her eyes question upon him and the look of death behind the question  with an inward groan he gave way and let his heart yield towards her a sudden gentle smile came on his face and her eyes which never left his face slowly slowly filled with tears he watched the strange water rise in her eyes like some slow fountain coming up and his heart seemed to burn and melt away in his breast  he could not bear to look at her any more he dropped on his knees and caught her head with his arms and pressed her face against his throat she was very still his heart which seemed to have broken was burning with a kind of agony in his breast and he felt her slow hot tears wetting his throat but he could not move  he felt the hot tears wet his neck and the hollows of his neck and he remained motionless suspended through one of mans eternities only now it had become indispensable to him to have her face pressed close to him he could never let her go again he could never let her head go away from the close clutch of his arm he wanted to remain like that for ever with his heart hurting him in a pain that was also life to him without knowing he was looking down on her damp soft brown hair  then as it were suddenly he smelt the horrid stagnant smell of that water and at the same moment she drew away from him and looked at him her eyes were wistful and unfathomable he was afraid of them and he fell to kissing her not knowing what he was doing he wanted her eyes not to have that terrible wistful unfathomable look  when she turned her face to him again a faint delicate flush was glowing and there was again dawning that terrible shining of joy in her eyes which really terrified him and yet which he now wanted to see because he feared the look of doubt still more  you love me she said rather faltering  yes the word cost him a painful effort not because it wasnt true but because it was too newly true the saying seemed to tear open again his newlytorn heart and he hardly wanted it to be true even now  she lifted her face to him and he bent forward and kissed her on the mouth gently with the one kiss that is an eternal pledge and as he kissed her his heart strained again in his breast he never intended to love her but now it was over he had crossed over the gulf to her and all that he had left behind had shrivelled and become void  after the kiss her eyes again slowly filled with tears she sat still away from him with her face drooped aside and her hands folded in her lap the tears fell very slowly there was complete silence he too sat there motionless and silent on the hearthrug the strange pain of his heart that was broken seemed to consume him that he should love her that this was love that he should be ripped open in this wayhim a doctorhow they would all jeer if they knewit was agony to him to think they might know  in the curious naked pain of the thought he looked again to her she was sitting there drooped into a muse he saw a tear fall and his heart flared hot he saw for the first time that one of her shoulders was quite uncovered one arm bare he could see one of her small breasts dimly because it had become almost dark in the room  why are you crying he asked in an altered voice  she looked up at him and behind her tears the consciousness of her situation for the first time brought a dark look of shame to her eyes  im not crying really she said watching him half frightened  he reached his hand and softly closed it on her bare arm  i love you i love you he said in a soft low vibrating voice unlike himself  she shrank and dropped her head the soft penetrating grip of his hand on her arm distressed her she looked up at him  i want to go she said i want to go and get you some dry things  why he said im all right  but i want to go she said and i want you to change your things  he released her arm and she wrapped herself in the blanket looking at him rather frightened and still she did not rise  kiss me she said wistfully  he kissed her but briefly half in anger  then after a second she rose nervously all mixed up in the blanket he watched her in her confusion as she tried to extricate herself and wrap herself up so that she could walk he watched her relentlessly as she knew and as she went the blanket trailing and as he saw a glimpse of her feet and her white leg he tried to remember her as she was when he had wrapped her in the blanket but then he didnt want to remember because she had been nothing to him then and his nature revolted from remembering her as she was when she was nothing to him  a tumbling muffled noise from within the dark house startled him then he heard her voicethere are clothes he rose and went to the foot of the stairs and gathered up the garments she had thrown down then he came back to the fire to rub himself down and dress he grinned at his own appearance when he had finished  the fire was sinking so he put on coal the house was now quite dark save for the light of a streetlamp that shone in faintly from beyond the holly trees he lit the gas with matches he found on the mantelpiece then he emptied the pockets of his own clothes and threw all his wet things in a heap into the scullery after which he gathered up her sodden clothes gently and put them in a separate heap on the coppertop in the scullery  it was six oclock on the clock his own watch had stopped he ought to go back to the surgery he waited and still she did not come down so he went to the foot of the stairs and called  i shall have to go  almost immediately he heard her coming down she had on her best dress of black voile and her hair was tidy but still damp she looked at himand in spite of herself smiled  i dont like you in those clothes she said  do i look a sight he answered  they were shy of one another  ill make you some tea she said  no i must go  must you and she looked at him again with the wide strained doubtful eyes and again from the pain of his breast he knew how he loved her he went and bent to kiss her gently passionately with his hearts painful kiss  and my hair smells so horrible she murmured in distraction and im so awful im so awful oh no im too awful and she broke into bitter heartbroken sobbing you cant want to love me im horrible  dont be silly dont be silly he said trying to comfort her kissing her holding her in his arms i want you i want to marry you were going to be married quickly quicklytomorrow if i can  but she only sobbed terribly and cried  i feel awful i feel awful i feel im horrible to you  no i want you i want you was all he answered blindly with that terrible intonation which frightened her almost more than her horror lest he should not want her     fanny and annie   flamelurid his face as he turned among the throng of flamelit and dark faces upon the platform in the light of the furnace she caught sight of his drifting countenance like a piece of floating fire and the nostalgia the doom of homecoming went through her veins like a drug his eternal face flamelit now the pulse and darkness of red fire from the furnace towers in the sky lighting the desultory industrial crowd on the wayside station lit him and went out  of course he did not see her flamelit and unseeing always the same with his meeting eyebrows his common cap and his redandblack scarf knotted round his throat not even a collar to meet her the flames had sunk there was shadow  she opened the door of her grimy branchline carriage and began to get down her bags the porter was nowhere of course but there was harry obscure on the outer edge of the little crowd missing her of course  here harry she called waving her umbrella in the twilight he hurried forward  thas come has ter he said in a sort of cheerful welcome she got down rather flustered and gave him a peck of a kiss  two suitcases she said  her soul groaned within her as he clambered into the carriage after her bags up shot the fire in the twilight sky from the great furnace behind the station she felt the red flame go across her face she had come back she had come back for good and her spirit groaned dismally she doubted if she could bear it  there on the sordid little station under the furnaces she stood tall and distinguished in her wellmade coat and skirt and her broad grey velour hat she held her umbrella her bead chatelaine and a little leather case in her greygloved hands while harry staggered out of the ugly little train with her bags  theres a trunk at the back she said in her bright voice but she was not feeling bright the twin black cones of the iron foundry blasted their skyhigh fires into the night the whole scene was lurid the train waited cheerfully it would wait another ten minutes she knew it it was all so deadly familiar  let us confess it at once she was a ladys maid thirty years old come back to marry her firstlove a foundry worker after having kept him dangling off and on for a dozen years why had she come back did she love him no she didnt pretend to she had loved her brilliant and ambitious cousin who had jilted her and who had died she had had other affairs which had come to nothing so here she was come back suddenly to marry her firstlove who had waitedor remained singleall these years  wont a porter carry those she said as harry strode with his workmans stride down the platform towards the guards van  i can manage he said  and with her umbrella her chatelaine and her little leather case she followed him  the trunk was there  well get heathers greengrocers cart to fetch it up he said  isnt there a cab said fanny knowing dismally enough that there wasnt  ill just put it aside o the pennyintheslot and heathers greengrocersll fetch it about half past eight he said  he seized the box by its two handles and staggered with it across the levelcrossing bumping his legs against it as he waddled then he dropped it by the red sweetmeats machine  will it be safe there she said  aysafe as houses he answered he returned for the two bags thus laden they started to plod up the hill under the great long black building of the foundry she walked beside himworkman of workmen he was trudging with that luggage the red lights flared over the deepening darkness from the foundry came the horrible slow clang clang clang of iron a great noise with an interval just long enough to make it unendurable  compare this with the arrival at gloucester the carriage for her mistress the dogcart for herself with the luggage the drive out past the river the pleasant trees of the carriageapproach and herself sitting beside arthur everybody so polite to her  she had come homefor good her heart nearly stopped beating as she trudged up that hideous and interminable hill beside the laden figure what a comedown what a comedown she could not take it with her usual bright cheerfulness she knew it all too well it is easy to bear up against the unusual but the deadly familiarity of an old stale past  he dumped the bags down under a lamppost for a rest there they stood the two of them in the lamplight passersby stared at her and gave goodnight to harry her they hardly knew she had become a stranger  theyre too heavy for you let me carry one she said  they begin to weigh a bit by the time youve gone a mile he answered  let me carry the little one she insisted  tha can hae it for a minute if ters a mind he said handing over the valise  and thus they arrived in the streets of shops of the little ugly town on top of the hill how everybody stared at her my word how they stared and the cinema was just going in and the queues were tailing down the road to the corner and everybody took full stock of her night harry shouted the fellows in an interested voice  however they arrived at her auntsa little sweetshop in a side street they pinged the doorbell and her aunt came running forward out of the kitchen  there you are child dying for a cup of tea im sure how are you  fannys aunt kissed her and it was all fanny could do to refrain from bursting into tears she felt so low perhaps it was her tea she wanted  youve had a drag with that luggage said fannys aunt to harry  ayim not sorry to put it down he said looking at his hand which was crushed and cramped by the bag handle  then he departed to see about heathers greengrocery cart  when fanny sat at tea her aunt a greyhaired fairfaced little woman looked at her with an admiring heart feeling bitterly sore for her for fanny was beautiful tall erect finely coloured with her delicately arched nose her rich brown hair her large lustrous grey eyes a passionate womana woman to be afraid of so proud so inwardly violent she came of a violent race  it needed a woman to sympathize with her men had not the courage poor fanny she was such a lady and so straight and magnificent and yet everything seemed to do her down every time she seemed to be doomed to humiliation and disappointment this handsome brilliantly sensitive woman with her nervous overwrought laugh  so youve really come back child said her aunt  i really have aunt said fanny  poor harry im not sure you know fanny that youre not taking a bit of an advantage of him  oh aunt hes waited so long he may as well have what hes waited for fanny laughed grimly  yes child hes waited so long that im not sure it isnt a bit hard on him you know i like him fannythough as you know quite well i dont think hes good enough for you and i think he thinks so himself poor fellow  dont you be so sure of that aunt harry is common but hes not humble he wouldnt think the queen was any too good for him if hed a mind to her  wellits as well if he has a proper opinion of himself  it depends what you call proper said fanny but hes got his good points  oh hes a nice fellow and i like him i do like him only as i tell you hes not good enough for you  ive made up my mind aunt said fanny grimly  yes mused the aunt they say all things come to him who waits  more than hes bargained for eh aunt laughed fanny rather bitterly  the poor aunt this bitterness grieved her for her niece  they were interrupted by the ping of the shopbell and harrys call of right but as he did not come in at once fanny feeling solicitous for him presumably at the moment rose and went into the shop she saw a cart outside and went to the door  and the moment she stood in the doorway she heard a womans common vituperative voice crying from the darkness of the opposite side of the road  thart theer ar ter ill shame thee mester ill shame thee see if i dunna  startled fanny stared across the darkness and saw a woman in a black bonnet go under one of the lamps up the side street  harry and bill heather had dragged the trunk off the little dray and she retreated before them as they came up the shop step with it  wheer shalt hae it asked harry  best take it upstairs said fanny  she went up first to light the gas  when heather had gone and harry was sitting down having tea and pork pie fanny asked  who was that woman shouting  nay i canna tell thee to somebody isd think replied harry fanny looked at him but asked no more  he was a fairhaired fellow of thirtytwo with a fair moustache he was broad in his speech and looked like a foundryhand which he was but women always liked him there was something of a mothers lad about himsomething warm and playful and really sensitive  he had his attractions even for fanny what she rebelled against so bitterly was that he had no sort of ambition he was a moulder but of very commonplace skill he was thirtytwo years old and hadnt saved twenty pounds she would have to provide the money for the home he didnt care he just didnt care he had no initiative at all he had no vicesno obvious ones but he was just indifferent spending as he went and not caring yet he did not look happy she remembered his face in the fireglow something haunted abstracted about it as he sat there eating his pork pie bulging his cheek out she felt he was like a doom to her and she raged against the doom of him it wasnt that he was gross his way was common almost on purpose but he himself wasnt really common for instance his food was not particularly important to him he was not greedy he had a charm too particularly for women with his blondness and his sensitiveness and his way of making a woman feel that she was a higher being but fanny knew him knew the peculiar obstinate limitedness of him that would nearly send her mad  he stayed till about half past nine she went to the door with him  when are you coming up he said jerking his head in the direction presumably of his own home  ill come tomorrow afternoon she said brightly between fanny and mrs goodall his mother there was naturally no love lost  again she gave him an awkward little kiss and said goodnight  you cant wonder you know child if he doesnt seem so very keen said her aunt its your own fault  oh aunt i couldnt stand him when he was keen i can do with him a lot better as he is  the two women sat and talked far into the night they understood each other the aunt too had married as fanny was marrying a man who was no companion to her a violent man brother of fannys father he was dead fannys father was dead  poor aunt lizzie she cried woefully over her bright niece when she had gone to bed  fanny paid the promised visit to his people the next afternoon mrs goodall was a large woman with smoothparted hair a common obstinate woman who had spoiled her four lads and her one vixen of a married daughter she was one of those oldfashioned powerful natures that couldnt do with looks or education or any form of showing off she fairly hated the sound of correct english she theed and thad her prospective daughterinlaw and said  im none as ormin as i look seest ta  fanny did not think her prospective motherinlaw looked at all orming so the speech was unnecessary  i towd him mysen said mrs goodall ers held back all this long let er stop as er is ed none ha had thee for my tellintha hears no es a fool an i know it i says to him tha looks a man doesnt ter at thy age goin an openin to her when ter hears her scrat at th gate after shes done gallivantin round wherever shed a mind that looks rare an soft but its no use o any talking he answered that letter o thine and made his own bad bargain  but in spite of the old womans anger she was also flattered at fannys coming back to harry for mrs goodall was impressed by fannya woman of her own match and more than this everybody knew that fannys aunt kate had left her two hundred pounds this apart from the girls savings  so there was high tea in princes street when harry came home black from work and a rather acrid odour of cordiality the vixen jinny darting in to say vulgar things of course jinny lived in a house whose garden end joined the paternal garden they were a clan who stuck together these goodalls  it was arranged that fanny should come to tea again on the sunday and the wedding was discussed it should take place in a fortnights time at morley chapel morley was a hamlet on the edge of the real country and in its little congregational chapel fanny and harry had first met  what a creature of habit he was he was still in the choir of morley chapelnot very regular he belonged just because he had a tenor voice and enjoyed singing indeed his solos were only spoilt to local fame because when he sang he handled his aitches so hopelessly  and i saw eaven hopened and beold a wite orse  this was one of harrys classics only surpassed by the fine outburst of his heaving  hangelshever bright an fair  it was a pity but it was inalterable he had a good voice and he sang with a certain lacerating fire but his pronunciation made it all funny and nothing could alter him  so he was never heard save at cheap concerts and in the little poorer chapels the others scoffed  now the month was september and sunday was harvest festival at morley chapel and harry was singing solos so that fanny was to go to afternoon service and come home to a grand spread of sunday tea with him poor fanny one of the most wonderful afternoons had been a sunday afternoon service with her cousin luther at her side harvest festival in morley chapel harry had sung solos thenten years ago she remembered his pale blue tie and the purple asters and the great vegetable marrows in which he was framed and her cousin luther at her side young clever come down from london where he was getting on well learning his latin and his french and german so brilliantly  however once again it was harvest festival at morley chapel and once again as ten years before a soft exquisite september day with the last roses pink in the cottage gardens the last dahlias crimson the last sunflowers yellow and again the little old chapel was a bower with its famous sheaves of corn and cornplaited pillars its great bunches of grapes dangling like tassels from the pulpit corners its marrows and potatoes and pears and apples and damsons its purple asters and yellow japanese sunflowers just as before the red dahlias round the pillars were dropping weakheaded among the oats the place was crowded and hot the plates of tomatoes seemed balanced perilously on the gallery front the rev enderby was weirder than ever to look at so long and emaciated and hairless  the rev enderby probably forewarned came and shook hands with her and welcomed her in his broad northern melancholy singsong before he mounted the pulpit fanny was handsome in a gauzy dress and a beautiful lace hat being a little late she sat in a chair in the sideaisle wedged in right in front of the chapel harry was in the gallery above and she could only see him from the eyes upwards she noticed again how his eyebrows met blond and not very marked over his nose he was attractive too physically lovable very if onlyif only her pride had not suffered she felt he dragged her down  come ye thankful people come raise the song of harvesthome all is safely gathered in ere the winter storms begin  even the hymn was a falsehood as the season had been wet and half the crops were still out and in a poor way  poor fanny she sang little and looked beautiful through that inappropriate hymn above her stood harrymercifully in a dark suit and dark tie looking almost handsome and his lacerating pure tenor sounded well when the words were drowned in the general commotion brilliant she looked and brilliant she felt for she was hot and angrily miserable and inflamed with a sort of fatal despair because there was about him a physical attraction which she really hated but which she could not escape from he was the first man who had ever kissed her and his kisses even while she rebelled from them had lived in her blood and sent roots down into her soul after all this time she had come back to them and her soul groaned for she felt dragged down dragged down to earth as a bird which some dog has got down in the dust she knew her life would be unhappy she knew that what she was doing was fatal yet it was her doom she had to come back to him  he had to sing two solos this afternoon one before the address from the pulpit and one after fanny looked at him and wondered he was not too shy to stand up there in front of all the people but no he was not shy he had even a kind of assurance on his face as he looked down from the choir gallery at her the assurance of a common man deliberately entrenched in his commonness oh such a rage went through her veins as she saw the air of triumph laconic indifferent triumph which sat so obstinately and recklessly on his eyelids as he looked down at her ah she despised him but there he stood up in that choir gallery like balaams ass in front of her and she could not get beyond him a certain winsomeness also about him a certain physical winsomeness and as if his flesh were new and lovely to touch the thorn of desire rankled bitterly in her heart  he it goes without saying sang like a canary this particular afternoon with a certain defiant passion which pleasantly crisped the blood of the congregation fanny felt the crisp flames go through her veins as she listened even the curious loudmouthed vernacular had a certain fascination but oh also it was so repugnant he would triumph over her obstinately he would drag her right back into the common people a doom a vulgar doom  the second performance was an anthem in which harry sang the solo parts it was clumsy but beautiful with lovely words  they that sow in tears shall reap in joy he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him  shall doubtless come shall doubtless come softly intoned the altosbringing his sheeeaves with him the trebles flourished brightly and then again began the halfwistful solo  they that sow in tears shall reap in joy  yes it was effective and moving  but at the moment when harrys voice sank carelessly down to his close and the choir standing behind him were opening their mouths for the final triumphant outburst a shouting female voice rose up from the body of the congregation the organ gave one startled trump and went silent the choir stood transfixed  you look well standing there singing in gods holy house came the loud angry female shout everybody turned electrified a stoutish redfaced woman in a black bonnet was standing up denouncing the soloist almost fainting with shock the congregation realized it you look well dont you standing there singing solos in gods holy house you goodall but i said id shame you you look well bringing your young woman here with you dont you ill let her know who shes dealing with a scamp as wont take the consequences of what hes done the hardfaced frenzied woman turned in the direction of fanny thats what harry goodall is if you want to know  and she sat down again in her seat fanny startled like all the rest had turned to look she had gone white and then a burning red under the attack she knew the woman a mrs nixon a devil of a woman who beat her pathetic drunken rednosed second husband bob and her two lanky daughters grownup as they were a notorious character fanny turned round again and sat motionless as eternity in her seat  there was a minute of perfect silence and suspense the audience was openmouthed and dumb the choir stood like lots wife and harry with his musicsheet stood there uplifted looking down with a dumb sort of indifference on mrs nixon his face naïve and faintly mocking mrs nixon sat defiant in her seat braving them all  then a rustle like a wood when the wind suddenly catches the leaves and then the tall weird minister got to his feet and in his strong belllike beautiful voicethe only beautiful thing about himhe said with infinite mournful pathos  let us unite in singing the last hymn on the hymnsheet the last hymn on the hymnsheet number eleven  fair waved the golden corn in canaans pleasant land  the organ tuned up promptly during the hymn the offertory was taken and after the hymn the prayer  mr enderby came from northumberland like harry he had never been able to conquer his accent which was very broad he was a little simple one of gods fools perhaps an odd bachelor soul emotional ugly but very gentle  and if o our dear lord beloved jesus there should fall a shadow of sin upon our harvest we leave it to thee to judge for thou art judge we lift our spirits and our sorrow jesus to thee and our mouths are dumb o lord keep us from forward speech restrain us from foolish words and thoughts we pray thee lord jesus who knowest all and judgest all  thus the minister said in his sad resonant voice washed his hands before the lord fanny bent forward openeyed during the prayer she could see the roundish head of harry also bent forward his face was inscrutable and expressionless the shock left her bewildered anger perhaps was her dominating emotion  the audience began to rustle to its feet to ooze slowly and excitedly out of the chapel looking with wildlyinterested eyes at fanny at mrs nixon and at harry mrs nixon shortish stood defiant in her pew facing the aisle as if announcing that without rolling her sleeves up she was ready for anybody fanny sat quite still luckily the people did not have to pass her and harry with red ears was making his way sheepishly out of the gallery the loud noise of the organ covered all the downstairs commotion of exit  the minister sat silent and inscrutable in his pulpit rather like a deathshead while the congregation filed out when the last lingerers had unwillingly departed craning their necks to stare at the still seated fanny he rose stalked in his hooked fashion down the little country chapel and fastened the door then he returned and sat down by the silent young woman  this is most unfortunate most unfortunate he moaned i am so sorry i am so sorry indeed indeed ah indeed he sighed himself to a close  its a sudden surprise thats one thing said fanny brightly  yesyesindeed yes a surprise yes i dont know the woman i dont know her  i know her said fanny shes a bad one  well well said the minister i dont know her i dont understand i dont understand at all but it is to be regretted it is very much to be regretted i am very sorry  fanny was watching the vestry door the gallery stairs communicated with the vestry not with the body of the chapel she knew the choir members had been peeping for information  at last harry camerather sheepishlywith his hat in his hand  well said fanny rising to her feet  weve had a bit of an extra said harry  i should think so said fanny  a most unfortunate circumstancea most unfortunate circumstance do you understand it harry i dont understand it at all  ah i understand it the daughters goin to have a childt an er lays it on to me  and has she no occasion to asked fanny rather censorious  its no more mine than it is some other chaps said harry looking aside  there was a moment of pause  which girl is it asked fanny  anniethe young one  there followed another silence  i dont think i know them do i asked the minister  i shouldnt think so their names nixonmother married old bob for her second husband shes a tangers

said  then he turned to mr enderby  well goodafternoon mr enderby he said  goodafternoon harry goodafternoon replied the mournful minister fanny followed harry to the door and for some time they walked in silence through the late afternoon  and its yours as much as anybody elses she said  ay he answered shortly  and they went without another word for the long mile or so till they came to the corner of the street where harry lived fanny hesitated should she go on to her aunts should she it would mean leaving all this for ever harry stood silent  some obstinacy made her turn with him along the road to his own home when they entered the houseplace the whole family was there mother and father and jinny with jinnys husband and children and harrys two brothers  youve been having yours ears

declare her hand she tidied her hair washed her hands and put the tiniest bit of powder on her face for coolness there in front of mrs goodalls indignant gaze it was like a declaration of independence
