57784280	rodney stone     preface    amongst the books to which i am indebted for my material in my endeavour to draw various phases of life and character in england at the beginning of the century i would particularly mention ashtons dawn of the nineteenth century gronows reminiscences fitzgeralds life and times of george iv jesses life of brummell boxiana pugilistica harpers brighton road robinsons last earl of barrymore and old q rices history of the turf tristrams coaching days jamess naval history clark russells collingwood and nelson  i am also much indebted to my friends mr j c parkinson and robert barr for information upon the subject of the ring  a conan doyle haslemere september 1 1896    chapter ifriars oak    on this the first of january of the year 1851 the nineteenth century has reached its midway term and many of us who shared its youth have already warnings which tell us that it has outworn us we put our grizzled heads together we older ones and we talk of the great days that we have known but we find that when it is with our children that we talk it is a hard matter to make them understand  we and our fathers before us lived much the same life but they with their railway trains and their steamboats belong to a different age  it is true that we can put historybooks into their hands and they can read from them of our weary struggle of two and twenty years with that great and evil man  they can learn how freedom fled from the whole broad continent and how nelsons blood was shed and pitts noble heart was broken in striving that she should not pass us for ever to take refuge with our brothers across the atlantic  all this they can read with the date of this treaty or that battle but i do not know where they are to read of ourselves of the folk we were and the lives we led and how the world seemed to our eyes when they were young as theirs are now  if i take up my pen to tell you about this you must not look for any story at my hands for i was only in my earliest manhood when these things befell and although i saw something of the stories of other lives i could scarce claim one of my own  it is the love of a woman that makes the story of a man and many a year was to pass before i first looked into the eyes of the mother of my children to us it seems but an affair of yesterday and yet those children can now reach the plums in the garden whilst we are seeking for a ladder and where we once walked with their little hands in ours we are glad now to lean upon their arms  but i shall speak of a time when the love of a mother was the only love i knew and if you seek for something more then it is not for you that i write  but if you would come out with me into that forgotten world if you would know boy jim and champion harrison if you would meet my father one of nelsons own men if you would catch a glimpse of that great seaman himself and of george afterwards the unworthy king of england if above all you would see my famous uncle sir charles tregellis the king of the bucks and the great fighting men whose names are still household words amongst you then give me your hand and let us start  but i must warn you also that if you think you will find much that is of interest in your guide you are destined to disappointment when i look over my bookshelves i can see that it is only the wise and witty and valiant who have ventured to write down their experiences  for my own part if i were only assured that i was as clever and brave as the average man about me i should be well satisfied  men of their hands have thought well of my brains and men of brains of my hands and that is the best that i can say of myself  save in the one matter of having an inborn readiness for music so that the mastery of any instrument comes very easily and naturally to me i cannot recall any single advantage which i can boast over my fellows  in all things i have been a halfway man for i am of middle height my eyes are neither blue nor grey and my hair before nature dusted it with her powder was betwixt flaxen and brown  i may perhaps claim this  that through life i have never felt a touch of jealousy as i have admired a better man than myself and that i have always seen all things as they are myself included which should count in my favour now that i sit down in my mature age to write my memories  with your permission then we will push my own personality as far as possible out of the picture if you can conceive me as a thin and colourless cord upon which my wouldbe pearls are strung you will be accepting me upon the terms which i should wish  our family the stones have for many generations belonged to the navy and it has been a custom among us for the eldest son to take the name of his fathers favourite commander  thus we can trace our lineage back to old vernon stone who commanded a highsterned peaknosed fiftygun ship against the dutch  through hawke stone and benbow stone we came down to my father anson stone who in his turn christened me rodney at the parish church of st thomas at portsmouth in the year of grace 1786  out of my window as i write i can see my own great lad in the garden and if i were to call out nelson you would see that i have been true to the traditions of our family  my dear mother the best that ever a man had was the second daughter of the reverend john tregellis vicar of milton which is a small parish upon the borders of the marshes of langstone  she came of a poor family but one of some position for her elder brother was the famous sir charles tregellis who having inherited the money of a wealthy east indian merchant became in time the talk of the town and the very particular friend of the prince of wales  of him i shall have more to say hereafter but you will note now that he was my own uncle and brother to my mother  i can remember her all through her beautiful life for she was but a girl when she married and little more when i can first recall her busy fingers and her gentle voice  i see her as a lovely woman with kind doves eyes somewhat short of stature it is true but carrying herself very bravely  in my memories of those days she is clad always in some purple shimmering stuff with a white kerchief round her long white neck and i see her fingers turning and darting as she works at her knitting  i see her again in her middle years sweet and loving planning contriving achieving with the few shillings a day of a lieutenants pay on which to support the cottage at friars oak and to keep a fair face to the world  and now if i do but step into the parlour i can see her once more with over eighty years of saintly life behind her silverhaired placidfaced with her dainty ribboned cap her goldrimmed glasses and her woolly shawl with the blue border  i loved her young and i love her old and when she goes she will take something with her which nothing in the world can ever make good to me again  you may have many friends you who read this and you may chance to marry more than once but your mother is your first and your last cherish her then whilst you may for the day will come when every hasty deed or heedless word will come back with its sting to hive in your own heart  such then was my mother and as to my father i can describe him best when i come to the time when he returned to us from the mediterranean  during all my childhood he was only a name to me and a face in a miniature hung round my mothers neck  at first they told me he was fighting the french and then after some years one heard less about the french and more about general buonaparte i remember the awe with which one day in thomas street portsmouth i saw a print of the great corsican in a booksellers window  this then was the arch enemy with whom my father spent his life in terrible and ceaseless contest  to my childish imagination it was a personal affair and i for ever saw my father and this cleanshaven thinlipped man swaying and reeling in a deadly yearlong grapple it was not until i went to the grammar school that i understood how many other little boys there were whose fathers were in the same case  only once in those long years did my father return home which will show you what it meant to be the wife of a sailor in those days  it was just after we had moved from portsmouth to friars oak whither he came for a week before he set sail with admiral jervis to help him to turn his name into lord st vincent  i remember that he frightened as well as fascinated me with his talk of battles and i can recall as if it were yesterday the horror with which i gazed upon a spot of blood upon his shirt ruffle which had come as i have no doubt from a mischance in shaving  at the time i never questioned that it had spurted from some stricken frenchman or spaniard and i shrank from him in terror when he laid his horny hand upon my head  my mother wept bitterly when he was gone but for my own part i was not sorry to see his blue back and white shorts going down the garden walk for i felt with the heedless selfishness of a child that we were closer together she and i when we were alone  i was in my eleventh year when we moved from portsmouth to friars oak a little sussex village to the north of brighton which was recommended to us by my uncle sir charles tregellis one of whose grand friends lord avon had had his seat near there  the reason of our moving was that living was cheaper in the country and that it was easier for my mother to keep up the appearance of a gentlewoman when away from the circle of those to whom she could not refuse hospitality  they were trying times those to all save the farmers who made such profits that they could as i have heard afford to let half their land lie fallow while living like gentlemen upon the rest  wheat was at a hundred and ten shillings a quarter and the quartern loaf at one and ninepence  even in the quiet of the cottage of friars oak we could scarce have lived were it not that in the blockading squadron in which my father was stationed there was the occasional chance of a little prizemoney the lineofbattle ships themselves tacking on and off outside brest could earn nothing save honour but the frigates in attendance made prizes of many coasters and these as is the rule of the service were counted as belonging to the fleet and their produce divided into headmoney  in this manner my father was able to send home enough to keep the cottage and to pay for me at the day school of mr joshua allen where for four years i learned all that he had to teach  it was at allens school that i first knew jim harrison boy jim as he has always been called the nephew of champion harrison of the village smithy  i can see him as he was in those days with great floundering halfformed limbs like a newfoundland puppy and a face that set every womans head round as he passed her  it was in those days that we began our lifelong friendship a friendship which still in our waning years binds us closely as two brothers  i taught him his exercises for he never loved the sight of a book and he in turn made me box and wrestle tickle trout on the adur and snare rabbits on ditching down for his hands were as active as his brain was slow  he was two years my elder however so that long before i had finished my schooling he had gone to help his uncle at the smithy  friars oak is in a dip of the downs and the fortythird milestone between london and brighton lies on the skirt of the village  it is but a small place with an ivied church a fine vicarage and a row of redbrick cottages each in its own little garden  at one end was the forge of champion harrison with his house behind it and at the other was mr allens school  the yellow cottage standing back a little from the road with its upper story bulging forward and a crisscross of black woodwork let into the plaster is the one in which we lived  i do not know if it is still standing but i should think it likely for it was not a place much given to change  just opposite to us at the other side of the broad white road was the friars oak inn which was kept in my day by john cummings a man of excellent repute at home but liable to strange outbreaks when he travelled as will afterwards become apparent  though there was a stream of traffic upon the road the coaches from brighton were too fresh to stop and those from london too eager to reach their journeys end so that if it had not been for an occasional broken trace or loosened wheel the landlord would have had only the thirsty throats of the village to trust to  those were the days when the prince of wales had just built his singular palace by the sea and so from may to september which was the brighton season there was never a day that from one to two hundred curricles chaises and phaetons did not rattle past our doors  many a summer evening have boy jim and i lain upon the grass watching all these grand folk and cheering the london coaches as they came roaring through the dust clouds leaders and wheelers stretched to their work the bugles screaming and the coachmen with their lowcrowned curlybrimmed hats and their faces as scarlet as their coats  the passengers used to laugh when boy jim shouted at them but if they could have read his big halfset limbs and his loose shoulders aright they would have looked a little harder at him perhaps and given him back his cheer  boy jim had never known a father or a mother and his whole life had been spent with his uncle champion harrison  harrison was the friars oak blacksmith and he had his nickname because he fought tom johnson when he held the english belt and would most certainly have beaten him had the bedfordshire magistrates not appeared to break up the fight  for years there was no such glutton to take punishment and no more finishing hitter than harrison though he was always as i understand a slow one upon his feet  at last in a fight with black baruk the jew he finished the battle with such a lashing hit that he not only knocked his opponent over the inner ropes but he left him betwixt life and death for long three weeks during all this time harrison lived half demented expecting every hour to feel the hand of a bow street runner upon his collar and to be tried for his life  this experience with the prayers of his wife made him forswear the ring for ever and carry his great muscles into the one trade in which they seemed to give him an advantage  there was a good business to be done at friars oak from the passing traffic and the sussex farmers so that he soon became the richest of the villagers and he came to church on a sunday with his wife and his nephew looking as respectable a family man as one would wish to see  he was not a tall man not more than five feet seven inches and it was often said that if he had had an extra inch of reach he would have been a match for jackson or belcher at their best  his chest was like a barrel and his forearms were the most powerful that i have ever seen with deep groves between the smoothswelling muscles like a piece of waterworn rock  in spite of his strength however he was of a slow orderly and kindly disposition so that there was no man more beloved over the whole country side  his heavy placid cleanshaven face could set very sternly as i have seen upon occasion but for me and every child in the village there was ever a smile upon his lips and a greeting in his eyes  there was not a beggar upon the country side who did not know that his heart was as soft as his muscles were hard  there was nothing that he liked to talk of more than his old battles but he would stop if he saw his little wife coming for the one great shadow in her life was the everpresent fear that some day he would throw down sledge and rasp and be off to the ring once more  and you must be reminded here once for all that that former calling of his was by no means at that time in the debased condition to which it afterwards fell  public opinion has gradually become opposed to it for the reason that it came largely into the hands of rogues and because it fostered ringside ruffianism  even the honest and brave pugilist was found to draw villainy round him just as the pure and noble racehorse does  for this reason the ring is dying in england and we may hope that when caunt and bendigo have passed away they may have none to succeed them  but it was different in the days of which i speak  public opinion was then largely in its favour and there were good reasons why it should be so  it was a time of war when england with an army and navy composed only of those who volunteered to fight because they had fighting blood in them had to encounter as they would now have to encounter a power which could by despotic law turn every citizen into a soldier  if the people had not been full of this lust for combat it is certain that england must have been overborne  and it was thought and is on the face of it reasonable that a struggle between two indomitable men with thirty thousand to view it and three million to discuss it did help to set a standard of hardihood and endurance  brutal it was no doubt and its brutality is the end of it but it is not so brutal as war which will survive it whether it is logical now to teach the people to be peaceful in an age when their very existence may come to depend upon their being warlike is a question for wiser heads than mine  but that was what we thought of it in the days of your grandfathers and that is why you might find statesmen and philanthropists like windham fox and althorp at the side of the ring  the mere fact that solid men should patronize it was enough in itself to prevent the villainy which afterwards crept in  for over twenty years in the days of jackson brain cribb the belchers pearce gully and the rest the leaders of the ring were men whose honesty was above suspicion and those were just the twenty years when the ring may as i have said have served a national purpose you have heard how pearce saved the bristol girl from the burning house how jackson won the respect and friendship of the best men of his age and how gully rose to a seat in the first reformed parliament  these were the men who set the standard and their trade carried with it this obvious recommendation that it is one in which no drunken or foulliving man could long succeed  there were exceptions among them no doubtbullies like hickman and brutes like berks in the main i say again that they were honest men brave and enduring to an incredible degree and a credit to the country which produced them  it was as you will see my fate to see something of them and i speak of what i know  in our own village i can assure you that we were very proud of the presence of such a man as champion harrison and if folks stayed at the inn they would walk down as far as the smithy just to have the sight of him  and he was worth seeing too especially on a winters night when the red glare of the forge would beat upon his great muscles and upon the proud hawkface of boy jim as they heaved and swayed over some glowing plough coulter framing themselves in sparks with every blow  he would strike once with his thirtypound swing sledge and jim twice with his hand hammer and the clunkclink clink clunkclink clink would bring me flying down the village street on the chance that since they were both at the anvil there might be a place for me at the bellows  only once during those village years can i remember champion harrison showing me for an instant the sort of man that he had been it chanced one summer morning when boy jim and i were standing by the smithy door that there came a private coach from brighton with its four fresh horses and its brasswork shining flying along with such a merry rattle and jingling that the champion came running out with a hallfullered shoe in his tongs to have a look at it  a gentleman in a white coachmans capea corinthian as we would call him in those dayswas driving and half a dozen of his fellows laughing and shouting were on the top behind him  it may have been that the bulk of the smith caught his eye and that he acted in pure wantonness or it may possibly have been an accident but as he swung past the twentyfoot thong of the drivers whip hissed round and we heard the sharp snap of it across harrisons leather apron  halloa master shouted the smith looking after him  youre not to be trusted on the box until you can handle your whip bettern that  whats that cried the driver pulling up his team  i bid you have a care master or there will be some oneeyed folk along the road you drive  oh you say that do you said the driver putting his whip into its socket and pulling off his drivinggloves  ill have a little talk with you my fine fellow  the sporting gentlemen of those days were very fine boxers for the most part for it was the mode to take a course of mendoza just as a few years afterwards there was no man about town who had not had the mufflers on with jackson  knowing their own prowess they never refused the chance of a wayside adventure and it was seldom indeed that the bargee or the navigator had much to boast of after a young blood had taken off his coat to him  this one swung himself off the boxseat with the alacrity of a man who has no doubts about the upshot of the quarrel and after hanging his caped coat upon the swinglebar he daintily turned up the ruffled cuffs of his white cambric shirt  ill pay you for your advice my man said he  i am sure that the men upon the coach knew who the burly smith was and looked upon it as a prime joke to see their companion walk into such a trap  they roared with delight and bellowed out scraps of advice to him  knock some of the soot off him lord frederick they shouted give the johnny raw his breakfast  chuck him in among his own cinders  sharps the word or youll see the back of him  encouraged by these cries the young aristocrat advanced upon his man  the smith never moved but his mouth set grim and hard while his tufted brows came down over his keen grey eyes  the tongs had fallen and his hands were hanging free  have a care master said he  youll get pepper if you dont  something in the assured voice and something also in the quiet pose warned the young lord of his danger  i saw him look hard at his antagonist and as he did so his hands and his jaw dropped together  by gad he cried its jack harrison  my name master  and i thought you were some essex chawbacon  why man i havent seen you since the day you nearly killed black baruk and cost me a cool hundred by doing it  how they roared on the coach  smoked  smoked by gad they yelled  its jack harrison the bruiser  lord frederick was going to take on the exchampion  give him one on the apron fred and see what happens  but the driver had already climbed back into his perch laughing as loudly as any of his companions  well let you off this time harrison said he  are those your sons down there  this is my nephew master  heres a guinea for him  he shall never say i robbed him of his uncle  and so having turned the laugh in his favour by his merry way of taking it he cracked his whip and away they flew to make london under the five hours while jack harrison with his half fullered shoe in his hand went whistling back to the forge    chapter iithe walker of cliffe royal    so much for champion harrison  now i wish to say something more about boy jim not only because he was the comrade of my youth but because you will find as you go on that this book is his story rather than mine and that there came a time when his name and his fame were in the mouths of all england  you will bear with me therefore while i tell you of his character as it was in those days and especially of one very singular adventure which neither of us are likely to forget  it was strange to see jim with his uncle and his aunt for he seemed to be of another race and breed to them  often i have watched them come up the aisle upon a sunday first the square thickset man and then the little worn anxiouseyed woman and last this glorious lad with his clearcut face his black curls and his step so springy and light that it seemed as if he were bound to earth by some lesser tie than the heavyfooted villagers round him  he had not yet attained his full six foot of stature but no judge of a man and every woman at least is one could look at his perfect shoulders his narrow loins and his proud head that sat upon his neck like an eagle upon its perch without feeling that sober joy which all that is beautiful in nature gives to usa vague self content as though in some way we also had a hand in the making of it  but we are used to associate beauty with softness in a man  i do not know why they should be so coupled and they never were with jim  of all men that i have known he was the most ironhard in body and in mind  who was there among us who could walk with him or run with him or swim with him  who on all the country side save only boy jim would have swung himself over wolstonbury cliff and clambered down a hundred feet with the mother hawk flapping at his ears in the vain struggle to hold him from her nest  he was but sixteen with his gristle not yet all set into bone when he fought and beat gipsy lee of burgess hill who called himself the cock of the south downs  it was after this that champion harrison took his training as a boxer in hand  id rather you left millin alone boy jim said he and so had the missus but if mill you must it will not be my fault if you cannot hold up your hands to anything in the south country  and it was not long before he made good his promise  i have said already that boy jim had no love for his books but by that i meant schoolbooks for when it came to the reading of romances or of anything which had a touch of gallantry or adventure there was no tearing him away from it until it was finished  when such a book came into his hands friars oak and the smithy became a dream to him and his life was spent out upon the ocean or wandering over the broad continents with his heroes  and he would draw me into his enthusiasms also so that i was glad to play friday to his crusoe when he proclaimed that the clump at clayton was a desert island and that we were cast upon it for a week  but when i found that we were actually to sleep out there without covering every night and that he proposed that our food should be the sheep of the downs wild goats he called them cooked upon a fire which was to be made by the rubbing together of two sticks my heart failed me and on the very first night i crept away to my mother  but jim stayed out there for the whole weary weeka wet week it was too and came back at the end of it looking a deal wilder and dirtier than his hero does in the picturebooks  it is well that he had only promised to stay a week for if it had been a month he would have died of cold and hunger before his pride would have let him come home  his pridethat was the deepest thing in all jims nature  it is a mixed quality to my mind half a virtue and half a vice  a virtue in holding a man out of the dirt a vice in making it hard for him to rise when once he has fallen  jim was proud down to the very marrow of his bones  you remember the guinea that the young lord had thrown him from the box of the coach  two days later somebody picked it from the roadside mud  jim only had seen where it had fallen and he would not deign even to point it out to a beggar nor would he stoop to give a reason in such a case but would answer all remonstrances with a curl of his lip and a flash of his dark eyes  even at school he was the same with such a sense of his own dignity that other folk had to think of it too  he might say as he did say that a right angle was a proper sort of angle or put panama in sicily but old joshua allen would as soon have thought of raising his cane against him as he would of letting me off if i had said as much  and so it was that although jim was the son of nobody and i of a kings officer it always seemed to me to have been a condescension on his part that he should have chosen me as his friend  it was this pride of boy jims which led to an adventure which makes me shiver now when i think of it  it happened in the august of 99 or it may have been in the early days of september but i remember that we heard the cuckoo in patcham wood and that jim said that perhaps it was the last of him i was still at school but jim had left he being nigh sixteen and i thirteen  it was my saturday halfholiday and we spent it as we often did out upon the downs  our favourite place was beyond wolstonbury where we could stretch ourselves upon the soft springy chalk grass among the plump little southdown sheep chatting with the shepherds as they leaned upon their queer old pyecombe crooks made in the days when sussex turned out more iron than all the counties of england  it was there that we lay upon that glorious afternoon  if we chose to roll upon our right sides the whole weald lay in front of us with the north downs curving away in olivegreen folds with here and there the snowwhite rift of a chalkpit if we turned upon our left we overlooked the huge blue stretch of the channel  a convoy as i can well remember was coming up it that day the timid flock of merchantmen in front the frigates like welltrained dogs upon the skirts and two burly drover lineofbattle ships rolling along behind them  my fancy was soaring out to my father upon the waters when a word from jim brought it back on to the grass like a broken winged gull  roddy said he have you heard that cliffe royal is haunted  had i heard it  of course i had heard it  who was there in all the down country who had not heard of the walker of cliffe royal  do you know the story of it roddy  why said i with some pride i ought to know it seeing that my mothers brother sir charles tregellis was the nearest friend of lord avon and was at this cardparty when the thing happened  i heard the vicar and my mother talking about it last week and it was all so clear to me that i might have been there when the murder was done  it is a strange story said jim thoughtfully but when i asked my aunt about it she would give me no answer and as to my uncle he cut me short at the very mention of it  there is a good reason for that said i for lord avon was as i have heard your uncles best friend and it is but natural that he would not wish to speak of his disgrace  tell me the story roddy  it is an old one nowfourteen years oldand yet they have not got to the end of it  there were four of them who had come down from london to spend a few days in lord avons old house  one was his own young brother captain barrington another was his cousin sir lothian hume sir charles tregellis my uncle was the third and lord avon the fourth  they are fond of playing cards for money these great people and they played and played for two days and a night  lord avon lost and sir lothian lost and my uncle lost and captain barrington won until he could win no more  he won their money but above all he won papers from his elder brother which meant a great deal to him  it was late on a monday night that they stopped playing  on the tuesday morning captain barrington was found dead beside his bed with his throat cut  and lord avon did it  his papers were found burned in the grate his wristband was clutched in the dead mans hand and his knife lay beside the body  did they hang him then  they were too slow in laying hands upon him  he waited until he saw that they had brought it home to him and then he fled  he has never been seen since but it is said that he reached america  and the ghost walks  there are many who have seen it  why is the house still empty  because it is in the keeping of the law  lord avon had no children and sir lothian humethe same who was at the cardparty is his nephew and heir  but he can touch nothing until he can prove lord avon to be dead  jim lay silent for a bit plucking at the short grass with his fingers  roddy said he at last will you come with me tonight and look for the ghost  it turned me cold the very thought of it  my mother would not let me  slip out when shes abed  ill wait for you at the smithy  cliffe royal is locked  ill open a window easy enough  im afraid jim  but you are not afraid if you are with me roddy  ill promise you that no ghost shall hurt you  so i gave him my word that i would come and then all the rest of the day i went about the most sadfaced lad in sussex  it was all very well for boy jim  it was that pride of his which was taking him there  he would go because there was no one else on the country side that would dare  but i had no pride of that sort  i was quite of the same way of thinking as the others and would as soon have thought of passing my night at jacobs gibbet on ditchling common as in the haunted house of cliffe royal  still i could not bring myself to desert jim and so as i say i slunk about the house with so pale and peaky a face that my dear mother would have it that i had been at the green apples and sent me to bed early with a dish of camomile tea for my supper  england went to rest betimes in those days for there were few who could afford the price of candles  when i looked out of my window just after the clock had gone ten there was not a light in the village save only at the inn  it was but a few feet from the ground so i slipped out and there was jim waiting for me at the smithy corner  we crossed johns common together and so past riddens farm meeting only one or two riding officers upon the way there was a brisk wind blowing and the moon kept peeping through the rifts of the scud so that our road was sometimes silverclear and sometimes so black that we found ourselves among the brambles and gorsebushes which lined it  we came at last to the wooden gate with the high stone pillars by the roadside and looking through between the rails we saw the long avenue of oaks and at the end of this illboding tunnel the pale face of the house glimmered in the moonshine  that would have been enough for me that one glimpse of it and the sound of the night wind sighing and groaning among the branches but jim swung the gate open and up we went the gravel squeaking beneath our tread  it towered high the old house with many little windows in which the moon glinted and with a strip of water running round three sides of it  the arched door stood right in the face of us and on one side a lattice hung open upon its hinges  were in luck roddy whispered jim  heres one of the windows open  dont you think weve gone far enough jim said i with my teeth chattering  ill lift you in first  no no ill not go first  then i will  he gripped the sill and had his knee on it in an instant  now roddy give me your hands  with a pull he had me up beside him and a moment later we were both in the haunted house  how hollow it sounded when we jumped down on to the wooden floor there was such a sudden boom and reverberation that we both stood silent for a moment  then jim burst out laughing  what an old drum of a place it is he cried well strike a light roddy and see where we are  he had brought a candle and a tinderbox in his pocket  when the flame burned up we saw an arched stone roof above our heads and broad deal shelves all round us covered with dusty dishes  it was the pantry  ill show you round said jim merrily and pushing the door open he led the way into the hall  i remember the high oak panelled walls with the heads of deer jutting out and a single white bust which sent my heart into my mouth in the corner  many rooms opened out of this and we wandered from one to the otherthe kitchens the stillroom the morningroom the diningroom all filled with the same choking smell of dust and of mildew  this is where they played the cards jim said i in a hushed voice  it was on that very table  why here are the cards themselves cried he and he pulled a brown towel from something in the centre of the sideboard  sure enough it was a pile of playingcardsforty packs i should think at the leastwhich had lain there ever since that tragic game which was played before i was born  i wonder whence that stair leads said jim  dont go up there jim i cried clutching at his arm  that must lead to the room of the murder  how do you know that  the vicar said that they saw on the ceilingoh jim you can see it even now  he held up his candle and there was a great dark smudge upon the white plaster above us  i believe youre right said he but anyhow im going to have a look at it  dont jim dont i cried  tut roddy you can stay here if you are afraid  i wont be more than a minute  theres no use going on a ghost hunt unlessgreat lord theres something coming down the stairs  i heard it tooa shuffling footstep in the room above and then a creak from the steps and then another creak and another  i saw jims face as if it had been carved out of ivory with his parted lips and his staring eyes fixed upon the black square of the stair opening  he still held the light but his fingers twitched and with every twitch the shadows sprang from the walls to the ceiling as to myself my knees gave way under me and i found myself on the floor crouching down behind jim with a scream frozen in my throat and still the step came slowly from stair to stair  then hardly daring to look and yet unable to turn away my eyes i saw a figure dimly outlined in the corner upon which the stair opened  there was a silence in which i could hear my poor heart thumping and then when i looked again the figure was gone and the low creak creak was heard once more upon the stairs  jim sprang after it and i was left halffainting in the moonlight  but it was not for long  he was down again in a minute and passing his hand under my arm he half led and half carried me out of the house  it was not until we were in the fresh night air again that he opened his mouth  can you stand roddy  yes but im shaking  so am i said he passing his hand over his forehead  i ask your pardon roddy  i was a fool to bring you on such an errand  but i never believed in such things  i know better now  could it have been a man jim i asked plucking up my courage now that i could hear the dogs barking on the farms  it was a spirit rodney  how do you know  because i followed it and saw it vanish into a wall as easily as an eel into sand  why roddy whats amiss now  my fears were all back upon me and every nerve creeping with horror  take me away jim  take me away i cried  i was glaring down the avenue and his eyes followed mine  amid the gloom of the oak trees something was coming towards us  quiet roddy whispered jim  by heavens come what may my arms are going round it this time  we crouched as motionless as the trunks behind us  heavy steps ploughed their way through the soft gravel and a broad figure loomed upon us in the darkness  jim sprang upon it like a tiger  youre not a spirit anyway he cried  the man gave a shout of surprise and then a growl of rage  what the deuce he roared and then ill break your neck if you dont let go  the threat might not have loosened jims grip but the voice did  why uncle he cried  well im blessed if it isnt boy jim  and whats this  why its young master rodney stone as im a living sinner  what in the world are you two doing up at cliffe royal at this time of night  we had all moved out into the moonlight and there was champion harrison with a big bundle on his armand such a look of amazement upon his face as would have brought a smile back on to mine had my heart not still been cramped with fear  were exploring said jim  exploring are you  well i dont think you were meant to be captain cooks either of you for i never saw such a pair of peeled turnip faces  why jim what are you afraid of  im not afraid uncle  i never was afraid but spirits are new to me and  spirits  ive been in cliffe royal and weve seen the ghost  the champion gave a whistle  thats the game is it said he  did you have speech with it  it vanished first  the champion whistled once more  ive heard there is something of the sort up yonder said he but its not a thing as i would advise you to meddle with  theres enough trouble with the folk of this world boy jim without going out of your way to mix up with those of another  as to young master rodney stone if his good mother saw that white face of his shed never let him come to the smithy more  walk slowly on and ill see you back to friars oak  we had gone half a mile perhaps when the champion overtook us and i could not but observe that the bundle was no longer under his arm we were nearly at the smithy before jim asked the question which was already in my mind  what took you up to cliffe royal uncle  well as a man gets on in years said the champion theres many a duty turns up that the likes of you have no idea of  when youre near forty yourself youll maybe know the truth of what i say  so that was all we could draw from him but young as i was i had heard of coast smuggling and of packages carried to lonely places at night so that from that time on if i had heard that the preventives had made a capture i was never easy until i saw the jolly face of champion harrison looking out of his smithy door    chapter iiithe playactress of anstey cross    i have told you something about friars oak and about the life that we led there  now that my memory goes back to the old place it would gladly linger for every thread which i draw from the skein of the past brings out half a dozen others that were entangled with it i was in two minds when i began whether i had enough in me to make a book of and now i know that i could write one about friars oak alone and the folk whom i knew in my childhood  they were hard and uncouth some of them i doubt not and yet seen through the golden haze of time they all seem sweet and lovable  there was our good vicar mr jefferson who loved the whole world save only mr slack the baptist minister of clayton and there was kindly mr slack who was all mens brother save only of mr jefferson the vicar of friars oak  then there was monsieur rudin the french royalist refugee who lived over on the pangdean road and who when the news of a victory came in was convulsed with joy because we had beaten buonaparte and shaken with rage because we had beaten the french so that after the nile he wept for a whole day out of delight and then for another one out of fury alternately clapping his hands and stamping his feet  well i remember his thin upright figure and the way in which he jauntily twirled his little cane for cold and hunger could not cast him down though we knew that he had his share of both  yet he was so proud and had such a grand manner of talking that no one dared to offer him a cloak or a meal  i can see his face now with a flush over each craggy cheekbone when the butcher made him the present of some ribs of beef  he could not but take it and yet whilst he was stalking off he threw a proud glance over his shoulder at the butcher and he said monsieur i have a dog  yet it was monsieur rudin and not his dog who looked plumper for a week to come  then i remember mr paterson the farmer who was what you would now call a radical though at that time some called him a priestleyite and some a foxite and nearly everybody a traitor  it certainly seemed to me at the time to be very wicked that a man should look glum when he heard of a british victory and when they burned his straw image at the gate of his farm boy jim and i were among those who lent a hand  but we were bound to confess that he was game though he might be a traitor for down he came striding into the midst of us with his brown coat and his buckled shoes and the fire beating upon his grim schoolmaster face  my word how he rated us and how glad we were at last to sneak quietly away  you livers of a lie said he  you and those like you have been preaching peace for nigh two thousand years and cutting throats the whole time  if the money that is lost in taking french lives were spent in saving english ones you would have more right to burn candles in your windows  who are you that dare to come here to insult a lawabiding man  we are the people of england cried young master ovington the son of the tory squire  you you horseracing cockfighting neerdoweel  do you presume to talk for the people of england  they are a deep strong silent stream and you are the scum the bubbles the poor silly froth that floats upon the surface  we thought him very wicked then but looking back i am not sure that we were not very wicked ourselves  and then there were the smugglers  the downs swarmed with them for since there might be no lawful trade betwixt france and england it had all to run in that channel  i have been up on st johns common upon a dark night and lying among the bracken i have seen as many as seventy mules and a man at the head of each go flitting past me as silently as trout in a stream  not one of them but bore its two ankers of the right french cognac or its bale of silk of lyons and lace of valenciennes  i knew dan scales the head of them and i knew tom hislop the riding officer and i remember the night they met  do you fight dan asked tom  yes tom thou must fight for it  on which tom drew his pistol and blew dans brains out  it was a sad thing to do he said afterwards but i knew dan was too good a man for me for we tried it out before  it was tom who paid a poet from brighton to write the lines for the tombstone which we all thought were very true and good beginning    alas  swift flew the fatal lead which pierced through the young mans head he instantly fell resigned his breath and closed his languid eyes in death   there was more of it and i dare say it is all still to be read in patcham churchyard  one day about the time of our cliffe royal adventure i was seated in the cottage looking round at the curios which my father had fastened on to the walls and wishing like the lazy lad that i was that mr lilly had died before ever he wrote his latin grammar when my mother who was sitting knitting in the window gave a little cry of surprise  good gracious she cried  what a vulgarlooking woman  it was so rare to hear my mother say a hard word against anybody unless it were general buonaparte that i was across the room and at the window in a jump  a ponychaise was coming slowly down the village street and in it was the queerestlooking person that i had ever seen  she was very stout with a face that was of so dark a red that it shaded away into purple over the nose and cheeks  she wore a great hat with a white curling ostrich feather and from under its brim her two bold black eyes stared out with a look of anger and defiance as if to tell the folk that she thought less of them than they could do of her  she had some sort of scarlet pelisse with white swansdown about her neck and she held the reins slack in her hands while the pony wandered from side to side of the road as the fancy took him  each time the chaise swayed her head with the great hat swayed also so that sometimes we saw the crown of it and sometimes the brim  what a dreadful sight cried my mother  what is amiss with her mother  heaven forgive me if i misjudge her rodney but i think that the unfortunate woman has been drinking  why i cried she has pulled the chaise up at the smithy  ill find out all the news for you and catching up my cap away i scampered  champion harrison had been shoeing a horse at the forge door and when i got into the street i could see him with the creatures hoof still under his arm and the rasp in his hand kneeling down amid the white parings  the woman was beckoning him from the chaise and he staring up at her with the queerest expression upon his face presently he threw down his rasp and went across to her standing by the wheel and shaking his head as he talked to her  for my part i slipped into the smithy where boy jim was finishing the shoe and i watched the neatness of his work and the deft way in which he turned up the caulkens  when he had done with it he carried it out and there was the strange woman still talking with his uncle  is that he i heard her ask  champion harrison nodded  she looked at jim and i never saw such eyes in a human head so large and black and wonderful  boy as i was i knew that in spite of that bloated face this woman had once been very beautiful she put out a hand with all the fingers going as if she were playing on the harpsichord and she touched jim on the shoulder  i hopei hope youre well she stammered  very well maam said jim staring from her to his uncle  and happy too  yes maam i thank you  nothing that you crave for  why no maam i have all that i lack  that will do jim said his uncle in a stern voice  blow up the forge again for that shoe wants reheating  but it seemed as if the woman had something else that she would say for she was angry that he should be sent away  her eyes gleamed and her head tossed while the smith with his two big hands outspread seemed to be soothing her as best he could  for a long time they whispered until at last she appeared to be satisfied  tomorrow then she cried loud out  tomorrow he answered  you keep your word and ill keep mine said she and dropped the lash on the ponys back  the smith stood with the rasp in his hand looking after her until she was just a little red spot on the white road  then he turned and i never saw his face so grave  jim said he thats miss hinton who has come to live at the maples out anstey cross way  shes taken a kind of a fancy to you jim and maybe she can help you on a bit  i promised her that you would go over and see her tomorrow  i dont want her help uncle and i dont want to see her  but ive promised jim and you wouldnt make me out a liar  she does but want to talk with you for it is a lonely life she leads  what would she want to talk with such as me about  why i cannot say that but she seemed very set upon it and women have their fancies  theres young master stone here who wouldnt refuse to go and see a good lady ill warrant if he thought he might better his fortune by doing so  well uncle ill go if roddy stone will go with me said jim  of course hell go  wont you master rodney  so it ended in my saying yes and back i went with all my news to my mother who dearly loved a little bit of gossip  she shook her head when she heard where i was going but she did not say nay and so it was settled  it was a good four miles of a walk but when we reached it you would not wish to see a more cosy little house  all honeysuckle and creepers with a wooden porch and lattice windows  a commonlooking woman opened the door for us  miss hinton cannot see you said she  but she asked us to come said jim  i cant help that cried the woman in a rude voice  i tell you that she cant see you  we stood irresolute for a minute  maybe you would just tell her i am here said jim at last  tell her  how am i to tell her when she couldnt so much as hear a pistol in her ears  try and tell her yourself if you have a mind to  she threw open a door as she spoke and there in a reclining chair at the further end of the room we caught a glimpse of a figure all lumped together huge and shapeless with tails of black hair hanging down  the sound of dreadful swinelike breathing fell upon our ears  it was but a glance and then we were off hotfoot for home  as for me i was so young that i was not sure whether this was funny or terrible but when i looked at jim to see how he took it he was looking quite white and ill  youll not tell any one roddy said he  not unless its my mother  i wont even tell my uncle  ill say she was ill the poor lady its enough that we should have seen her in her shame without its being the gossip of the village  it makes me feel sick and heavy at heart  she was so yesterday jim  was she  i never marked it  but i know that she has kind eyes and a kind heart for i saw the one in the other when she looked at me maybe its the want of a friend that has driven her to this  it blighted his spirits for days and when it had all gone from my mind it was brought back to me by his manner  but it was not to be our last memory of the lady with the scarlet pelisse for before the week was out jim came round to ask me if i would again go up with him  my uncle has had a letter said he  she would speak with me and i would be easier if you came with me rod  for me it was only a pleasure outing but i could see as we drew near the house that jim was troubling in his mind lest we should find that things were amiss  his fears were soon set at rest however for we had scarce clicked the garden gate before the woman was out of the door of the cottage and running down the path to meet us  she was so strange a figure with some sort of purple wrapper on and her big flushed face smiling out of it that i might if i had been alone have taken to my heels at the sight of her  even jim stopped for a moment as if he were not very sure of himself but her hearty ways soon set us at our ease  it is indeed good of you to come and see an old lonely woman said she and i owe you an apology that i should give you a fruitless journey on tuesday but in a sense you were yourselves the cause of it since the thought of your coming had excited me and any excitement throws me into a nervous fever  my poor nerves  you can see for yourselves how they serve me  she held out her twitching hands as she spoke  then she passed one of them through jims arm and walked with him up the path  you must let me know you and know you well said she  your uncle and aunt are quite old acquaintances of mine and though you cannot remember me i have held you in my arms when you were an infant  tell me little man she added turning to me what do you call your friend  boy jim maam said i  then if you will not think me forward i will call you boy jim also  we elderly people have our privileges you know  and now you shall come in with me and we will take a dish of tea together  she led the way into a cosy roomthe same which we had caught a glimpse of when last we cameand there in the middle was a table with white napery and shining glass and gleaming china and red cheeked apples piled upon a centredish and a great plateful of smoking muffins which the crossfaced maid had just carried in  you can think that we did justice to all the good things and miss hinton would ever keep pressing us to pass our cup and to fill our plate  twice during our meal she rose from her chair and withdrew into a cupboard at the end of the room and each time i saw jims face cloud for we heard a gentle clink of glass against glass  come now little man said she to me when the table had been cleared  why are you looking round so much  because there are so many pretty things upon the walls  and which do you think the prettiest of them  why that said i pointing to a picture which hung opposite to me  it was of a tall and slender girl with the rosiest cheeks and the tenderest eyesso daintily dressed too that i had never seen anything more perfect  she had a posy of flowers in her hand and another one was lying upon the planks of wood upon which she was standing  oh thats the prettiest is it said she laughing  well now walk up to it and let us hear what is writ beneath it  i did as she asked and read out  miss polly hinton as peggy in the country wife played for her benefit at the haymarket theatre september 14th 1782  its a playactress said i  oh you rude little boy to say it in such a tone said she as if a playactress wasnt as good as any one else  why twas but the other day that the duke of clarence who may come to call himself king of england married mrs jordan who is herself only a playactress  and whom think you that this one is  she stood under the picture with her arms folded across her great body and her big black eyes looking from one to the other of us  why where are your eyes she cried at last  i was miss polly hinton of the haymarket theatre  and perhaps you never heard the name before  we were compelled to confess that we never had  and the very name of playactress had filled us both with a kind of vague horror like the countrybred folk that we were  to us they were a class apart to be hinted at rather than named with the wrath of the almighty hanging over them like a thundercloud  indeed his judgments seemed to be in visible operation before us when we looked upon what this woman was and what she had been  well said she laughing like one who is hurt you have no cause to say anything for i read on your face what you have been taught to think of me  so this is the upbringing that you have had jim to think evil of that which you do not understand  i wish you had been in the theatre that very night with prince florizel and four dukes in the boxes and all the wits and macaronis of london rising at me in the pit  if lord avon had not given me a cast in his carriage i had never got my flowers back to my lodgings in york street westminster  and now two little country lads are sitting in judgment upon me  jims pride brought a flush on to his cheeks for he did not like to be called a country lad or to have it supposed that he was so far behind the grand folk in london  i have never been inside a playhouse said he i know nothing of them  nor i either  well said she i am not in voice and it is ill to play in a little room with but two to listen but you must conceive me to be the queen of the peruvians who is exhorting her countrymen to rise up against the spaniards who are oppressing them  and straightway that coarse swollen woman became a queenthe grandest haughtiest queen that you could dream ofand she turned upon us with such words of fire such lightning eyes and sweeping of her white hand that she held us spellbound in our chairs  her voice was soft and sweet and persuasive at the first but louder it rang and louder as it spoke of wrongs and freedom and the joys of death in a good cause until it thrilled into my every nerve and i asked nothing more than to run out of the cottage and to die then and there in the cause of my country  and then in an instant she changed  she was a poor woman now who had lost her only child and who was bewailing it  her voice was full of tears and what she said was so simple so true that we both seemed to see the dead babe stretched there on the carpet before us and we could have joined in with words of pity and of grief  and then before our cheeks were dry she was back into her old self again  how like you that then she cried  that was my way in the days when sally siddons would turn green at the name of polly hinton its a fine play is pizarro  and who wrote it maam  who wrote it  i never heard  what matter who did the writing of it  but there are some great lines for one who knows how they should be spoken  and you play no longer maam  no jim i left the boards whenwhen i was weary of them  but my heart goes back to them sometimes  it seems to me there is no smell like that of the hot oil in the footlights and of the oranges in the pit  but you are sad jim  it was but the thought of that poor woman and her child  tut never think about her  i will soon wipe her from your mind this is miss priscilla tomboy from the romp  you must conceive that the mother is speaking and that the forward young minx is answering  and she began a scene between the two of them so exact in voice and manner that it seemed to us as if there were really two folk before us  the stern old mother with her hand up like an eartrumpet and her flouncing bouncing daughter  her great figure danced about with a wonderful lightness and she tossed her head and pouted her lips as she answered back to the old bent figure that addressed her  jim and i had forgotten our tears and were holding our ribs before she came to the end of it  that is better said she smiling at our laughter  i would not have you go back to friars oak with long faces or maybe they would not let you come to me again  she vanished into her cupboard and came out with a bottle and glass which she placed upon the table  you are too young for strong waters she said but this talking gives one a dryness and  then it was that boy jim did a wonderful thing  he rose from his chair and he laid his hand upon the bottle  dont said he  she looked him in the face and i can still see those black eyes of hers softening before the gaze  am i to have none  please dont  with a quick movement she wrested the bottle out of his hand and raised it up so that for a moment it entered my head that she was about to drink it off  then she flung it through the open lattice and we heard the crash of it on the path outside  there jim said she does that satisfy you  its long since any one cared whether i drank or no  you are too good and kind for that said he  good she cried  well i love that you should think me so  and it would make you happier if i kept from the brandy jim  well then ill make you a promise if youll make me one in return  whats that miss  no drop shall pass my lips jim if you will swear wet or shine blow or snow to come up here twice in every week that i may see you and speak with you for indeed there are times when i am very lonesome  so the promise was made and very faithfully did jim keep it for many a time when i have wanted him to go fishing or rabbitsnaring he has remembered that it was his day for miss hinton and has tramped off to anstey cross  at first i think that she found her share of the bargain hard to keep and i have seen jim come back with a black face on him as if things were going amiss  but after a time the fight was wonas all fights are won if one does but fight long enoughand in the year before my father came back miss hinton had become another woman  and it was not her ways only but herself as well for from being the person that i have described she became in one twelvemonth as fine a looking lady as there was in the whole countryside  jim was prouder of it by far than of anything he had had a hand in in his life but it was only to me that he ever spoke about it for he had that tenderness towards her that one has for those whom one has helped  and she helped him also for by her talk of the world and of what she had seen she took his mind away from the sussex countryside and prepared it for a broader life beyond  so matters stood between them at the time when peace was made and my father came home from the sea    chapter ivthe peace of amiens    many a womans knee was on the ground and many a womans soul spent itself in joy and thankfulness when the news came with the fall of the leaf in 1801 that the preliminaries of peace had been settled all england waved her gladness by day and twinkled it by night even in little friars oak we had our flags flying bravely and a candle in every window with a big gr guttering in the wind over the door of the inn  folk were weary of the war for we had been at it for eight years taking holland and spain and france each in turn and all together  all that we had learned during that time was that our little army was no match for the french on land and that our large navy was more than a match for them upon the water  we had gained some credit which we were sorely in need of after the american business and a few colonies which were welcome also for the same reason but our debt had gone on rising and our consols sinking until even pitt stood aghast  still if we had known that there never could be peace between napoleon and ourselves and that this was only the end of a round and not of the battle we should have been better advised had we fought it out without a break  as it was the french got back the twenty thousand good seamen whom we had captured and a fine dance they led us with their boulogne flotillas and fleets of invasion before we were able to catch them again  my father as i remember him best was a tough strong little man of no great breadth but solid and well put together  his face was burned of a reddish colour as bright as a flowerpot and in spite of his age for he was only forty at the time of which i speak it was shot with lines which deepened if he were in any way perturbed so that i have seen him turn on the instant from a youngish man to an elderly  his eyes especially were meshed round with wrinkles as is natural for one who had puckered them all his life in facing foul wind and bitter weather  these eyes were perhaps his strangest feature for they were of a very clear and beautiful blue which shone the brighter out of that ruddy setting  by nature he must have been a fairskinned man for his upper brow where his cap came over it was as white as mine and his closecropped hair was tawny  he had served as he was proud to say in the last of our ships which had been chased out of the mediterranean in 97 and in the first which had reentered it in 98  he was under miller as third lieutenant of the theseus when our fleet like a pack of eager fox hounds in a covert was dashing from sicily to syria and back again to naples trying to pick up the lost scent  with the same good fighting man he served at the nile where the men of his command sponged and rammed and trained until when the last tricolour had come down they hove up the sheet anchor and fell dead asleep upon the top of each other under the capstan bars  then as a second lieutenant he was in one of those grim threedeckers with powder blackened hulls and crimson scupperholes their spare cables tied round their keels and over their bulwarks to hold them together which carried the news into the bay of naples  from thence as a reward for his services he was transferred as first lieutenant to the aurora frigate engaged in cutting off supplies from genoa and in her he still remained until long after peace was declared  how well i can remember his homecoming  though it is now eight andforty years ago it is clearer to me than the doings of last week for the memory of an old man is like one of those glasses which shows out what is at a distance and blurs all that is near  my mother had been in a tremble ever since the first rumour of the preliminaries came to our ears for she knew that he might come as soon as his message  she said little but she saddened my life by insisting that i should be for ever clean and tidy  with every rumble of wheels too her eyes would glance towards the door and her hands steal up to smooth her pretty black hair  she had embroidered a white welcome upon a blue ground with an anchor in red upon each side and a border of laurel leaves and this was to hang upon the two lilac bushes which flanked the cottage door  he could not have left the mediterranean before we had this finished and every morning she looked to see if it were in its place and ready to be hanged  but it was a weary time before the peace was ratified and it was april of next year before our great day came round to us  it had been raining all morning i remembera soft spring rain which sent up a rich smell from the brown earth and pattered pleasantly upon the budding chestnuts behind our cottage  the sun had shone out in the evening and i had come down with my fishingrod for i had promised boy jim to go with him to the millstream when what should i see but a postchaise with two smoking horses at the gate and there in the open door of it were my mothers black skirt and her little feet jutting out with two blue arms for a waistbelt and all the rest of her buried in the chaise  away i ran for the motto and i pinned it up on the bushes as we had agreed but when i had finished there were the skirts and the feet and the blue arms just the same as before  heres rod said my mother at last struggling down on to the ground again  roddy darling heres your father  i saw the red face and the kindly lightblue eyes looking out at me  why roddy lad you were but a child and we kissed goodbye when last we met but i suppose we must put you on a different rating now  im right glad from my heart to see you dear lad and as to you sweetheart  the blue arms flew out and there were the skirt and the two feet fixed in the door again  here are the folk coming anson said my mother blushing  wont you get out and come in with us  and then suddenly it came home to us both that for all his cheery face he had never moved more than his arms and that his leg was resting on the opposite seat of the chaise  oh anson anson she cried  tut tis but the bone of my leg said he taking his knee between his hands and lifting it round  i got it broke in the bay but the surgeon has fished it and spliced it though its a bit crank yet why bless her kindly heart if i havent turned her from pink to white  you can see for yourself that its nothing  he sprang out as he spoke and with one leg and a staff he hopped swiftly up the path and under the laurelbordered motto and so over his own threshold for the first time for five years  when the postboy and i had carried up the seachest and the two canvas bags there he was sitting in his armchair by the window in his old weatherstained blue coat  my mother was weeping over his poor leg and he patting her hair with one brown hand  his other he threw round my waist and drew me to the side of his chair  now that we have peace i can lie up and refit until king george needs me again said he  twas a carronade that came adrift in the bay when it was blowing a topgallant breeze with a beam sea ere we could make it fast it had me jammed against the mast  well well he added looking round at the walls of the room here are all my old curios the same as ever  the narwhals horn from the arctic and the blowfish from the moluccas and the paddles from fiji and the picture of the ca ira with lord hotham in chase  and here you are mary and you also roddy and good luck to the carronade which has sent me into so snug a harbour without fear of sailing orders  my mother had his long pipe and his tobacco all ready for him so that he was able now to light it and to sit looking from one of us to the other and then back again as if he could never see enough of us  young as i was i could still understand that this was the moment which he had thought of during many a lonely watch and that the expectation of it had cheered his heart in many a dark hour sometimes he would touch one of us with his hand and sometimes the other and so he sat with his soul too satiated for words whilst the shadows gathered in the little room and the lights of the inn windows glimmered through the gloom  and then after my mother had lit our own lamp she slipped suddenly down upon her knees and he got one knee to the ground also so that handinhand they joined their thanks to heaven for manifold mercies  when i look back at my parents as they were in those days it is at that very moment that i can picture them most clearly  her sweet face with the wet shining upon her cheeks and his blue eyes upturned to the smokeblackened ceiling  i remember that he swayed his reeking pipe in the earnestness of his prayer so that i was half tears and half smiles as i watched him  roddy lad said he after supper was over youre getting a man now and i suppose you will go afloat like the rest of us  youre old enough to strap a dirk to your thigh  and leave me without a child as well as without a husband cried my mother  well theres time enough yet said he for they are more inclined to empty berths than to fill them now that peace has come but ive never tried what all this schooling has done for you rodney  you have had a great deal more than ever i had but i dare say i can make shift to test it  have you learned history  yes father said i with some confidence  then how many sail of the line were at the battle of camperdown  he shook his head gravely when he found that i could not answer him  why there are men in the fleet who never had any schooling at all who could tell you that we had seven 74s seven 64s and two 50 gun ships in the action  theres a picture on the wall of the chase of the ca ira  which were the ships that laid her aboard  again i had to confess that he had beaten me  well your dad can teach you something in history yet he cried looking in triumph at my mother  have you learned geography  yes father said i though with less confidence than before  well how far is it from port mahon to algeciras  i could only shake my head  if ushant lay three leagues upon your starboard quarter what would be your nearest english port  again i had to give it up  well i dont see that your geography is much better than your history said he  youd never get your certificate at this rate can you do addition  well then let us see if you can tot up my prizemoney  he shot a mischievous glance at my mother as he spoke and she laid down her knitting on her lap and looked very earnestly at him  you never asked me about that mary said he  the mediterranean is not the station for it anson  i have heard you say that it is the atlantic for prizemoney and the mediterranean for honour  i had a share of both last cruise which comes from changing a lineofbattleship for a frigate  now rodney there are two pounds in every hundred due to me when the prizecourts have done with them  when we were watching massena off genoa we got a matter of seventy schooners brigs and tartans with wine food and powder lord keith will want his finger in the pie but thats for the courts to settle  put them at four pounds apiece to me and what will the seventy bring  two hundred and eighty pounds i answered  why anson it is a fortune cried my mother clapping her hands  try you again roddy said he shaking his pipe at me  there was the xebec frigate out of barcelona with twenty thousand spanish dollars aboard which make four thousand of our pounds  her hull should be worth another thousand  whats my share of that  a hundred pounds  why the purser couldnt work it out quicker he cried in his delight  heres for you again  we passed the straits and worked up to the azores where we fell in with the la sabina from the mauritius with sugar and spices  twelve hundred pounds shes worth to me mary my darling and never again shall you soil your pretty fingers or pinch upon my beggarly pay  my dear mother had borne her long struggle without a sign all these years but now that she was so suddenly eased of it she fell sobbing upon his neck  it was a long time before my father had a thought to spare upon my examination in arithmetic  its all in your lap mary said he dashing his own hand across his eyes  by george lass when this leg of mine is sound well bear down for a spell to brighton and if there is a smarter frock than yours upon the steyne may i never tread a poop again  but how is it that you are so quick at figures rodney when you know nothing of history or geography  i tried to explain that addition was the same upon sea or land but that history and geography were not  well he concluded you need figures to take a reckoning and you need nothing else save what your mother wit will teach you  there never was one of our breed who did not take to salt water like a young gull  lord nelson has promised me a vacancy for you and hell be as good as his word  so it was that my father came home to us and a better or kinder no lad could wish for  though my parents had been married so long they had really seen very little of each other and their affection was as warm and as fresh as if they were two newlywedded lovers  i have learned since that sailors can be coarse and foul but never did i know it from my father for although he had seen as much rough work as the wildest could wish for he was always the same patient goodhumoured man with a smile and a jolly word for all the village  he could suit himself to his company too for on the one hand he could take his wine with the vicar or with sir james ovington the squire of the parish while on the other he would sit by the hour amongst my humble friends down in the smithy with champion harrison boy jim and the rest of them telling them such stories of nelson and his men that i have seen the champion knot his great hands together while jims eyes have smouldered like the forge embers as he listened  my father had been placed on halfpay like so many others of the old war officers and so for nearly two years he was able to remain with us  during all this time i can only once remember that there was the slightest disagreement between him and my mother  it chanced that i was the cause of it and as great events sprang out of it i must tell you how it came about  it was indeed the first of a series of events which affected not only my fortunes but those of very much more important people  the spring of 1803 was an early one and the middle of april saw the leaves thick upon the chestnut trees  one evening we were all seated together over a dish of tea when we heard the scrunch of steps outside our door and there was the postman with a letter in his hand  i think it is for me said my mother and sure enough it was addressed in the most beautiful writing to mrs mary stone of friars oak and there was a red seal the size of a halfcrown upon the outside of it with a flying dragon in the middle  whom think you that it is from anson she asked  i had hoped that it was from lord nelson answered my father  it is time the boy had his commission  but if it be for you then it cannot be from any one of much importance  can it not she cried pretending to be offended  you will ask my pardon for that speech sir for it is from no less a person than sir charles tregellis my own brother  my mother seemed to speak with a hushed voice when she mentioned this wonderful brother of hers and always had done as long as i can remember so that i had learned also to have a subdued and reverent feeling when i heard his name  and indeed it was no wonder for that name was never mentioned unless it were in connection with something brilliant and extraordinary  once we heard that he was at windsor with the king  often he was at brighton with the prince sometimes it was as a sportsman that his reputation reached us as when his meteor beat the duke of queensberrys egham at newmarket or when he brought jim belcher up from bristol and sprang him upon the london fancy  but usually it was as the friend of the great the arbiter of fashions the king of bucks and the bestdressed man in town that his reputation reached us  my father however did not appear to be elated at my mothers triumphant rejoinder  ay and what does he want asked he in no very amiable voice  i wrote to him anson and told him that rodney was growing a man now thinking since he had no wife or child of his own he might be disposed to advance him  we can do very well without him growled my father  he sheered off from us when the weather was foul and we have no need of him now that the sun is shining  nay you misjudge him anson said my mother warmly  there is no one with a better heart than charles but his own life moves so smoothly that he cannot understand that others may have trouble during all these years i have known that i had but to say the word to receive as much as i wished from him  thank god that you never had to stoop to it mary  i want none of his help  but we must think of rodney  rodney has enough for his seachest and kit  he needs no more  but charles has great power and influence in london  he could make rodney known to all the great people  surely you would not stand in the way of his advancement  let us hear what he says then said my father and this was the letter which she read to him    14 jermyn street st jamess april 15th 1803  my dear sister mary  in answer to your letter i can assure you that you must not conceive me to be wanting in those finer feelings which are the chief adornment of humanity  it is true that for some years absorbed as i have been in affairs of the highest importance i have seldom taken a pen in hand for which i can assure you that i have been reproached by many des plus charmantes of your charming sex at the present moment i lie abed having stayed late in order to pay a compliment to the marchioness of dover at her ball last night and this is writ to my dictation by ambrose my clever rascal of a valet  i am interested to hear of my nephew rodney mon dieu quel nom and as i shall be on my way to visit the prince at brighton next week i shall break my journey at friars oak for the sake of seeing both you and him  make my compliments to your husband  i am ever my dear sister mary your brother charles tregellis   what do you think of that cried my mother in triumph when she had finished  i think it is the letter of a fop said my father bluntly  you are too hard on him anson  you will think better of him when you know him  but he says that he will be here next week and this is thursday and the best curtains unhung and no lavender in the sheets  away she bustled half distracted while my father sat moody with his chin upon his hands and i remained lost in wonder at the thought of this grand new relative from london and of all that his coming might mean to us    chapter vbuck tregellis    now that i was in my seventeenth year and had already some need for a razor i had begun to weary of the narrow life of the village and to long to see something of the great world beyond  the craving was all the stronger because i durst not speak openly about it for the least hint of it brought the tears into my mothers eyes  but now there was the less reason that i should stay at home since my father was at her side and so my mind was all filled by this prospect of my uncles visit and of the chance that he might set my feet moving at last upon the road of life  as you may think it was towards my fathers profession that my thoughts and my hopes turned for from my childhood i have never seen the heave of the sea or tasted the salt upon my lips without feeling the blood of five generations of seamen thrill within my veins  and think of the challenge which was ever waving in those days before the eyes of a coastliving lad  i had but to walk up to wolstonbury in the war time to see the sails of the french chasse marees and privateers  again and again i have heard the roar of the guns coming from far out over the waters  seamen would tell us how they had left london and been engaged ere nightfall or sailed out of portsmouth and been yardarm to yardarm before they had lost sight of st helens light  it was this imminence of the danger which warmed our hearts to our sailors and made us talk round the winter fires of our little nelson and cuddie collingwood and johnnie jarvis and the rest of them not as being great high admirals with titles and dignities but as good friends whom we loved and honoured above all others  what boy was there through the length and breadth of britain who did not long to be out with them under the redcross flag  but now that peace had come and the fleets which had swept the channel and the mediterranean were lying dismantled in our harbours there was less to draw ones fancy seawards  it was london now of which i thought by day and brooded by night  the huge city the home of the wise and the great from which came this constant stream of carriages and those crowds of dusty people who were for ever flashing past our windowpane  it was this one side of life which first presented itself to me and so as a boy i used to picture the city as a gigantic stable with a huge huddle of coaches which were for ever streaming off down the country roads  but then champion harrison told me how the fightingmen lived there and my father how the heads of the navy lived there and my mother how her brother and his grand friends were there until at last i was consumed with impatience to see this marvellous heart of england this coming of my uncle then was the breaking of light through the darkness though i hardly dared to hope that he would take me with him into those high circles in which he lived  my mother however had such confidence either in his good nature or in her own powers of persuasion that she already began to make furtive preparations for my departure  but if the narrowness of the village life chafed my easy spirit it was a torture to the keen and ardent mind of boy jim  it was but a few days after the coming of my uncles letter that we walked over the downs together and i had a peep of the bitterness of his heart  what is there for me to do rodney he cried  i forge a shoe and i fuller it and i clip it and i caulken it and i knock five holes in it and there it is finished  then i do it again and again and blow up the bellows and feed the forge and rasp a hoof or two and there is a days work done and every day the same as the other  was it for this only do you think that i was born into the world  i looked at him his proud eagle face and his tall sinewy figure and i wondered whether in the whole land there was a finer handsomer man  the army or the navy is the place for you jim said i  that is very well he cried  if you go into the navy as you are likely to do you go as an officer and it is you who do the ordering  if i go in it is as one who was born to receive orders  an officer gets his orders from those above him  but an officer does not have the lash hung over his head  i saw a poor fellow at the inn hereit was some years agowho showed us his back in the taproom all cut into red diamonds with the boat swains whip  who ordered that i asked  the captain said he and what would you have had if you had struck him dead said i the yardarm he answered  then if i had been you thats where i should have been said i and i spoke the truth  i cant help it rod  theres something here in my heart something that is as much a part of myself as this hand is which holds me to it  i know that you are as proud as lucifer said i  it was born with me roddy and i cant help it  life would be easier if i could  i was made to be my own master and theres only one place where i can hope to be so  where is that jim  in london  miss hinton has told me of it until i feel as if i could find my way through it from end to end  she loves to talk of it as well as i do to listen  i have it all laid out in my mind and i can see where the playhouses are and how the river runs and where the kings house is and the princes and the place where the fightingmen live  i could make my name known in london  how  never mind how rod  i could do it and i will do it too wait says my unclewait and it will all come right for you that is what he always says and my aunt the same  why should i wait  what am i to wait for  no roddy ill stay no longer eating my heart out in this little village but ill leave my apron behind me and ill seek my fortune in london and when i come back to friars oak it will be in such style as that gentleman yonder  he pointed as he spoke and there was a high crimson curricle coming down the london road with two bay mares harnessed tandem fashion before it  the reins and fittings were of a light fawn colour and the gentleman had a drivingcoat to match with a servant in dark livery behind  they flashed past us in a rolling cloud of dust and i had just a glimpse of the pale handsome face of the master and of the dark shrivelled features of the man  i should never have given them another thought had it not chanced that when the village came into view there was the curricle again standing at the door of the inn and the grooms busy taking out the horses  jim i cried i believe it is my uncle and taking to my heels i ran for home at the top of my speed  at the door was standing the darkfaced servant  he carried a cushion upon which lay a small and fluffy lapdog  you will excuse me young sir said he in the suavest most soothing of voices but am i right in supposing that this is the house of lieutenant stone  in that case you will perhaps do me the favour to hand to mrs stone this note which her brother sir charles tregellis has just committed to my care  i was quite abashed by the mans flowery way of talkingso unlike anything which i had ever heard  he had a wizened face and sharp little dark eyes which took in me and the house and my mothers startled face at the window all in the instant  my parents were together the two of them in the sittingroom and my mother read the note to us  my dear mary it ran i have stopped at the inn because i am somewhat ravage by the dust of your sussex roads  a lavenderwater bath may restore me to a condition in which i may fitly pay my compliments to a lady  meantime i send you fidelio as a hostage pray give him a halfpint of warmish milk with six drops of pure brandy in it  a better or more faithful creature never lived toujours a toicharles  have him in  have him in cried my father heartily running to the door  come in mr fidelio  every man to his own taste and six drops to the halfpint seems a sinful watering of grogbut if you like it so you shall have it  a smile flickered over the dark face of the servant but his features reset themselves instantly into their usual mask of respectful observance  you are labouring under a slight error sir if you will permit me to say so  my name is ambrose and i have the honour to be the valet of sir charles tregellis  this is fidelio upon the cushion  tut the dog cried my father in disgust  heave him down by the fireside  why should he have brandy when many a christian has to go without  hush anson said my mother taking the cushion  you will tell sir charles that his wishes shall be carried out and that we shall expect him at his own convenience  the man went off noiselessly and swiftly but was back in a few minutes with a flat brown basket  it is the refection madam said he  will you permit me to lay the table  sir charles is accustomed to partake of certain dishes and to drink certain wines so that we usually bring them with us when we visit  he opened the basket and in a minute he had the table all shining with silver and glass and studded with dainty dishes  so quick and neat and silent was he in all he did that my father was as taken with him as i was  youd have made a right good foretopman if your heart is as stout as your fingers are quick said he  did you never wish to have the honour of serving your country  it is my honour sir to serve sir charles tregellis and i desire no other master he answered  but i will convey his dressingcase from the inn and then all will be ready  he came back with a great silvermounted box under his arm and close at his heels was the gentleman whose coming had made such a disturbance  my first impression of my uncle as he entered the room was that one of his eyes was swollen to the size of an apple  it caught the breath from my lipsthat monstrous glistening eye  but the next instant i perceived that he held a round glass in the front of it which magnified it in this fashion  he looked at us each in turn and then he bowed very gracefully to my mother and kissed her upon either cheek  you will permit me to compliment you my dear mary said he in a voice which was the most mellow and beautiful that i have ever heard  i can assure you that the country air has used you wondrous well and that i should be proud to see my pretty sister in the mall  i am your servant sir he continued holding out his hand to my father  it was but last week that i had the honour of dining with my friend lord st vincent and i took occasion to mention you to him  i may tell you that your name is not forgotten at the admiralty sir and i hope that i may see you soon walking the poop of a 74gun ship of your own  so this is my nephew is it  he put a hand upon each of my shoulders in a very friendly way and looked me up and down  how old are you nephew he asked  seventeen sir  you look older  you look eighteen at the least  i find him very passable maryvery passable indeed  he has not the bel air the tournurein our uncouth english we have no word for it  but he is as healthy as a mayhedge in bloom  so within a minute of his entering our door he had got himself upon terms with all of us and with so easy and graceful a manner that it seemed as if he had known us all for years  i had a good look at him now as he stood upon the hearthrug with my mother upon one side and my father on the other  he was a very large man with noble shoulders small waist broad hips wellturned legs and the smallest of hands and feet  his face was pale and handsome with a prominent chin a jutting nose and large blue staring eyes in which a sort of dancing mischievous light was for ever playing  he wore a deep brown coat with a collar as high as his ears and tails as low as his knees  his black breeches and silk stockings ended in very small pointed shoes so highly polished that they twinkled with every movement  his vest was of black velvet open at the top to show an embroidered shirtfront with a high smooth white cravat above it which kept his neck for ever on the stretch  he stood easily with one thumb in the armpit and two fingers of the other hand in his vest pocket  it made me proud as i watched him to think that so magnificent a man with such easy masterful ways should be my own blood relation and i could see from my mothers eyes as they turned towards him that the same thought was in her mind  all this time ambrose had been standing like a darkclothed bronze faced image by the door with the big silverbound box under his arm  he stepped forward now into the room  shall i convey it to your bedchamber sir charles he asked  ah pardon me sister mary cried my uncle i am oldfashioned enough to have principlesan anachronism i know in this lax age one of them is never to allow my batterie de toilette out of my sight when i am travelling  i cannot readily forget the agonies which i endured some years ago through neglecting this precaution i will do ambrose the justice to say that it was before he took charge of my affairs  i was compelled to wear the same ruffles upon two consecutive days  on the third morning my fellow was so affected by the sight of my condition that he burst into tears and laid out a pair which he had stolen from me  as he spoke his face was very grave but the light in his eyes danced and gleamed  he handed his open snuffbox to my father as ambrose followed my mother out of the room  you number yourself in an illustrious company by upping your finger and thumb into it said he  indeed sir said my father shortly  you are free of my box as being a relative by marriage  you are free also nephew and i pray you to take a pinch  it is the most intimate sign of my goodwill  outside ourselves there are four i think who have had access to itthe prince of course mr pitt monsieur otto the french ambassador and lord hawkesbury  i have sometimes thought that i was premature with lord hawkesbury  i am vastly honoured sir said my father looking suspiciously at his guest from under his shaggy eyebrows for with that grave face and those twinkling eyes it was hard to know how to take him  a woman sir has her love to bestow said my uncle  a man has his snuffbox  neither is to be lightly offered  it is a lapse of taste nay more it is a breach of morals  only the other day as i was seated in watiers my box of prime macouba open upon the table beside me an irish bishop thrust in his intrusive fingers waiter i cried my box has been soiled  remove it  the man meant no insult you understand but that class of people must be kept in their proper sphere  a bishop cried my father  you draw your line very high sir  yes sir said my uncle i wish no better epitaph upon my tombstone  my mother had in the meanwhile descended and we all drew up to the table  you will excuse my apparent grossness mary in venturing to bring my own larder with me  abernethy has me under his orders and i must eschew your rich country dainties  a little white wine and a cold birdit is as much as the niggardly scotchman will allow me  we should have you on blockading service when the levanters are blowing said my father  salt junk and weevilly biscuits with a rib of a tough barbary ox when the tenders come in  you would have your spare diet there sir  straightway my uncle began to question him about the sea service and for the whole meal my father was telling him of the nile and of the toulon blockade and the siege of genoa and all that he had seen and done  but whenever he faltered for a word my uncle always had it ready for him and it was hard to say which knew most about the business  no i read little or nothing said he when my father marvelled where he got his knowledge  the fact is that i can hardly pick up a print without seeing some allusion to myself  sir c t does this or sir c t says the other so i take them no longer  but if a man is in my position all knowledge comes to him  the duke of york tells me of the army in the morning and lord spencer chats with me of the navy in the afternoon and dundas whispers me what is going forward in the cabinet so that i have little need of the times or the morning chronicle  this set him talking of the great world of london telling my father about the men who were his masters at the admiralty and my mother about the beauties of the town and the great ladies at almacks but all in the same light fanciful way so that one never knew whether to laugh or to take him gravely  i think it flattered him to see the way in which we all three hung upon his words  of some he thought highly and of some lowly but he made no secret that the highest of all and the one against whom all others should be measured was sir charles tregellis himself  as to the king said he of course i am lami de famille there and even with you i can scarce speak freely as my relations are confidential  god bless him and keep him from ill cried my father  it is pleasant to hear you say so said my uncle  one has to come into the country to hear honest loyalty for a sneer and a gibe are more the fashions in town  the king is grateful to me for the interest which i have ever shown in his son  he likes to think that the prince has a man of taste in his circle  and the prince asked my mother  is he wellfavoured  he is a fine figure of a man  at a distance he has been mistaken for me  and he has some taste in dress though he gets slovenly if i am too long away from him  i warrant you that i find a crease in his coat tomorrow  we were all seated round the fire by this time for the evening had turned chilly  the lamp was lighted and so also was my fathers pipe  i suppose said he that this is your first visit to friars oak  my uncles face turned suddenly very grave and stern  it is my first visit for many years said he  i was but oneand twenty years of age when last i came here  i am not likely to forget it  i knew that he spoke of his visit to cliffe royal at the time of the murder and i saw by her face that my mother knew it also  my father however had either never heard of it or had forgotten the circumstance  was it at the inn you stayed he asked  i stayed with the unfortunate lord avon  it was the occasion when he was accused of slaying his younger brother and fled from the country  we all fell silent and my uncle leaned his chin upon his hand looking thoughtfully into the fire  if i do but close my eyes now i can see the light upon his proud handsome face and see also my dear father concerned at having touched upon so terrible a memory shooting little slanting glances at him betwixt the puffs of his pipe  i dare say that it has happened with you sir said my uncle at last that you have lost some dear messmate in battle or wreck and that you have put him out of your mind in the routine of your daily life until suddenly some word or some scene brings him back to your memory and you find your sorrow as raw as upon the first day of your loss  my father nodded  so it is with me tonight  i never formed a close friendship with a mani say nothing of womensave only the once  that was with lord avon  we were of an age he a few years perhaps my senior but our tastes our judgments and our characters were alike save only that he had in him a touch of pride such as i have never known in any other man  putting aside the little foibles of a rich young man of fashion les indescretions dune jeunesse doree i could have sworn that he was as good a man as i have ever known  how came he then to such a crime asked my father  my uncle shook his head  many a time have i asked myself that question and it comes home to me more tonight than ever  all the jauntiness had gone out of his manner and he had turned suddenly into a sad and serious man  was it certain that he did it charles asked my mother  my uncle shrugged his shoulders  i wish i could think it were not so  i have thought sometimes that it was this very pride turning suddenly to madness which drove him to it  you have heard how he returned the money which we had lost  nay i have heard nothing of it my father answered  it is a very old story now though we have not yet found an end to it  we had played for two days the four of us  lord avon his brother captain barrington sir lothian hume and myself  of the captain i knew little save that he was not of the best repute and was deep in the hands of the jews  sir lothian has made an evil name for himself sincetis the same sir lothian who shot lord carton in the affair at chalk farmbut in those days there was nothing against him  the oldest of us was but twentyfour and we gamed on as i say until the captain had cleared the board  we were all hit but our host far the hardest  that nighti tell you now what it would be a bitter thing for me to tell in a court of lawi was restless and sleepless as often happens when a man has kept awake over long  my mind would dwell upon the fall of the cards and i was tossing and turning in my bed when suddenly a cry fell upon my ears and then a second louder one coming from the direction of captain barringtons room  five minutes later i heard steps passing down the passage and without striking a light i opened my door and peeped out thinking that some one was taken unwell  there was lord avon walking towards me in one hand he held a guttering candle and in the other a brown bag which chinked as he moved  his face was all drawn and distortedso much so that my question was frozen upon my lips  before i could utter it he turned into his chamber and softly closed the door  next morning i was awakened by finding him at my bedside  charles said he i cannot abide to think that you should have lost this money in my house  you will find it here upon your table  it was in vain that i laughed at his squeamishness telling him that i should most certainly have claimed my money had i won so that it would be strange indeed if i were not permitted to pay it when i lost  neither i nor my brother will touch it said he  there it lies and you may do what you like about it  he would listen to no argument but dashed out of the room like a madman  but perhaps these details are familiar to you and god knows they are painful to me to tell  my father was sitting with staring eyes and his forgotten pipe reeking in his hand  pray let us hear the end of it sir he cried  well then i had finished my toilet in an hour or sofor i was less exigeant in those days than nowand i met sir lothian hume at breakfast  his experience had been the same as my own and he was eager to see captain barrington and to ascertain why he had directed his brother to return the money to us  we were talking the matter over when suddenly i raised my eyes to the corner of the ceiling and i sawi saw  my uncle had turned quite pale with the vividness of the memory and he passed his hand over his eyes  it was crimson said he with a shuddercrimson with black cracks and from every crackbut i will give you dreams sister mary  suffice it that we rushed up the stair which led direct to the captains room and there we found him lying with the bone gleaming white through his throat  a huntingknife lay in the room and the knife was lord avons  a lace ruffle was found in the dead mans graspand the ruffle was lord avons  some papers were found charred in the grateand the papers were lord avons  oh my poor friend in what moment of madness did you come to do such a deed  the light had gone out of my uncles eyes and the extravagance from his manner  his speech was clear and plain with none of those strange london ways which had so amazed me  here was a second uncle a man of heart and a man of brains and i liked him better than the first  and what said lord avon cried my father  he said nothing  he went about like one who walks in his sleep with horrorstricken eyes  none dared arrest him until there should be due inquiry but when the coroners court brought wilful murder against him the constables came for him in full cry  but they found him fled  there was a rumour that he had been seen in westminster in the next week and then that he had escaped for america but nothing more is known  it will be a bright day for sir lothian hume when they can prove him dead for he is next of kin and till then he can touch neither title nor estate  the telling of this grim story had cast a chill upon all of us  my uncle held out his hands towards the blaze and i noticed that they were as white as the ruffles which fringed them  i know not how things are at cliffe royal now said he thoughtfully  it was not a cheery house even before this shadow fell upon it  a fitter stage was never set forth for such a tragedy  but seventeen years have passed and perhaps even that horrible ceiling  it still bears the stain said i  i know not which of the three was the more astonished for my mother had not heard of my adventures of the night  they never took their wondering eyes off me as i told my story and my heart swelled with pride when my uncle said that we had carried ourselves well and that he did not think that many of our age would have stood it as stoutly  but as to this ghost it must have been the creature of your own minds said he  imagination plays us strange tricks and though i have as steady a nerve as a man might wish i cannot answer for what i might see if i were to stand under that bloodstained ceiling at midnight  uncle said i i saw a figure as plainly as i see that fire and i heard the steps as clearly as i hear the crackle of the fagots besides we could not both be deceived  there is truth in that said be thoughtfully  you saw no features you say  it was too dark  but only a figure  the dark outline of one  and it retreated up the stairs  yes  and vanished into the wall  yes  what part of the wall cried a voice from behind us  my mother screamed and down came my fathers pipe on to the hearthrug  i had sprung round with a catch of my breath and there was the valet ambrose his body in the shadow of the doorway his dark face protruded into the light and two burning eyes fixed upon mine  what the deuce is the meaning of this sir cried my uncle  it was strange to see the gleam and passion fade out of the mans face and the demure mask of the valet replace it  his eyes still smouldered but his features regained their prim composure in an instant  i beg your pardon sir charles said he  i had come in to ask you if you had any orders for me and i did not like to interrupt the young gentlemans story  i am afraid that i have been somewhat carried away by it  i never knew you forget yourself before said my uncle  you will i am sure forgive me sir charles if you will call to mind the relation in which i stood to lord avon  he spoke with some dignity of manner and with a bow he left the room  we must make some little allowance said my uncle with a sudden return to his jaunty manner  when a man can brew a dish of chocolate or tie a cravat as ambrose does he may claim consideration  the fact is that the poor fellow was valet to lord avon that he was at cliffe royal upon the fatal night of which i have spoken and that he is most devoted to his old master  but my talk has been somewhat triste sister mary and now we shall return if you please to the dresses of the countess lieven and the gossip of st james    chapter vion the threshold    my father sent me to bed early that night though i was very eager to stay up for every word which this man said held my attention his face his manner the large waves and sweeps of his white hands his easy air of superiority his fantastic fashion of talk all filled me with interest and wonder  but as i afterwards learned their conversation was to be about myself and my own prospects so i was despatched to my room whence far into the night i could hear the deep growl of my father and the rich tones of my uncle with an occasional gentle murmur from my mother as they talked in the room beneath  i had dropped asleep at last when i was awakened suddenly by something wet being pressed against my face and by two warm arms which were cast round me  my mothers cheek was against my own and i could hear the click of her sobs and feel her quiver and shake in the darkness  a faint light stole through the latticed window and i could dimly see that she was in white with her black hair loose upon her shoulders  you wont forget us roddy  you wont forget us  why mother what is it  your uncle roddyhe is going to take you away from us  when mother  tomorrow  god forgive me how my heart bounded for joy when hers which was within touch of it was breaking with sorrow  oh mother i cried  to london  first to brighton that he may present you to the prince  next day to london where you will meet the great people roddy and learn to look down uponto look down upon your poor simple oldfashioned father and mother  i put my arms about her to console her but she wept so that for all my seventeen years and pride of manhood it set me weeping also and with such a hiccoughing noise since i had not a womans knack of quiet tears that it finally turned her own grief to laughter  charles would be flattered if he could see the gracious way in which we receive his kindness said she  be still roddy dear or you will certainly wake him  ill not go if it is to grieve you i cried  nay dear you must go for it may be the one great chance of your life  and think how proud it will make us all when we hear of you in the company of charless grand friends  but you will promise me not to gamble roddy  you heard tonight of the dreadful things which come from it  i promise you mother  and you will be careful of wine roddy  you are young and unused to it  yes mother  and playactresses also roddy  and you will not cast your underclothing until june is in  young master overton came by his death through it  think well of your dress roddy so as to do your uncle credit for it is the thing for which he is himself most famed  you have but to do what he will direct  but if there is a time when you are not meeting grand people you can wear out your country things for your brown coat is as good as new and the blue one if it were ironed and relined would take you through the summer  i have put out your sunday clothes with the nankeen vest since you are to see the prince tomorrow and you will wear your brown silk stockings and buckle shoes  be guarded in crossing the london streets for i am told that the hackney coaches are past all imagining  fold your clothes when you go to bed roddy and do not forget your evening prayers for oh my dear boy the days of temptation are at hand when i will no longer be with you to help you  so with advice and guidance both for this world and the next did my mother with her soft warm arms around me prepare me for the great step which lay before me  my uncle did not appear at breakfast in the morning but ambrose brewed him a dish of chocolate and took it to his room  when at last about midday he did descend he was so fine with his curled hair his shining teeth his quizzing glass his snowwhite ruffles and his laughing eyes that i could not take my gaze from him  well nephew he cried what do you think of the prospect of coming to town with me  i thank you sir for the kind interest which you take in me said i  but you must be a credit to me  my nephew must be of the best if he is to be in keeping with the rest of me  youll find him a chip of good wood sir said my father  we must make him a polished chip before we have done with him your aim my dear nephew must always be to be in bon ton  it is not a case of wealth you understand  mere riches cannot do it golden price has forty thousand a year but his clothes are disastrous  i assure you that i saw him come down st jamess street the other day and i was so shocked at his appearance that i had to step into vernets for a glass of orange brandy  no it is a question of natural taste and of following the advice and example of those who are more experienced than yourself  i fear charles that roddys wardrobe is countrymade said my mother  we shall soon set that right when we get to town  we shall see what stultz or weston can do for him my uncle answered  we must keep him quiet until he has some clothes to wear  this slight upon my best sunday suit brought a flush to my mothers cheeks which my uncle instantly observed for he was quick in noticing trifles  the clothes are very well for friars oak sister mary said he and yet you can understand that they might seem rococo in the mall if you leave him in my hands i shall see to the matter  on how much sir asked my father can a young man dress in town  with prudence and reasonable care a young man of fashion can dress upon eight hundred a year my uncle answered  i saw my poor fathers face grow longer  i fear sir that roddy must keep his country clothes said he even with my prizemoney  tut sir cried my uncle  i already owe weston something over a thousand so how can a few odd hundreds affect it  if my nephew comes with me my nephew is my care  the point is settled and i must refuse to argue upon it  he waved his white hands as if to brush aside all opposition  my parents tried to thank him but he cut them short  by the way now that i am in friars oak there is another small piece of business which i have to perform said he  i believe that there is a fightingman named harrison here who at one time might have held the championship  in those days poor avon and i were his principal backers  i should like to have a word with him  you may think how proud i was to walk down the village street with my magnificent relative and to note out of the corner of my eye how the folk came to the doors and windows to see us pass  champion harrison was standing outside the smithy and he pulled his cap off when he saw my uncle  god bless me sir  whod ha thought of seem you at friars oak why sir charles it brings old memories back to look at your face again  glad to see you looking so fit harrison said my uncle running his eyes over him  why with a weeks training you would be as good a man as ever  i dont suppose you scale more than thirteen and a half  thirteen ten sir charles  im in my fortieth year but i am sound in wind and limb and if my old woman would have let me off my promise id ha had a try with some of these young ones before now i hear that theyve got some amazin good stuff up from bristol of late  yes the bristol yellowman has been the winning colour of late how dye do mrs harrison  i dont suppose you remember me  she had come out from the house and i noticed that her worn face on which some past terror seemed to have left its shadowhardened into stern lines as she looked at my uncle  i remember you too well sir charles tregellis said she  i trust that you have not come here today to try to draw my husband back into the ways that he has forsaken  thats the way with her sir charles said harrison resting his great hand upon the womans shoulder  shes got my promise and she holds me to it  there was never a better or more hardworking wife but she aint what youd call a patron of sport and thats a fact  sport cried the woman bitterly  a fine sport for you sir charles with your pleasant twentymile drive into the country and your luncheonbasket and your wines and so merrily back to london in the cool of the evening with a wellfought battle to talk over think of the sport that it was to me to sit through the long hours listening for the wheels of the chaise which would bring my man back to me  sometimes he could walk in and sometimes he was led in and sometimes he was carried in and it was only by his clothes that i could know him  come wifie said harrison patting her on the shoulder  ive been cut up in my time but never as bad as that  and then to live for weeks afterwards with the fear that every knock at the door may be to tell us that the other is dead and that my man may have to stand in the dock and take his trial for murder  no she hasnt got a sportin drop in her veins said harrison shed never make a patron never  its black baruks business that did it when we thought hed napped it once too often  well she has my promise and ill never sling my hat over the ropes unless she gives me leave  youll keep your hat on your head like an honest godfearing man john said his wife turning back into the house  i wouldnt for the world say anything to make you change your resolutions said my uncle  at the same time if you had wished to take a turn at the old sport i had a good thing to put in your way  well its no use sir said harrison but id be glad to hear about it all the same  they have a very good bit of stuff at thirteen stone down gloucester way  wilson is his name and they call him crab on account of his style  harrison shook his head  never heard of him sir  very likely not for he has never shown in the pr  but they think great things of him in the west and he can hold his own with either of the belchers with the mufflers  sparrin aint fightin said the smith  i am told that he had the best of it in a bybattle with noah james of cheshire  theres no gamer man on the list sir than noah james the guardsman said harrison  i saw him myself fight fifty rounds after his jaw had been cracked in three places  if wilson could beat him wilson will go far  so they think in the west and they mean to spring him on the london talent  sir lothian hume is his patron and to make a long story short he lays me odds that i wont find a young one of his weight to meet him  i told him that i had not heard of any good young ones but that i had an old one who had not put his foot into a ring for many years who would make his man wish he had never come to london  young or old under twenty or over thirtyfive you may bring whom you will at the weight and i shall lay two to one on wilson said he  i took him in thousands and here i am  it wont do sir charles said the smith shaking his head theres nothing would please me better but you heard for yourself  well if you wont fight harrison i must try to get some promising colt  id be glad of your advice in the matter  by the way i take the chair at a supper of the fancy at the waggon and horses in st martins lane next friday  i should be very glad if you will make one of my guests  halloa whos this  up flew his glass to his eye  boy jim had come out from the forge with his hammer in his hand  he had i remember a grey flannel shirt which was open at the neck and turned up at the sleeves  my uncle ran his eyes over the fine lines of his magnificent figure with the glance of a connoisseur  thats my nephew sir charles  is he living with you  his parents are dead  has he ever been in london  no sir charles  hes been with me here since he was as high as that hammer  my uncle turned to boy jim  i hear that you have never been in london said he  your uncle is coming up to a supper which i am giving to the fancy next friday would you care to make one of us  boy jims dark eyes sparkled with pleasure  i should be glad to come sir  no no jim cried the smith abruptly  im sorry to gainsay you lad but there are reasons why i had rather you stayed down here with your aunt  tut harrison let the lad come cried my uncle  no no sir charles  its dangerous company for a lad of his mettle  theres plenty for him to do when im away  poor jim turned away with a clouded brow and strode into the smithy again  for my part i slipped after him to try to console him and to tell him all the wonderful changes which had come so suddenly into my life  but i had not got half through my story and jim like the good fellow that he was had just begun to forget his own troubles in his delight at my good fortune when my uncle called to me from without  the curricle with its tandem mares was waiting for us outside the cottage and ambrose had placed the refectionbasket the lapdog and the precious toiletbox inside of it  he had himself climbed up behind and i after a hearty handshake from my father and a last sobbing embrace from my mother took my place beside my uncle in the front  let go her head cried he to the ostler and with a snap a crack and a jingle away we went upon our journey  across all the years how clearly i can see that spring day with the green english fields the windy english sky and the yellow beetle browed cottage in which i had grown from a child to a man  i see too the figures at the garden gate  my mother with her face turned away and her handkerchief waving my father with his blue coat and his white shorts leaning upon his stick with his hand shading his eyes as he peered after us  all the village was out to see young roddy stone go off with his grand relative from london to call upon the prince in his own palace  the harrisons were waving to me from the smithy and john cummings from the steps of the inn and i saw joshua allen my old schoolmaster pointing me out to the people as if he were showing what came from his teaching  to make it complete who should drive past just as we cleared the village but miss hinton the playactress the pony and phaeton the same as when first i saw her but she herself another woman and i thought to myself that if boy jim had done nothing but that one thing he need not think that his youth had been wasted in the country  she was driving to see him i have no doubt for they were closer than ever and she never looked up nor saw the hand that i waved to her so as we took the curve of the road the little village vanished and there in the dip of the downs past the spires of patcham and of preston lay the broad blue sea and the grey houses of brighton with the strange eastern domes and minarets of the princes pavilion shooting out from the centre of it  to every traveller it was a sight of beauty but to me it was the worldthe great wide free worldand my heart thrilled and fluttered as the young birds may when it first hears the whirr of its own flight and skims along with the blue heaven above it and the green fields beneath  the day may come when it may look back regretfully to the snug nest in the thornbush but what does it reck of that when spring is in the air and youth in its blood and the old hawk of trouble has not yet darkened the sunshine with the ill boding shadow of its wings    chapter viithe hope of england    my uncle drove for some time in silence but i was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me and i had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived  you sing dont you nephew he asked suddenly  yes sir a little  a baritone i should fancy  yes sir  and your mother tells me that you play the fiddle  these things will be of service to you with the prince  music runs in his family  your education has been what you could get at a village school  well you are not examined in greek roots in polite society which is lucky for some of us  it is as well just to have a tag or two of horace or virgil  sub tegmine fagi or habet foenum in cornu which gives a flavour to ones conversation like the touch of garlic in a salad  it is not bon ton to be learned but it is a graceful thing to indicate that you have forgotten a good deal  can you write verse  i fear not sir  a small book of rhymes may be had for half a crown  vers de societe are a great assistance to a young man  if you have the ladies on your side it does not matter whom you have against you you must learn to open a door to enter a room to present a snuff box raising the lid with the forefinger of the hand in which you hold it  you must acquire the bow for a man with its necessary touch of dignity and that for a lady which cannot be too humble and should still contain the least suspicion of abandon  you must cultivate a manner with women which shall be deprecating and yet audacious  have you any eccentricity  it made me laugh the easy way in which he asked the question as if it were a most natural thing to possess  you have a pleasant catching laugh at all events said he  but an eccentricity is very bon ton at present and if you feel any leaning towards one i should certainly advise you to let it run its course  petersham would have remained a mere peer all his life had it not come out that he had a snuffbox for every day in the year and that he had caught cold through a mistake of his valet who sent him out on a bitter winter day with a thin sevres china box instead of a thick tortoiseshell  that brought him out of the ruck you see and people remember him  even some small characteristic such as having an apricot tart on your sideboard all the year round or putting your candle out at night by stuffing it under your pillow serves to separate you from your neighbour  in my own case it is my precise judgment upon matter of dress and decorum which has placed me where i am  i do not profess to follow a law  i set one for example i am taking you today to see the prince in a nankeen vest  what do you think will be the consequence of that  my fears told me that it might be my own very great discomfiture but i did not say so  why the night coach will carry the news to london  it will be in brookess and whites tomorrow morning  within a week st jamess street and the mall will be full of nankeen waistcoats  a most painful incident happened to me once  my cravat came undone in the street and i actually walked from carlton house to watiers in bruton street with the two ends hanging loose  do you suppose it shook my position  the same evening there were dozens of young bloods walking the streets of london with their cravats loose  if i had not rearranged mine there would not be one tied in the whole kingdom now and a great art would have been prematurely lost  you have not yet began to practise it  i confessed that i had not  you should begin now in your youth  i will myself teach you the coup darchet  by using a few hours in each day which would otherwise be wasted you may hope to have excellent cravats in middle life  the whole knack lies in pointing your chin to the sky and then arranging your folds by the gradual descent of your lower jaw  when my uncle spoke like this there was always that dancing mischievous light in his dark blue eyes which showed me that this humour of his was a conscious eccentricity depending as i believe upon a natural fastidiousness of taste but wilfully driven to grotesque lengths for the very reason which made him recommend me also to develop some peculiarity of my own  when i thought of the way in which he had spoken of his unhappy friend lord avon upon the evening before and of the emotion which he showed as he told the horrible story i was glad to think that there was the heart of a man there however much it might please him to conceal it  and as it happened i was very soon to have another peep at it for a most unexpected event befell us as we drew up in front of the crown hotel  a swarm of ostlers and grooms had rushed out to us and my uncle throwing down the reins gathered fidelio on his cushion from under the seat  ambrose he cried you may take fidelio  but there came no answer  the seat behind was unoccupied  ambrose was gone  we could hardly believe our eyes when we alighted and found that it was really so  he had most certainly taken his seat there at friars oak and from there on we had come without a break as fast as the mares could travel  whither then could he have vanished to  hes fallen off in a fit cried my uncle  id drive back but the prince is expecting us  wheres the landlord  here coppinger send your best man back to friars oak as fast as his horse can go to find news of my valet ambrose  see that no pains be spared now nephew we shall lunch and then go up to the pavilion  my uncle was much disturbed by the strange loss of his valet the more so as it was his custom to go through a whole series of washings and changings after even the shortest journey  for my own part mindful of my mothers advice i carefully brushed the dust from my clothes and made myself as neat as possible  my heart was down in the soles of my little silverbuckled shoes now that i had the immediate prospect of meeting so great and terrible a person as the prince of wales  i had seen his flaring yellow barouche flying through friars oak many a time and had halloaed and waved my hat with the others as it passed but never in my wildest dreams had it entered my head that i should ever be called upon to look him in the face and answer his questions  my mother had taught me to regard him with reverence as one of those whom god had placed to rule over us but my uncle smiled when i told him of her teaching  you are old enough to see things as they are nephew said he and your knowledge of them is the badge that you are in that inner circle where i mean to place you  there is no one who knows the prince better than i do and there is no one who trusts him less  a stranger contradiction of qualities was never gathered under one hat  he is a man who is always in a hurry and yet has never anything to do  he fusses about things with which he has no concern and he neglects every obvious duty  he is generous to those who have no claim upon him but he has ruined his tradesmen by refusing to pay his just debts  he is affectionate to casual acquaintances but he dislikes his father loathes his mother and is not on speaking terms with his wife  he claims to be the first gentleman of england but the gentlemen of england have responded by blackballing his friends at their clubs and by warning him off from newmarket under suspicion of having tampered with a horse  he spends his days in uttering noble sentiments and contradicting them by ignoble actions  he tells stories of his own doings which are so grotesque that they can only be explained by the madness which runs in his blood  and yet with all this he can be courteous dignified and kindly upon occasion and i have seen an impulsive goodheartedness in the man which has made me overlook faults which come mainly from his being placed in a position which no one upon this earth was ever less fitted to fill  but this is between ourselves nephew and now you will come with me and you will form an opinion for yourself  it was but a short walk and yet it took us some time for my uncle stalked along with great dignity his lacebordered handkerchief in one hand and his cane with the clouded amber head dangling from the other  every one that we met seemed to know him and their hats flew from their heads as we passed  he took little notice of these greetings save to give a nod to one or to slightly raise his forefinger to another  it chanced however that as we turned into the pavilion grounds we met a magnificent team of four coalblack horses driven by a roughlooking middleaged fellow in an old weatherstained cape  there was nothing that i could see to distinguish him from any professional driver save that he was chatting very freely with a dainty little woman who was perched on the box beside him  halloa charlie  good drive down he cried  my uncle bowed and smiled to the lady  broke it at friars oak said he  ive my light curricle and two new mareshalf thoroughbred half cleveland bay  what dyou think of my team of blacks asked the other  yes sir charles what dyou think of them  aint they damnation smart cried the little woman  plenty of power  good horses for the sussex clay  too thick about the fetlocks for me  i like to travel  travel cried the woman with extraordinary vehemence  why what the and she broke into such language as i had never heard from a mans lips before  wed start with our swinglebars touching and wed have your dinner ordered cooked laid and eaten before you were there to claim it  by george yes letty is right cried the man  dyou start to morrow  yes jack  well ill make you an offer  look ye here charlie  ill spring my cattle from the castle square at quarter before nine  you can follow as the clock strikes  ive double the horses and double the weight  if you so much as see me before we cross westminster bridge ill pay you a cool hundred  if not its my moneyplay or pay  is it a match  very good said my uncle and raising his hat he led the way into the grounds  as i followed i saw the woman take the reins while the man looked after us and squirted a jet of tobaccojuice from between his teeth in coachman fashion  thats sir john lade said my uncle one of the richest men and best whips in england  there isnt a professional on the road that can handle either his tongue or his ribbons better but his wife lady letty is his match with the one or the other  it was dreadful to hear her said i  oh its her eccentricity  we all have them and she amuses the prince  now nephew keep close at my elbow and have your eyes open and your mouth shut  two lines of magnificent red and gold footmen who guarded the door bowed deeply as my uncle and i passed between them he with his head in the air and a manner as if he entered into his own whilst i tried to look assured though my heart was beating thin and fast within there was a high and large hall ornamented with eastern decorations which harmonized with the domes and minarets of the exterior  a number of people were moving quietly about forming into groups and whispering to each other  one of these a short burly redfaced man full of fuss and selfimportance came hurrying up to my uncle  i have de goot news sir charles said he sinking his voice as one who speaks of weighty measures  es ist vollendetdat is i have it at last thoroughly done  well serve it hot said my uncle coldly and see that the sauces are a little better than when last i dined at carlton house  ah mine gott you tink i talk of de cuisine  it is de affair of de prince dat i speak of  dat is one little volauvent dat is worth one hundred tousand pound  ten per cent and double to be repaid when de royal pappa die  alles ist fertig  goldshmidt of de hague have took it up and de dutch public has subscribe de money  god help the dutch public muttered my uncle as the fat little man bustled off with his news to some newcomer  thats the princes famous cook nephew  he has not his equal in england for a filet saute aux champignons  he manages his masters money affairs  the cook i exclaimed in bewilderment  you look surprised nephew  i should have thought that some respectable banking firm  my uncle inclined his lips to my ear  no respectable house would touch them he whispered  ah mellish is the prince within  in the private saloon sir charles said the gentleman addressed  any one with him  sheridan and francis  he said he expected you  then we shall go through  i followed him through the strangest succession of rooms full of curious barbaric splendour which impressed me as being very rich and wonderful though perhaps i should think differently now  gold and scarlet in arabesque designs gleamed upon the walls with gilt dragons and monsters writhing along cornices and out of corners look where i would on panel or ceiling a score of mirrors flashed back the picture of the tall proud whitefaced man and the youth who walked so demurely at his elbow  finally a footman opened a door and we found ourselves in the princes own private apartment  two gentlemen were lounging in a very easy fashion upon luxurious fauteuils at the further end of the room and a third stood between them his thick wellformed legs somewhat apart and his hands clasped behind him  the sun was shining in upon them through a sidewindow and i can see the three faces nowone in the dusk one in the light and one cut across by the shadow  of those at the sides i recall the reddish nose and dark flashing eyes of the one and the hard austere face of the other with the high coatcollars and manywreathed cravats  these i took in at a glance but it was upon the man in the centre that my gaze was fixed for this i knew must be the prince of wales  george was then in his fortyfirst year and with the help of his tailor and his hairdresser he might have passed as somewhat less the sight of him put me at my ease for he was a merrylooking man handsome too in a portly fullblooded way with laughing eyes and pouting sensitive lips  his nose was turned upwards which increased the goodhumoured effect of his countenance at the expense of its dignity  his cheeks were pale and sodden like those of a man who lived too well and took too little exercise  he was dressed in a singlebreasted black coat buttoned up a pair of leather pantaloons stretched tightly across his broad thighs polished hessian boots and a huge white neckcloth  halloa tregellis he cried in the cheeriest fashion as my uncle crossed the threshold and then suddenly the smile faded from his face and his eyes gleamed with resentment  what the deuce is this he shouted angrily  a thrill of fear passed through me as i thought that it was my appearance which had produced this outburst  but his eyes were gazing past us and glancing round we saw that a man in a brown coat and scratch wig had followed so closely at our heels that the footmen had let him pass under the impression that he was of our party  his face was very red and the folded blue paper which he carried in his hand shook and crackled in his excitement  why its vuillamy the furniture man cried the prince  what am i to be dunned in my own private room  wheres mellish  wheres townshend  what the deuce is tom tring doing  i wouldnt have intruded your royal highness but i must have the moneyor even a thousand on account would do  must have it must you vuillamy  thats a fine word to use  i pay my debts in my own time and im not to be bullied  turn him out footman  take him away  if i dont get it by monday i shall be in your papas bench wailed the little man and as the footman led him out we could hear him amidst shouts of laughter still protesting that he would wind up in papas bench  thats the very place for a furniture man said the man with the red nose  it should be the longest bench in the world sherry answered the prince for a good many of his subjects will want seats on it very glad to see you back tregellis but you must really be more careful what you bring in upon your skirts  it was only yesterday that we had an infernal dutchman here howling about some arrears of interest and the deuce knows what  my good fellow said i as long as the commons starve me i have to starve you and so the matter ended  i think sir that the commons would respond now if the matter were fairly put before them by charlie fox or myself said sheridan  the prince burst out against the commons with an energy of hatred that one would scarce expect from that chubby goodhumoured face  why curse them he cried  after all their preaching and throwing my fathers model life as they called it in my teeth they had to pay his debts to the tune of nearly a million whilst i cant get a hundred thousand out of them  and look at all theyve done for my brothers  york is commanderinchief  clarence is admiral  what am i  colonel of a damned dragoon regiment under the orders of my own younger brother  its my mother thats at the bottom of it all  she always tried to hold me back  but whats this youve brought tregellis eh  my uncle put his hand on my sleeve and led me forward  this is my sisters son sir rodney stone by name said he  he is coming with me to london and i thought it right to begin by presenting him to your royal highness  quite right  quite right said the prince with a goodnatured smile patting me in a friendly way upon the shoulder  is your mother living  yes sir said i  if you are a good son to her you will never go wrong  and mark my words mr rodney stone you should honour the king love your country and uphold the glorious british constitution  when i thought of the energy with which he had just been cursing the house of commons i could scarce keep from smiling and i saw sheridan put his hand up to his lips  you have only to do this to show a regard for your word and to keep out of debt in order to insure a happy and respected life what is your father mr stone  royal navy  well it is a glorious service  i have had a touch of it myself  did i ever tell you how we laid aboard the french sloop of war minervehey tregellis  no sir said my uncle  sheridan and francis exchanged glances behind the princes back  she was flying her tricolour out there within sight of my pavilion windows  never saw such monstrous impudence in my life  it would take a man of less mettle than me to stand it  out i went in my little cockboatyou know my sixtyton yawl charliewith two fourpounders on each side and a sixpounder in the bows  well sir  well sir  and what then sir cried francis who appeared to be an irascible roughtongued man  you will permit me to tell the story in my own way sir philip said the prince with dignity  i was about to say that our metal was so light that i give you my word gentlemen that i carried my port broadside in one coat pocket and my starboard in the other up we came to the big frenchman took her fire and scraped the paint off her before we let drive  but it was no use  by george gentlemen our balls just stuck in her timbers like stones in a mud wall  she had her nettings up but we scrambled aboard and at it we went hammer and anvil  it was a sharp twenty minutes but we beat her people down below made the hatches fast on them and towed her into seaham  surely you were with us sherry  i was in london at the time said sheridan gravely  you can vouch for it francis  i can vouch to having heard your highness tell the story  it was a rough little bit of cutlass and pistol work  but for my own part i like the rapier  its a gentlemans weapon  you heard of my bout with the chevalier deon  i had him at my swordpoint for forty minutes at angelos  he was one of the best blades in europe but i was a little too supple in the wrist for him  i thank god there was a button on your highnesss foil said he when we had finished our breather  by the way youre a bit of a duellist yourself tregellis  how often have you been out  i used to go when i needed exercise said my uncle carelessly but i have taken to tennis now instead  a painful incident happened the last time that i was out and it sickened me of it  you killed your man  no no sir it was worse than that  i had a coat that weston has never equalled  to say that it fitted me is not to express it  it was melike the hide on a horse  ive had sixty from him since but he could never approach it  the sit of the collar brought tears into my eyes sir when first i saw it and as to the waist  but the duel tregellis cried the prince  well sir i wore it at the duel like the thoughtless fool that i was  it was major hunter of the guards with whom i had had a little tracasserie because i hinted that he should not come into brookess smelling of the stables  i fired first and missed  he fired and i shrieked in despair  hes hit  a surgeon  a surgeon they cried  a tailor  a tailor said i for there was a double hole through the tails of my masterpiece  no it was past all repair  you may laugh sir but ill never see the like of it again  i had seated myself on a settee in the corner upon the princes invitation and very glad i was to remain quiet and unnoticed listening to the talk of these men  it was all in the same extravagant vein garnished with many senseless oaths but i observed this difference that whereas my uncle and sheridan had something of humour in their exaggeration francis tended always to illnature and the prince to selfglorification  finally the conversation turned to musici am not sure that my uncle did not artfully bring it there and the prince hearing from him of my tastes would have it that i should then and there sit down at the wonderful little piano all inlaid with motherofpearl which stood in the corner and play him the accompaniment to his song  it was called as i remember the briton conquers but to save and he rolled it out in a very fair bass voice the others joining in the chorus and clapping vigorously when he finished  bravo mr stone said he  you have an excellent touch and i know what i am talking about when i speak of music  cramer of the opera said only the other day that he had rather hand his baton to me than to any amateur in england  halloa its charlie fox by all thats wonderful  he had run forward with much warmth and was shaking the hand of a singularlooking person who had just entered the room  the new comer was a stout squarebuilt man plainly and almost carelessly dressed with an uncouth manner and a rolling gait  his age might have been something over fifty and his swarthy harshlyfeatured face was already deeply lined either by his years or by his excesses  i have never seen a countenance in which the angel and the devil were more obviously wedded  above was the high broad forehead of the philosopher with keen humorous eyes looking out from under thick strong brows  below was the heavy jowl of the sensualist curving in a broad crease over his cravat  that brow was the brow of the public charles fox the thinker the philanthropist the man who rallied and led the liberal party during the twenty most hazardous years of its existence  that jaw was the jaw of the private charles fox the gambler the libertine the drunkard  yet to his sins he never added the crowning one of hypocrisy  his vices were as open as his virtues  in some quaint freak of nature two spirits seemed to have been joined in one body and the same frame to contain the best and the worst man of his age  ive run down from chertsey sir just to shake you by the hand and to make sure that the tories have not carried you off  hang it charlie you know that i sink or swim with my friends  a whig i started and a whig i shall remain  i thought that i could read upon foxs dark face that he was by no means so confident about the princes principles  pitt has been at you sir i understand  yes confound him  i hate the sight of that sharppointed snout of his which he wants to be ever poking into my affairs  he and addington have been boggling about the debts again  why look ye charlie if pitt held me in contempt he could not behave different  i gathered from the smile which flitted over sheridans expressive face that this was exactly what pitt did do  but straightway they all plunged into politics varied by the drinking of sweet maraschino which a footman brought round upon a salver  the king the queen the lords and the commons were each in succession cursed by the prince in spite of the excellent advice which he had given me about the british constitution  why they allow me so little that i cant look after my own people there are a dozen annuities to old servants and the like and its all i can do to scrape the money together to pay them  however myhe pulled himself up and coughed in a consequential waymy financial agent has arranged for a loan repayable upon the kings death  this liqueur isnt good for either of us charlie  were both getting monstrous stout  i cant get any exercise for the gout said fox  i am blooded fifty ounces a month but the more i take the more i make  you wouldnt think to look at us tregellis that we could do what we have done  weve had some days and nights together charlie  fox smiled and shook his head  you remember how we posted to newmarket before the races  we took a public coach tregellis clapped the postillions into the rumble and jumped on to their places  charlie rode the leader and i the wheeler  one fellow wouldnt let us through his turnpike and charlie hopped off and had his coat off in a minute  the fellow thought he had to do with a fighting man and soon cleared the way for us  by the way sir speaking of fighting men i give a supper to the fancy at the waggon and horses on friday next said my uncle  if you should chance to be in town they would think it a great honour if you should condescend to look in upon us  ive not seen a fight since i saw tom tyne the tailor kill earl fourteen years ago  i swore off then and you know me as a man of my word tregellis  of course ive been at the ringside incog many a time but never as the prince of wales  we should be vastly honoured if you would come incog to our supper sir  well well sherry make a note of it  well be at carlton house on friday  the prince cant come you know tregellis but you might reserve a chair for the earl of chester  sir we shall be proud to see the earl of chester there said my uncle  by the way tregellis said fox theres some rumour about your having a sporting bet with sir lothian hume  whats the truth of it  only a small matter of a couple of thous to a thou he giving the odds  he has a fancy to this new gloucester man crab wilson and im to find a man to beat him  anything under twenty or over thirtyfive at or about thirteen stone  you take charlie foxs advice then cried the prince  when it comes to handicapping a horse playing a hand matching a cock or picking a man he has the best judgment in england  now charlie whom have we upon the list who can beat crab wilson of gloucester  i was amazed at the interest and knowledge which all these great people showed about the ring for they not only had the deeds of the principal men of the timebelcher mendoza jackson or dutch sam at their fingers ends but there was no fighting man so obscure that they did not know the details of his deeds and prospects  the old ones and then the young were discussedtheir weight their gameness their hitting power and their constitution  who as he saw sheridan and fox eagerly arguing as to whether caleb baldwin the westminster costermonger could hold his own with isaac bittoon the jew would have guessed that the one was the deepest political philosopher in europe and that the other would be remembered as the author of the wittiest comedy and of the finest speech of his generation  the name of champion harrison came very early into the discussion and fox who had a high idea of crab wilsons powers was of opinion that my uncles only chance lay in the veteran taking the field again  he may be slow on his pins but he fights with his head and he hits like the kick of a horse  when he finished black baruk the man flew across the outer ring as well as the inner and fell among the spectators  if he isnt absolutely stale tregellis he is your best chance  my uncle shrugged his shoulders  if poor avon were here we might do something with him for he was harrisons first patron and the man was devoted to him  but his wife is too strong for me  and now sir i must leave you for i have had the misfortune today to lose the best valet in england and i must make inquiry for him  i thank your royal highness for your kindness in receiving my nephew in so gracious a fashion  till friday then said the prince holding out his hand  i have to go up to town in any case for there is a poor devil of an east india companys officer who has written to me in his distress  if i can raise a few hundreds i shall see him and set things right for him  now mr stone you have your life before you and i hope it will be one which your uncle may be proud of  you will honour the king and show respect for the constitution mr stone  and hark ye you will avoid debt and bear in mind that your honour is a sacred thing  so i carried away a last impression of his sensual goodhumoured face his high cravat and his broad leather thighs  again we passed the strange rooms the gilded monsters and the gorgeous footmen and it was with relief that i found myself out in the open air once more with the broad blue sea in front of us and the fresh evening breeze upon our faces    chapter viiithe brighton road    my uncle and i were up betimes next morning but he was much out of temper for no news had been heard of his valet ambrose  he had indeed become like one of those ants of which i have read who are so accustomed to be fed by smaller ants that when they are left to themselves they die of hunger  it was only by the aid of a man whom the landlord procured and of foxs valet who had been sent expressly across that his toilet was at last performed  i must win this race nephew said he when he had finished breakfast i cant afford to be beat  look out of the window and see if the lades are there  i see a red fourinhand in the square and there is a crowd round it  yes i see the lady upon the box seat  is our tandem out  it is at the door  come then and you shall have such a drive as you never had before  he stood at the door pulling on his long brown drivinggauntlets and giving his orders to the ostlers  every ounce will tell said he  well leave that dinnerbasket behind  and you can keep my dog for me coppinger  you know him and understand him  let him have his warm milk and curacoa the same as usual  whoa my darlings youll have your fill of it before you reach westminster bridge  shall i put in the toiletcase asked the landlord  i saw the struggle upon my uncles face but he was true to his principles  put it under the seatthe front seat said he  nephew you must keep your weight as far forward as possible  can you do anything on a yard of tin  well if you cant well leave the trumpet  buckle that girth up thomas  have you greased the hubs as i told you well jump up nephew and well see them off  quite a crowd had gathered in the old square  men and women dark coated tradesmen bucks from the princes court and officers from hove all in a buzz of excitement for sir john lade and my uncle were two of the most famous whips of the time and a match between them was a thing to talk of for many a long day  the prince will be sorry to have missed the start said my uncle he doesnt show before midday  ah jack good morning  your servant madam  its a fine day for a little bit of waggoning  as our tandem came alongside of the fourinhand with the two bonny bay mares gleaming like shotsilk in the sunshine a murmur of admiration rose from the crowd  my uncle in his fawncoloured drivingcoat with all his harness of the same tint looked the ideal of a corinthian whip while sir john lade with his manycaped coat his white hat and his rough weatherbeaten face might have taken his seat with a line of professionals upon any alehouse bench without any one being able to pick him out as one of the wealthiest landowners in england  it was an age of eccentricity but he had carried his peculiarities to a length which surprised even the out andouters by marrying the sweetheart of a famous highwayman when the gallows had come between her and her lover  she was perched by his side looking very smart in a flowered bonnet and grey travellingdress while in front of them the four splendid coal black horses with a flickering touch of gold upon their powerful wellcurved quarters were pawing the dust in their eagerness to be off  its a hundred that you dont see us before westminster with a quarter of an hours start said sir john  ill take you another hundred that we pass you answered my uncle  very good  times up  goodbye  he gave a tchk of the tongue shook his reins saluted with his whip in true coachmans style and away he went taking the curve out of the square in a workmanlike fashion that fetched a cheer from the crowd  we heard the dwindling roar of the wheels upon the cobblestones until they died away in the distance  it seemed one of the longest quarters of an hour that i had ever known before the first stroke of nine boomed from the parish clock for my part i was fidgeting in my seat in my impatience but my uncles calm pale face and large blue eyes were as tranquil and demure as those of the most unconcerned spectator  he was keenly on the alert however and it seemed to me that the stroke of the clock and the thong of his whip fell togethernot in a blow but in a sharp snap over the leader which sent us flying with a jingle and a rattle upon our fifty miles journey  i heard a roar from behind us saw the gliding lines of windows with staring faces and waving handkerchiefs and then we were off the stones and on to the good white road which curved away in front of us with the sweep of the green downs upon either side  i had been provided with shillings that the turnpikegate might not stop us but my uncle reined in the mares and took them at a very easy trot up all the heavy stretch which ends in clayton hill  he let them go then and we flashed through friars oak and across st johns common without more than catching a glimpse of the yellow cottage which contained all that i loved best  never have i travelled at such a pace and never have i felt such a sense of exhilaration from the rush of keen upland air upon our faces and from the sight of those two glorious creatures stretched to their utmost with the roar of their hoofs and the rattle of our wheels as the light curricle bounded and swayed behind them  its a long four miles uphill from here to hand cross said my uncle as we flew through cuckfield  i must ease them a bit for i cannot afford to break the hearts of my cattle  they have the right blood in them and they would gallop until they dropped if i were brute enough to let them  stand up on the seat nephew and see if you can get a glimpse of them  i stood up steadying myself upon my uncles shoulder but though i could see for a mile or perhaps a quarter more there was not a sign of the fourinhand  if he has sprung his cattle up all these hills theyll be spent ere they see croydon said he  they have four to two said i  jen suis bien sur  sir johns black strain makes a good honest creature but not fliers like these  there lies cuckfield place where the towers are yonder  get your weight right forward on the splashboard now that we are going uphill nephew  look at the action of that leader  did ever you see anything more easy and more beautiful  we were taking the hill at a quiet trot but even so we made the carrier walking in the shadow of his huge broadwheeled canvas covered waggon stare at us in amazement  close to hand cross we passed the royal brighton stage which had left at halfpast seven dragging heavily up the slope and its passengers toiling along through the dust behind gave us a cheer as we whirled by  at hand cross we caught a glimpse of the old landlord hurrying out with his gin and his gingerbread but the dip of the ground was downwards now and away we flew as fast as eight gallant hoofs could take us  do you drive nephew  very little sir  there is no driving on the brighton road  how is that sir  too good a road nephew  i have only to give them their heads and they will race me into westminster  it wasnt always so  when i was a very young man one might learn to handle his twenty yards of tape here as well as elsewhere  theres not much really good waggoning now south of leicestershire  show me a man who can hit em and hold em on a yorkshire daleside and thats the man who comes from the right school  we had raced over crawley down and into the broad main street of crawley village flying between two country waggons in a way which showed me that even now a driver might do something on the road with every turn i peered ahead looking for our opponents but my uncle seemed to concern himself very little about them and occupied himself in giving me advice mixed up with so many phrases of the craft that it was all that i could do to follow him  keep a finger for each or you will have your reins clubbed said he  as to the whip the less fanning the better if you have willing cattle but when you want to put a little life into a coach see that you get your thong on to the one that needs it and dont let it fly round after youve hit  ive seen a driver warm up the offside passenger on the roof behind him every time he tried to cut his offside wheeler  i believe that is their dust over yonder  a long stretch of road lay before us barred with the shadows of wayside trees  through the green fields a lazy blue river was drawing itself slowly along passing under a bridge in front of us beyond was a young fir plantation and over its olive line there rose a white whirl which drifted swiftly like a cloudscud on a breezy day  yes yes its they cried my uncle  no one else would travel as fast  come nephew were halfway when we cross the mole at kimberham bridge and weve done it in two hours and fourteen minutes  the prince drove to carlton house with a three tandem in four hours and a half  the first half is the worst half and we might cut his time if all goes well  we should make up between this and reigate  and we flew  the bay mares seemed to know what that white puff in front of us signified and they stretched themselves like greyhounds  we passed a phaeton and pair londonbound and we left it behind as if it had been standing still  trees gates cottages went dancing by  we heard the folks shouting from the fields under the impression that we were a runaway  faster and faster yet they raced the hoofs rattling like castanets the yellow manes flying the wheels buzzing and every joint and rivet creaking and groaning while the curricle swung and swayed until i found myself clutching to the siderail  my uncle eased them and glanced at his watch as we saw the grey tiles and dingy red houses of reigate in the hollow beneath us  we did the last six well under twenty minutes said he  weve time in hand now and a little water at the red lion will do them no harm  red fourinhand passed ostler  just gone sir  going hard  galloping full split sir  took the wheel off a butchers cart at the corner of the high street and was out o sight before the butchers boy could see what had hurt him  zzzzack went the long thong and away we flew once more  it was market day at redhill and the road was crowded with carts of produce droves of bullocks and farmers gigs  it was a sight to see how my uncle threaded his way amongst them all  through the marketplace we dashed amidst the shouting of men the screaming of women and the scuttling of poultry and then we were out in the country again with the long steep incline of the redhill road before us  my uncle waved his whip in the air with a shrill view halloa  there was the dustcloud rolling up the hill in front of us and through it we had a shadowy peep of the backs of our opponents with a flash of brasswork and a gleam of scarlet  theres half the game won nephew  now we must pass them  hark forrard my beauties  by george if kitty isnt foundered  the leader had suddenly gone dead lame  in an instant we were both out of the curricle and on our knees beside her  it was but a stone wedged between frog and shoe in the off forefoot but it was a minute or two before we could wrench it out  when we had regained our places the lades were round the curve of the hill and out of sight  bad luck growled my uncle  but they cant get away from us for the first time he touched the mares up for he had but cracked the whip over their heads before  if we catch them in the next few miles we can spare them for the rest of the way  they were beginning to show signs of exhaustion  their breath came quick and hoarse and their beautiful coats were matted with moisture  at the top of the hill however they settled down into their swing once more  where on earth have they got to cried my uncle  can you make them out on the road nephew  we could see a long white ribbon of it all dotted with carts and waggons coming from croydon to redhill but there was no sign of the big red fourinhand  there they are  stole away  stole away he cried wheeling the mares round into a side road which struck to the right out of that which we had travelled  there they are nephew  on the brow of the hill  sure enough on the rise of a curve upon our right the fourinhand had appeared the horses stretched to the utmost  our mares laid themselves out gallantly and the distance between us began slowly to decrease  i found that i could see the black band upon sir johns white hat then that i could count the folds of his cape finally that i could see the pretty features of his wife as she looked back at us  were on the side road to godstone and warlingham said my uncle i suppose he thought that he could make better time by getting out of the way of the market carts  but weve got the deuce of a hill to come down  youll see some fun nephew or i am mistaken  as he spoke i suddenly saw the wheels of the fourinhand disappear then the body of it and then the two figures upon the box as suddenly and abruptly as if it had bumped down the first three steps of some gigantic stairs  an instant later we had reached the same spot and there was the road beneath us steep and narrow winding in long curves into the valley  the fourinhand was swishing down it as hard as the horses could gallop  thought so cried my uncle  if he doesnt brake why should i now my darlings one good spurt and well show them the colour of our tailboard  we shot over the brow and flew madly down the hill with the great red coach roaring and thundering before us  already we were in her dust so that we could see nothing but the dim scarlet blur in the heart of it rocking and rolling with its outline hardening at every stride  we could hear the crack of the whip in front of us and the shrill voice of lady lade as she screamed to the horses  my uncle was very quiet but when i glanced up at him i saw that his lips were set and his eyes shining with just a little flush upon each pale cheek  there was no need to urge on the mares for they were already flying at a pace which could neither be stopped nor controlled  our leaders head came abreast of the off hind wheel then of the off front onethen for a hundred yards we did not gain an inch and then with a spurt the bay leader was neck to neck with the black wheeler and our fore wheel within an inch of their hind one  dusty work said my uncle quietly  fan em jack  fan em shrieked the lady  he sprang up and lashed at his horses  look out tregellis he shouted  theres a damnation spill coming for somebody  we had got fairly abreast of them now the rumps of the horses exactly aline and the fore wheels whizzing together  there was not six inches to spare in the breadth of the road and every instant i expected to feel the jar of a locking wheel  but now as we came out from the dust we could see what was ahead and my uncle whistled between his teeth at the sight  two hundred yards or so in front of us there was a bridge with wooden posts and rails upon either side  the road narrowed down at the point so that it was obvious that the two carriages abreast could not possibly get over  one must give way to the other already our wheels were abreast of their wheelers  i lead shouted my uncle  you must pull them lade  not i he roared  no by george shrieked her ladyship  fan em jack keep on fanning em  it seemed to me that we were all going to eternity together  but my uncle did the only thing that could have saved us  by a desperate effort we might just clear the coach before reaching the mouth of the bridge  he sprang up and lashed right and left at the mares who maddened by the unaccustomed pain hurled themselves on in a frenzy  down we thundered together all shouting i believe at the top of our voices in the madness of the moment but still we were drawing steadily away and we were almost clear of the leaders when we flew on to the bridge  i glanced back at the coach and i saw lady lade with her savage little white teeth clenched together throw herself forward and tug with both hands at the offside reins  jam them jack she cried  jam thebefore they can pass  had she done it an instant sooner we should have crashed against the woodwork carried it away and been hurled into the deep gully below  as it was it was not the powerful haunch of the black leader which caught our wheel but the forequarter which had not weight enough to turn us from our course  i saw a red wet seam gape suddenly through the black hair and next instant we were flying alone down the road whilst the fourinhand had halted and sir john and his lady were down in the road together tending to the wounded horse  easy now my beauties cried my uncle settling down into his seat again and looking back over his shoulder  i could not have believed that sir john lade would have been guilty of such a trick as pulling that leader across  i do not permit a mauvaise plaisanterie of that sort  he shall hear from me tonight  it was the lady said i  my uncles brow cleared and he began to laugh  it was little letty was it said he  i might have known it theres a touch of the late lamented sixteenstring jack about the trick  well it is only messages of another kind that i send to a lady so well just drive on our way nephew and thank our stars that we bring whole bones over the thames  we stopped at the greyhound at croydon where the two good little mares were sponged and petted and fed after which at an easier pace we made our way through norbury and streatham  at last the fields grew fewer and the walls longer  the outlying villas closed up thicker and thicker until their shoulders met and we were driving between a double line of houses with garish shops at the corners and such a stream of traffic as i had never seen roaring down the centre  then suddenly we were on a broad bridge with a dark coffeebrown river flowing sulkily beneath it and bluffbowed barges drifting down upon its bosom  to right and left stretched a broken irregular line of manycoloured houses winding along either bank as far as i could see  thats the house of parliament nephew said my uncle pointing with his whip and the black towers are westminster abbey  how do your grace  how do  thats the duke of norfolkthe stout man in blue upon the swishtailed mare  now we are in whitehall  theres the treasury on the left and the horse guards and the admiralty where the stone dolphins are carved above the gate  i had the idea which a countrybred lad brings up with him that london was merely a wilderness of houses but i was astonished now to see the green slopes and the lovely spring trees showing between  yes those are the privy gardens said my uncle and there is the window out of which charles took his last step on to the scaffold you wouldnt think the mares had come fifty miles would you  see how les petites cheries step out for the credit of their master look at the barouche with the sharpfeatured man peeping out of the window  thats pitt going down to the house  we are coming into pall mall now and this great building on the left is carlton house the princes palace  theres st jamess the big dingy place with the clock and the two redcoated sentries before it  and heres the famous street of the same name nephew which is the very centre of the world and heres jermyn street opening out of it and finally heres my own little box and we are well under the five hours from brighton old square    chapter ixwatiers    my uncles house in jermyn street was quite a small onefive rooms and an attic  a mancook and a cottage he said are all that a wise man requires  on the other hand it was furnished with the neatness and taste which belonged to his character so that his most luxurious friends found something in the tiny rooms which made them discontented with their own sumptuous mansions  even the attic which had been converted into my bedroom was the most perfect little bijou attic that could possibly be imagined  beautiful and valuable knickknacks filled every corner of every apartment and the house had become a perfect miniature museum which would have delighted a virtuoso  my uncle explained the presence of all these pretty things with a shrug of his shoulders and a wave of his hands they are des petites cadeaux said he but it would be an indiscretion for me to say more  we found a note from ambrose waiting for us which increased rather than explained the mystery of his disappearance  my dear sir charles tregellis it ran it will ever be a subject of regret to me that the force of circumstances should have compelled me to leave your service in so abrupt a fashion but something occurred during our journey from friars oak to brighton which left me without any possible alternative  i trust however that my absence may prove to be but a temporary one  the isinglass recipe for the shirtfronts is in the strongbox at drummonds bankyours obediently ambrose  well i suppose i must fill his place as best i can said my uncle moodily  but how on earth could something have occurred to make him leave me at a time when we were going fulltrot down hill in my curricle  i shall never find his match again either for chocolate or cravats  je suis desole  but now nephew we must send to weston and have you fitted up  it is not for a gentleman to go to a shop but for the shop to come to the gentleman  until you have your clothes you must remain en retraite  the measuring was a most solemn and serious function though it was nothing to the tryingon two days later when my uncle stood by in an agony of apprehension as each garment was adjusted he and weston arguing over every seam and lapel and skirt until i was dizzy with turning round in front of them  then just as i had hoped that all was settled in came young mr brummell who promised to be an even greater exquisite than my uncle and the whole matter had to be thrashed out between them  he was a goodsized man this brummell with a long fair face light brown hair and slight sandy side whiskers  his manner was languid his voice drawling and while he eclipsed my uncle in the extravagance of his speech he had not the air of manliness and decision which underlay all my kinsmans affectations  why george cried my uncle i thought you were with your regiment  ive sent in my papers drawled the other  i thought it would come to that  yes  the tenth was ordered to manchester and they could hardly expect me to go to a place like that  besides i found the major monstrous rude  how was that  he expected me to know about his absurd drill tregellis and i had other things to think of as you may suppose  i had no difficulty in taking my right place on parade for there was a trooper with a red nose on a fleabitten grey and i had observed that my post was always immediately in front of him  this saved a great deal of trouble  the other day however when i came on parade i galloped up one line and down the other but the deuce a glimpse could i get of that long nose of his  then just as i was at my wits end i caught sight of him alone at one side so i formed up in front  it seems he had been put there to keep the ground and the major so far forgot himself as to say that i knew nothing of my duties  my uncle laughed and brummell looked me up and down with his large intolerant eyes  these will do very passably said he  buff and blue are always very gentlemanlike  but a sprigged waistcoat would have been better  i think not said my uncle warmly  my dear tregellis you are infallible upon a cravat but you must allow me the right of my own judgment upon vests  i like it vastly as it stands but a touch of red sprig would give it the finish that it needs  they argued with many examples and analogies for a good ten minutes revolving round me at the same time with their heads on one side and their glasses to their eyes  it was a relief to me when they at last agreed upon a compromise  you must not let anything i have said shake your faith in sir charless judgment mr stone said brummell very earnestly  i assured him that i should not  if you were my nephew i should expect you to follow my taste  but you will cut a very good figure as it is  i had a young cousin who came up to town last year with a recommendation to my care  but he would take no advice  at the end of the second week i met him coming down st jamess street in a snuffcoloured coat cut by a country tailor  he bowed to me  of course i knew what was due to myself  i looked all round him and there was an end to his career in town  you are from the country mr stone  from sussex sir  sussex  why that is where i send my washing to  there is an excellent clearstarcher living near haywards heath  i send my shirts two at a time for if you send more it excites the woman and diverts her attention  i cannot abide anything but country washing but i should be vastly sorry to have to live there  what can a man find to do  you dont hunt george  when i do its a woman  but surely you dont go to hounds charles  i was out with the belvoir last winter  the belvoir  did you hear how i smoked rutland  the story has been in the clubs this month past  i bet him that my bag would weigh more than his  he got three and a half brace but i shot his livercoloured pointer so he had to pay  but as to hunting what amusement can there be in flying about among a crowd of greasy galloping farmers  every man to his own taste but brookess window by day and a snug corner of the macao table at watiers by night give me all i want for mind and body  you heard how i plucked montague the brewer  i have been out of town  i had eight thousand from him at a sitting  i shall drink your beer in future mr brewer said i  every blackguard in london does said he  it was monstrous impolite of him but some people cannot lose with grace  well i am going down to clarges street to pay jew king a little of my interest  are you bound that way well goodbye then  ill see you and your young friend at the club or in the mall no doubt and he sauntered off upon his way  that young man is destined to take my place said my uncle gravely when brummell had departed  he is quite young and of no descent but he has made his way by his cool effrontery his natural taste and his extravagance of speech  there is no man who can be impolite in so polished a fashion  he has a halfsmile and a way of raising his eyebrows for which he will be shot one of these mornings  already his opinion is quoted in the clubs as a rival to my own  well every man has his day and when i am convinced that mine is past st jamess street shall know me no more for it is not in my nature to be second to any man  but now nephew in that buff and blue suit you may pass anywhere so if you please we will step into my visavis and i will show you something of the town  how can i describe all that we saw and all that we did upon that lovely spring day  to me it was as if i had been wafted to a fairy world and my uncle might have been some benevolent enchanter in a highcollared longtailed coat who was guiding me about in it  he showed me the westend streets with the bright carriages and the gaily dressed ladies and sombreclad men all crossing and hurrying and recrossing like an ants nest when you turn it over with a stick  never had i formed a conception of such endless banks of houses and such a ceaseless stream of life flowing between  then we passed down the strand where the crowd was thicker than ever and even penetrated beyond temple bar and into the city though my uncle begged me not to mention it for he would not wish it to be generally known  there i saw the exchange and the bank and lloyds coffee house with the browncoated sharpfaced merchants and the hurrying clerks the huge horses and the busy draymen  it was a very different world this from that which we had left in the westa world of energy and of strength where there was no place for the listless and the idle  young as i was i knew that it was here in the forest of merchant shipping in the bales which swung up to the warehouse windows in the loaded waggons which roared over the cobblestones that the power of britain lay  here in the city of london was the taproot from which empire and wealth and so many other fine leaves had sprouted  fashion and speech and manners may change but the spirit of enterprise within that square mile or two of land must not change for when it withers all that has grown from it must wither also  we lunched at stephens the fashionable inn in bond street where i saw a line of tilburys and saddlehorses which stretched from the door to the further end of the street  and thence we went to the mail in st jamess park and thence to brookess the great whig club and thence again to watiers where the men of fashion used to gamble  everywhere i met the same sort of men with their stiff figures and small waists all showing the utmost deference to my uncle and for his sake an easy tolerance of me  the talk was always such as i had already heard at the pavilion  talk of politics talk of the kings health talk of the princes extravagance of the expected renewal of war of horseracing and of the ring  i saw too that eccentricity was as my uncle had told me the fashion and if the folk upon the continent look upon us even to this day as being a nation of lunatics it is no doubt a tradition handed down from the time when the only travellers whom they were likely to see were drawn from the class which i was now meeting  it was an age of heroism and of folly  on the one hand soldiers sailors and statesmen of the quality of pitt nelson and afterwards wellington had been forced to the front by the imminent menace of buonaparte  we were great in arms and were soon also to be great in literature for scott and byron were in their day the strongest forces in europe  on the other hand a touch of madness real or assumed was a passport through doors which were closed to wisdom and to virtue  the man who could enter a drawingroom walking upon his hands the man who had filed his teeth that he might whistle like a coachman the man who always spoke his thoughts aloud and so kept his guests in a quiver of apprehension these were the people who found it easy to come to the front in london society nor could the heroism and the folly be kept apart for there were few who could quite escape the contagion of the times  in an age when the premier was a heavy drinker the leader of the opposition a libertine and the prince of wales a combination of the two it was hard to know where to look for a man whose private and public characters were equally lofty  at the same time with all its faults it was a strong age and you will be fortunate if in your time the country produces five such names as pitt fox scott nelson and wellington  it was in watiers that night seated by my uncle on one of the red velvet settees at the side of the room that i had pointed out to me some of those singular characters whose fame and eccentricities are even now not wholly forgotten in the world  the long manypillared room with its mirrors and chandeliers was crowded with full blooded loudvoiced menabouttown all in the same dark evening dress with white silk stockings cambric shirtfronts and little flat chapeaubras under their arms  the acidfaced old gentleman with the thin legs is the marquis of queensberry said my uncle  his chaise was driven nineteen miles in an hour in a match against the count taafe and he sent a message fifty miles in thirty minutes by throwing it from hand to hand in a cricketball  the man he is talking to is sir charles bunbury of the jockey club who had the prince warned off the heath at newmarket on account of the inandout riding of sam chifney his jockey  theres captain barclay going up to them now  he knows more about training than any man alive and he has walked ninety miles in twentyone hours  you have only to look at his calves to see that nature built him for it  theres another walker there the man with a flowered vest standing near the fireplace  that is buck whalley who walked to jerusalem in a long blue coat topboots and buckskins  why did he do that sir i asked in astonishment  my uncle shrugged his shoulders  it was his humour said he  he walked into society through it and that was better worth reaching than jerusalem  theres lord petersham the man with the beaky nose  he always rises at six in the evening and he has laid down the finest cellar of snuff in europe  it was he who ordered his valet to put half a dozen of sherry by his bed and call him the day after tomorrow  hes talking to lord panmure who can take his six bottles of claret and argue with a bishop after it  the lean man with the weak knees is general scott who lives upon toast and water and has won 200000 pounds at whist  he is talking to young lord blandford who gave 1800 pounds for a boccaccio the other day  evening dudley  evening tregellis  an elderly vacantlooking man had stopped before us and was looking me up and down  some young cub charlie tregellis has caught in the country he murmured  he doesnt look as if he would be much credit to him been out of town tregellis  for a few days  hem said the man transferring his sleepy gaze to my uncle hes looking pretty bad  hell be going into the country feet foremost some of these days if he doesnt pull up  he nodded and passed on  you mustnt look so mortified nephew said my uncle smiling thats old lord dudley and he has a trick of thinking aloud people used to be offended but they take no notice of him now  it was only last week when he was dining at lord elgins that he apologized to the company for the shocking bad cooking  he thought he was at his own table you see  it gives him a place of his own in society  thats lord harewood he has fastened on to now harewoods peculiarity is to mimic the prince in everything  one day the prince hid his queue behind the collar of his coat so harewood cut his off thinking that they were going out of fashion heres lumley the ugly man  lhomme laid they called him in paris  the other one is lord foleythey call him no 11 on account of his thin legs  there is mr brummell sir said i  yes hell come to us presently  that young man has certainly a future before him  do you observe the way in which he looks round the room from under his drooping eyelids as though it were a condescension that he should have entered it  small conceits are intolerable but when they are pushed to the uttermost they become respectable  how do george  have you heard about vereker merton asked brummell strolling up with one or two other exquisites at his heels  he has run away with his fathers womancook and actually married her  what did lord merton do  he congratulated him warmly and confessed that he had always underrated his intelligence  he is to live with the young couple and make a handsome allowance on condition that the bride sticks to her old duties  by the way there was a rumour that you were about to marry tregellis  i think not answered my uncle  it would be a mistake to overwhelm one by attentions which are a pleasure to many  my view exactly and very neatly expressed cried brummell  is it fair to break a dozen hearts in order to intoxicate one with rapture  im off to the continent next week  bailiffs asked one of his companions  too bad pierrepoint  no no it is pleasure and instruction combined  besides it is necessary to go to paris for your little things and if there is a chance of the war breaking out again it would be well to lay in a supply  quite right said my uncle who seemed to have made up his mind to outdo brummell in extravagance  i used to get my sulphurcoloured gloves from the palais royal  when the war broke out in 93 i was cut off from them for nine years  had it not been for a lugger which i specially hired to smuggle them i might have been reduced to english tan  the english are excellent at a flatiron or a kitchen poker but anything more delicate is beyond them  our tailors are good cried my uncle but our stuffs lack taste and variety  the war has made us more rococo than ever  it has cut us off from travel and there is nothing to match travel for expanding the mind  last year for example i came upon some new waistcoating in the square of san marco at venice  it was yellow with the prettiest little twill of pink running through it  how could i have seen it had i not travelled  i brought it back with me and for a time it was all the rage  the prince took it up  yes he usually follows my lead  we dressed so alike last year that we were frequently mistaken for each other  it tells against me but so it was  he often complains that things do not look as well upon him as upon me but how can i make the obvious reply  by the way george i did not see you at the marchioness of dovers ball  yes i was there and lingered for a quarter of an hour or so  i am surprised that you did not see me  i did not go past the doorway however for undue preference gives rise to jealousy  i went early said my uncle for i had heard that there were to be some tolerable debutantes  it always pleases me vastly when i am able to pass a compliment to any of them  it has happened but not often for i keep to my own standard  so they talked these singular men and i looking from one to the other could not imagine how they could help bursting out alaughing in each others faces  but on the contrary their conversation was very grave and filled out with many little bows and opening and shutting of snuffboxes and flickings of laced handkerchiefs quite a crowd had gathered silently around and i could see that the talk had been regarded as a contest between two men who were looked upon as rival arbiters of fashion  it was finished by the marquis of queensberry passing his arm through brummells and leading him off while my uncle threw out his laced cambric shirtfront and shot his ruffles as if he were well satisfied with his share in the encounter  it is sevenandforty years since i looked upon that circle of dandies and where now are their dainty little hats their wonderful waistcoats and their boots in which one could arrange ones cravat  they lived strange lives these men and they died strange deathssome by their own hands some as beggars some in a debtors gaol some like the most brilliant of them all in a madhouse in a foreign land  there is the cardroom rodney said my uncle as we passed an open door on our way out  glancing in i saw a line of little green baize tables with small groups of men sitting round while at one side was a longer one from which there came a continuous murmur of voices  you may lose what you like in there save only your nerve or your temper my uncle continued  ah sir lothian i trust that the luck was with you  a tall thin man with a hard austere face had stepped out of the open doorway  his heavily thatched eyebrows covered quick furtive grey eyes and his gaunt features were hollowed at the cheek and temple like watergrooved flint  he was dressed entirely in black and i noticed that his shoulders swayed a little as if he had been drinking  lost like the deuce he snapped  dice  no whist  you couldnt get very hard hit over that  couldnt you he snarled  play a hundred a trick and a thousand on the rub losing steadily for five hours and see what you think of it  my uncle was evidently struck by the haggard look upon the others face  i hope its not very bad he said  bad enough  it wont bear talking about  by the way tregellis have you got your man for this fight yet  no  you seem to be hanging in the wind a long time  its play or pay you know  i shall claim forfeit if you dont come to scratch  if you will name your day i shall produce my man sir lothian said my uncle coldly  this day four weeks if you like  very good  the 18th of may  i hope to have changed my name by then  how is that asked my uncle in surprise  it is just possible that i may be lord avon  what you have had some news cried my uncle and i noticed a tremor in his voice  ive had my agent over at monte video and he believes he has proof that avon died there  anyhow it is absurd to suppose that because a murderer chooses to fly from justice  i wont have you use that word sir lothian cried my uncle sharply  you were there as i was  you know that he was a murderer  i tell you that you shall not say so  sir lothians fierce little grey eyes had to lower themselves before the imperious anger which shone in my uncles  well to let that point pass it is monstrous to suppose that the title and the estates can remain hung up in this way for ever  im the heir tregellis and im going to have my rights  i am as you are aware lord avons dearest friend said my uncle sternly  his disappearance has not affected my love for him and until his fate is finally ascertained i shall exert myself to see that his rights also are respected  his rights would be a long drop and a cracked spine sir lothian answered and then changing his manner suddenly he laid his hand upon my uncles sleeve  come come tregellis i was his friend as well as you said he but we cannot alter the facts and it is rather late in the day for us to fall out over them  your invitation holds good for friday night  certainly  i shall bring crab wilson with me and finally arrange the conditions of our little wager  very good sir lothian  i shall hope to see you  they bowed and my uncle stood a little time looking after him as he made his way amidst the crowd  a good sportsman nephew said he  a bold rider the best pistolshot in england but    a dangerous man    chapter xthe men of the ring    it was at the end of my first week in london that my uncle gave a supper to the fancy as was usual for gentlemen of that time if they wished to figure before the public as corinthians and patrons of sport  he had invited not only the chief fightingmen of the day but also those men of fashion who were most interested in the ring mr fletcher reid lord say and sele sir lothian hume sir john lade colonel montgomery sir thomas apreece the hon berkeley craven and many more  the rumour that the prince was to be present had already spread through the clubs and invitations were eagerly sought after  the waggon and horses was a wellknown sporting house with an old prizefighter for landlord  and the arrangements were as primitive as the most bohemian could wish  it was one of the many curious fashions which have now died out that men who were blase from luxury and high living seemed to find a fresh piquancy in life by descending to the lowest resorts so that the nighthouses and gamblingdens in covent garden or the haymarket often gathered illustrious company under their smokeblackened ceilings  it was a change for them to turn their backs upon the cooking of weltjie and of ude or the chambertin of old q and to dine upon a porterhouse steak washed down by a pint of ale from a pewter pot  a rough crowd had assembled in the street to see the fightingmen go in and my uncle warned me to look to my pockets as we pushed our way through it  within was a large room with faded red curtains a sanded floor and walls which were covered with prints of pugilists and racehorses  brown liquorstained tables were dotted about in it and round one of these half a dozen formidablelooking men were seated while one the roughest of all was perched upon the table itself swinging his legs to and fro  a tray of small glasses and pewter mugs stood beside them  the boys were thirsty sir so i brought up some ale and some liptrap whispered the landlord i thought you would have no objection sir  quite right bob  how are you all  how are you maddox  how are you baldwin  ah belcher i am very glad to see you  the fightingmen rose and took their hats off except the fellow on the table who continued to swing his legs and to look my uncle very coolly in the face  how are you berks  pretty tidy  ow are you  say sir when you speak to a genelman said belcher and with a sudden tilt of the table he sent berks flying almost into my uncles arms  see now jem none o that said berks sulkily  ill learn you manners joe which is more than ever your father did  youre not drinkin blackjack in a boozin ken but you are meetin noble slapup corinthians and its for you to behave as such  ive always been reckoned a genelmanlike sort of man said berks thickly but if so be as ive said or done what i adnt ought to   there there berks thats all right cried my uncle only too anxious to smooth things over and to prevent a quarrel at the outset of the evening  here are some more of our friends  how are you apreece  how are you colonel  well jackson you are looking vastly better  good evening lade  i trust lady lade was none the worse for our pleasant drive  ah mendoza you look fit enough to throw your hat over the ropes this instant  sir lothian i am glad to see you  you will find some old friends here  amid the stream of corinthians and fightingmen who were thronging into the room i had caught a glimpse of the sturdy figure and broad goodhumoured face of champion harrison  the sight of him was like a whiff of south down air coming into that lowroofed oilsmelling room and i ran forward to shake him by the hand  why master rodneyor i should say mr stone i supposeyouve changed out of all knowledge  i cant hardly believe that it was really you that used to come down to blow the bellows when boy jim and i were at the anvil  well you are fine to be sure  whats the news of friars oak i asked eagerly  your father was down to chat with me master rodney and he tells me that the war is going to break out again and that he hopes to see you here in london before many days are past for he is coming up to see lord nelson and to make inquiry about a ship  your mother is well and i saw her in church on sunday  and boy jim  champion harrisons goodhumoured face clouded over  hed set his heart very much on comin here tonight but there were reasons why i didnt wish him to and so theres a shadow betwixt us  its the first that ever was and i feel it master rodney  between ourselves i have very good reason to wish him to stay with me and i am sure that with his high spirit and his ideas he would never settle down again after once he had a taste o london  i left him behind me with enough work to keep him busy until i get back to him  a tall and beautifully proportioned man very elegantly dressed was strolling towards us  he stared in surprise and held out his hand to my companion  why jack harrison he cried  this is a resurrection  where in the world did you come from  glad to see you jackson said my companion  you look as well and as young as ever  thank you yes  i resigned the belt when i could get no one to fight me for it and i took to teaching  im doing smiths work down sussex way  ive often wondered why you never had a shy at my belt  i tell you honestly between man and man im very glad you didnt  well its real good of you to say that jackson  i might ha done it perhaps but the old woman was against it  shes been a good wife to me and i cant go against her  but i feel a bit lonesome here for these boys are since my time  you could do some of them over now said jackson feeling my friends upper arm  no better bit of stuff was ever seen in a twentyfour foot ring  it would be a rare treat to see you take some of these young ones on  wont you let me spring you on them  harrisons eyes glistened at the idea but he shook his head  it wont do jackson  my old woman holds my promise  thats belcher aint itthe good lookin young chap with the flash coat  yes thats jem  youve not seen him  hes a jewel  so ive heard  whos the youngster beside him  he looks a tidy chap  thats a new man from the west  crab wilsons his name  harrison looked at him with interest  ive heard of him said he they are getting a match on for him aint they  yes  sir lothian hume the thinfaced gentleman over yonder has backed him against sir charles tregelliss man  were to hear about the match tonight i understand  jem belcher thinks great things of crab wilson  theres belchers young brother tom  hes looking out for a match too  they say hes quicker than jem with the mufflers but he cant hit as hard  i was speaking of your brother jem  the young un will make his way said belcher who had come across to us  hes more a sparrer than a fighter just at present but when his gristle sets hell take on anything on the list  bristols as full o young fightinmen now as a bin is of bottles  weve got two more comin upgully and pearcewholl make you london milling coves wish they was back in the west country again  heres the prince said jackson as a hum and bustle rose from the door  i saw george come bustling in with a goodhumoured smile upon his comely face  my uncle welcomed him and led some of the corinthians up to be presented  well have trouble govnor said belcher to jackson  heres joe berks drinkin gin out of a mug and you know what a swine he is when hes drunk  you must put a stopper on im govnor said several of the other prizefighters  e aint what youd call a charmer when es sober but theres no standing im when es fresh  jackson on account of his prowess and of the tact which he possessed had been chosen as general regulator of the whole prize fighting body by whom he was usually alluded to as the commander inchief  he and belcher went across now to the table upon which berks was still perched  the ruffians face was already flushed and his eyes heavy and bloodshot  you must keep yourself in hand tonight berks said jackson the prince is here and  i never set eyes on im yet cried berks lurching off the table where is e govnor  tell im joe berks would like to do isself proud by shakin im by the and  no you dont joe said jackson laying his hand upon berkss chest as he tried to push his way through the crowd  youve got to keep your place joe or well put you where you can make all the noise you like  wheres that govnor  into the street through the window  were going to have a peaceful evening as jem belcher and i will show you if you get up to any of your whitechapel games  no arm govnor grumbled berks  im sure ive always ad the name of bein a very genelmanlike man  so ive always said joe berks and mind you prove yourself such but the supper is ready for us and theres the prince and lord sole going in  two and two lads and dont forget whose company you are in  the supper was laid in a large room with union jacks and mottoes hung thickly upon the walls  the tables were arranged in three sides of a square my uncle occupying the centre of the principal one with the prince upon his right and lord sele upon his left  by his wise precaution the seats had been allotted beforehand so that the gentlemen might be scattered among the professionals and no risk run of two enemies finding themselves together or a man who had been recently beaten falling into the company of his conqueror  for my own part i had champion harrison upon one side of me and a stout floridfaced man upon the other who whispered to me that he was bill warr landlord of the one tun publichouse of jermyn street and one of the gamest men upon the list  its my flesh thats beat me sir said he  it creeps over me amazin fast  i should fight at thirteeneight and ere i am nearly seventeen  its the business that does it what with loflin about behind the bar all day and bein afraid to refuse a wet for fear of offendin a customer  its been the ruin of many a good fightinman before me  you should take to my job said harrison  im a smith by trade and ive not put on half a stone in fifteen years  some take to one thing and some to another but the most of us try to ave a barparlour of our own  theres will wood that i beat in forty rounds in the thick of a snowstorm down navestock way e drives a ackney  young firby the ruffian es a waiter now dick umphries sells coalse was always of a genelmanly disposition  george ingleston is a brewers drayman  we all find our own cribs  but theres one thing you are saved by livin in the country and that is avin the young corinthians and bloods about town smackin you eternally in the face  this was the last inconvenience which i should have expected a famous prizefighter to be subjected to but several bullfaced fellows at the other side of the table nodded their concurrence  youre right bill said one of them  theres no one has had more trouble with them than i have  in they come of an evenin into my bar with the wine in their heads  are you tom owen the bruiser says one o them  at your service sir says i  take that then says he and its a clip on the nose or a backhanded slap across the chops as likely as not  then they can brag all their lives that they had hit tom owen  dyou draw their cork in return asked harrison  i argey it out with them  i say to them now gents fightin is my profession and i dont fight for love any more than a doctor doctors for love or a butcher gives away a loin chop  put up a small purse master and ill do you over and proud  but dont expect that youre goin to come here and get glutted by a middle weight champion for nothing  thats my way too tom said my burly neighbour  if they put down a guinea on the counterwhich they do if they ave been drinkin very eavyi give them what i think is about a guineas worth and take the money  but if they dont  why then its a common assault dye see against the body of is majestys liege william warr and i as em before the beak next mornin and its a week or twenty shillins  meanwhile the supper was in full swingone of those solid and uncompromising meals which prevailed in the days of your grandfathers and which may explain to some of you why you never set eyes upon that relative  great rounds of beef saddles of mutton smoking tongues veal and ham pies turkeys and chickens and geese with every variety of vegetables and a succession of fiery cherries and heavy ales were the main staple of the feast  it was the same meal and the same cooking as their norse or german ancestors might have sat down to fourteen centuries before and indeed as i looked through the steam of the dishes at the lines of fierce and rugged faces and the mighty shoulders which rounded themselves over the board i could have imagined myself at one of those oldworld carousals of which i had read where the savage company gnawed the joints to the bone and then with murderous horseplay hurled the remains at their prisoners  here and there the pale aquiline features of a sporting corinthian recalled rather the norman type but in the main these stolid heavyjowled faces belonging to men whose whole life was a battle were the nearest suggestion which we have had in modern times of those fierce pirates and rovers from whose loins we have sprung  and yet as i looked carefully from man to man in the line which faced me i could see that the english although they were ten to one had not the game entirely to themselves but that other races had shown that they could produce fightingmen worthy to rank with the best  there were it is true no finer or braver men in the room than jackson and jem belcher the one with his magnificent figure his small waist and herculean shoulders the other as graceful as an old grecian statue with a head whose beauty many a sculptor had wished to copy and with those long delicate lines in shoulder and loins and limbs which gave him the litheness and activity of a panther already as i looked at him it seemed to me that there was a shadow of tragedy upon his face a forecast of the day then but a few months distant when a blow from a racquet ball darkened the sight of one eye for ever  had he stopped there with his unbeaten career behind him then indeed the evening of his life might have been as glorious as its dawn  but his proud heart could not permit his title to be torn from him without a struggle  if even now you can read how the gallant fellow unable with his one eye to judge his distances fought for thirtyfive minutes against his young and formidable opponent and how in the bitterness of defeat he was heard only to express his sorrow for a friend who had backed him with all he possessed and if you are not touched by the story there must be something wanting in you which should go to the making of a man  but if there were no men at the tables who could have held their own against jackson or jem belcher there were others of a different race and type who had qualities which made them dangerous bruisers a little way down the room i saw the black face and woolly head of bill richmond in a purpleandgold footmans liverydestined to be the predecessor of molineaux sutton and all that line of black boxers who have shown that the muscular power and insensibility to pain which distinguish the african give him a peculiar advantage in the sports of the ring  he could boast also of the higher honour of having been the first born american to win laurels in the british ring  there also i saw the keen features of dada mendoza the jew just retired from active work and leaving behind him a reputation for elegance and perfect science which has to this day never been exceeded  the worst fault that the critics could find with him was that there was a want of power in his blowsa remark which certainly could not have been made about his neighbour whose long face curved nose and dark flashing eyes proclaimed him as a member of the same ancient race  this was the formidable dutch sam who fought at nine stone six and yet possessed such hitting powers that his admirers in after years were willing to back him against the fourteenstone tom cribb if each were strapped astraddle to a bench  half a dozen other sallow hebrew faces showed how energetically the jews of houndsditch and whitechapel had taken to the sport of the land of their adoption and that in this as in more serious fields of human effort they could hold their own with the best  it was my neighbour warr who very goodhumouredly pointed out to me all these celebrities the echoes of whose fame had been wafted down even to our little sussex village  theres andrew gamble the irish champion said he  it was e that beat noah james the guardsman and was afterwards nearly killed by jem belcher in the ollow of wimbledon common by abbershaws gibbet  the two that are next im are irish also jack odonnell and bill ryan  when you get a good irishman you cant better em but theyre dreadful asty  that little cove with the leery face is caleb baldwin the coster im that they call the pride of westminster  es but five foot seven and nine stone five but es got the eart of a giant  es never been beat and there aint a man within a stone of im that could beat im except only dutch sam  theres george maddox too another o the same breed and as good a man as ever pulled his coat off  the genelmanly man that eats with a fork im what looks like a corinthian only that the bridge of is nose aint quite as it ought to be thats dick umphries the same that was cock of the middleweights until mendoza cut his comb for im  you see the other with the grey ead and the scars on his face  why its old tom faulkner the cricketer cried harrison following the line of bill warrs stubby forefinger  hes the fastest bowler in the midlands and at his best there werent many boxers in england that could stand up against him  youre right there jack arrison  e was one of the three who came up to fight when the best men of birmingham challenged the best men of london  es an evergreen is tom  why he was turned five andfifty when he challenged and beat after fifty minutes of it jack thornhill who was tough enough to take it out of many a youngster  its better to give odds in weight than in years  youth will be served said a crooning voice from the other side of the table  ay masters youth will be served  the man who had spoken was the most extraordinary of all the many curious figures in the room  he was very very old so old that he was past all comparison and no one by looking at his mummy skin and fishlike eyes could give a guess at his years  a few scanty grey hairs still hung about his yellow scalp  as to his features they were scarcely human in their disfigurement for the deep wrinkles and pouchings of extreme age had been added to a face which had always been grotesquely ugly and had been crushed and smashed in addition by many a blow  i had noticed this creature at the beginning of the meal leaning his chest against the edge of the table as if its support was a welcome one and feebly picking at the food which was placed before him  gradually however as his neighbours plied him with drink his shoulders grew squarer his back stiffened his eyes brightened and he looked about him with an air of surprise at first as if he had no clear recollection of how he came there and afterwards with an expression of deepening interest as he listened with his ear scooped up in his hand to the conversation around him  thats old buckhorse whispered champion harrison  he was just the same as that when i joined the ring twenty years ago  time was when he was the terror of london  e was so said bill warr  e would fight like a stag and e was that ard that e would let any swell knock im down for alfa crown  e ad no face to spoil dye see for e was always the ugliest man in england  but es been on the shelf now for near sixty years and it cost im many a beatin before e could understand that is strength was slippin away from im  youth will be served masters droned the old man shaking his head miserably  fill up is glass said warr  ere tom give old buckhorse a sup o liptrap  warm his eart for im  the old man poured a glass of neat gin down his shrivelled throat and the effect upon him was extraordinary  a light glimmered in each of his dull eyes a tinge of colour came into his waxlike cheeks and opening his toothless mouth he suddenly emitted a peculiar belllike and most musical cry  a hoarse roar of laughter from all the company answered it and flushed faces craned over each other to catch a glimpse of the veteran  theres buckhorse they cried  buckhorse is comin round again  you can laugh if you vill masters he cried in his lewkner lane dialect holding up his two thin veincovered hands  it vont be long that youll be able to see my crooks vich ave been on figgs conk and on jack broughtons and on arry grays and many another good fightin man that was millin for a livin before your fathers could eat pap  the company laughed again and encouraged the old man by half derisive and halfaffectionate cries  let em ave it buckhorse  give it em straight  tell us how the millin coves did it in your time  the old gladiator looked round him in great contempt  vy from vot i see he cried in his high broken treble theres some on you that aint fit to flick a fly from a joint o meat youd make werry good ladies maids the most of you but you took the wrong turnin ven you came into the ring  give im a wipe over the mouth said a hoarse voice  joe berks said jackson id save the hangman the job of breaking your neck if his royal highness wasnt in the room  thats as it may be guvnor said the halfdrunken ruffian staggering to his feet  if ive said anything wot isnt genelmanlike  sit down berks cried my uncle with such a tone of command that the fellow collapsed into his chair  vy vitch of you would look tom slack in the face piped the old fellow or jack broughtonhim vot told the old dook of cumberland that all he vanted vas to fight the king o proosias guard day by day year in year out until e ad worked out the whole

through the doors  e ad so upon my davy  e was that strong that wherever e it the bone had got to go and when ed cracked a jaw or two it looked as though nothing in the country could stan against him  so the king e sent one of his genelmen down to figg and he said to him  eres a cove vot cracks a bone every time e lets vly and itll be little credit to the lunnon boys if they lets im get avay

jawbone with a sledge ammer i was with figg in slaughters coffeeouse as then vas ven e says this to the kings genelman and i goes so i does  again he emitted the curious belllike cry and again the corinthians and the fightingmen laughed and applauded him  his royal highnessthat is the earl of chesterwould be glad to hear the end of your story buckhorse said my uncle to whom the prince had been whispering  vell your ryal ighness it vas like this  ven the day came round all the volk came to figgs amphitheatre the same that vos in tottenham court an bob vittaker e vos there and the eytalian

shippin office vere e vas askin ow soon e could get a passage to voreign parts  there was much laughter and clapping of glasses upon the table at the conclusion of old buckhorses story and i saw the prince of wales hand something to the waiter who brought it round and slipped it into the skinny hand of the veteran who spat upon it before thrusting it into his pocket  the table had in the meanwhile been cleared and was now studded with bottles and glasses while long clay pipes and tobaccoboxes were handed round  my uncle never smoked thinking that the habit might darken his teeth but many of the corinthians and the prince amongst the first of them set the example of lighting up  all restraint had been done away with and the prizefighters flushed with wine roared across the tables to each other or shouted their greetings to friends at the other end of the room  the amateurs falling into the humour of their company were hardly less noisy and loudly debated the merits of the different men criticizing their styles of fighting before their faces and making bets upon the results of future matches  in the midst of the uproar there was an imperative rap upon the table and my uncle rose to speak  as he stood with his pale calm face and fine figure i had never seen him to greater advantage for he seemed with all his elegance to have a quiet air of domination amongst these fierce fellows like a huntsman walking carelessly through a springing and yapping pack  he expressed his pleasure at seeing so many good sportsmen under one roof and acknowledged the honour which had been done both to his guests and himself by the presence there that night of the illustrious personage whom he should refer to as the earl of chester  he was sorry that the season prevented him from placing game upon the table but there was so much sitting round it that it would perhaps be hardly missed cheers and laughter  the sports of the ring had in his opinion tended to that contempt of pain and of danger which had contributed so much in the past to the safety of the country and which might if what he heard was true be very quickly needed once more  if an enemy landed upon our shores it was then that with our small army we should be forced to fall back upon native valour trained into hardihood by the practice and contemplation of manly sports  in time of peace also the rules of the ring had been of service in enforcing the principles of fair play and in turning public opinion against that use of the knife or of the boot which was so common in foreign countries  he begged therefore to drink success to the fancy coupled with the name of john jackson who might stand as a type of all that was most admirable in british boxing  jackson having replied with a readiness which many a public man might have envied my uncle rose once more  we are here tonight said he not only to celebrate the past glories of the prize ring but also to arrange some sport for the future  it should be easy now that backers and fighting men are gathered together under one roof to come to terms with each other i have myself set an example by making a match with sir lothian hume the terms of which will be communicated to you by that gentleman  sir lothian rose with a paper in his hand  the terms your royal highness and gentlemen are briefly these said he  my man crab wilson of gloucester having never yet fought a prize battle is prepared to meet upon may the 18th of this year any man of any weight who may be selected by sir charles tregellis  sir charles tregelliss selection is limited to men below twenty or above thirtyfive years of age so as to exclude belcher and the other candidates for championship honours  the stakes are two thousand pounds against a thousand two hundred to be paid by the winner to his man play or pay  it was curious to see the intense gravity of them all fighters and backers as they bent their brows and weighed the conditions of the match  i am informed said sir john lade that crab wilsons age is twentythree and that although he has never fought a regular pr battle he has none the less fought within ropes for a stake on many occasions  ive seen him half a dozen times at the least said belcher  it is precisely for that reason sir john that i am laying odds of two to one in his favour  may i ask said the prince what the exact height and weight of wilson may be  five foot eleven and thirteenten your royal highness  long enough and heavy enough for anything on two legs said jackson and the professionals all murmured their assent  read the rules of the fight sir lothian  the battle to take place on tuesday may the 18th at the hour of ten in the morning at a spot to be afterwards named  the ring to be twenty foot square  neither to fall without a knockdown blow subject to the decision of the umpires  three umpires to be chosen upon the ground namely two in ordinary and one in reference  does that meet your wishes sir charles  my uncle bowed  have you anything to say wilson  the young pugilist who had a curious lanky figure and a craggy bony face passed his fingers through his closecropped hair  if you please zir said he with a slight westcountry burr a twentyvoot ring is too small for a thirteenstone man  there was another murmur of professional agreement  what would you have it wilson  vourantwenty sir lothian  have you any objection sir charles  not the slightest  anything else wilson  if you please zir id like to know whom im vighting with  i understand that you have not publicly nominated your man sir charles  i do not intend to do so until the very morning of the fight  i believe i have that right within the terms of our wager  certainly if you choose to exercise it  i do so intend  and i should be vastly pleased if mr berkeley craven will consent to be stakeholder  that gentleman having willingly given his consent the final formalities which led up to these humble tournaments were concluded  and then as these fullblooded powerful men became heated with their wine angry eyes began to glare across the table and amid the grey swirls of tobaccosmoke the lamplight gleamed upon the fierce hawklike jews and the flushed savage saxons  the old quarrel as to whether jackson had or had not committed a foul by seizing mendoza by the hair on the occasion of their battle at hornchurch eight years before came to the front once more  dutch sam hurled a shilling down upon the table and offered to fight the pride of westminster for it if he ventured to say that mendoza had been fairly beaten  joe berks who had grown noisier and more quarrelsome as the evening went on tried to clamber across the table with horrible blasphemies to come to blows with an old jew named fighting yussef who had plunged into the discussion  it needed very little more to finish the supper by a general and ferocious battle and it was only the exertions of jackson belcher harrison and others of the cooler and steadier men which saved us from a riot  and then when at last this question was set aside that of the rival claims to championships at different weights came on in its stead and again angry words flew about and challenges were in the air  there was no exact limit between the light middle and heavyweights and yet it would make a very great difference to the standing of a boxer whether he should be regarded as the heaviest of the lightweights or the lightest of the heavyweights  one claimed to be tenstone champion another was ready to take on anything at eleven but would not run to twelve which would have brought the invincible jem belcher down upon him  faulkner claimed to be champion of the seniors and even old buckhorses curious call rang out above the tumult as he turned the whole company to laughter and good humour again by challenging anything over eighty and under seven stone  but in spite of gleams of sunshine there was thunder in the air and champion harrison had just whispered in my ear that he was quite sure that we should never get through the night without trouble and was advising me if it got very bad to take refuge under the table when the landlord entered the room hurriedly and handed a note to my uncle  he read it and then passed it to the prince who returned it with raised eyebrows and a gesture of surprise  then my uncle rose with the scrap of paper in his hand and a smile upon his lips  gentlemen said he there is a stranger waiting below who desires a fight to a finish with the best men in the room    chapter xithe fight in the coachhouse    the curt announcement was followed by a moment of silent surprise and then by a general shout of laughter  there might be argument as to who was champion at each weight but there could be no question that all the champions of all the weights were seated round the tables  an audacious challenge which embraced them one and all without regard to size or age could hardly be regarded otherwise than as a jokebut it was a joke which might be a dear one for the joker  is this genuine asked my uncle  yes sir charles answered the landlord the man is waiting below  its a kid cried several of the fightingmen  some cove is a gammonin us  dont you believe it answered the landlord  hes a real slapup corinthian by his dress and he means what he says or else i aint no judge of a man  my uncle whispered for a few moments with the prince of wales well gentlemen said he at last the night is still young and if any of you should wish to show the company a little of your skill you could not ask a better opportunity  what weight is he bill asked jem belcher  hes close on six foot and i should put him well into the thirteen stones when hes buffed  heavy metal cried jackson  who takes him on  they all wanted to from ninestone dutch sam upwards  the air was filled with their hoarse shouts and their arguments why each should be the chosen one  to fight when they were flushed with wine and ripe for mischiefabove all to fight before so select a company with the prince at the ringside was a chance which did not often come in their way  only jackson belcher mendoza and one or two others of the senior and more famous men remained silent thinking it beneath their dignity that they should condescend to so irregular a byebattle  well you cant all fight him remarked jackson when the babel had died away  its for the chairman to choose  perhaps your royal highness has a preference said my uncle  by jove id take him on myself if my position was different said the prince whose face was growing redder and his eyes more glazed youve seen me with the mufflers jackson  you know my form  ive seen your royal highness and i have felt your royal highness said the courtly jackson  perhaps jem belcher would give us an exhibition said my uncle  belcher smiled and shook his handsome head  theres my brother tom here has never been blooded in london yet sir  he might make a fairer match of it  give him over to me roared joe berks  ive been waitin for a turn all evenin an ill fight any man that tries to take my place  es my meat my masters  leave im to me if you want to see ow a calfs ead should be dressed  if you put tom belcher before me ill fight tom belcher an for that matter ill fight jem belcher or bill belcher or any other belcher that ever came out of bristol  it was clear that berks had got to the stage when he must fight some one  his heavy face was gorged and the veins stood out on his low forehead while his fierce grey eyes looked viciously from man to man in quest of a quarrel  his great red hands were bunched into huge gnarled fists and he shook one of them menacingly as his drunken gaze swept round the tables  i think youll agree with me gentlemen that joe berks would be all the better for some fresh air and exercise said my uncle with the concurrence of his royal highness and of the company i shall select him as our champion on this occasion  you do me proud cried the fellow staggering to his feet and pulling at his coat  if i dont glut him within the five minutes may i never see shropshire again  wait a bit berks cried several of the amateurs  wheres it going to be held  where you like masters  ill fight him in a sawpit or on the outside of a coach if it please you  put us toe to toe and leave the rest with me  they cant fight here with all this litter said my uncle  where shall it be  pon my soul tregellis cried the prince i think our unknown friend might have a word to say upon that matter  hell be vastly illused if you dont let him have his own choice of conditions  you are right sir  we must have him up  thats easy enough said the landlord for here he comes through the doorway  i glanced round and had a side view of a tall and welldressed young man in a long brown travelling coat and a black felt hat  the next instant he had turned and i had clutched with both my hands on to champion harrisons arm  harrison i gasped  its boy jim  and yet somehow the possibility and even the probability of it had occurred to me from the beginning and i believe that it had to harrison also for i had noticed that his face grew grave and troubled from the very moment that there was talk of the stranger below  now the instant that the buzz of surprise and admiration caused by jims face and figure had died away harrison was on his feet gesticulating in his excitement  its my nephew jim gentlemen he cried  hes not twenty yet and its no doing of mine that he should be here  let him alone harrison cried jackson  hes big enough to take care of himself  this matter has gone rather far said my uncle  i think harrison that you are too good a sportsman to prevent your nephew from showing whether he takes after his uncle  its very different from me cried harrison in great distress but ill tell you what ill do gentlemen  i never thought to stand up in a ring again but ill take on joe berks with pleasure just to give a bit o sport to this company  boy jim stepped across and laid his hand upon the prizefighters shoulder  it must be so uncle i heard him whisper  i am sorry to go against your wishes but i have made up my mind and i must carry it through  harrison shrugged his huge shoulders  jim jim you dont know what you are doing  but ive heard you speak like that before boy and i know that it ends in your getting your way  i trust harrison that your opposition is withdrawn said my uncle  can i not take his place  you would not have it said that i gave a challenge and let another carry it out whispered jim  this is my one chance  for heavens sake dont stand in my way  the smiths broad and usually stolid face was all working with his conflicting emotions  at last he banged his fist down upon the table  its no fault of mine he cried  it was to be and it is  jim boy for the lords sake remember your distances and stick to out fightin with a man that could give you a stone  i was sure that harrison would not stand in the way of sport said my uncle  we are glad that you have stepped up that we might consult you as to the arrangements for giving effect to your very sporting challenge  whom am i to fight asked jim looking round at the company who were now all upon their feet  young man youll know enough of who you ave to fight before you are through with it cried berks lurching heavily through the crowd  youll need a friend to swear to you before ive finished dye see  jim looked at him with disgust in every line of his face  surely you are not going to set me to fight a drunken man said he  where is jem belcher  my name young man  i should be glad to try you if i may  you must work up to me my lad  you dont take a ladder at one jump but you do it rung by rung  show yourself to be a match for me and ill give you a turn  im much obliged to you  and i like the look of you and wish you well said belcher holding out his hand  they were not unlike each other either in face or figure though the bristol man was a few years the older and a murmur of critical admiration was heard as the two tall lithe figures and keen cleancut faces were contrasted  have you any choice where the fight takes place asked my uncle  i am in your hands sir said jim  why not go round to the fives court suggested sir john lade  yes let us go to the fives court  but this did not at all suit the views of the landlord who saw in this lucky incident a chance of reaping a fresh harvest from his spendthrift company  if it please you he cried there is no need to go so far  my coachhouse at the back of the yard is empty and a better place for a mill youll never find  there was a general shout in favour of the coachhouse and those who were nearest the door began to slip through in the hope of scouring the best places  my stout neighbour bill warr pulled harrison to one side  id stop it if i were you he whispered  i would if i could  its no wish of mine that he should fight but theres no turning him when once his mind is made up  all his own fights put together had never reduced the pugilist to such a state of agitation  wait on im yourself then and chuck up the sponge when things begin to go wrong  you know joe berkss record  hes since my time  well es a terror thats all  its only belcher that can master im  you see the man for yourself six foot fourteen stone and full of the devil  belchers beat im twice but the second time e ad all is work to do it  well well weve got to go through with it  youve not seen boy jim put his mawleys up or maybe youd think better of his chances when he was short of sixteen he licked the cock of the south downs and hes come on a long way since then  the company was swarming through the door and clattering down the stair so we followed in the stream  a fine rain was falling and the yellow lights from the windows glistened upon the wet cobblestones of the yard  how welcome was that breath of sweet damp air after the fetid atmosphere of the supperroom  at the other end of the yard was an open door sharply outlined by the gleam of lanterns within and through this they poured amateurs and fightingmen jostling each other in their eagerness to get to the front  for my own part being a smallish man i should have seen nothing had i not found an upturned bucket in a corner upon which i perched myself with the wall at my back  it was a large room with a wooden floor and an open square in the ceiling which was fringed with the heads of the ostlers and stable boys who were looking down from the harnessroom above  a carriage lamp was slung in each corner and a very large stablelantern hung from a rafter in the centre  a coil of rope had been brought in and under the direction of jackson four men had been stationed to hold it  what space do you give them asked my uncle  twentyfour as they are both big ones sir  very good and halfminutes between rounds i suppose  ill umpire if sir lothian hume will do the same and you can hold the watch and referee jackson  with great speed and exactness every preparation was rapidly made by these experienced men  mendoza and dutch sam were commissioned to attend to berks while belcher and jack harrison did the same for boy jim  sponges towels and some brandy in a bladder were passed over the heads of the crowd for the use of the seconds  heres our man cried belcher  come along berks or well go to fetch you  jim appeared in the ring stripped to the waist with a coloured handkerchief tied round his middle  a shout of admiration came from the spectators as they looked upon the fine lines of his figure and i found myself roaring with the rest  his shoulders were sloping rather than bulky and his chest was deep rather than broad but the muscle was all in the right place rippling down in long low curves from neck to shoulder and from shoulder to elbow  his work at the anvil had developed his arms to their utmost and his healthy country living gave a sleek gloss to his ivory skin which shone in the lamplight  his expression was full of spirit and confidence and he wore a grim sort of halfsmile which i had seen many a time in our boyhood and which meant i knew that his pride had set iron hard and that his senses would fail him long before his courage  joe berks in the meanwhile had swaggered in and stood with folded arms between his seconds in the opposite corner  his face had none of the eager alertness of his opponent and his skin of a dead white with heavy folds about the chest and ribs showed even to my inexperienced eyes that he was not a man who should fight without training  a life of toping and ease had left him flabby and gross on the other hand he was famous for his mettle and for his hitting power so that even in the face of the advantages of youth and condition the betting was three to one in his favour  his heavy jowled cleanshaven face expressed ferocity as well as courage and he stood with his small bloodshot eyes fixed viciously upon jim and his lumpy shoulders stooping a little forwards like a fierce hound training on a leash  the hubbub of the betting had risen until it drowned all other sounds men shouting their opinions from one side of the coachhouse to the other and waving their hands to attract attention or as a sign that they had accepted a wager  sir john lade standing just in front of me was roaring out the odds against jim and laying them freely with those who fancied the appearance of the unknown  ive seen berks fight said he to the honourable berkeley craven no country hawbuck is going to knock out a man with such a record  he may be a country hawbuck the other answered but i have been reckoned a judge of anything either on two legs or four and i tell you sir john that i never saw a man who looked better bred in my life  are you still laying against him  three to one  have you once in hundreds  very good craven  there they go  berks  berks  bravo  berks bravo  i think craven that i shall trouble you for that hundred  the two men had stood up to each other jim as light upon his feet as a goat with his left well out and his right thrown across the lower part of his chest while berks held both arms half extended and his feet almost level so that he might lead off with either side  for an instant they looked each other over and then berks ducking his head and rushing in with a handoverhand style of hitting bored jim down into his corner  it was a backward slip rather than a knockdown but a thin trickle of blood was seen at the corner of jims mouth  in an instant the seconds had seized their men and carried them back into their corners  do you mind doubling our bet said berkeley craven who was craning his neck to get a glimpse of jim  four to one on berks  four to one on berks cried the ringsiders  the odds have gone up you see  will you have four to one in hundreds  very good sir john  you seem to fancy him more for having been knocked down  he was pushed down but he stopped every blow and i liked the look on his face as he got up again  well its the old stager for me  here they come again  hes got a pretty style and he covers his points well but it isnt the best looking that wins  they were at it again and i was jumping about upon my bucket in my excitement  it was evident that berks meant to finish the battle offhand whilst jim with two of the most experienced men in england to advise him was quite aware that his correct tactics were to allow the ruffian to expend his strength and wind in vain  there was something horrible in the ferocious energy of berkss hitting every blow fetching a grunt from him as he smashed it in and after each i gazed at jim as i have gazed at a stranded vessel upon the sussex beach when wave after wave has roared over it fearing each time that i should find it miserably mangled  but still the lamplight shone upon the lads clear alert face upon his well opened eyes and his firmset mouth while the blows were taken upon his forearm or allowed by a quick duck of the head to whistle over his shoulder  but berks was artful as well as violent  gradually he worked jim back into an angle of the ropes from which there was no escape and then when he had him fairly penned he sprang upon him like a tiger  what happened was so quick that i cannot set its sequence down in words but i saw jim make a quick stoop under the swinging arms and at the same instant i heard a sharp ringing smack and there was jim dancing about in the middle of the ring and berks lying upon his side on the floor with his hand to his eye  how they roared  prizefighters corinthians prince stableboy and landlord were all shouting at the top of their lungs  old buckhorse was skipping about on a box beside me shrieking out criticisms and advice in strange obsolete ringjargon which no one could understand  his dull eyes were shining his parchment face was quivering with excitement and his strange musical call rang out above all the hubbub  the two men were hurried to their corners one second sponging them down and the other flapping a towel in front of their face whilst they with arms hanging down and legs extended tried to draw all the air they could into their lungs in the brief space allowed them  wheres your country hawbuck now cried craven triumphantly did ever you witness anything more masterly  hes no johnny raw certainly said sir john shaking his head what odds are you giving on berks lord sole  two to one  i take you twice in hundreds  heres sir john lade hedging cried my uncle smiling back at us over his shoulder  time said jackson and the two men sprang forward to the mark again  this round was a good deal shorter than that which had preceded it berkss orders evidently were to close at any cost and so make use of his extra weight and strength before the superior condition of his antagonist could have time to tell  on the other hand jim after his experience in the last round was less disposed to make any great exertion to keep him at arms length  he led at berkss head as he came rushing in and missed him receiving a severe body blow in return which left the imprint of four angry knuckles above his ribs  as they closed jim caught his opponents bullet head under his arm for an instant and put a couple of halfarm blows in but the prizefighter pulled him over by his weight and the two fell panting side by side upon the ground  jim sprang up however and walked over to his corner while berks distressed by his evenings dissipation leaned one arm upon mendoza and the other upon dutch sam as he made for his seat  bellows to mend cried jem belcher  wheres the four to one now  give us time to get the lid off our pepperbox said mendoza  we mean to make a night of it  looks like it said jack harrison  hes shut one of his eyes already  even money that my boy wins it  how much asked several voices  two pound four and threepence cried harrison counting out all his worldly wealth  time said jackson once more  they were both at the mark in an instant jim as full of sprightly confidence as ever and berks with a fixed grin upon his bulldog face and a most vicious gleam in the only eye which was of use to him  his halfminute had not enabled him to recover his breath and his huge hairy chest was rising and falling with a quick loud panting like a spent hound  go in boy  bustle him roared harrison and belcher  get your wind joe get your wind cried the jews  so now we had a reversal of tactics for it was jim who went in to hit with all the vigour of his young strength and unimpaired energy while it was the savage berks who was paying his debt to nature for the many injuries which he had done her  he gasped he gurgled his face grew purple in his attempts to get his breath while with his long left arm extended and his right thrown across he tried to screen himself from the attack of his wiry antagonist  drop when he hits cried mendoza  drop and have a rest  but there was no shyness or shiftiness about berkss fighting  he was always a gallant ruffian who disdained to go down before an antagonist as long as his legs would sustain him  he propped jim off with his long arm and though the lad sprang lightly round him looking for an opening he was held off as if a fortyinch bar of iron were between them  every instant now was in favour of berks and already his breathing was easier and the bluish tinge fading from his face  jim knew that his chance of a speedy victory was slipping away from him and he came back again and again as swift as a flash to the attack without being able to get past the passive defence of the trained fightingman  it was at such a moment that ringcraft was needed and luckily for jim two masters of it were at his back  get your left on his mark boy they shouted then go to his head with the right  jim heard and acted on the instant  plunk came his left just where his antagonists ribs curved from his breastbone  the force of the blow was half broken by berkss elbow but it served its purpose of bringing forward his head  spank went the right with the clear crisp sound of two billiard balls clapping together and berks reeled flung up his arms spun round and fell in a huge fleshy heap upon the floor  his seconds were on him instantly and propped him up in a sitting position his head rolling helplessly from one shoulder to the other and finally toppling backwards with his chin pointed to the ceiling  dutch sam thrust the brandybladder between his teeth while mendoza shook him savagely and howled insults in his ear but neither the spirits nor the sense of injury could break into that serene insensibility  time was duly called and the jews seeing that the affair was over let their mans head fall back with a crack upon the floor and there he lay his huge arms and legs asprawl whilst the corinthians and fightingmen crowded past him to shake the hand of his conqueror  for my part i tried also to press through the throng but it was no easy task for one of the smallest and weakest men in the room  on all sides of me i heard a brisk discussion from amateurs and professionals of jims performance and of his prospects  hes the best bit of new stuff that ive seen since jem belcher fought his first fight with paddington jones at wormwood scrubbs four years ago last april said berkeley craven  youll see him with the belt round his waist before hes fiveandtwenty or i am no judge of a man  that handsome face of his has cost me a cool five hundred grumbled sir john lade  whod have thought he was such a punishing hitter  for all that said another i am confident that if joe berks had been sober he would have eaten him  besides the lad was in training and the other would burst like an overdone potato if he were hit  i never saw a man so soft or with his wind in such condition  put the men in training and its a horse to a hen on the bruiser  some agreed with the last speaker and some were against him so that a brisk argument was being carried on around me  in the midst of it the prince took his departure which was the signal for the greater part of the company to make for the door  in this way i was able at last to reach the corner where jim had just finished his dressing while champion harrison with tears of joy still shining upon his cheeks was helping him on with his overcoat  in four rounds he kept repeating in a sort of an ecstasy  joe berks in four rounds  and it took jem belcher fourteen  well roddy cried jim holding out his hand i told you that i would come to london and make my name known  it was splendid jim  dear old roddy  i saw your white face staring at me from the corner  you are not changed for all your grand clothes and your london friends  it is you who are changed jim said i i hardly knew you when you came into the room  nor i cried the smith  where got you all these fine feathers jim  sure i am that it was not your aunt who helped you to the first step towards the prizering  miss hinton has been my friendthe best friend i ever had  humph  i thought as much grumbled the smith  well it is no doing of mine jim and you must bear witness to that when we go home again  i dont know whatbut there it is done and it cant be helped  after all shesnow the deuce take my clumsy tongue  i could not tell whether it was the wine which he had taken at supper or the excitement of boy jims victory which was affecting harrison but his usually placid face wore a most disturbed expression and his manner seemed to betray an alternation of exultation and embarrassment  jim looked curiously at him wondering evidently what it was that lay behind these abrupt sentences and sudden silences  the coachhouse had in the mean time been cleared berks with many curses had staggered at last to his feet and had gone off in company with two other bruisers while jem belcher alone remained chatting very earnestly with my uncle  very good belcher i heard my uncle say  it would be a real pleasure to me to do it sir and the famous prizefighter as the two walked towards us  i wished to ask you jim harrison whether you would undertake to be my champion in the fight against crab wilson of gloucester said my uncle  that is what i want sir charlesto have a chance of fighting my way upwards  there are heavy stakes upon the eventvery heavy stakes said my uncle  you will receive two hundred pounds if you win  does that satisfy you  i shall fight for the honour and because i wish to be thought worthy of being matched against jem belcher  belcher laughed goodhumouredly  you are going the right way about it lad said he  but you had a soft thing on tonight with a drunken man who was out of condition  i did not wish to fight him said jim flushing  oh i know you have spirit enough to fight anything on two legs  i knew that the instant i clapped eyes on you but i want you to remember that when you fight crab wilson you will fight the most promising man from the west and that the best man of the west is likely to be the best man in england  hes as quick and as long in the reach as you are and hell train himself to the last halfounce of tallow  i tell you this now dye see because if im to have the charge of you  charge of me  yes said my uncle  belcher has consented to train you for the coming battle if you are willing to enter  i am sure i am very much obliged to you cried jim heartily unless my uncle should wish to train me there is no one i would rather have  nay jim ill stay with you a few days but belcher knows a deal more about training than i do  where will the quarters be  i thought it would be handy for you if we fixed it at the george at crawley  then if we have choice of place we might choose crawley down for except molesey hurst and maybe smitham bottom there isnt a spot in the country that would compare with it for a mill  do you agree with that  with all my heart said jim  then youre my man from this hour on dye see said belcher your food is mine and your drink is mine and your sleep is mine and all youve to do is just what you are told  we havent an hour to lose for wilson has been in halftraining this month back  you saw his empty glass tonight  jims fit to fight for his life at the present moment said harrison  but well both come down to crawley tomorrow  so good night sir charles  good night roddy said jim  youll come down to crawley and see me at my training quarters will you not  and i heartily promised that i would  you must be more careful nephew said my uncle as we rattled home in his model visavis  en premiere jeunesse one is a little inclined to be ruled by ones heart rather than by ones reason jim harrison seems to be a most respectable young fellow but after all he is a blacksmiths apprentice and a candidate for the prize ring  there is a vast gap between his position and that of my own blood relation and you must let him feel that you are his superior  he is the oldest and dearest friend that i have in the world sir i answered  we were boys together and have never had a secret from each other  as to showing him that i am his superior i dont know how i can do that for i know very well that he is mine  hum said my uncle drily and it was the last word that he addressed to me that night    chapter xiithe coffeeroom of fladongs    so boy jim went down to the george at crawley under the charge of jim belcher and champion harrison to train for his great fight with crab wilson of gloucester whilst every club and bar parlour of london rang with the account of how he had appeared at a supper of corinthians and beaten the formidable joe berks in four rounds  i remembered that afternoon at friars oak when jim had told me that he would make his name known and his words had come true sooner than he could have expected it for go where one might one heard of nothing but the match between sir lothian hume and sir charles tregellis and the points of the two probable combatants  the betting was still steadily in favour of wilson for he had a number of byebattles to set against this single victory of jims and it was thought by connoisseurs who had seen him spar that the singular defensive tactics which had given him his nickname would prove very puzzling to a raw antagonist  in height strength and reputation for gameness there was very little to choose between them but wilson had been the more severely tested  it was but a few days before the battle that my father made his promised visit to london  the seaman had no love of cities and was happier wandering over the downs and turning his glass upon every topsail which showed above the horizon than when finding his way among crowded streets where as he complained it was impossible to keep a course by the sun and hard enough by dead reckoning rumours of war were in the air however and it was necessary that he should use his influence with lord nelson if a vacancy were to be found either for himself or for me  my uncle had just set forth as was his custom of an evening clad in his green ridingfrock his plate buttons his cordovan boots and his round hat to show himself upon his croptailed tit in the mall  i had remained behind for indeed i had already made up my mind that i had no calling for this fashionable life  these men with their small waists their gestures and their unnatural ways had become wearisome to me and even my uncle with his cold and patronizing manner filled me with very mixed feelings  my thoughts were back in sussex and i was dreaming of the kindly simple ways of the country when there came a rattat at the knocker the ring of a hearty voice and there in the doorway was the smiling weatherbeaten face with the puckered eyelids and the light blue eyes  why roddy you are grand indeed he cried  but i had rather see you with the kings blue coat upon your back than with all these frills and ruffles  and i had rather wear it father  it warms my heart to hear you say so  lord nelson has promised me that he would find a berth for you and tomorrow we shall seek him out and remind him of it  but where is your uncle  he is riding in the mall  a look of relief passed over my fathers honest face for he was never very easy in his brotherinlaws company  i have been to the admiralty said he and i trust that i shall have a ship when war breaks out by all accounts it will not be long first  lord st vincent told me so with his own lips  but i am at fladongs rodney where if you will come and sup with me you will see some of my messmates from the mediterranean  when you think that in the last year of the war we had 140000 seamen and mariners afloat commanded by 4000 officers and that half of these had been turned adrift when the peace of amiens laid their ships up in the hamoaze or portsdown creek you will understand that london as well as the dockyard towns was full of seafarers  you could not walk the streets without catching sight of the gipsyfaced keeneyed men whose plain clothes told of their thin purses as plainly as their listless air showed their weariness of a life of forced and unaccustomed inaction  amid the dark streets and brick houses there was something out of place in their appearance as when the seagulls driven by stress of weather are seen in the midland shires  yet while prizecourts procrastinated or there was a chance of an appointment by showing their sunburned faces at the admiralty so long they would continue to pace with their quarterdeck strut down whitehall or to gather of an evening to discuss the events of the last war or the chances of the next at fladongs in oxford street which was reserved as entirely for the navy as slaughters was for the army or ibbetsons for the church of england  it did not surprise me therefore that we should find the large room in which we supped crowded with naval men but i remember that what did cause me some astonishment was to observe that all these sailors who had served under the most varying conditions in all quarters of the globe from the baltic to the east indies should have been moulded into so uniform a type that they were more like each other than brother is commonly to brother  the rules of the service insured that every face should be cleanshaven every head powdered and every neck covered by the little queue of natural hair tied with a black silk ribbon  biting winds and tropical suns had combined to darken them whilst the habit of command and the menace of everrecurring dangers had stamped them all with the same expression of authority and of alertness  there were some jovial faces amongst them but the older officers with their deeplined cheeks and their masterful noses were for the most part as austere as so many weatherbeaten ascetics from the desert  lonely watches and a discipline which cut them off from all companionship had left their mark upon those red indian faces  for my part i could hardly eat my supper for watching them  young as i was i knew that if there were any freedom left in europe it was to these men that we owed it and i seemed to read upon their grim harsh features the record of that long ten years of struggle which had swept the tricolour from the seas  when we had finished our supper my father led me into the great coffeeroom where a hundred or more officers may have been assembled drinking their wine and smoking their long clay pipes until the air was as thick as the maindeck in a closefought action  as we entered we found ourselves face to face with an elderly officer who was coming out  he was a man with large thoughtful eyes and a full placid facesuch a face as one would expect from a philosopher and a philanthropist rather than from a fighting seaman  heres cuddie collingwood whispered my father  halloa lieutenant stone cried the famous admiral very cheerily i have scarce caught a glimpse of you since you came aboard the excellent after st vincent  you had the luck to be at the nile also i understand  i was third of the theseus under millar sir  it nearly broke my heart to have missed it  i have not yet outlived it  to think of such a gallant service and i engaged in harassing the marketboats the miserable cabbagecarriers of st luccars  your plight was better than mine sir cuthbert said a voice from behind us and a large man in the full uniform of a postcaptain took a step forward to include himself in our circle  his mastiff face was heavy with emotion and he shook his head miserably as he spoke  yes yes troubridge i can understand and sympathize with your feelings  i passed through torment that night collingwood  it left a mark on me that i shall never lose until i go over the ships side in a canvas cover  to have my beautiful culloden laid on a sandbank just out of gunshot  to hear and see the fight the whole night through and never to pull a lanyard or take the tompions out of my guns twice i opened my pistolcase to blow out my brains and it was but the thought that nelson might have a use for me that held me back  collingwood shook the hand of the unfortunate captain  admiral nelson was not long in finding a use for you troubridge said he  we have all heard of your siege of capua and how you ran up your ships guns without trenches or parallels and fired point blank through the embrasures  the melancholy cleared away from the massive face of the big seaman and his deep laughter filled the room  im not clever enough or slow enough for their zz fashions said he  we got alongside and slapped it in through their portholes until they struck their colours  but where have you been sir cuthbert  with my wife and my two little lasses at morpeth in the north country  i have but seen them this once in ten years and it may be ten more for all i know ere i see them again  i have been doing good work for the fleet up yonder  i had thought sir that it was inland said my father  collingwood took a little black bag out of his pocket and shook it  inland it is said he and yet i have done good work for the fleet there  what do you suppose i hold in this bag  bullets said troubridge  something that a sailor needs even more than that answered the admiral and turning it over he tilted a pile of acorns on to his palm  i carry them with me in my country walks and where i see a fruitful nook i thrust one deep with the end of my cane  my oak trees may fight those rascals over the water when i am long forgotten  do you know lieutenant how many oaks go to make an eightygun ship  my father shook his head  two thousand no less  for every twodecked ship that carries the white ensign there is a grove the less in england  so how are our grandsons to beat the french if we do not give them the trees with which to build their ships  he replaced his bag in his pocket and then passing his arm through troubridges they went through the door together  theres a man whose life might help you to trim your own course said my father as we took our seats at a vacant table  he is ever the same quiet gentleman with his thoughts busy for the comfort of his ships company and his heart with his wife and children whom he has so seldom seen  it is said in the fleet that an oath has never passed his lips rodney though how he managed when he was first lieutenant of a raw crew is more than i can conceive  but they all love cuddie for they know hes an angel to fight  how dye do captain foley  my respects sir edard  why if they could but press the company they would man a corvette with flag officers  theres many a man here rodney continued my father as he glanced about him whose name may never find its way into any book save his own ships log but who in his own way has set as fine an example as any admiral of them all  we know them and talk of them in the fleet though they may never be bawled in the streets of london  theres as much seamanship and pluck in a good cutter action as in a lineobattleship fight though you may not come by a title nor the thanks of parliament for it  theres hamilton for example the quiet palefaced man who is learning against the pillar  it was he who with six rowingboats cut out the 44gun frigate hermione from under the muzzles of two hundred shoreguns in the harbour of puerto cabello  no finer action was done in the whole war  theres jaheel brenton with the whiskers  it was he who attacked twelve spanish gunboats in his one little brig and made four of them strike to him  theres walker of the rose cutter who with thirteen men engaged three french privateers with crews of a hundred and fortysix  he sank one captured one and chased the third  how are you captain ball  i hope i see you well  two or three of my fathers acquaintances who had been sitting close by drew up their chairs to us and soon quite a circle had formed all talking loudly and arguing upon sea matters shaking their long redtipped pipes at each other as they spoke  my father whispered in my ear that his neighbour was captain foley of the goliath who led the van at the nile and that the tall thin foxyhaired man opposite was lord cochrane the most dashing frigate captain in the service  even at friars oak we had heard how in the little speedy of fourteen small guns with fiftyfour men he had carried by boarding the spanish frigate gamo with her crew of three hundred it was easy to see that he was a quick irascible highblooded man for he was talking hotly about his grievances with a flush of anger upon his freckled cheeks  we shall never do any good upon the ocean until we have hanged the dockyard contractors he cried  id have a dead dockyard contractor as a figurehead for every firstrate in the fleet and a provision dealer for every frigate  i know them with their puttied seams and their devil bolts risking five hundred lives that they may steal a few pounds worth of copper  what became of the chance and of the martin and of the orestes  they foundered at sea and were never heard of more and i say that the crews of them were murdered men  lord cochrane seemed to be expressing the views of all for a murmur of assent with a mutter of hearty deepsea curses ran round the circle  those rascals over yonder manage things better said an old one eyed captain with the blueandwhite riband for st vincent peeping out of his third buttonhole  they sheer away their heads if they get up to any foolery  did ever a vessel come out of toulon as my 38gun frigate did from plymouth last year with her masts rolling about until her shrouds were like iron bars on one side and hanging in festoons upon the other  the meanest sloop that ever sailed out of france would have overmatched her and then it would be on me and not on this devonport bungler that a courtmartial would be called  they loved to grumble those old salts for as soon as one had shot off his grievance his neighbour would follow with another each more bitter than the last  look at our sails cried captain foley  put a french and a british ship at anchor together and how can you tell which is which  frenchy has his fore and maintopgallant masts about equal said my father  in the old ships maybe but how many of the new are laid down on the french model  no theres no way of telling them at anchor but let them hoist sail and how dyou tell them then  frenchy has white sails cried several  and ours are black and rotten  thats the difference  no wonder they outsail us when the wind can blow through our canvas  in the speedy said cochrane the sailcloth was so thin that when i made my observation i always took my meridian through the foretopsail and my horizon through the foresail  there was a general laugh at this and then at it they all went again letting off into speech all those weary broodings and silent troubles which had rankled during long years of service for an iron discipline prevented them from speaking when their feet were upon their own quarterdecks  one told of his powder six pounds of which were needed to throw a ball a thousand yards  another cursed the admiralty courts where a prize goes in as a fullrigged ship and comes out as a schooner  the old captain spoke of the promotions by parliamentary interest which had put many a youngster into the captains cabin when he should have been in the gunroom and then they came back to the difficulty of finding crews for their vessels and they all together raised up their voices and wailed  what is the use of building fresh ships cried foley when even with a tenpound bounty you cant man the ships that you have got  but lord cochrane was on the other side in this question  youd have the men sir if you treated them well when you got them said he  admiral nelson can get his ships manned  so can admiral collingwood  why  because he has thought for the men and so the men have thought for him  let men and officers know and respect each other and theres no difficulty in keeping a ships company  its the infernal plan of turning a crew over from ship to ship and leaving the officers behind that rots the navy  but i have never found a difficulty and i dare swear that if i hoist my pennant tomorrow i shall have all my old speedies back and as many volunteers as i care to take  that is very well my lord said the old captain with some warmth when the jacks hear that the speedy took fifty vessels in thirteen months they are sure to volunteer to serve with her commander  every good cruiser can fill her complement quickly enough  but it is not the cruisers that fight the countrys battles and blockade the enemys ports  i say that all prizemoney should be divided equally among the whole fleet and until you have such a rule the smartest men will always be found where they are of least service to any one but themselves  this speech produced a chorus of protests from the cruiser officers and a hearty agreement from the lineofbattleship men who seemed to be in the majority in the circle which had gathered round  from the flushed faces and angry glances it was evident that the question was one upon which there was strong feeling upon both sides  what the cruiser gets the cruiser earns cried a frigate captain  do you mean to say sir said captain foley that the duties of an officer upon a cruiser demand more care or higher professional ability than those of one who is employed upon blockade service with a lee coast under him whenever the wind shifts to the west and the topmasts of an enemys squadron for ever in his sight  i do not claim higher ability sir  then why should you claim higher pay  can you deny that a seaman before the mast makes more in a fast frigate than a lieutenant can in a battleship  it was only last year said a very gentlemanlylooking officer who might have passed for a buck upon town had his skin not been burned to copper in such sunshine as never bursts upon londonit was only last year that i brought the old alexander back from the mediterranean floating like an empty barrel and carrying nothing but honour for her cargo  in the channel we fell in with the frigate minerva from the western ocean with her lee ports under water and her hatches bursting with the plunder which had been too valuable to trust to the prize crews  she had ingots of silver along her yards and bowsprit and a bit of silver plate at the truck of the masts  my jacks could have fired into her and would too if they had not been held back  it made them mad to think of all they had done in the south and then to see this saucy frigate flashing her money before their eyes  i cannot see their grievance captain ball said cochrane  when you are promoted to a twodecker my lord it will possibly become clearer to you  you speak as if a cruiser had nothing to do but take prizes  if that is your view you will permit me to say that you know very little of the matter  i have handled a sloop a corvette and a frigate and i have found a great variety of duties in each of them i have had to avoid the enemys battleships and to fight his cruisers  i have had to chase and capture his privateers and to cut them out when they run under his batteries  i have had to engage his forts to take my men ashore and to destroy his guns and his signal stations  all this with convoying reconnoitring and risking ones own ship in order to gain a knowledge of the enemys movements comes under the duties of the commander of a cruiser  i make bold to say that the man who can carry these objects out with success has deserved better of the country than the officer of a battleship tacking from ushant to the black rocks and back again until she builds up a reef with her beefbones  sir said the angry old sailor such an officer is at least in no danger of being mistaken for a privateersman  i am surprised captain bulkeley cochran retorted hotly that you should venture to couple the names of privateersman and kings officer  there was mischief brewing among these hotheaded shortspoken salts but captain foley changed the subject to discuss the new ships which were being built in the french ports  it was of interest to me to hear these men who were spending their lives in fighting against our neighbours discussing their character and ways  you cannot conceiveyou who live in times of peace and charityhow fierce the hatred was in england at that time against the french and above all against their great leader  it was more than a mere prejudice or dislike  it was a deep aggressive loathing of which you may even now form some conception if you examine the papers or caricatures of the day  the word frenchman was hardly spoken without rascal or scoundrel slipping in before it  in all ranks of life and in every part of the country the feeling was the same  even the jacks aboard our ships fought with a viciousness against a french vessel which they would never show to dane dutchman or spaniard  if you ask me now after fifty years why it was that there should have been this virulent feeling against them so foreign to the easygoing and tolerant british nature i would confess that i think the real reason was fear  not fear of them individually of course our foulest detractors have never called us faintheartedbut fear of their star fear of their future fear of the subtle brain whose plans always seemed to go aright and of the heavy hand which had struck nation after nation to the ground  we were but a small country with a population which when the war began was not much more than half that of france  and then france had increased by leaps and bounds reaching out to the north into belgium and holland and to the south into italy whilst we were weakened by deeplying disaffection among both catholics and presbyterians in ireland  the danger was imminent and plain to the least thoughtful one could not walk the kent coast without seeing the beacons heaped up to tell the country of the enemys landing and if the sun were shining on the uplands near boulogne one might catch the flash of its gleam upon the bayonets of manoeuvring veterans  no wonder that a fear of the french power lay deeply in the hearts of the most gallant men and that fear should as it always does beget a bitter and rancorous hatred  the seamen did not speak kindly then of their recent enemies  their hearts loathed them and in the fashion of our country their lips said what the heart felt  of the french officers they could not have spoken with more chivalry as of worthy foemen but the nation was an abomination to them  the older men had fought against them in the american war they had fought again for the last ten years and the dearest wish of their hearts seemed to be that they might be called upon to do the same for the remainder of their days  yet if i was surprised by the virulence of their animosity against the french i was even more so to hear how highly they rated them as antagonists  the long succession of british victories which had finally made the french take to their ports and resign the struggle in despair had given all of us the idea that for some reason a briton on the water must in the nature of things always have the best of it against a frenchman  but these men who had done the fighting did not think so  they were loud in their praise of their foemens gallantry and precise in their reasons for his defeat they showed how the officers of the old french navy had nearly all been aristocrats  how the revolution had swept them out of their ships and the force been left with insubordinate seamen and no competent leaders  this illdirected fleet had been hustled into port by the pressure of the wellmanned and wellcommanded british who had pinned them there ever since so that they had never had an opportunity of learning seamanship  their harbour drill and their harbour gunnery had been of no service when sails had to be trimmed and broadsides fired on the heave of an atlantic swell  let one of their frigates get to sea and have a couple of years free run in which the crew might learn their duties and then it would be a feather in the cap of a british officer if with a ship of equal force he could bring down her colours  such were the views of these experienced officers fortified by many reminiscences and examples of french gallantry such as the way in which the crew of the lorient had fought her quarterdeck guns when the maindeck was in a blaze beneath them and when they must have known that they were standing over an exploding magazine  the general hope was that the west indian expedition since the peace might have given many of their fleet an ocean training and that they might be tempted out into midchannel if the war were to break out afresh  but would it break out afresh  we had spent gigantic sums and made enormous exertions to curb the power of napoleon and to prevent him from becoming the universal despot of europe  would the government try it again  or were they appalled by the gigantic load of debt which must bend the backs of many generations unborn pitt was there and surely he was not a man to leave his work half done  and then suddenly there was a bustle at the door  amid the grey swirl of the tobaccosmoke i could catch a glimpse of a blue coat and gold epaulettes with a crowd gathering thickly round them while a hoarse murmur rose from the group which thickened into a deepchested cheer  every one was on his feet peering and asking each other what it might mean  and still the crowd seethed and the cheering swelled  what is it  what has happened cried a score of voices  put him up  hoist him up shouted somebody and an instant later i saw captain troubridge appear above the shoulders of the crowd his face was flushed as if he were in wine and he was waving what seemed to be a letter in the air  the cheering died away and there was such a hush that i could hear the crackle of the paper in his hand  great news gentlemen he roared  glorious news  rearadmiral collingwood has directed me to communicate it to you  the french ambassador has received his papers tonight  every ship on the list is to go into commission  admiral cornwallis is ordered out of cawsand bay to cruise off ushant  a squadron is starting for the north sea and another for the irish channel  he may have had more to say but his audience could wait no longer how they shouted and stamped and raved in their delight  harsh old flagofficers grave postcaptains young lieutenants all were roaring like schoolboys breaking up for the holidays  there was no thought now of those manifold and weary grievances to which i had listened  the foul weather was passed and the landlocked seabirds would be out on the foam once more  the rhythm of god save the king swelled through the babel and i heard the old lines sung in a way that made you forget their bad rhymes and their bald sentiments i trust that you will never hear them so sung with tears upon rugged cheeks and catchings of the breath from strong men  dark days will have come again before you hear such a song or see such a sight as that  let those talk of the phlegm of our countrymen who have never seen them when the lava crust of restraint is broken and when for an instant the strong enduring fires of the north glow upon the surface  i saw them then and if i do not see them now i am not so old or so foolish as to doubt that they are there    chapter xiiilord nelson    my fathers appointment with lord nelson was an early one and he was the more anxious to be punctual as he knew how much the admirals movements must be affected by the news which we had heard the night before  i had hardly breakfasted then and my uncle had not rung for his chocolate when he called for me at jermyn street a walk of a few hundred yards brought us to the high building of discoloured brick in piccadilly which served the hamiltons as a town house and which nelson used as his headquarters when business or pleasure called him from merton  a footman answered our knock and we were ushered into a large drawingroom with sombre furniture and melancholy curtains  my father sent in his name and there we sat looking at the white italian statuettes in the corners and the picture of vesuvius and the bay of naples which hung over the harpsichord  i can remember that a black clock was ticking loudly upon the mantelpiece and that every now and then amid the rumble of the hackney coaches we could hear boisterous laughter from some inner chamber  when at last the door opened both my father and i sprang to our feet expecting to find ourselves face to face with the greatest living englishman  it was a very different person however who swept into the room  she was a lady tall and as it seemed to me exceedingly beautiful though perhaps one who was more experienced and more critical might have thought that her charm lay in the past rather than the present  her queenly figure was moulded upon large and noble lines while her face though already tending to become somewhat heavy and coarse was still remarkable for the brilliancy of the complexion the beauty of the large light blue eyes and the tinge of the dark hair which curled over the low white forehead she carried herself in the most stately fashion so that as i looked at her majestic entrance and at the pose which she struck as she glanced at my father i was reminded of the queen of the peruvians as in the person of miss polly hinton she incited boy jim and myself to insurrection  lieutenant anson stone she asked  yes your ladyship answered my father  ah she cried with an affected and exaggerated start you know me then  i have seen your ladyship at naples  then you have doubtless seen my poor sir william alsomy poor poor sir william  she touched her dress with her white ring covered fingers as if to draw our attention to the fact that she was in the deepest mourning  i heard of your ladyships sad loss said my father  we died together she cried  what can my life be now save a longdrawn living death  she spoke in a beautiful rich voice with the most heartbroken thrill in it but i could not conceal from myself that she appeared to be one of the most robust persons that i had ever seen and i was surprised to notice that she shot arch little questioning glances at me as if the admiration even of so insignificant a person were of some interest to her  my father in his blunt sailor fashion tried to stammer out some commonplace condolence but her eyes swept past his rude weatherbeaten face to ask and reask what effect she had made upon me  there he hangs the tutelary angel of this house she cried pointing with a grand sweeping gesture to a painting upon the wall which represented a very thinfaced highnosed gentleman with several orders upon his coat  but enough of my private sorrow she dashed invisible tears from her eyes  you have come to see lord nelson  he bid me say that he would be with you in an instant you have doubtless heard that hostilities are about to reopen  we heard the news last night  lord nelson is under orders to take command of the mediterranean fleet  you can think at such a momentbut ah is it not his lordships step that i hear  my attention was so riveted by the ladys curious manner and by the gestures and attitudes with which she accompanied every remark that i did not see the great admiral enter the room  when i turned he was standing close by my elbow a small brown man with the lithe slim figure of a boy  he was not clad in uniform but he wore a highcollared brown coat with the right sleeve hanging limp and empty by his side  the expression of his face was as i remember it exceedingly sad and gentle with the deep lines upon it which told of the chafing of his urgent and fiery soul  one eye was disfigured and sightless from a wound but the other looked from my father to myself with the quickest and shrewdest of expressions indeed his whole manner with his short sharp glance and the fine poise of the head spoke of energy and alertness so that he reminded me if i may compare great things with small of a well bred fighting terrier gentle and slim but keen and ready for whatever chance might send  why lieutenant stone said he with great cordiality holding out his left hand to my father i am very glad to see you  london is full of mediterranean men but i trust that in a week there will not be an officer amongst you all with his feet on dry land  i had come to ask you sir if you could assist me to a ship  you shall have one stone if my word goes for anything at the admiralty  i shall want all my old nile men at my back  i cannot promise you a firstrate but at least it shall be a 64gun ship and i can tell you that there is much to be done with a handy well manned wellfound 64gun ship  who could doubt it who has heard of the agamemnon cried lady hamilton and straightway she began to talk of the admiral and of his doings with such extravagance of praise and such a shower of compliments and of epithets that my father and i did not know which way to look feeling shame and sorrow for a man who was compelled to listen to such things said in his own presence  but when i ventured to glance at lord nelson i found to my surprise that far from showing any embarrassment he was smiling with pleasure as if this gross flattery of her ladyships were the dearest thing in all the world to him  come come my dear lady said he you speak vastly beyond my merits upon which encouragement she started again in a theatrical apostrophe to britains darling and neptunes eldest son which he endured with the same signs of gratitude and pleasure  that a man of the world fiveandforty years of age shrewd honest and acquainted with courts should be beguiled by such crude and coarse homage amazed me as it did all who knew him but you who have seen much of life do not need to be told how often the strongest and noblest nature has its one inexplicable weakness showing up the more obviously in contrast to the rest as the dark stain looks the fouler upon the whitest sheet  you are a seaofficer of my own heart stone said he when her ladyship had exhausted her panegyric  you are one of the old breed  he walked up and down the room with little impatient steps as he talked turning with a whisk upon his heel every now and then as if some invisible rail had brought him up  we are getting too fine for our work with these newfangled epaulettes and quarterdeck trimmings  when i joined the service you would find a lieutenant gammoning and rigging his own bowsprit or aloft maybe with a marlinspike slung round his neck showing an example to his men now its as much as hell do to carry his own sextant up the companion  when could you join  tonight my lord  right stone right  that is the true spirit  they are working double tides in the yards but i do not know when the ships will be ready  i hoist my flag on the victory on wednesday and we sail at once  no no not so soon  she cannot be ready for sea said lady hamilton in a wailing voice clasping her hands and turning up her eyes as she spoke  she must and she shall be ready cried nelson with extraordinary vehemence  by heaven if the devil stands at the door i sail on wednesday  who knows what these rascals may be doing in my absence it maddens me to think of the deviltries which they may be devising at this very instant dear lady the queen our queen may be straining her eyes for the topsails of nelsons ships  thinking as i did that he was speaking of our own old queen charlotte i could make no meaning out of this but my father told me afterwards that both nelson and lady hamilton had conceived an extraordinary affection for the queen of naples and that it was the interests of her little kingdom which he had so strenuously at heart  it may have been my expression of bewilderment which attracted nelsons attention to me for he suddenly stopped in his quick quarterdeck walk and looked me up and down with a severe eye  well young gentleman said he sharply  this is my only son sir said my father  it is my wish that he should join the service if a berth can be found for him for we have all been kings officers for many generations  so you wish to come and have your bones broken cried nelson roughly looking with much disfavour at the fine clothes which had cost my uncle and mr brummel such a debate  you will have to change that grand coat for a tarry jacket if you serve under me sir  i was so embarrassed by the abruptness of his manner that i could but stammer out that i hoped i should do my duty on which his stern mouth relaxed into a goodhumoured smile and he laid his little brown hand for an instant upon my shoulder  i dare say that you will do very well said he  i can see that you have the stuff in you  but do not imagine that it is a light service which you undertake young gentleman when you enter his majestys navy  it is a hard profession  you hear of the few who succeed but what do you know of the hundreds who never find their way  look at my own luck  out of 200 who were with me in the san juan expedition 145 died in a single night  i have been in 180 engagements and i have as you see lost my eye and my arm and been sorely wounded besides  it chanced that i came through and here i am flying my admirals flag but i remember many a man as good as me who did not come through  yes he added as her ladyship broke in with a voluble protest many and many as good a man who has gone to the sharks or the landcrabs  but it is a useless sailor who does not risk himself every day and the lives of all of us are in the hands of him who best knows when to claim them  for an instant in his earnest gaze and reverent manner we seemed to catch a glimpse of the deeper truer nelson the man of the eastern counties steeped in the virile puritanism which sent from that district the ironsides to fashion england within and the pilgrim fathers to spread it without  here was the nelson who declared that he saw the hand of god pressing upon the french and who waited on his knees in the cabin of his flagship while she bore down upon the enemys line  there was a human tenderness too in his way of speaking of his dead comrades which made me understand why it was that he was so beloved by all who served with him for ironhard as he was as seaman and fighter there ran through his complex nature a sweet and unenglish power of affectionate emotion showing itself in tears if he were moved and in such tender impulses as led him afterwards to ask his flagcaptain to kiss him as he lay dying in the cockpit of the victory  my father had risen to depart but the admiral with that kindliness which he ever showed to the young and which had been momentarily chilled by the unfortunate splendour of my clothes still paced up and down in front of us shooting out crisp little sentences of exhortation and advice  it is ardour that we need in the service young gentleman said he  we need redhot men who will never rest satisfied  we had them in the mediterranean and we shall have them again  there was a band of brothers  when i was asked to recommend one for special service i told the admiralty they might take the names as they came for the same spirit animated them all  had we taken nineteen vessels we should never have said it was well done while the twentieth sailed the seas  you know how it was with us stone  you are too old a mediterranean man for me to tell you anything  i trust my lord that i shall be with you when next we meet them said my father  meet them we shall and must  by heaven i shall never rest until i have given them a shaking  the scoundrel buonaparte wishes to humble us  let him try and god help the better cause  he spoke with such extraordinary animation that the empty sleeve flapped about in the air giving him the strangest appearance seeing my eyes fixed upon it he turned with a smile to my father  i can still work my fin stone said he putting his hand across to the stump of his arm  what used they to say in the fleet about it  that it was a sign sir that it was a bad hour to cross your hawse  they knew me the rascals  you can see young gentleman that not a scrap of the ardour with which i serve my country has been shot away  some day you may find that you are flying your own flag and when that time comes you may remember that my advice to an officer is that he should have nothing to do with tame slow measures  lay all your stake and if you lose through no fault of your own the country will find you another stake as large  never mind manoeuvres  go for them  the only manoeuvre you need is that which will place you alongside your enemy  always fight and you will always be right  give not a thought to your own ease or your own life for from the day that you draw the blue coat over your back you have no life of your own  it is the countrys to be most freely spent if the smallest gain can come from it  how is the wind this morning stone  eastsoutheast my father answered readily  then cornwallis is doubtless keeping well up to brest though for my own part i had rather tempt them out into the open sea  that is what every officer and man in the fleet would prefer your lordship said my father  they do not love the blockading service and it is little wonder since neither money nor honour is to be gained at it  you can remember how it was in the winter months before toulon stone when we had neither firing wine beef pork nor flour aboard the ships nor a spare piece of rope canvas or twine  we braced the old hulks with our spare cables and god knows there was never a levanter that i did not expect it to send us to the bottom  but we held our grip all the same  yet i fear that we do not get much credit for it here in england stone where they light the windows for a great battle but they do not understand that it is easier for us to fight the nile six times over than to keep our station all winter in the blockade  but i pray god that we may meet this new fleet of theirs and settle the matter by a pellmell battle  may i be with you my lord said my father earnestly  but we have already taken too much of your time and so i beg to thank you for your kindness and to wish you good morning  good morning stone said nelson  you shall have your ship and if i can make this young gentleman one of my officers it shall be done  but i gather from his dress he continued running his eye over me that you have been more fortunate in prizemoney than most of your comrades  for my own part i never did nor could turn my thoughts to moneymaking  my father explained that i had been under the charge of the famous sir charles tregellis who was my uncle and with whom i was now residing  then you need no help from me said nelson with some bitterness if you have either guineas or interest you can climb over the heads of old seaofficers though you may not know the poop from the galley or a carronade from a long nine  neverthelessbut what the deuce have we here  the footman had suddenly precipitated himself into the room but stood abashed before the fierce glare of the admirals eye  your lordship told me to rush to you if it should come he explained holding out a large blue envelope  by heaven it is my orders cried nelson snatching it up and fumbling with it in his awkward onehanded attempt to break the seals  lady hamilton ran to his assistance but no sooner had she glanced at the paper inclosed than she burst into a shrill scream and throwing up her hands and her eyes she sank backwards in a swoon  i could not but observe however that her fall was very carefully executed and that she was fortunate enough in spite of her insensibility to arrange her drapery and attitude into a graceful and classical design  but he the honest seaman so incapable of deceit or affectation that he could not suspect it in others ran madly to the bell shouting for the maid the doctor and the smellingsalts with incoherent words of grief and such passionate terms of emotion that my father thought it more discreet to twitch me by the sleeve as a signal that we should steal from the room  there we left him then in the dimlit london drawingroom beside himself with pity for this shallow and most artificial woman while without at the edge of the piccadilly curb there stood the high dark berline ready to start him upon that long journey which was to end in his chase of the french fleet over seven thousand miles of ocean his meeting with it his victory which confined napoleons ambition for ever to the land and his death coming as i would it might come to all of us at the crowning moment of his life    chapter xivon the road    and now the day of the great fight began to approach  even the imminent outbreak of war and the renewed threats of napoleon were secondary things in the eyes of the sportsmenand the sportsmen in those days made a large half of the population  in the club of the patrician and the plebeian ginshop in the coffeehouse of the merchant or the barrack of the soldier in london or the provinces the same question was interesting the whole nation  every west country coach brought up word of the fine condition of crab wilson who had returned to his own native air for his training and was known to be under the immediate care of captain barclay the expert on the other hand although my uncle had not yet named his man there was no doubt amongst the public that jim was to be his nominee and the report of his physique and of his performance found him many backers  on the whole however the betting was in favour of wilson for bristol and the west country stood by him to a man whilst london opinion was divided  three to two were to be had on wilson at any west end club two days before the battle  i had twice been down to crawley to see jim in his training quarters where i found him undergoing the severe regimen which was usual  from early dawn until nightfall he was running jumping striking a bladder which swung upon a bar or sparring with his formidable trainer  his eyes shone and his skin glowed with exuberent health and he was so confident of success that my own misgivings vanished as i watched his gallant bearing and listened to his quiet and cheerful words  but i wonder that you should come and see me now rodney said he when we parted trying to laugh as he spoke  i have become a bruiser and your uncles paid man whilst you are a corinthian upon town  if you had not been the best and truest little gentleman in the world you would have been my patron instead of my friend before now  when i looked at this splendid fellow with his highbred cleancut face and thought of the fine qualities and gentle generous impulses which i knew to lie within him it seemed so absurd that he should speak as though my friendship towards him were a condescension that i could not help laughing aloud  that is all very well rodney said he looking hard into my eyes but what does your uncle think about it  this was a poser and i could only answer lamely enough that much as i was indebted to my uncle i had known jim first and that i was surely old enough to choose my own friends  jims misgivings were so far correct that my uncle did very strongly object to any intimacy between us but there were so many other points in which he disapproved of my conduct that it made the less difference  i fear that he was already disappointed in me  i would not develop an eccentricity although he was good enough to point out several by which i might come out of the ruck as he expressed it and so catch the attention of the strange world in which he lived  you are an active young fellow nephew said he  do you not think that you could engage to climb round the furniture of an ordinary room without setting foot upon the ground  some little tourdeforce of the sort is in excellent taste  there was a captain in the guards who attained considerable social success by doing it for a small wager  lady lieven who is exceedingly exigeant used to invite him to her evenings merely that he might exhibit it  i had to assure him that the feat would be beyond me  you are just a little difficile said he shrugging his shoulders as my nephew you might have taken your position by perpetuating my own delicacy of taste  if you had made bad taste your enemy the world of fashion would willingly have looked upon you as an arbiter by virtue of your family traditions and you might without a struggle have stepped into the position to which this young upstart brummell aspires  but you have no instinct in that direction  you are incapable of minute attention to detail  look at your shoes look at your cravat  look at your watchchain  two links are enough to show  i have shown three but it was an indiscretion  at this moment i can see no less than five of yours  i regret it nephew but i do not think that you are destined to attain that position which i have a right to expect from my blood relation  i am sorry to be a disappointment to you sir said i  it is your misfortune not to have come under my influence earlier said he  i might then have moulded you so as to have satisfied even my own aspirations  i had a younger brother whose case was a similar one  i did what i could for him but he would wear ribbons in his shoes and he publicly mistook white burgundy for rhine wine eventually the poor fellow took to books and lived and died in a country vicarage  he was a good man but he was commonplace and there is no place in society for commonplace people  then i fear sir that there is none for me said i  but my father has every hope that lord nelson will find me a position in the fleet  if i have been a failure in town i am none the less conscious of your kindness in trying to advance my interests and i hope that should i receive my commission i may be a credit to you yet  it is possible that you may attain the very spot which i had marked out for you but by another road said my uncle  there are many men in town such as lord st vincent lord hood and others who move in the most respectable circles although they have nothing but their services in the navy to recommend them  it was on the afternoon of the day before the fight that this conversation took place between my uncle and myself in the dainty sanctum of his jermynstreet house  he was clad i remember in his flowing brocade dressinggown as was his custom before he set off for his club and his foot was extended upon a stoolfor abernethy had just been in to treat him for an incipient attack of the gout it may have been the pain or it may have been his disappointment at my career but his manner was more testy than was usual with him and i fear that there was something of a sneer in his smile as he spoke of my deficiencies  for my own part i was relieved at the explanation for my father had left london in the full conviction that a vacancy would speedily be found for us both and the one thing which had weighed upon my mind was that i might have found it hard to leave my uncle without interfering with the plans which he had formed  i was heartweary of this empty life for which i was so illfashioned and weary also of that intolerant talk which would make a coterie of frivolous women and foolish fops the central point of the universe  something of my uncles sneer may have flickered upon my lips as i heard him allude with supercilious surprise to the presence in those sacrosanct circles of the men who had stood between the country and destruction  by the way nephew said he gout or no gout and whether abernethy likes it or not we must be down at crawley tonight  the battle will take place upon crawley downs  sir lothian hume and his man are at reigate  i have reserved beds at the george for both of us  the crush will it is said exceed anything ever known  the smell of these country inns is always most offensive to memais que voulezvous  berkeley craven was saying in the club last night that there is not a bed within twenty miles of crawley which is not bespoke and that they are charging three guineas for the night  i hope that your young friend if i must describe him as such will fulfil the promise which he has shown for i have rather more upon the event than i care to lose  sir lothian has been plunging also he made a single byebet of five thousand to three upon wilson in limmers yesterday  from what i hear of his affairs it will be a serious matter for him if we should pull it off  well lorimer  a person to see you sir charles said the new valet  you know that i never see any one until my dressing is complete  he insists upon seeing you sir  he pushed open the door  pushed it open  what dyou mean lorimer  why didnt you put him out  a smile passed over the servants face  at the same moment there came a deep voice from the passage  you show me in this instant young man dye ear  let me see your master or itll be the worse for you  i thought that i had heard the voice before but when over the shoulder of the valet i caught a glimpse of a large fleshy bull face with a flattened michael angelo nose in the centre of it i knew at once that it was my neighbour at the supper party  its warr the prizefighter sir said i  yes sir said our visitor pushing his huge form into the room its bill warr landlord of the one ton publicouse jermyn street and the gamest man upon the list  theres only one thing that ever beat me sir charles and that was my flesh which creeps over me that amazin fast that ive always got four stone that as no business there  why sir ive got enough to spare to make a featherweight champion out of  youd ardly think to look at me that even after mendoza fought me i was able to jump the fourfoot ropes at the ringside just as light as a little kiddy but if i was to chuck my castor into the ring now id never get it till the wind blew it out again for blow my dicky if i could climb after  my respecs to you young sir and i ope i see you well  my uncles face had expressed considerable disgust at this invasion of his privacy but it was part of his position to be on good terms with the fightingmen so he contented himself with asking curtly what business had brought him there  for answer the huge prizefighter looked meaningly at the valet  its important sir charles and between man and man said he  you may go lorimer  now warr what is the matter  the bruiser very calmly seated himself astride of a chair with his arms resting upon the back of it  ive got information sir charles said he  well what is it cried my uncle impatiently  information of value  out with it then  information thats worth money said warr and pursed up his lips  i see  you want to be paid for what you know  the prizefighter smiled an affirmative  well i dont buy things on trust  you should know me better than to try on such a game with me  i know you for what you are sir charles and that is a noble slapup corinthian  but if i was to use this against you dye see it would be worth undreds in my pocket  but my eart wont let me do it for bill warrs always been on the side o good sport and fair play  if i use it for you then i expect that you wont see me the loser  you can do what you like said my uncle  if your news is of service to me i shall know how to treat you  you cant say fairer than that  well let it stand there govnor and youll do the andsome thing as you ave always ad the name for doin  well then your man jim arisen fights crab wilson of gloucester at crawley down tomorrow mornin for a stake  what of that  did you appen to know what the bettin was yesterday  it was three to two on wilson  right you are govnor  three to two was offered in my own bar parlour  dyou know what the bettin is today  i have not been out yet  then ill tell you  its seven to one against your man  what  seven to one govnor no less  youre talking nonsense warr  how could the betting change from three to two to seven to one  ive been to tom owens and ive been to the ole in the wall and ive been to the waggon and orses and you can get seven to one in any of them  theres tons of money being laid against your man its a orse to a en in every sportin ouse and boozin ken from ere to stepney  for a moment the expression upon my uncles face made me realize that this match was really a serious matter to him  then he shrugged his shoulders with an incredulous smile  all the worse for the fools who give the odds said he  my man is all right  you saw him yesterday nephew  he was all right yesterday sir  if anything had gone wrong i should have heard  but perhaps said warr it as not gone wrong with im yet  what dyou mean  ill tell you what i mean sir  you remember berks  you know that e aint to be overmuch depended on at any time and that e ad a grudge against your man cause e laid im out in the coachouse well last night about ten oclock in e comes into my bar and the three bloodiest rogues in london at is eels  there was red ike im that was warned off the ring cause e fought a cross with bittoon and there was fightin yussef who would sell is mother for a sevenshillinbit the third was chris mccarthy who is a foglesnatcher by trade with a pitch outside the aymarket theatre you dont often see four such beauties together and all with as much as they could carry save only chris who is too leary a cove to drink when theres somethin goin forward  for my part i showed em into the parlour not cos they was worthy of it but cos i knew right well they would start bashin some of my customers and maybe get my license into trouble if i left em in the bar  i served em with drink and stayed with em just to see that they didnt lay their ands on the stuffed parroquet and the pictures  well govnor to cut it short they began to talk about the fight and they all laughed at the idea that young jim arrison could win itall except chris and e kept anudging and atwitchin at the others until joe berks nearly gave him a wipe across the face for is trouble  i saw somethin was in the wind and it wasnt very ard to guess what it wasespecially when red ike was ready to put up a fiver that jim arrison would never fight at all  so i up to get another bottle of liptrap and i slipped round to the shutter that we pass the liquor through from the private bar into the parlour  i drew it an inch open and i might ave been at the table with them i could ear every word that clearly  there was chris mccarthy growlin at them for not keepin their tongues still and there was joe berks swearin that e would knock is face in if e dared give im any of is lip  so chris e sort of argued with them for e was frightened of berks and e put it to them whether they would be fit for the job in the mornin and whether the govnor would pay the money if e found they ad been drinkin and were not to be trusted  this struck them sober all three an fighting yussef asked what time they were to start chris said that as long as they were at crawley before the george shut up they could work it  its poor pay for a chance of a rope said red ike  rope be damned cried chris takin a little loaded stick out of his side pocket  if three of you old him down and i break his armbone with this weve earned our money and we dont risk moren six months jug  ell fight said berks  well its the only fight ell get answered chris and that was all i eard of it  this mornin out i went and i found as i told you afore that the money is goin on to wilson by the ton and that no odds are too long for the layers  so it stands govnor and you know what the meanin of it may be better than bill warr can tell you  very good warr said my uncle rising  i am very much obliged to you for telling me this and i will see that you are not a loser by it  i put it down as the gossip of drunken ruffians but none the less you have served me vastly by calling my attention to it  i suppose i shall see you at the downs tomorrow  mr jackson as asked me to be one o the beatersout sir  very good  i hope that we shall have a fair and good fight  good day to you and thank you  my uncle had preserved his jaunty demeanour as long as warr was in the room but the door had hardly closed upon him before he turned to me with a face which was more agitated than i had ever seen it  we must be off for crawley at once nephew said he ringing the bell  theres not a moment to be lost  lorimer order the bays to be harnessed in the curricle  put the toilet things in and tell william to have it round at the door as soon as possible  ill see to it sir said i and away i ran to the mews in little ryder street where my uncle stabled his horses  the groom was away and i had to send a lad in search of him while with the help of the liveryman i dragged the curricle from the coachhouse and brought the two mares out of their stalls  it was half an hour or possibly threequarters before everything had been found and lorimer was already waiting in jermyn street with the inevitable baskets whilst my uncle stood in the open door of his house clad in his long fawncoloured drivingcoat with no sign upon his calm pale face of the tumult of impatience which must i was sure be raging within  we shall leave you lorimer said he  we might find it hard to get a bed for you  keep at her head william  jump in nephew halloa warr what is the matter now  the prizefighter was hastening towards us as fast as his bulk would allow  just one word before you go sir charles he panted  ive just eard in my taproom that the four men i spoke of left for crawley at one oclock  very good warr said my uncle with his foot upon the step  and the odds ave risen to ten to one  let go her head william  just one more word govnor  youll excuse the liberty but if i was you id take my pistols with me  thank you i have them  the long thong cracked between the ears of the leader the groom sprang for the pavement and jermyn street had changed for st jamess and that again for whitehall with a swiftness which showed that the gallant mares were as impatient as their master  it was halfpast four by the parliament clock as we flew on to westminster bridge  there was the flash of water beneath us and then we were between those two long duncoloured lines of houses which had been the avenue which had led us to london  my uncle sat with tightened lips and a brooding brow  we had reached streatham before he broke the silence  i have a good deal at stake nephew said he  so have i sir i answered  you he cried in surprise  my friend sir  ah yes i had forgot  you have some eccentricities after all nephew  you are a faithful friend which is a rare enough thing in our circles  i never had but one friend of my own position and he but youve heard me tell the story  i fear it will be dark before we reach crawley  i fear that it will  in that case we may be too late  pray god not sir  we sit behind the best cattle in england but i fear lest we find the roads blocked before we get to crawley  did you observe nephew that these four villains spoke in warrs hearing of the master who was behind them and who was paying them for their infamy  did you not understand that they were hired to cripple my man  who then could have hired them  who had an interest unless it wasi know sir lothian hume to be a desperate man  i know that he has had heavy card losses at watiers and whites  i know also that he has much at stake upon this event and that he has plunged upon it with a rashness which made his friends think that he had some private reason for being satisfied as to the result  by heaven it all hangs together  if it should be so  he relapsed into silence but i saw the same look of cold fierceness settle upon his features which i had marked there when he and sir john lade had raced wheel to wheel down the godstone road  the sun sank slowly towards the low surrey hills and the shadows crept steadily eastwards but the whirr of the wheels and the roar of the hoofs never slackened  a fresh wind blew upon our faces while the young leaves drooped motionless from the wayside branches the golden edge of the sun was just sinking behind the oaks of reigate hill when the dripping mares drew up before the crown at redhill  the landlord an old sportsman and ringsider ran out to greet so wellknown a corinthian as sir charles tregellis  you know berks the bruiser asked my uncle  yes sir charles  has he passed  yes sir charles  it may have been about four oclock though with this crowd of folk and carriages its hard to swear to it  there was him and red ike and fighting yussef the jew and another with a good bit of blood betwixt the shafts  theyd been driving her hard too for she was all in a lather  thats ugly nephew said my uncle when we were flying onwards towards reigate  if they drove so hard it looks as though they wished to get early to work  jim and belcher would surely be a match for the four of them i suggested  if belcher were with him i should have no fear  but you cannot tell what diablerie they may be up to  let us only find him safe and sound and ill never lose sight of him until i see him in the ring  well sit up on guard with our pistols nephew and i only trust that these villains may be indiscreet enough to attempt it but they must have been very sure of success before they put the odds up to such a figure and it is that which alarms me  but surely they have nothing to win by such villainy sir  if they were to hurt jim harrison the battle could not be fought and the bets would not be decided  so it would be in an ordinary prizebattle nephew and it is fortunate that it should be so or the rascals who infest the ring would soon make all sport impossible  but here it is different  on the terms of the wager i lose unless i can produce a man within the prescribed ages who can beat crab wilson  you must remember that i have never named my man  cest dommage but so it is  we know who it is and so do our opponents but the referees and stakeholder would take no notice of that  if we complain that jim harrison has been crippled they would answer that they have no official knowledge that jim harrison was our nominee  its play or pay and the villains are taking advantage of it  my uncles fears as to our being blocked upon the road were only too well founded for after we passed reigate there was such a procession of every sort of vehicle that i believe for the whole eight miles there was not a horse whose nose was further than a few feet from the back of the curricle or barouche in front  every road leading from london as well as those from guildford in the west and tunbridge in the east had contributed their stream of fourin hands gigs and mounted sportsmen until the whole broad brighton highway was choked from ditch to ditch with a laughing singing shouting throng all flowing in the same direction  no man who looked upon that motley crowd could deny that for good or evil the love of the ring was confined to no class but was a national peculiarity deeply seated in the english nature and a common heritage of the young aristocrat in his drag and of the rough costers sitting six deep in their pony cart  there i saw statesmen and soldiers noblemen and lawyers farmers and squires with roughs of the east end and yokels of the shires all toiling along with the prospect of a night of discomfort before them on the chance of seeing a fight which might for all that they knew be decided in a single round  a more cheery and hearty set of people could not be imagined and the chaff flew about as thick as the dust clouds while at every wayside inn the landlord and the drawers would be out with trays of foamheaded tankards to moisten those importunate throats  the aledrinking the rude goodfellowship the heartiness the laughter at discomforts the craving to see the fightall these may be set down as vulgar and trivial by those to whom they are distasteful but to me listening to the faroff and uncertain echoes of our distant past they seem to have been the very bones upon which much that is most solid and virile in this ancient race was moulded  but alas for our chance of hastening onwards  even my uncles skill could not pick a passage through that moving mass  we could but fall into our places and be content to snail along from reigate to horley and on to povey cross and over lowfield heath while day shaded away into twilight and that deepened into night  at kimberham bridge the carriagelamps were all lit and it was wonderful where the road curved downwards before us to see this writhing serpent with the golden scales crawling before us in the darkness  and then at last we saw the formless mass of the huge crawley elm looming before us in the gloom and there was the broad village street with the glimmer of the cottage windows and the high front of the old george inn glowing from every door and pane and crevice in honour of the noble company who were to sleep within that night    chapter xvfoul play    my uncles impatience would not suffer him to wait for the slow rotation which would bring us to the door but he flung the reins and a crownpiece to one of the rough fellows who thronged the side walk and pushing his way vigorously through the crowd he made for the entrance  as he came within the circle of light thrown by the windows a whisper ran round as to who this masterful gentleman with the pale face and the drivingcoat might be and a lane was formed to admit us  i had never before understood the popularity of my uncle in the sporting world for the folk began to huzza as we passed with cries of hurrah for buck tregellis  good luck to you and your man sir charles  clear a path for a bangup noble corinthian whilst the landlord attracted by the shouting came running out to greet us  good evening sir charles he cried  i hope i see you well sir and i trust that you will find that your man does credit to the george  how is he asked my uncle quickly  never better sir  looks a picture he doesand fit to fight for a kingdom  my uncle gave a sigh of relief  where is he he asked  hes gone to his room early sir seein that he had some very particlar business tomorrow mornin said the landlord grinning  where is belcher  here he is in the bar parlour  he opened a door as he spoke and looking in we saw a score of well dressed men some of whose faces had become familiar to me during my short west end career seated round a table upon which stood a steaming souptureen filled with punch  at the further end very much at his ease amongst the aristocrats and exquisites who surrounded him sat the champion of england his superb figure thrown back in his chair a flush upon his handsome face and a loose red handkerchief knotted carelessly round his throat in the picturesque fashion which was long known by his name  half a century has passed since then and i have seen my share of fine men perhaps it is because i am a slight creature myself but it is my peculiarity that i had rather look upon a splendid man than upon any work of nature  yet during all that time i have never seen a finer man than jim belcher and if i wish to match him in my memory i can only turn to that other jim whose fate and fortunes i am trying to lay before you  there was a shout of jovial greeting when my uncles face was seen in the doorway  come in tregellis  we were expecting you  theres a devilled bladebone ordered  whats the latest from london  what is the meaning of the long odds against your man  have the folk gone mad  what the devil is it all about  they were all talking at once  excuse me gentlemen my uncle answered  i shall be happy to give you any information in my power a little later  i have a matter of some slight importance to decide  belcher i would have a word with you  the champion came out with us into the passage  where is your man belcher  he has gone to his room sir  i believe that he should have a clear twelve hours sleep before fighting  what sort of day has he had  i did him lightly in the matter of exercise  clubs dumbbells walking and a halfhour with the mufflers  hell do us all proud sir or im a dutchman  but what in the worlds amiss with the betting  if i didnt know that he was as straight as a line id ha thought he was planning a cross and laying against himself  its about that ive hurried down  i have good information belcher that there has been a plot to cripple him and that the rogues are so sure of success that they are prepared to lay anything against his appearance  belcher whistled between his teeth  ive seen no sign of anything of the kind sir  no one has been near him or had speech with him except only your nephew there and myself  four villains with berks at their head got the start of us by several hours  it was warr who told me  what bill warr says is straight and what joe berks does is crooked  who were the others sir  red ike fighting yussef and chris mccarthy  a pretty gang too  well sir the lad is safe but it would be as well perhaps for one or other of us to stay in his room with him for my own part as long as hes my charge im never very far away  it is a pity to wake him  he can hardly be asleep with all this racket in the house  this way sir and down the passage  we passed along the lowroofed devious corridors of the old fashioned inn to the back of the house  this is my room sir said belcher nodding to a door upon the right  this one upon the left is his  he threw it open as he spoke  heres sir charles tregellis come to see you jim said he and then good lord what is the meaning of this  the little chamber lay before us brightly illuminated by a brass lamp which stood upon the table  the bedclothes had not been turned down but there was an indentation upon the counterpane which showed that some one had lain there  onehalf of the lattice window was swinging on its hinge and a cloth cap lying upon the table was the only sign of the occupant  my uncle looked round him and shook his head  it seems that we are too late said he  thats his cap sir  where in the world can he have gone to with his head bare  i thought he was safe in his bed an hour ago  jim jim he shouted  he has certainly gone through the window cried my uncle  i believe these villains have enticed him out by some devilish device of their own  hold the lamp nephew  ha  i thought so  here are his footmarks upon the flowerbed outside  the landlord and one or two of the corinthians from the bar parlour had followed us to the back of the house  some one had opened the side door and we found ourselves in the kitchen garden where clustering upon the gravel path we were able to hold the lamp over the soft newly turned earth which lay between us and the window  thats his footmark said belcher  he wore his running boots this evening and you can see the nails  but whats this  some one else has been here  a woman i cried  by heaven youre right nephew said my uncle  belcher gave a hearty curse  he never had a word to say to any girl in the village  i took particlar notice of that  and to think of them coming in like this at the last moment  its clear as possible tregellis said the hon berkeley craven who was one of the company from the barparlour  whoever it was came outside the window and tapped  you see here and here the small feet have their toes to the house while the others are all leading away  she came to summon him and he followed her  that is perfectly certain said my uncle  theres not a moment to be lost  we must divide and search in different directions unless we can get some clue as to where they have gone  theres only the one path out of the garden cried the landlord leading the way  it opens out into this back lane which leads up to the stables  the other end of the lane goes out into the side road  the bright yellow glare from a stable lantern cut a ring suddenly from the darkness and an ostler came lounging out of the yard  whos that cried the landlord  its me master  bill shields  how long have you been there bill  well master ive been in an out of the stables this hour back we cant pack in another orse and theres no use tryin  i darent ardly give them their feed for if they was to thicken out just ever so little  see here bill  be careful how you answer for a mistake may cost you your place  have you seen any one pass down the lane  there was a feller in a rabbitskin cap some time ago  e was loiterin about until i asked im what is business was for i didnt care about the looks of im or the way that e was peepin in at the windows  i turned the stable lantern on to im but e ducked is face an i could only swear to is red ead  i cast a quick glance at my uncle and i saw that the shadow had deepened upon his face  what became of him he asked  e slouched away sir an i saw the last of im  youve seen no one else  you didnt for example see a woman and a man pass down the lane together  no sir  or hear anything unusual  why now that you mention it sir i did ear somethin but on a night like this when all these london blades are in the village  what was it then cried my uncle impatiently  well sir it was a kind of a cry out yonder as if some one ad got imself into trouble  i thought maybe two sparks were fightin and i took no particlar notice  where did it come from  from the side road yonder  was it distant  no sir i should say it didnt come from moren two hundred yards  a single cry  well it was a kind of screech sir and then i eard somebody drivin very ard down the road  i remember thinking that it was strange that any one should be driving away from crawley on a great night like this  my uncle seized the lantern from the fellows hand and we all trooped behind him down the lane  at the further end the road cut it across at right angles  down this my uncle hastened but his search was not a long one for the glaring light fell suddenly upon something which brought a groan to my lips and a bitter curse to those of jem belcher  along the white surface of the dusty highway there was drawn a long smear of crimson while beside this ominous stain there lay a murderous little pocketbludgeon such as warr had described in the morning    chapter xvicrawley downs    all through that weary night my uncle and i with belcher berkeley craven and a dozen of the corinthians searched the country side for some trace of our missing man but save for that illboding splash upon the road not the slightest clue could be obtained as to what had befallen him  no one had seen or heard anything of him and the single cry in the night of which the ostler told us was the only indication of the tragedy which had taken place  in small parties we scoured the country as far as east grinstead and bletchingley and the sun had been long over the horizon before we found ourselves back at crawley once more with heavy hearts and tired feet  my uncle who had driven to reigate in the hope of gaining some intelligence did not return until past seven oclock and a glance at his face gave us the same black news which he gathered from ours  we held a council round our dismal breakfasttable to which mr berkeley craven was invited as a man of sound wisdom and large experience in matters of sport  belcher was half frenzied by this sudden ending of all the pains which he had taken in the training and could only rave out threats at berks and his companions with terrible menaces as to what he would do when he met them  my uncle sat grave and thoughtful eating nothing and drumming his fingers upon the table while my heart was heavy within me and i could have sunk my face into my hands and burst into tears as i thought how powerless i was to aid my friend  mr craven a freshfaced alert man of the world was the only one of us who seemed to preserve both his wits and his appetite  let me see  the fight was to be at ten was it not he asked  it was to be  i dare say it will be too  never say die tregellis  your man has still three hours in which to come back  my uncle shook his head  the villains have done their work too well for that i fear said he  well now let us reason it out said berkeley craven  a woman comes and she coaxes this young man out of his room  do you know any young woman who had an influence over him  my uncle looked at me  no said i  i know of none  well we know that she came said berkeley craven  there can be no question as to that  she brought some piteous tale no doubt such as a gallant young man could hardly refuse to listen to  he fell into the trap and allowed himself to be decoyed to the place where these rascals were waiting for him  we may take all that as proved i should fancy tregellis  i see no better explanation said my uncle  well then it is obviously not the interest of these men to kill him  warr heard them say as much  they could not make sure perhaps of doing so tough a young fellow an injury which would certainly prevent him from fighting  even with a broken arm he might pull the fight off as men have done before  there was too much money on for them to run any risks  they gave him a tap on the head therefore to prevent his making too much resistance and they then drove him off to some farmhouse or stable where they will hold him a prisoner until the time for the fight is over  i warrant that you see him before tonight as well as ever he was  this theory sounded so reasonable that it seemed to lift a little of the weight from my heart but i could see that from my uncles point of view it was a poor consolation  i dare say you are right craven said he  i am sure that i am  but it wont help us to win the fight  thats the point sir cried belcher  by the lord i wish theyd let me take his place even with my left arm strapped behind me  i should advise you in any case to go to the ringside said craven  you should hold on until the last moment in the hope of your man turning up  i shall certainly do so  and i shall protest against paying the wagers under such circumstances  craven shrugged his shoulders  you remember the conditions of the match said he  i fear it is pay or play  no doubt the point might be submitted to the referees but i cannot doubt that they would have to give it against you  we had sunk into a melancholy silence when suddenly belcher sprang up from the table  hark he cried  listen to that  what is it we cried all three  the betting  listen again  out of the babel of voices and roaring of wheels outside the window a single sentence struck sharply on our ears  even money upon sir charless nominee  even money cried my uncle  it was seven to one against me yesterday  what is the meaning of this  even money either way cried the voice again  theres somebody knows something said belcher and theres nobody has a better right to know what it is than we  come on sir and well get to the bottom of it  the village street was packed with people for they had been sleeping twelve and fifteen in a room whilst hundreds of gentlemen had spent the night in their carriages  so thick was the throng that it was no easy matter to get out of the george  a drunken man snoring horribly in his breathing was curled up in the passage absolutely oblivious to the stream of people who flowed round and occasionally over him  whats the betting boys asked belcher from the steps  even money jim cried several voices  it was long odds on wilson when last i heard  yes but there came a man who laid freely the other way and he started others taking the odds until now you can get even money  who started it  why thats he  the man that lies drunk in the passage  hes been pouring it down like water ever since he drove in at six oclock so its no wonder hes like that  belcher stooped down and turned over the mans inert head so as to show his features  hes a stranger to me sir  and to me added my uncle  but not to me i cried  its john cumming the landlord of the inn at friars oak  ive known him ever since i was a boy and i cant be mistaken  well what the devil can he know about it said craven  nothing at all in all probability answered my uncle  he is backing young jim because he knows him and because he has more brandy than sense  his drunken confidence set others to do the same and so the odds came down  he was as sober as a judge when he drove in here this morning said the landlord  he began backing sir charless nominee from the moment he arrived  some of the other boys took the office from him and they very soon brought the odds down amongst them  i wish he had not brought himself down as well said my uncle  i beg that you will bring me a little lavender water landlord for the smell of this crowd is appalling  i suppose you could not get any sense from this drunken fellow nephew or find out what it is he knows  it was in vain that i rocked him by the shoulder and shouted his name in his ear  nothing could break in upon that serene intoxication  well its a unique situation as far as my experience goes said berkeley craven  here we are within a couple of hours of the fight and yet you dont know whether you have a man to represent you  i hope you dont stand to lose very much tregellis  my uncle shrugged his shoulders carelessly and took a pinch of his snuff with that inimitable sweeping gesture which no man has ever ventured to imitate  pretty well my boy said he  but it is time that we thought of going up to the downs  this night journey has left me just a little effleure and i should like half an hour of privacy to arrange my toilet  if this is my last kick it shall at least be with a well brushed boot  i have heard a traveller from the wilds of america say that he looked upon the red indian and the english gentleman as closely akin citing the passion for sport the aloofness and the suppression of the emotions in each  i thought of his words as i watched my uncle that morning for i believe that no victim tied to the stake could have had a worse outlook before him  it was not merely that his own fortunes were largely at stake but it was the dreadful position in which he would stand before this immense concourse of people many of whom had put their money upon his judgment if he should find himself at the last moment with an impotent excuse instead of a champion to put before them  what a situation for a man who prided himself upon his aplomb and upon bringing all that he undertook to the very highest standard of success  i who knew him well could tell from his wan cheeks and his restless fingers that he was at his wits ends what to do but no stranger who observed his jaunty bearing the flecking of his laced handkerchief the handling of his quizzing glass or the shooting of his ruffles would ever have thought that this butterfly creature could have had a care upon earth  it was close upon nine oclock when we were ready to start for the downs and by that time my uncles curricle was almost the only vehicle left in the village street  the night before they had lain with their wheels interlocking and their shafts under each others bodies as thick as they could fit from the old church to the crawley elm spanning the road fivedeep for a good halfmile in length  now the grey village street lay before us almost deserted save by a few women and children  men horses carriagesall were gone  my uncle drew on his drivinggloves and arranged his costume with punctilious neatness but i observed that he glanced up and down the road with a haggard and yet expectant eye before he took his seat  i sat behind with belcher while the hon berkeley craven took the place beside him  the road from crawley curves gently upwards to the upland heather clad plateau which extends for many miles in every direction strings of pedestrians most of them so weary and dustcovered that it was evident that they had walked the thirty miles from london during the night were plodding along by the sides of the road or trailing over the long mottled slopes of the moorland  a horseman fantastically dressed in green and splendidly mounted was waiting at the crossroads and as he spurred towards us i recognised the dark handsome face and bold black eyes of mendoza  i am waiting here to give the office sir charles said he  its down the grinstead road half a mile to the left  very good said my uncle reining his mares round into the cross road  you havent got your man there remarked mendoza with something of suspicion in his manner  what the devil is that to you cried belcher furiously  its a good deal to all of us for there are some funny stories about  you keep them to yourself then or you may wish you had never heard them  all right jem  your breakfast dont seem to have agreed with you this morning  have the others arrived asked my uncle carelessly  not yet sir charles  but tom oliver is there with the ropes and stakes  jackson drove by just now and most of the ringkeepers are up  we have still an hour remarked my uncle as he drove on  it is possible that the others may be late since they have to come from reigate  you take it like a man tregellis said craven  we must keep a bold face and brazen it out until the last moment  of course sir cried belcher  ill never believe the betting would rise like that if somebody didnt know something  well hold on by our teeth and nails sir charles and see what comes of it  we could hear a sound like the waves upon the beach long before we came in sight of that mighty multitude and then at last on a sudden dip of the road we saw it lying before us a whirlpool of humanity with an open vortex in the centre  all round the thousands of carriages and horses were dotted over the moor and the slopes were gay with tents and booths  a spot had been chosen for the ring where a great basin had been hollowed out in the ground so that all round that natural amphitheatre a crowd of thirty thousand people could see very well what was going on in the centre as we drove up a buzz of greeting came from the people upon the fringe which was nearest to us spreading and spreading until the whole multitude had joined in the acclamation  then an instant later a second shout broke forth beginning from the other side of the arena and the faces which had been turned towards us whisked round so that in a twinkling the whole foreground changed from white to dark  its they  they are in time said my uncle and craven together  standing up on our curricle we could see the cavalcade approaching over the downs  in front came a huge yellow barouche in which sat sir lothian hume crab wilson and captain barclay his trainer the postillions were flying canaryyellow ribands from their caps those being the colours under which wilson was to fight  behind the carriage there rode a hundred or more noblemen and gentlemen of the west country and then a line of gigs tilburies and carriages wound away down the grinstead road as far as our eyes could follow it  the big barouche came lumbering over the sward in our direction until sir lothian hume caught sight of us when he shouted to his postillions to pull up  good morning sir charles said he springing out of the carriage i thought i knew your scarlet curricle  we have an excellent morning for the battle  my uncle bowed coldly and made no answer  i suppose that since we are all here we may begin at once said sir lothian taking no notice of the others manner  we begin at ten oclock  not an instant before  very good if you prefer it  by the way sir charles where is your man  i would ask you that question sir lothian answered my uncle where is my man  a look of astonishment passed over sir lothians features which if it were not real was most admirably affected  what do you mean by asking me such a question  because i wish to know  but how can i tell and what business is it of mine  i have reason to believe that you have made it your business  if you would kindly put the matter a little more clearly there would be some possibility of my understanding you  they were both very white and cold formal and unimpassioned in their bearing but exchanging glances which crossed like rapier blades  i thought of sir lothians murderous repute as a duellist and i trembled for my uncle  now sir if you imagine that you have a grievance against me you will oblige me vastly by putting it into words  i will said my uncle  there has been a conspiracy to maim or kidnap my man and i have every reason to believe that you are privy to it  an ugly sneer came over sir lothians saturnine face  i see said he  your man has not come on quite as well as you had expected in his training and you are hard put to it to invent an excuse  still i should have thought that you might have found a more probable one and one which would entail less serious consequences  sir answered my uncle you are a liar but how great a liar you are nobody knows save yourself  sir lothians hollow cheeks grew white with passion and i saw for an instant in his deepset eyes such a glare as comes from the frenzied hound rearing and ramping at the end of its chain  then with an effort he became the same cold hard selfcontained man as ever  it does not become our position to quarrel like two yokels at a fair said he we shall go further into the matter afterwards  i promise you that we shall answered my uncle grimly  meanwhile i hold you to the terms of your wager  unless you produce your nominee within fiveandtwenty minutes i claim the match  eightandtwenty minutes said my uncle looking at his watch you may claim it then but not an instant before  he was admirable at that moment for his manner was that of a man with all sorts of hidden resources so that i could hardly make myself realize as i looked at him that our position was really as desperate as i knew it to be  in the meantime berkeley craven who had been exchanging a few words with sir lothian hume came back to our side  i have been asked to be sole referee in this matter said he does that meet with your wishes sir charles  i should be vastly obliged to you craven if you will undertake the duties  and jackson has been suggested as timekeeper  i could not wish a better one  very good  that is settled  in the meantime the last of the carriages had come up and the horses had all been picketed upon the moor  the stragglers who had dotted the grass had closed in until the huge crowd was one unit with a single mighty voice which was already beginning to bellow its impatience  looking round there was hardly a moving object upon the whole vast expanse of green and purple down  a belated gig was coming at full gallop down the road which led from the south and a few pedestrians were still trailing up from crawley but nowhere was there a sign of the missing man  the betting keeps up for all that said belcher  ive just been to the ringside and it is still even  theres a place for you at the outer ropes sir charles said craven  there is no sign of my man yet  i wont come in until he arrives  it is my duty to tell you that only ten minutes are left  i make it five cried sir lothian hume  that is a question which lies with the referee said craven firmly  my watch makes it ten minutes and ten it must be  heres crab wilson cried belcher and at the same moment a shout like a thunderclap burst from the crowd  the west countryman had emerged from his dressingtent followed by dutch sam and tom owen who were acting as his seconds  he was nude to the waist with a pair of white calico drawers white silk stockings and running shoes  round his middle was a canaryyellow sash and dainty little ribbons of the same colour fluttered from the sides of his knees he carried a high white hat in his hand and running down the lane which had been kept open through the crowd to allow persons to reach the ring he threw the hat high into the air so that it fell within the staked inclosure  then with a double spring he cleared the outer and inner line of rope and stood with his arms folded in the centre  i do not wonder that the people cheered  even belcher could not help joining in the general shout of applause  he was certainly a splendidly built young athlete and one could not have wished to look upon a finer sight as his white skin sleek and luminous as a panthers gleamed in the light of the morning sun with a beautiful liquid rippling of muscles at every movement  his arms were long and slingy his shoulders loose and yet powerful with the downward slant which is a surer index of power than squareness can be  he clasped his hands behind his head threw them aloft and swung them backwards and at every movement some fresh expanse of his smooth white skin became knobbed and gnarled with muscles whilst a yell of admiration and delight from the crowd greeted each fresh exhibition then folding his arms once more he stood like a beautiful statue waiting for his antagonist  sir lothian hume had been looking impatiently at his watch and now he shut it with a triumphant snap  times up he cried  the match is forfeit  time is not up said craven  i have still five minutes  my uncle looked round with despairing eyes  only three tregellis  a deep angry murmur was rising from the crowd  its a cross  its a cross  its a fake was the cry  two minutes tregellis  wheres your man sir charles  wheres the man that we have backed  flushed faces began to crane over each other and angry eyes glared up at us  one more minute tregellis  i am very sorry but it will be my duty to declare it forfeit against you  there was a sudden swirl in the crowd a rush a shout and high up in the air there spun an old black hat floating over the heads of the ringsiders and flickering down within the ropes  saved by the lord screamed belcher  i rather fancy said my uncle calmly that this must be my man  too late cried sir lothian  no answered the referee  it was still twenty seconds to the hour  the fight will now proceed    chapter xviithe ringside    out of the whole of that vast multitude i was one of the very few who had observed whence it was that this black hat skimming so opportunely over the ropes had come  i have already remarked that when we looked around us there had been a single gig travelling very rapidly upon the southern road  my uncles eyes had rested upon it but his attention had been drawn away by the discussion between sir lothian hume and the referee upon the question of time  for my own part i had been so struck by the furious manner in which these belated travellers were approaching that i had continued to watch them with all sorts of vague hopes within me which i did not dare to put into words for fear of adding to my uncles disappointments i had just made out that the gig contained a man and a woman when suddenly i saw it swerve off the road and come with a galloping horse and bounding wheels right across the moor crashing through the gorse bushes and sinking down to the hubs in the heather and bracken  as the driver pulled up his foamspattered horse he threw the reins to his companion sprang from his seat butted furiously into the crowd and then an instant afterwards up went the hat which told of his challenge and defiance  there is no hurry now i presume craven said my uncle as coolly as if this sudden effect had been carefully devised by him  now that your man has his hat in the ring you can take as much time as you like sir charles  your friend has certainly cut it rather fine nephew  it is not jim sir i whispered  it is some one else  my uncles eyebrows betrayed his astonishment  some one else he ejaculated  and a good man too roared belcher slapping his thigh with a crack like a pistolshot  why blow my dickey if it aint old jack harrison himself  looking down at the crowd we had seen the head and shoulders of a powerful and strenuous man moving slowly forward and leaving behind him a long vshaped ripple upon its surface like the wake of a swimming dog  now as he pushed his way through the looser fringe the head was raised and there was the grinning hardy face of the smith looking up at us  he had left his hat in the ring and was enveloped in an overcoat with a blue birdseye handkerchief tied round his neck  as he emerged from the throng he let his greatcoat fly loose and showed that he was dressed in his full fighting kit black drawers chocolate stockings and white shoes  im right sorry to be so late sir charles he cried  id have been sooner but it took me a little time to make it all straight with the missus  i couldnt convince her all at once an so i brought her with me and we argued it out on the way  looking at the gig i saw that it was indeed mrs harrison who was seated in it  sir charles beckoned him up to the wheel of the curricle  what in the world brings you here harrison he whispered  i am as glad to see you as ever i was to see a man in my life but i confess that i did not expect you  well sir you heard i was coming said the smith  indeed i did not  didnt you get a message sir charles from a man named cumming landlord of the friars oak inn  mister rodney there would know him  we saw him dead drunk at the george  there now if i wasnt afraid of it cried harrison angrily hes always like that when hes excited and i never saw a man more off his head than he was when he heard i was going to take this job over  he brought a bag of sovereigns up with him to back me with  thats how the betting got turned said my uncle  he found others to follow his lead it appears  i was so afraid that he might get upon the drink that i made him promise to go straight to you sir the very instant he should arrive  he had a note to deliver  i understand that he reached the george at six whilst i did not return from reigate until after seven by which time i have no doubt that he had drunk his message to me out of his head  but where is your nephew jim and how did you come to know that you would be needed  it is not his fault i promise you that you should be left in the lurch  as to me i had my orders to take his place from the only man upon earth whose word i have never disobeyed  yes sir charles said mrs harrison who had left the gig and approached us  you can make the most of it this time for never again shall you have my jacknot if you were to go on your knees for him  shes not a patron of sport and thats a fact said the smith  sport she cried with shrill contempt and anger  tell me when all is over  she hurried away and i saw her afterwards seated amongst the bracken her back turned towards the multitude and her hands over her ears cowering and wincing in an agony of apprehension  whilst this hurried scene had been taking place the crowd had become more and more tumultuous partly from their impatience at the delay and partly from their exuberant spirits at the unexpected chance of seeing so celebrated a fighting man as harrison  his identity had already been noised abroad and many an elderly connoisseur plucked his long netpurse out of his fob in order to put a few guineas upon the man who would represent the school of the past against the present  the younger men were still in favour of the westcountryman and small odds were to be had either way in proportion to the number of the supporters of each in the different parts of the crowd  in the mean time sir lothian hume had come bustling up to the honourable berkeley craven who was still standing near our curricle  i beg to lodge a formal protest against these proceedings said he  on what grounds sir  because the man produced is not the original nominee of sir charles tregellis  i never named one as you are well aware said my uncle  the betting has all been upon the understanding that young jim harrison was my mans opponent  now at the last moment he is withdrawn and another and more formidable man put into his place  sir charles tregellis is quite within his rights said craven firmly  he undertook to produce a man who should be within the age limits stipulated and i understand that harrison fulfils all the conditions  you are over fiveandthirty harrison  fortyone next month master  very good  i direct that the fight proceed  but alas there was one authority which was higher even than that of the referee and we were destined to an experience which was the prelude and sometimes the conclusion also of many an oldtime fight  across the moor there had ridden a blackcoated gentleman with bufftopped huntingboots and a couple of grooms behind him the little knot of horsemen showing up clearly upon the curving swells and then dipping down into the alternate hollows  some of the more observant of the crowd had glanced suspiciously at this advancing figure but the majority had not observed him at all until he reined up his horse upon a knoll which overlooked the amphitheatre and in a stentorian voice announced that he represented the custos rotulorum of his majestys county of sussex that he proclaimed this assembly to be gathered together for an illegal purpose and that he was commissioned to disperse it by force if necessary  never before had i understood that deepseated fear and wholesome respect which many centuries of bludgeoning at the hands of the law had beaten into the fierce and turbulent natives of these islands here was a man with two attendants upon one side and on the other thirty thousand very angry and disappointed people many of them fighters by profession and some from the roughest and most dangerous classes in the country  and yet it was the single man who appealed confidently to force whilst the huge multitude swayed and murmured like a mutinous fiercewilled creature brought face to face with a power against which it knew that there was neither argument nor resistance  my uncle however with berkeley craven sir john lade and a dozen other lords and gentlemen hurried across to the interrupter of the sport  i presume that you have a warrant sir said craven  yes sir i have a warrant  then i have a legal right to inspect it  the magistrate handed him a blue paper which the little knot of gentlemen clustered their heads over for they were mostly magistrates themselves and were keenly alive to any possible flaw in the wording  at last craven shrugged his shoulders and handed it back  this seems to be correct sir said he  it is entirely correct answered the magistrate affably  to prevent waste of your valuable time gentlemen i may say once for all that it is my unalterable determination that no fight shall under any circumstances be brought off in the county over which i have control and i am prepared to follow you all day in order to prevent it  to my inexperience this appeared to bring the whole matter to a conclusion but i had underrated the foresight of those who arrange these affairs and also the advantages which made crawley down so favourite a rendezvous  there was a hurried consultation between the principals the backers the referee and the timekeeper  its seven miles to hampshire border and about two to surrey said jackson  the famous master of the ring was clad in honour of the occasion in a most resplendent scarlet coat worked in gold at the buttonholes a white stock a looped hat with a broad black band buff kneebreeches white silk stockings and paste bucklesa costume which did justice to his magnificent figure and especially to those famous balustrade calves which had helped him to be the finest runner and jumper as well as the most formidable pugilist in england  his hard highboned face large piercing eyes and immense physique made him a fitting leader for that rough and tumultuous body who had named him as their commanderinchief  if i might venture to offer you a word of advice said the affable official it would be to make for the hampshire line for sir james ford on the surrey border has as great an objection to such assemblies as i have whilst mr merridew of long hall who is the hampshire magistrate has fewer scruples upon the point  sir said my uncle raising his hat in his most impressive manner i am infinitely obliged to you  with the referees permission there is nothing for it but to shift the stakes  in an instant a scene of the wildest animation had set in  tom owen and his assistant fogo with the help of the ringkeepers plucked up the stakes and ropes and carried them off across country  crab wilson was enveloped in great coats and borne away in the barouche whilst champion harrison took mr cravens place in our curricle then off the huge crowd started horsemen vehicles and pedestrians rolling slowly over the broad face of the moorland the carriages rocked and pitched like boats in a seaway as they lumbered along fifty abreast scrambling and lurching over everything which came in their way  sometimes with a snap and a thud one axle would come to the ground whilst a wheel reeled off amidst the tussocks of heather and roars of delight greeted the owners as they looked ruefully at the ruin  then as the gorse clumps grew thinner and the sward more level those on foot began to run the riders struck in their spurs the drivers cracked their whips and away they all streamed in the maddest wildest cross country steeplechase the yellow barouche and the crimson curricle which held the two champions leading the van  what do you think of your chances harrison i heard my uncle ask as the two mares picked their way over the broken ground  its my last fight sir charles said the smith  you heard the missus say that if she let me off this time i was never to ask again  i must try and make it a good one  but your training  im always in training sir  i work hard from morning to night and i drink little else than water  i dont think that captain barclay can do much better with all his rules  hes rather long in the reach for you  ive fought and beat them that were longer  if it comes to a rally i should hold my own and i should have the better of him at a throw  its a match of youth against experience  well i would not hedge a guinea of my money  but unless he was acting under force i cannot forgive young jim for having deserted me  he was acting under force sir charles  you have seen him then  no master i have not seen him  you know where he is  well it is not for me to say one way or the other  i can only tell you that he could not help himself  but heres the beak a comin for us again  the ominous figure galloped up once more alongside of our curricle but this time his mission was a more amiable one  my jurisdiction ends at that ditch sir said he  i should fancy that you could hardly wish a better place for a mill than the sloping field beyond  i am quite sure that no one will interfere with you there  his anxiety that the fight should be brought off was in such contrast to the zeal with which he had chased us from his county that my uncle could not help remarking upon it  it is not for a magistrate to wink at the breaking of the law sir he answered  but if my colleague of hampshire has no scruples about its being brought off within his jurisdiction i should very much like to see the fight with which he spurred his horse up an adjacent knoll from which he thought that he might gain the best view of the proceedings  and now i had a view of all those points of etiquette and curious survivals of custom which are so recent that we have not yet appreciated that they may some day be as interesting to the social historian as they then were to the sportsman  a dignity was given to the contest by a rigid code of ceremony just as the clash of mailclad knights was prefaced and adorned by the calling of the heralds and the showing of blazoned shields  to many in those ancient days the tourney may have seemed a bloody and brutal ordeal but we who look at it with ample perspective see that it was a rude but gallant preparation for the conditions of life in an iron age and so also when the ring has become as extinct as the lists we may understand that a broader philosophy would show that all things which spring up so naturally and spontaneously have a function to fulfil and that it is a less evil that two men should of their own free will fight until they can fight no more than that the standard of hardihood and endurance should run the slightest risk of being lowered in a nation which depends so largely upon the individual qualities of her citizens for her defence  do away with war if the cursed thing can by any wit of man be avoided but until you see your way to that have a care in meddling with those primitive qualities to which at any moment you may have to appeal for your own protection  tom owen and his singular assistant fogo who combined the functions of prizefighter and of poet though fortunately for himself he could use his fists better than his pen soon had the ring arranged according to the rules then in vogue  the white wooden posts each with the pc of the pugilistic club printed upon it were so fixed as to leave a square of 24 feet within the roped enclosure  outside this ring an outer one was pitched eight feet separating the two  the inner was for the combatants and for their seconds while in the outer there were places for the referee the timekeeper the backers and a few select and fortunate individuals of whom through being in my uncles company i was one  some twenty wellknown prizefighters including my friend bill warr black richmond maddox the pride of westminster tom belcher paddington jones tough tom blake symonds the ruffian tyne the tailor and others were stationed in the outer ring as beaters these fellows all wore the high white hats which were at that time much affected by the fancy and they were armed with horsewhips silvermounted and each bearing the pc monogram  did any one be it east end rough or west end patrician intrude within the outer ropes this corp of guardians neither argued nor expostulated but they fell upon the offender and laced him with their whips until he escaped back out of the forbidden ground  even with so formidable a guard and such fierce measures the beatersout who had to check the forward heaves of a maddened straining crowd were often as exhausted at the end of a fight as the principals themselves  in the mean time they formed up in a line of sentinels presenting under their row of white hats every type of fighting face from the fresh boyish countenances of tom belcher jones and the other younger recruits to the scarred and mutilated visages of the veteran bruisers  whilst the business of the fixing of the stakes and the fastening of the ropes was going forward i from my place of vantage could hear the talk of the crowd behind me the front two rows of which were lying upon the grass the next two kneeling and the others standing in serried ranks all up the side of the gently sloping hill so that each line could just see over the shoulders of that which was in front  there were several and those amongst the most experienced who took the gloomiest view of harrisons chances and it made my heart heavy to overhear them  its the old story over again said one  they wont bear in mind that youth will be served  they only learn wisdom when its knocked into them  ay ay responded another  thats how jack slack thrashed boughton and i myself saw hooper the tinman beat to pieces by the fighting oilman  they all come to it in time and now its harrisons turn  dont you be so sure about that cried a third  ive seen jack harrison fight five times and i never yet saw him have the worse of it  hes a slaughterer and so i tell you  he was you mean  well i dont see no such difference as all that comes to and im putting ten guineas on my opinion  why said a loud consequential man from immediately behind me speaking with a broad western burr vrom what ive zeen of this young gloucester lad i doant think harrison could have stood bevore him for ten rounds when he vas in his prime  i vas coming up in the bristol coach yesterday and the guard he told me that he had vifteen thousand pound in hard gold in the boot that had been zent up to back our man  theyll be in luck if they see their money again said another harrisons no ladysmaid fighter and hes blood to the bone hed have a shy at it if his man was as big as carlton house  tut answered the westcountryman  its only in bristol and gloucester that you can get men to beat bristol and gloucester  its like your damned himpudence to say so said an angry voice from the throng behind him  there are six men in london that would hengage to walk round the best twelve that hever came from the west  the proceedings might have opened by an impromptu byebattle between the indignant cockney and the gentleman from bristol but a prolonged roar of applause broke in upon their altercation  it was caused by the appearance in the ring of crab wilson followed by dutch sam and mendoza carrying the basin sponge brandybladder and other badges of their office  as he entered wilson pulled the canaryyellow handkerchief from his waist and going to the corner post he tied it to the top of it where it remained fluttering in the breeze  he then took a bundle of smaller ribands of the same colour from his seconds and walking round he offered them to the noblemen and corinthians at halfaguinea apiece as souvenirs of the fight  his brisk trade was only brought to an end by the appearance of harrison who climbed in a very leisurely manner over the ropes as befitted his more mature years and less elastic joints  the yell which greeted him was even more enthusiastic than that which had heralded wilson and there was a louder ring of admiration in it for the crowd had already had their opportunity of seeing wilsons physique whilst harrisons was a surprise to them  i had often looked upon the mighty arms and neck of the smith but i had never before seen him stripped to the waist or understood the marvellous symmetry of development which had made him in his youth the favourite model of the london sculptors  there was none of that white sleek skin and shimmering play of sinew which made wilson a beautiful picture but in its stead there was a rugged grandeur of knotted and tangled muscle as though the roots of some old tree were writhing from breast to shoulder and from shoulder to elbow even in repose the sun threw shadows from the curves of his skin but when he exerted himself every muscle bunched itself up distinct and hard breaking his whole trunk into gnarled knots of sinew  his skin on face and body was darker and harsher than that of his youthful antagonist but he looked tougher and harder an effect which was increased by the sombre colour of his stockings and breeches  he entered the ring sucking a lemon with jim belcher and caleb baldwin the coster at his heels  strolling across to the post he tied his blue birdseye handkerchief over the west countrymans yellow and then walked to his opponent with his hand out  i hope i see you well wilson said he  pretty tidy i thank you answered the other  well speak to each other in a different vashion i spects afore we part  but no illfeeling said the smith and the two fighting men grinned at each other as they took their own corners  may i ask mr referee whether these two men have been weighed asked sir lothian hume standing up in the outer ring  their weight has just been taken under my supervision sir answered mr craven  your man brought the scale down at thirteen three and harrison at thirteeneight  hes a fifteenstoner from the loins upwards cried dutch sam from his corner  well get some of it off him before we finish  youll get more off him than ever you bargained for answered jim belcher and the crowd laughed at the rough chaff    chapter xviiithe smiths last battle    clear the outer ring cried jackson standing up beside the ropes with a big silver watch in his hand  sswhack sswhack sswhack went the horsewhipsfor a number of the spectators either driven onwards by the pressure behind or willing to risk some physical pain on the chance of getting a better view had crept under the ropes and formed a ragged fringe within the outer ring  now amidst roars of laughter from the crowd and a shower of blows from the beatersout they dived madly back with the ungainly haste of frightened sheep blundering through a gap in their hurdles  their case was a hard one for the folk in front refused to yield an inch of their placesbut the arguments from the rear prevailed over everything else and presently every frantic fugitive had been absorbed whilst the beatersout took their stands along the edge at regular intervals with their whips held down by their thighs  gentlemen cried jackson again i am requested to inform you that sir charles tregelliss nominee is jack harrison fighting at thirteeneight and sir lothian humes is crab wilson at thirteen three  no person can be allowed at the inner ropes save the referee and the timekeeper  i have only to beg that if the occasion should require it you will all give me your assistance to keep the ground clear to prevent confusion and to have a fair fight  all ready  all ready from both corners  time  there was a breathless hush as harrison wilson belcher and dutch sam walked very briskly into the centre of the ring  the two men shook hands whilst their seconds did the same the four hands crossing each other  then the seconds dropped back and the two champions stood toe to toe with their hands up  it was a magnificent sight to any one who had not lost his sense of appreciation of the noblest of all the works of nature  both men fulfilled that requisite of the powerful athlete that they should look larger without their clothes than with them  in ring slang they buffed well  and each showed up the others points on account of the extreme contrast between them  the long looselimbed deer footed youngster and the squareset rugged veteran with his trunk like the stump of an oak  the betting began to rise upon the younger man from the instant that they were put face to face for his advantages were obvious whilst those qualities which had brought harrison to the top in his youth were only a memory in the minds of the older men  all could see the three inches extra of height and two of reach which wilson possessed and a glance at the quick catlike motions of his feet and the perfect poise of his body upon his legs showed how swiftly he could spring either in or out from his slower adversary  but it took a subtler insight to read the grim smile which flickered over the smiths mouth or the smouldering fire which shone in his grey eyes and it was only the oldtimers who knew that with his mighty heart and his iron frame he was a perilous man to lay odds against  wilson stood in the position from which he had derived his nickname his left hand and left foot well to the front his body sloped very far back from his loins and his guard thrown across his chest but held well forward in a way which made him exceedingly hard to get at  the smith on the other hand assumed the obsolete attitude which humphries and mendoza introduced but which had not for ten years been seen in a firstclass battle  both his knees were slightly bent he stood square to his opponent and his two big brown fists were held over his mark so that he could lead equally with either  wilsons hands which moved incessantly in and out had been stained with some astringent juice with the purpose of preventing them from puffing and so great was the contrast between them and his white forearms that i imagined that he was wearing dark closefitting gloves until my uncle explained the matter in a whisper  so they stood in a quiver of eagerness and expectation whilst that huge multitude hung so silently and breathlessly upon every motion that they might have believed themselves to be alone man to man in the centre of some primeval solitude  it was evident from the beginning that crab wilson meant to throw no chance away and that he would trust to his lightness of foot and quickness of hand until he should see something of the tactics of this roughlooking antagonist  he paced swiftly round several times with little elastic menacing steps whilst the smith pivoted slowly to correspond  then as wilson took a backward step to induce harrison to break his ground and follow him the older man grinned and shook his head  you must come to me lad said he  im too old to scamper round the ring after you  but we have the day before us and ill wait  he may not have expected his invitation to be so promptly answered but in an instant with a panther spring the westcountryman was on him  smack smack smack  thud thud  the first three were on harrisons face the last two were heavy counters upon wilsons body  back danced the youngster disengaging himself in beautiful style but with two angry red blotches over the lower line of his ribs  blood for wilson yelled the crowd and as the smith faced round to follow the movements of his nimble adversary i saw with a thrill that his chin was crimson and dripping  in came wilson again with a feint at the mark and a flush hit on harrisons cheek then breaking the force of the smiths ponderous right counter he brought the round to a conclusion by slipping down upon the grass  first knockdown for harrison roared a thousand voices for ten times as many pounds would change hands upon the point  i appeal to the referee cried sir lothian hume  it was a slip and not a knockdown  i give it a slip said berkeley craven and the men walked to their corners amidst a general shout of applause for a spirited and wellcontested opening round  harrison fumbled in his mouth with his finger and thumb and then with a sharp halfturn he wrenched out a tooth which he threw into the basin  quite like old times said he to belcher  have a care jack whispered the anxious second  you got rather more than you gave  maybe i can carry more too said he serenely whilst caleb baldwin mopped the big sponge over his face and the shining bottom of the tin basin ceased suddenly to glimmer through the water  i could gather from the comments of the experienced corinthians around me and from the remarks of the crowd behind that harrisons chance was thought to have been lessened by this round  ive seen his old faults and i havent seen his old merits said sir john lade our opponent of the brighton road  hes as slow on his feet and with his guard as ever  wilson hit him as he liked  wilson may hit him three times to his once but his one is worth wilsons three remarked my uncle  hes a natural fighter and the other an excellent sparrer but i dont hedge a guinea  a sudden hush announced that the men were on their feet again and so skilfully had the seconds done their work that neither looked a jot the worse for what had passed  wilson led viciously with his left but misjudged his distance receiving a smashing counter on the mark in reply which sent him reeling and gasping to the ropes hurrah for the old one yelled the mob and my uncle laughed and nudged sir john lade  the westcountryman smiled and shook himself like a dog from the water as with a stealthy step he came back to the centre of the ring where his man was still standing  bang came harrisons right upon the mark once more but crab broke the blow with his elbow and jumped laughing away  both men were a little winded and their quick high breathing with the light patter of their feet as they danced round each other blended into one continuous longdrawn sound  two simultaneous exchanges with the left made a clap like a pistolshot and then as harrison rushed in for a fall wilson slipped him and over went my old friend upon his face partly from the impetus of his own futile attack and partly from a swinging halfarm blow which the westcountryman brought home upon his ear as he passed  knockdown for wilson cried the referee and the answering roar was like the broadside of a seventyfour  up went hundreds of curly brimmed corinthian hats into the air and the slope before us was a bank of flushed and yelling faces  my heart was cramped with my fears and i winced at every blow yet i was conscious also of an absolute fascination with a wild thrill of fierce joy and a certain exultation in our common human nature which could rise above pain and fear in its straining after the very humblest form of fame  belcher and baldwin had pounced upon their man and had him up and in his corner in an instant but in spite of the coolness with which the hardy smith took his punishment there was immense exultation amongst the westcountrymen  weve got him  hes beat  hes beat shouted the two jew seconds  its a hundred to a tizzy on gloucester  beat is he answered belcher  youll need to rent this field before you can beat him for hell stand a month of that kind of flyflappin  he was swinging a towel in front of harrison as he spoke whilst baldwin mopped him with the sponge  how is it with you harrison asked my uncle  hearty as a buck sir  its as right as the day  the cheery answer came with so merry a ring that the clouds cleared from my uncles face  you should recommend your man to lead more tregellis said sir john lade  hell never win it unless he leads  he knows more about the game than you or i do lade  ill let him take his own way  the betting is three to one against him now said a gentleman whose grizzled moustache showed that he was an officer of the late war  very true general fitzpatrick  but youll observe that it is the raw young bloods who are giving the odds and the sheenies who are taking them  i still stick to my opinion  the two men came briskly up to the scratch at the call of time the smith a little lumpy on one side of his head but with the same goodhumoured and yet menacing smile upon his lips  as to wilson he was exactly as he had begun in appearance but twice i saw him close his lips sharply as if he were in a sudden spasm of pain and the blotches over his ribs were darkening from scarlet to a sullen purple  he held his guard somewhat lower to screen this vulnerable point and he danced round his opponent with a lightness which showed that his wind had not been impaired by the bodyblows whilst the smith still adopted the impassive tactics with which he had commenced  many rumours had come up to us from the west as to crab wilsons fine science and the quickness of his hitting but the truth surpassed what had been expected of him  in this round and the two which followed he showed a swiftness and accuracy which old ringsiders declared that mendoza in his prime had never surpassed he was in and out like lightning and his blows were heard and felt rather than seen  but harrison still took them all with the same dogged smile occasionally getting in a hard bodyblow in return for his adversarys height and his position combined to keep his face out of danger  at the end of the fifth round the odds were four to one and the westcountrymen were riotous in their exultation  what think you now cried the westcountryman behind me and in his excitement he could get no further save to repeat over and over again what think you now  when in the sixth round the smith was peppered twice without getting in a counter and had the worst of the fall as well the fellow became inarticulate altogether and could only huzza wildly in his delight  sir lothian hume was smiling and nodding his head whilst my uncle was coldly impassive though i was sure that his heart was as heavy as mine  this wont do tregellis said general fitzpatrick  my money is on the old one but the other is the finer boxer  my man is un peu passe but he will come through all right answered my uncle  i saw that both belcher and baldwin were looking grave and i knew that we must have a change of some sort or the old tale of youth and age would be told once more  the seventh round however showed the reserve strength of the hardy old fighter and lengthened the faces of those layers of odds who had imagined that the fight was practically over and that a few finishing rounds would have given the smith his coupdegrace  it was clear when the two men faced each other that wilson had made himself up for mischief and meant to force the fighting and maintain the lead which he had gained but that grey gleam was not quenched yet in the veterans eyes and still the same smile played over his grim face  he had become more jaunty too in the swing of his shoulders and the poise of his head and it brought my confidence back to see the brisk way in which he squared up to his man  wilson led with his left but was short and he only just avoided a dangerous righthander which whistled in at his ribs  bravo old un one of those will be a dose of laudanum if you get it home cried belcher  there was a pause of shuffling feet and hard breathing broken by the thud of a tremendous body blow from wilson which the smith stopped with the utmost coolness  then again a few seconds of silent tension when wilson led viciously at the head but harrison took it on his forearm smiling and nodding at his opponent  get the pepperbox open yelled mendoza and wilson sprang in to carry out his instructions but was hit out again by a heavy drive on the chest  nows the time  follow it up cried belcher and in rushed the smith pelting in his halfarm blows and taking the returns without a wince until crab wilson went down exhausted in the corner  both men had their marks to show but harrison had all the best of the rally so it was our turn to throw our hats into the air and to shout ourselves hoarse whilst the seconds clapped their man upon his broad back as they hurried him to his corner  what think you now shouted all the neighbours of the west countryman repeating his own refrain  why dutch sam never put in a better rally cried sir john lade whats the betting now sir lothian  i have laid all that i intend but i dont think my man can lose it  for all that the smile had faded from his face and i observed that he glanced continually over his shoulder into the crowd behind him  a sullen purple cloud had been drifting slowly up from the south westthough i dare say that out of thirty thousand folk there were very few who had spared the time or attention to mark it  now it suddenly made its presence apparent by a few heavy drops of rain thickening rapidly into a sharp shower which filled the air with its hiss and rattled noisily upon the high hard hats of the corinthians  coatcollars were turned up and handkerchiefs tied round necks whilst the skins of the two men glistened with the moisture as they stood up to each other once more  i noticed that belcher whispered very earnestly into harrisons ear as he rose from his knee and that the smith nodded his head curtly with the air of a man who understands and approves of his orders  and what those orders were was instantly apparent  harrison was to be turned from the defender into the attacker  the result of the rally in the last round had convinced his seconds that when it came to giveandtake hitting their hardy and powerful man was likely to have the better of it  and then on the top of this came the rain with the slippery grass the superior activity of wilson would be neutralized and he would find it harder to avoid the rushes of his opponent  it was in taking advantage of such circumstances that the art of ringcraft lay and many a shrewd and vigilant second had won a losing battle for his man  go in then  go in whooped the two prizefighters while every backer in the crowd took up the roar  and harrison went in in such fashion that no man who saw him do it will ever forget it  crab wilson as game as a pebble met him with a flush hit every time but no human strength or human science seemed capable of stopping the terrible onslaught of this iron man round after round he scrambled his way in slapbang right and left every hit tremendously sent home  sometimes he covered his own face with his left and sometimes he disdained to use any guard at all but his springing hits were irresistible  the rain lashed down upon them pouring from their faces and running in crimson trickles over their bodies but neither gave any heed to it save to manoeuvre always with the view of bringing it in to each others eyes  but round after round the westcountryman fell and round after round the betting rose until the odds were higher in our favour than ever they had been against us  with a sinking heart filled with pity and admiration for these two gallant men i longed that every bout might be the last and yet the time was hardly out of jacksons mouth before they had both sprung from their seconds knees with laughter upon their mutilated faces and chaffing words upon their bleeding lips  it may have been a humble objectlesson but i give you my word that many a time in my life i have braced myself to a hard task by the remembrance of that morning upon crawley downs asking myself if my manhood were so weak that i would not do for my country or for those whom i loved as much as these two would endure for a paltry stake and for their own credit amongst their fellows  such a spectacle may brutalize those who are brutal but i say that there is a spiritual side to it also and that the sight of the utmost human limit of endurance and courage is one which bears a lesson of its own  but if the ring can breed bright virtues it is but a partisan who can deny that it can be the mother of black vices also and we were destined that morning to have a sight of each  it so chanced that as the battle went against his man my eyes stole round very often to note the expression upon sir lothian humes face for i knew how fearlessly he had laid the odds and i understood that his fortunes as well as his champion were going down before the smashing blows of the old bruiser  the confident smile with which he had watched the opening rounds had long vanished from his lips and his cheeks had turned of a sallow pallor whilst his small fierce grey eyes looked furtively from under his craggy brows and more than once he burst into savage imprecations when wilson was beaten to the ground  but especially i noticed that his chin was always coming round to his shoulder and that at the end of every round he sent keen little glances flying backwards into the crowd  for some time amidst the immense hillside of faces which banked themselves up on the slope behind us i was unable to pick out the exact point at which his gaze was directed  but at last i succeeded in following it  a very tall man who showed a pair of broad bottlegreen shoulders high above his neighbours was looking very hard in our direction and i assured myself that a quick exchange of almost imperceptible signals was going on between him and the corinthian baronet  i became conscious also as i watched this stranger that the cluster of men around him were the roughest elements of the whole assembly fierce viciouslooking fellows with cruel debauched faces who howled like a pack of wolves at every blow and yelled execrations at harrison whenever he walked across to his corner  so turbulent were they that i saw the ringkeepers whisper together and glance up in their direction as if preparing for trouble in store but none of them had realized how near it was to breaking out or how dangerous it might prove  thirty rounds had been fought in an hour and twentyfive minutes and the rain was pelting down harder than ever  a thick steam rose from the two fighters and the ring was a pool of mud  repeated falls had turned the men brown with a horrible mottling of crimson blotches  round after round had ended by crab wilson going down and it was evident even to my inexperienced eyes that he was weakening rapidly  he leaned heavily upon the two jews when they led him to his corner and he reeled when their support was withdrawn  yet his science had through long practice become an automatic thing with him so that he stopped and hit with less power but with as great accuracy as ever  even now a casual observer might have thought that he had the best of the battle for the smith was far the more terribly marked but there was a wild stare in the westcountrymans eyes and a strange catch in his breathing which told us that it is not the most dangerous blow which shows upon the surface  a heavy crossbuttock at the end of the thirtyfirst round shook the breath from his body and he came up for the thirtysecond with the same jaunty gallantry as ever but with the dazed expression of a man whose wind has been utterly smashed  hes got the rolypolies cried belcher  you have it your own way now  ill vight for a week yet gasped wilson  damme i like his style cried sir john lade  no shifting nothing shy no hugging nor hauling  its a shame to let him fight take the brave fellow away  take him away  take him away echoed a hundred voices  i wont be taken away  who dares say so cried wilson who was back after another fall upon his seconds knee  his heart wont suffer him to cry enough said general fitzpatrick  as his patron sir lothian you should direct the sponge to be thrown up  you think he cant win it  he is hopelessly beat sir  you dont know him  hes a glutton of the first water  a gamer man never pulled his shirt off but the other is too strong for him  well sir i believe that he can fight another ten rounds  he half turned as he spoke and i saw him throw up his left arm with a singular gesture into the air  cut the ropes  fair play  wait till the rain stops roared a stentorian voice behind me and i saw that it came from the big man with the bottlegreen coat  his cry was a signal for like a thunderclap there came a hundred hoarse voices shouting together fair play for gloucester  break the ring  break the ring  jackson had called time and the two mudplastered men were already upon their feet but the interest had suddenly changed from the fight to the audience  a succession of heaves from the back of the crowd had sent a series of long ripples running through it all the heads swaying rhythmically in the one direction like a wheatfield in a squall  with every impulsion the oscillation increased those in front trying vainly to steady themselves against the rushes from behind until suddenly there came a sharp snap two white stakes with earth clinging to their points flew into the outer ring and a spray of people dashed from the solid wave behind were thrown against the line of the beatersout  down came the long horsewhips swayed by the most vigorous arms in england but the wincing and shouting victims had no sooner scrambled back a few yards from the merciless cuts before a fresh charge from the rear hurled them once more into the arms of the prizefighters  many threw themselves down upon the turf and allowed successive waves to pass over their bodies whilst others driven wild by the blows returned them with their huntingcrops and walkingcanes  and then as half the crowd strained to the left and half to the right to avoid the pressure from behind the vast mass was suddenly reft in twain and through the gap surged the rough fellows from behind all armed with loaded sticks and yelling for fair play and gloucester their determined rush carried the prizefighters before them the inner ropes snapped like threads and in an instant the ring was a swirling seething mass of figures whips and sticks falling and clattering whilst face to face in the middle of it all so wedged that they could neither advance nor retreat the smith and the west countryman continued their longdrawn battle as oblivious of the chaos raging round them as two bulldogs would have been who had got each other by the throat  the driving rain the cursing and screams of pain the swish of the blows the yelling of orders and advice the heavy smell of the damp clothevery incident of that scene of my early youth comes back to me now in my old age as clearly as if it had been but yesterday  it was not easy for us to observe anything at the time however for we were ourselves in the midst of the frantic crowd swaying about and carried occasionally quite off our feet but endeavouring to keep our places behind jackson and berkeley craven who with sticks and whips meeting over their heads were still calling the rounds and superintending the fight  the rings broken shouted sir lothian hume  i appeal to the referee  the fight is null and void  you villain cried my uncle hotly this is your doing  you have already an account to answer for with me said hume with his sinister sneer and as he spoke he was swept by the rush of the crowd into my uncles very arms  the two mens faces were not more than a few inches apart and sir lothians bold eyes had to sink before the imperious scorn which gleamed coldly in those of my uncle  we will settle our accounts never fear though i degrade myself in meeting such a blackleg  what is it craven  we shall have to declare a draw tregellis  my man has the fight in hand  i cannot help it  i cannot attend to my duties when every moment i am cut over with a whip or a stick  jackson suddenly made a wild dash into the crowd but returned with empty hands and a rueful face  theyve stolen my timekeepers watch he cried  a little cove snatched it out of my hand  my uncle clapped his hand to his fob  mine has gone also he cried  draw it at once or your man will get hurt said jackson and we saw that as the undaunted smith stood up to wilson for another round a dozen rough fellows were clustering round him with bludgeons  do you consent to a draw sir lothian hume  i do  and you sir charles  certainly not  the ring is gone  that is no fault of mine  well i see no help for it  as referee i order that the men be withdrawn and that the stakes be returned to their owners  a draw  a draw shrieked every one and the crowd in an instant dispersed in every direction the pedestrians running to get a good lead upon the london road and the corinthians in search of their horses and carriages  harrison ran over to wilsons corner and shook him by the hand  i hope i have not hurt you much  im hard put to it to stand  how are you  my heads singin like a kettle  it was the rain that helped me  yes i thought i had you beat one time  i never wish a better battle  nor me either  goodbye  and so those two bravehearted fellows made their way amidst the yelping roughs like two wounded lions amidst a pack of wolves and jackals  i say again that if the ring has fallen low it is not in the main the fault of the men who have done the fighting but it lies at the door of the vile crew of ringside parasites and ruffians who are as far below the honest pugilist as the welsher and the blackleg are below the noble racehorse which serves them as a pretext for their villainies    chapter xixcliffe royal    my uncle was humanely anxious to get harrison to bed as soon as possible for the smith although he laughed at his own injuries had none the less been severely punished  dont you dare ever to ask my leave to fight again jack harrison said his wife as she looked ruefully at his battered face  why its worse than when you beat black baruk and if it werent for your topcoat i couldnt swear you were the man who led me to the altar  if the king of england ask you ill never let you do it more  well old lass i give my davy that i never will  its best that i leave fightin before fightin leaves me  he screwed up his face as he took a sup from sir charless brandy flask  its fine liquor sir but it gets into my cut lips most cruel  why heres john cummings of the friars oak inn as im a sinner and seekin for a mad doctor to judge by the look of him  it was certainly a most singular figure who was approaching us over the moor  with the flushed dazed face of a man who is just recovering from recent intoxication the landlord was tearing madly about his hat gone and his hair and beard flying in the wind  he ran in little zigzags from one knot of people to another whilst his peculiar appearance drew a running fire of witticisms as he went so that he reminded me irresistibly of a snipe skimming along through a line of guns  we saw him stop for an instant by the yellow barouche and hand something to sir lothian hume  then on he came again until at last catching sight of us he gave a cry of joy and ran for us full speed with a note held out at arms length  youre a nice cove too john cummings said harrison reproachfully  didnt i tell you not to let a drop pass your lips until you had given your message to sir charles  i ought to be poleaxed i ought he cried in bitter repentance i asked for you sir charles as im a livin man i did but you werent there and what with bein so pleased at gettin such odds when i knew harrison was goin to fight an what with the landlord at the george wantin me to try his own specials i let my senses go clean away from me  and now its only after the fight is over that i see you sir charles an if you lay that whip over my back its only what i deserve  but my uncle was paying no attention whatever to the voluble self reproaches of the landlord  he had opened the note and was reading it with a slight raising of the eyebrows which was almost the very highest note in his limited emotional gamut  what make you of this nephew he asked handing it to me  this was what i read    sir charles tregellis  for gods sake come at once when this reaches you to cliffe royal and tarry as little as possible upon the way  you will see me there and you will hear much which concerns you deeply  i pray you to come as soon as may be and until then i remain him whom you knew as  james harrison   well nephew asked my uncle  why sir i cannot tell what it may mean  who gave it to you sirrah  it was young jim harrison himself sir said the landlord though indeed i scarce knew him at first for he looked like his own ghost he was so eager that it should reach you that he would not leave me until the horse was harnessed and i started upon my way  there was one note for you and one for sir lothian hume and i wish to god he had chosen a better messenger  this is a mystery indeed said my uncle bending his brows over the note  what should he be doing at that house of illomen  and why does he sign himself him whom you knew as jim harrison  by what other style should i know him  harrison you can throw a light upon this  you mrs harrison i see by your face that you understand it  maybe we do sir charles but we are plain folk my jack and i and we go as far as we see our way and when we dont see our way any longer we just stop  weve been goin this twenty year but now well draw aside and let our betters get to the front so if you wish to find what that note means i can only advise you to do what you are asked and to drive over to cliffe royal where you will find out  my uncle put the note into his pocket  i dont move until i have seen you safely in the hands of the surgeon harrison  never mind for me sir  the missus and me can drive down to crawley in the gig and a yard of stickin plaster and a raw steak will soon set me to rights  but my uncle was by no means to be persuaded and he drove the pair into crawley where the smith was left under the charge of his wife in the very best quarters which money could procure  then after a hasty luncheon we turned the mares heads for the south  this ends my connection with the ring nephew said my uncle  i perceive that there is no possible means by which it can be kept pure from roguery  i have been cheated and befooled but a man learns wisdom at last and never again do i give countenance to a prizefight  had i been older or he less formidable i might have said what was in my heart and begged him to give up other things alsoto come out from those shallow circles in which he lived and to find some work that was worthy of his strong brain and his good heart  but the thought had hardly formed itself in my mind before he had dropped his serious vein and was chatting away about some new silvermounted harness which he intended to spring upon the mall and about the match for a thousand guineas which he meant to make between his filly ethelberta and lord doncasters famous threeyear old aurelius  we had got as far as whitemans green which is rather more than midway between crawley down and friars oak when looking backwards i saw far down the road the gleam of the sun upon a high yellow carriage  sir lothian hume was following us  he has had the same summons as we and is bound for the same destination said my uncle glancing over his shoulder at the distant barouche  we are both wanted at cliffe royalwe the two survivors of that black business  and it is jim harrison of all people who calls us there  nephew i have had an eventful life but i feel as if the very strangest scene of it were waiting for me among those trees  he whipped up the mares and now from the curve of the road we could see the high dark pinnacles of the old manorhouse shooting up above the ancient oaks which ring it round  the sight of it with its bloodstained and ghostblasted reputation would in itself have been enough to send a thrill through my nerves but when the words of my uncle made me suddenly realize that this strange summons was indeed for the two men who were concerned in that oldworld tragedy and that it was the playmate of my youth who had sent it i caught my breath as i seemed vaguely to catch a glimpse of some portentous thing forming itself in front of us  the rusted gates between the crumbling heraldic pillars were folded back and my uncle flicked the mares impatiently as we flew up the weedgrown avenue until he pulled them on their haunches before the timeblotched steps  the front door was open and boy jim was waiting there to meet us  but it was a different boy jim from him whom i had known and loved there was a change in him somewhere a change so marked that it was the first thing that i noticed and yet so subtle that i could not put words to it  he was not better dressed than of old for i well knew the old brown suit that he wore  he was not less comely for his training had left him the very model of what a man should be  and yet there was a change a touch of dignity in the expression a suggestion of confidence in the bearing which seemed now that it was supplied to be the one thing which had been needed to give him harmony and finish  somehow in spite of his prowess his old school name of boy had clung very naturally to him until that instant when i saw him standing in his selfcontained and magnificent manhood in the doorway of the ancient house  a woman stood beside him her hand resting upon his shoulder and i saw that it was miss hinton of anstey cross  you remember me sir charles tregellis said she coming forward as we sprang down from the curricle  my uncle looked hard at her with a puzzled face  i do not think that i have the privilege madame  and yet  polly hinton of the haymarket  you surely cannot have forgotten polly hinton  forgotten  why we have mourned for you in fops alley for more years than i care to think of  but what in the name of wonder  i was privately married and i retired from the stage  i want you to forgive me for taking jim away from you last night  it was you then  i had a stronger claim even than you could have  you were his patron i was his mother  she drew his head down to hers as she spoke and there with their cheeks together were the two faces the one stamped with the waning beauty of womanhood the other with the waxing strength of man and yet so alike in the dark eyes the blueblack hair and the broad white brow that i marvelled that i had never read her secret on the first days that i had seen them together  yes she cried he is my own boy and he saved me from what is worse than death as your nephew rodney could tell you  yet my lips were sealed and it was only last night that i could tell him that it was his mother whom he had brought back by his gentleness and his patience into the sweetness of life  hush mother said jim turning his lips to her cheek  there are some things which are between ourselves  but tell me sir charles how went the fight  your uncle would have won it but the roughs broke the ring  he is no uncle of mine sir charles but he has been the best and truest friend both to me and to my father that ever the world could offer  i only know one as true he continued taking me by the hand and dear old rodney stone is his name  but i trust he was not much hurt  a week or two will set him right  but i cannot pretend to understand how this matter stands and you must allow me to say that i have not heard you advance anything yet which seems to me to justify you in abandoning your engagements at a moments notice  come in sir charles and i am convinced that you will acknowledge that i could not have done otherwise  but here if i mistake not is sir lothian hume  the yellow barouche had swung into the avenue and a few moments later the weary panting horses had pulled up behind our curricle sir lothian sprang out looking as black as a thundercloud  stay where you are corcoran said he and i caught a glimpse of a bottlegreen coat which told me who was his travelling companion well he continued looking round him with an insolent stare i should vastly like to know who has had the insolence to give me so pressing an invitation to visit my own house and what in the devil you mean by daring to trespass upon my grounds  i promise you that you will understand this and a good deal more before we part sir lothian said jim with a curious smile playing over his face  if you will follow me i will endeavour to make it all clear to you  with his mothers hand in his own he led us into that illomened room where the cards were still heaped upon the sideboard and the dark shadow lurked in the corner of the ceiling  now sirrah your explanation cried sir lothian standing with his arms folded by the door  my first explanations i owe to you sir charles said jim and as i listened to his voice and noted his manner i could not but admire the effect which the company of her whom he now knew to be his mother had had upon a rude country lad  i wish to tell you what occurred last night  i will tell it for you jim said his mother  you must know sir charles that though my son knew nothing of his parents we were both alive and had never lost sight of him  for my part i let him have his own way in going to london and in taking up this challenge it was only yesterday that it came to the ears of his father who would have none of it  he was in the weakest health and his wishes were not to be gainsayed  he ordered me to go at once and to bring his son to his side  i was at my wits end for i was sure that jim would never come unless a substitute were provided for him  i went to the kind good couple who had brought him up and i told them how matters stood  mrs harrison loved jim as if he had been her own son and her husband loved mine so they came to my help and may god bless them for their kindness to a distracted wife and mother harrison would take jims place if jim would go to his father  then i drove to crawley  i found out which was jims room and i spoke to him through the window for i was sure that those who had backed him would not let him go  i told him that i was his mother  i told him who was his father  i said that i had my phaeton ready and that he might for all i knew be only in time to receive the dying blessing of that parent whom he had never known  still the boy would not go until he had my assurance that harrison would take his place  why did he not leave a message with belcher  my head was in a whirl sir charles  to find a father and a mother a new name and a new rank in a few minutes might turn a stronger brain than ever mine was  my mother begged me to come with her and i went  the phaeton was waiting but we had scarcely started when some fellow seized the horses heads and a couple of ruffians attacked us  one of them i beat over the head with the butt of the whip so that he dropped the cudgel with which he was about to strike me then lashing the horse i shook off the others and got safely away  i cannot imagine who they were or why they should molest us  perhaps sir lothian hume could tell you said my uncle  our enemy said nothing but his little grey eyes slid round with a most murderous glance in our direction  after i had come here and seen my father i went down  my uncle stopped him with a cry of astonishment  what did you say young man  you came here and you saw your fatherhere at cliffe royal  yes sir  my uncle had turned very pale  in gods name then tell us who your father is  jim made no answer save to point over our shoulders and glancing round we became aware that two people had entered the room through the door which led to the bedroom stair  the one i recognized in an instant  that impassive masklike face and demure manner could only belong to ambrose the former valet of my uncle  the other was a very different and even more singular figure  he was a tall man clad in a dark dressinggown and leaning heavily upon a stick  his long bloodless countenance was so thin and so white that it gave the strangest illusion of transparency  only within the folds of a shroud have i ever seen so wan a face  the brindled hair and the rounded back gave the impression of advanced age and it was only the dark brows and the bright alert eyes glancing out from beneath them which made me doubt whether it was really an old man who stood before us  there was an instant of silence broken by a deep oath from sir lothian hume   lord avon by god he cried  very much at your service gentlemen answered the strange figure in the dressinggown    chapter xxlord avon    my uncle was an impassive man by nature and had become more so by the tradition of the society in which he lived  he could have turned a card upon which his fortune depended without the twitch of a muscle and i had seen him myself driving to imminent death on the godstone road with as calm a face as if he were out for his daily airing in the mall  but now the shock which had come upon him was so great that he could only stand with white cheeks and staring incredulous eyes  twice i saw him open his lips and twice he put his hand up to his throat as though a barrier had risen betwixt himself and his utterance  finally he took a sudden little run forward with both his hands thrown out in greeting  ned he cried  but the strange man who stood before him folded his arms over his breast  no charles said he  my uncle stopped and looked at him in amazement  surely ned you have a greeting for me after all these years  you believed me to have done this deed charles  i read it in your eyes and in your manner on that terrible morning  you never asked me for an explanation  you never considered how impossible such a crime must be for a man of my character  at the first breath of suspicion you my intimate friend the man who knew me best set me down as a thief and a murderer  no no ned  you did charles i read it in your eyes  and so it was that when i wished to leave that which was most precious to me in safe hands i had to pass you over and to place him in the charge of the one man who from the first never doubted my innocence  better a thousand times that my son should be brought up in a humble station and in ignorance of his unfortunate father than that he should learn to share the doubts and suspicions of his equals  then he is really your son cried my uncle staring at jim in amazement  for answer the man stretched out his long withered arm and placed a gaunt hand upon the shoulder of the actress whilst she looked up at him with love in her eyes  i married charles and i kept it secret from my friends for i had chosen my wife outside our own circles  you know the foolish pride which has always been the strongest part of my nature  i could not bear to avow that which i had done  it was this neglect upon my part which led to an estrangement between us and drove her into habits for which it is i who am to blame and not she  yet on account of these same habits i took the child from her and gave her an allowance on condition that she did not interfere with it  i had feared that the boy might receive evil from her and had never dreamed in my blindness that she might get good from him  but i have learned in my miserable life charles that there is a power which fashions things for us though we may strive to thwart it and that we are in truth driven by an unseen current towards a certain goal however much we may deceive ourselves into thinking that it is our own sails and oars which are speeding us upon our way  my eyes had been upon the face of my uncle as he listened but now as i turned them from him they fell once more upon the thin wolfish face of sir lothian hume  he stood near the window his grey silhouette thrown up against the square of dusty glass and i have never seen such a play of evil passions of anger of jealousy of disappointed greed upon a human face before  am i to understand said he in a loud harsh voice that this young man claims to be the heir of the peerage of avon  he is my lawful son  i knew you fairly well sir in our youth but you will allow me to observe that neither i nor any friend of yours ever heard of a wife or a son  i defy sir charles tregellis to say that he ever dreamed that there was any heir except myself  i have already explained sir lothian why i kept my marriage secret  you have explained sir but it is for others in another place to say if that explanation is satisfactory  two blazing dark eyes flashed out of the pale haggard face with as strange and sudden an effect as if a stream of light were to beat through the windows of a shattered and ruined house  you dare to doubt my word  i demand a proof  my word is proof to those who know me  excuse me lord avon but i know you and i see no reason why i should accept your statement  it was a brutal speech and brutally delivered  lord avon staggered forward and it was only his son on one aide and his wife on the other who kept his quivering hands from the throat of his insulter sir lothian recoiled from the pale fierce face with the black brows but he still glared angrily about the room  a very pretty conspiracy this he cried with a criminal an actress and a prizefighter all playing their parts  sir charles tregellis you shall hear from me again  and you also my lord he turned upon his heel and strode from the room  he has gone to denounce me said lord avon a spasm of wounded pride distorting his features  shall i bring him back cried boy jim  no no let him go  it is as well for i have already made up my mind that my duty to you my son outweighs that which i owe and have at such bitter cost fulfilled to my brother and my family  you did me an injustice ned said my uncle if you thought that i had forgotten you or that i had judged you unkindly  if ever i have thought that you had done this deedand how could i doubt the evidence of my own eyesi have always believed that it was at a time when your mind was unhinged and when you knew no more of what you were about than the man who is walking in his sleep  what do you mean when you talk about the evidence of your own eyes asked lord avon looking hard at my uncle  i saw you ned upon that accursed night  saw me  where  in the passage  and doing what  you were coming from your brothers room  i had heard his voice raised in anger and pain only an instant before  you carried in your hand a bag full of money and your face betrayed the utmost agitation  if you can but explain to me ned how you came to be there you will take from my heart a weight which has pressed upon it for all these years  no one now would have recognized in my uncle the man who was the leader of all the fops of london  in the presence of this old friend and of the tragedy which girt him round the veil of triviality and affectation had been rent and i felt all my gratitude towards him deepening for the first time into affection whilst i watched his pale anxious face and the eager hops which shone in his eyes as he awaited his friends explanation  lord avon sank his face in his hands and for a few moments there was silence in the dim grey room  i do not wonder now that you were shaken said he at last  my god what a net was cast round me  had this vile charge been brought against me you my dearest friend would have been compelled to tear away the last doubt as to my guilt  and yet in spite of what you have seen charles i am as innocent in the matter as you are  i thank god that i hear you say so  but you are not satisfied charles  i can read it on your face you wish to know why an innocent man should conceal himself for all these years  your word is enough for me ned but the world will wish this other question answered also  it was to save the family honour charles  you know how dear it was to me  i could not clear myself without proving my brother to have been guilty of the foulest crime which a gentleman could commit  for eighteen years i have screened him at the expense of everything which a man could sacrifice  i have lived a living death which has left me an old and shattered man when i am but in my fortieth year  but now when i am faced with the alternative of telling the facts about my brother or of wronging my son i can only act in one fashion and the more so since i have reason to hope that a way may be found by which what i am now about to disclose to you need never come to the public ear  he rose from his chair and leaning heavily upon his two supporters he tottered across the room to the dustcovered sideboard  there in the centre of it was lying that illboding pile of timestained mildewed cards just as boy jim and i had seen them years before lord avon turned them over with trembling fingers and then picking up half a dozen he brought them to my uncle  place your finger and thumb upon the lefthand bottom corner of this card charles said he  pass them lightly backwards and forwards and tell me what you feel  it has been pricked with a pin  precisely  what is the card  my uncle turned it over  it is the king of clubs  try the bottom corner of this one  it is quite smooth  and the card is  the three of spades  and this one  it has been pricked  it is the ace of hearts  lord avon hurled them down upon the floor  there you have the whole accursed story he cried  need i go further where every word is an agony  i see something but not all  you must continue ned  the frail figure stiffened itself as though he were visibly bracing himself for an effort  i will tell it you then once and for ever  never again i trust will it be necessary for me to open my lips about the miserable business  you remember our game  you remember how we lost  you remember how you all retired and left me sitting in this very room and at that very table  far from being tired i was exceedingly wakeful and i remained here for an hour or more thinking over the incidents of the game and the changes which it promised to bring about in my fortunes  i had as you will recollect lost heavily and my only consolation was that my own brother had won  i knew that owing to his reckless mode of life he was firmly in the clutches of the jews and i hoped that that which had shaken my position might have the effect of restoring his  as i sat there fingering the cards in an abstracted way some chance led me to observe the small needlepricks which you have just felt  i went over the packs and found to my unspeakable horror that any one who was in the secret could hold them in dealing in such a way as to be able to count the exact number of high cards which fell to each of his opponents  and then with such a flush of shame and disgust as i had never known i remembered how my attention had been drawn to my brothers mode of dealing its slowness and the way in which he held each card by the lower corner  i did not condemn him precipitately  i sat for a long time calling to mind every incident which could tell one way or the other  alas it all went to confirm me in my first horrible suspicion and to turn it into a certainty  my brother had ordered the packs from ledburys in bond street  they had been for some hours in his chambers  he had played throughout with a decision which had surprised us at the time  above all i could not conceal from myself that his past life was not such as to make even so abominable a crime as this impossible to him  tingling with anger and shame i went straight up that stair the cards in my hand and i taxed him with this lowest and meanest of all the crimes to which a villain could descend  he had not retired to rest and his illgotten gains were spread out upon the dressingtable  i hardly know what i said to him but the facts were so deadly that he did not attempt to deny his guilt you will remember as the only mitigation of his crime that he was not yet one and twenty years of age  my words overwhelmed him  he went on his knees to me imploring me to spare him  i told him that out of consideration for our family i should make no public exposure of him but that he must never again in his life lay his hand upon a card and that the money which he had won must be returned next morning with an explanation  it would be social ruin he protested i answered that he must take the consequence of his own deed  then and there i burned the papers which he had won from me and i replaced in a canvas bag which lay upon the table all the gold pieces  i would have left the room without another word but he clung to me and tore the ruffle from my wrist in his attempt to hold me back and to prevail upon me to promise to say nothing to you or sir lothian hume  it was his despairing cry when he found that i was proof against all his entreaties which reached your ears charles and caused you to open your chamber door and to see me as i returned to my room  my uncle drew a long sigh of relief  nothing could be clearer he murmured  in the morning i came as you remember to your room and i returned your money  i did the same to sir lothian hume  i said nothing of my reasons for doing so for i found that i could not bring myself to confess our disgrace to you  then came the horrible discovery which has darkened my life and which was as great a mystery to me as it has been to you  i saw that i was suspected and i saw also that even if i were to clear myself it could only be done by a public confession of the infamy of my brother  i shrank from it charles  any personal suffering seemed to me to be better than to bring public shame upon a family which has held an untarnished record through so many centuries  i fled from my trial therefore and disappeared from the world  but first of all it was necessary that i should make arrangements for the wife and the son of whose existence you and my other friends were ignorant  it is with shame mary that i confess it and i acknowledge to you that the blame of all the consequences rests with me rather than with you  at the time there were reasons now happily long gone past which made me determine that the son was better apart from the mother whose absence at that age he would not miss  i would have taken you into my confidence charles had it not been that your suspicions had wounded me deeplyfor i did not at that time understand how strong the reasons were which had prejudiced you against me  on the evening after the tragedy i fled to london and arranged that my wife should have a fitting allowance on condition that she did not interfere with the child  i had as you remember had much to do with harrison the prizefighter and i had often had occasion to admire his simple and honest nature  i took my boy to him now and i found him as i expected incredulous as to my guilt and ready to assist me in any way  at his wifes entreaty he had just retired from the ring and was uncertain how he should employ himself  i was able to fit him up as a smith on condition that he should ply his trade at the village of friars oak  my agreement was that james was to be brought up as their nephew and that he should know nothing of his unhappy parents  you will ask me why i selected friars oak  it was because i had already chosen my place of concealment and if i could not see my boy it was at least some consolation to know that he was near me you are aware that this mansion is one of the oldest in england but you are not aware that it has been built with a very special eye to concealment that there are no less than two habitable secret chambers and that the outer or thicker walls are tunnelled into passages  the existence of these rooms has always been a family secret though it was one which i valued so little that it was only the chance of my seldom using the house which had prevented me from pointing them out to some friend  now i found that a secure retreat was provided for me in my extremity  i stole down to my own mansion entered it at night and leaving all that was dear to me behind i crept like a rat behind the wainscot to live out the remainder of my weary life in solitude and misery  in this worn face charles and in this grizzled hair you may read the diary of my most miserable existence  once a week harrison used to bring me up provisions passing them through the pantry window which i left open for the purpose sometimes i would steal out at night and walk under the stars once more with the cool breeze upon my forehead but this i had at last to stop for i was seen by the rustics and rumours of a spirit at cliffe royal began to get about  one night two ghosthunters  it was i father cried boy jim i and my friend rodney stone  i know it was  harrison told me so the same night  i was proud james to see that you had the spirit of the barringtons and that i had an heir whose gallantry might redeem the family blot which i have striven so hard to cover over  then came the day when your mothers kindnessher mistaken kindnessgave you the means of escaping to london  ah edward cried his wife if you had seen our boy like a caged eagle beating against the bars you would have helped to give him even so short a flight as this  i do not blame you mary  it is possible that i should have done so  he went to london and he tried to open a career for himself by his own strength and courage  how many of our ancestors have done the same save only that a swordhilt lay in their closed hands but of them all i do not know that any have carried themselves more gallantly  that i dare swear said my uncle heartily  and then when harrison at last returned i learned that my son was actually matched to fight in a public prizebattle  that would not do charles  it was one thing to fight as you and i have fought in our youth and it was another to compete for a purse of gold  my dear friend i would not for the world  of course you would not charles  you chose the best man and how could you do otherwise  but it would not do  i determined that the time had come when i should reveal myself to my son the more so as there were many signs that my most unnatural existence had seriously weakened my health  chance or shall i not rather say providence had at last made clear all that had been dark and given me the means of establishing my innocence  my wife went yesterday to bring my boy at last to the side of his unfortunate father  there was silence for some time and then it was my uncles voice which broke it  youve been the most illused man in the world ned said he please god we shall have many years yet in which to make up to you for it  but after all it seems to me that we are as far as ever from learning how your unfortunate brother met his death  for eighteen years it was as much a mystery to me as to you charles  but now at last the guilt is manifest  stand forward ambrose and tell your story as frankly and as fully as you have told it to me    chapter xxithe valets story    the valet had shrunk into the dark corner of the room and had remained so motionless that we had forgotten his presence until upon this appeal from his former master he took a step forward into the light turning his sallow face in our direction  his usually impassive features were in a state of painful agitation and he spoke slowly and with hesitation as though his trembling lips could hardly frame the words  and yet so strong is habit that even in this extremity of emotion he assumed the deferential air of the highclass valet and his sentences formed themselves in the sonorous fashion which had struck my attention upon that first day when the curricle of my uncle had stopped outside my fathers door  my lady avon and gentlemen said he if i have sinned in this matter and i freely confess that i have done so i only know one way in which i can atone for it and that is by making the full and complete confession which my noble master lord avon has demanded i assure you then that what i am about to tell you surprising as it may seem is the absolute and undeniable truth concerning the mysterious death of captain barrington  it may seem impossible to you that one in my humble walk of life should bear a deadly and implacable hatred against a man in the position of captain barrington  you think that the gulf between is too wide  i can tell you gentlemen that the gulf which can be bridged by unlawful love can be spanned also by an unlawful hatred and that upon the day when this young man stole from me all that made my life worth living i vowed to heaven that i should take from him that foul life of his though the deed would cover but the tiniest fraction of the debt which he owed me  i see that you look askance at me sir charles tregellis but you should pray to god sir that you may never have the chance of finding out what you would yourself be capable of in the same position  it was a wonder to all of us to see this mans fiery nature breaking suddenly through the artificial constraints with which he held it in check  his short dark hair seemed to bristle upwards his eyes glowed with the intensity of his passion and his face expressed a malignity of hatred which neither the death of his enemy nor the lapse of years could mitigate  the demure servant was gone and there stood in his place a deep and dangerous man one who might be an ardent lover or a most vindictive foe  we were about to be married she and i when some black chance threw him across our path  i do not know by what base deceptions he lured her away from me  i have heard that she was only one of many and that he was an adept at the art  it was done before ever i knew the danger and she was left with her broken heart and her ruined life to return to that home into which she had brought disgrace and misery  i only saw her once  she told me that her seducer had burst out alaughing when she had reproached him for his perfidy and i swore to her that his hearts blood should pay me for that laugh  i was a valet at the time but i was not yet in the service of lord avon  i applied for and gained that position with the one idea that it might give me an opportunity of settling my accounts with his younger brother  and yet my chance was a terribly long time coming for many months had passed before the visit to cliffe royal gave me the opportunity which i longed for by day and dreamed of by night when it did come however it came in a fashion which was more favourable to my plans than anything that i had ever ventured to hope for  lord avon was of opinion that no one but himself knew of the secret passages in cliffe royal  in this he was mistaken  i knew of them or at least i knew enough of them to serve my purpose  i need not tell you how one day when preparing the chambers for the guests an accidental pressure upon part of the fittings caused a panel to gape in the woodwork and showed me a narrow opening in the wall  making my way down this i found that another panel led into a larger bedroom beyond  that was all i knew but it was all that was needed for my purpose  the disposal of the rooms had been left in my hands and i arranged that captain barrington should sleep in the larger and i in the smaller  i could come upon him when i wished and no one would be the wiser  and then he arrived  how can i describe to you the fever of impatience in which i lived until the moment should come for which i had waited and planned  for a night and a day they gambled and for a night and a day i counted the minutes which brought me nearer to my man  they might ring for fresh wine at what hour they liked they always found me waiting and ready so that this young captain hiccoughed out that i was the model of all valets  my master advised me to go to bed  he had noticed my flushed cheek and my bright eyes and he set me down as being in a fever  so i was but it was a fever which only one medicine could assuage  then at last very early in the morning i heard them push back their chairs and i knew that their game had at last come to an end when i entered the room to receive my orders i found that captain barrington had already stumbled off to bed  the others had also retired and my master was sitting alone at the table with his empty bottle and the scattered cards in front of him  he ordered me angrily to my room and this time i obeyed him  my first care was to provide myself with a weapon  i knew that if i were face to face with him i could tear his throat out but i must so arrange that the fashion of his death should be a noiseless one there was a hunting trophy in the hall and from it i took a straight heavy knife which i sharpened upon my boot  then i stole to my room and sat waiting upon the side of my bed  i had made up my mind what i should do  there would be little satisfaction in killing him if he was not to know whose hand had struck the blow or which of his sins it came to avenge  could i but bind him and gag him in his drunken sleep then a prick or two of my dagger would arouse him to listen to what i had to say to him  i pictured the look in his eyes as the haze of sleep cleared slowly away from them the look of anger turning suddenly to stark horror as he understood who i was and what i had come for  it would be the supreme moment of my life  i waited as it seemed to me for at least an hour but i had no watch and my impatience was such that i dare say it really was little more than a quarter of that time  then i rose removed my shoes took my knife and having opened the panel slipped silently through  it was not more than thirty feet that i had to go but i went inch by inch for the old rotten boards snapped like breaking twigs if a sudden weight was placed upon them  it was of course pitch dark and very very slowly i felt my way along  at last i saw a yellow seam of light glimmering in front of me and i knew that it came from the other panel  i was too soon then since he had not extinguished his candles  i had waited many months and i could afford to wait another hour for i did not wish to do anything precipitately or in a hurry  it was very necessary to move silently now since i was within a few feet of my man with only the thin wooden partition between age had warped and cracked the boards so that when i had at last very stealthily crept my way as far as the slidingpanel i found that i could without any difficulty see into the room  captain barrington was standing by the dressingtable with his coat and vest off  a large pile of sovereigns and several slips of paper were lying before him and he was counting over his gambling gains  his face was flushed and he was heavy from want of sleep and from wine it rejoiced me to see it for it meant that his slumber would be deep and that all would be made easy for me  i was still watching him when of a sudden i saw him start and a terrible expression come upon his face  for an instant my heart stood still for i feared that he had in some way divined my presence  and then i heard the voice of my master within  i could not see the door by which he had entered nor could i see him where he stood but i heard all that he had to say  as i watched the captains face flush fieryred and then turn to a livid white as he listened to those bitter words which told him of his infamy my revenge was sweeterfar sweeterthan my most pleasant dreams had ever pictured it  i saw my master approach the dressingtable hold the papers in the flame of the candle throw their charred ashes into the grate and sweep the golden pieces into a small brown canvas bag  then as he turned to leave the room the captain seized him by the wrist imploring him by the memory of their mother to have mercy upon him and i loved my master as i saw him drag his sleeve from the grasp of the clutching fingers and leave the stricken wretch grovelling upon the floor  and now i was left with a difficult point to settle for it was hard for me to say whether it was better that i should do that which i had come for or whether by holding this mans guilty secret i might not have in my hand a keener and more deadly weapon than my masters huntingknife  i was sure that lord avon could not and would not expose him  i knew your sense of family pride too well my lord and i was certain that his secret was safe in your hands but i both could and would and then when his life had been blasted and he had been hounded from his regiment and from his clubs it would be time perhaps for me to deal in some other way with him  ambrose you are a black villain said my uncle  we all have our own feelings sir charles and you will permit me to say that a servingman may resent an injury as much as a gentleman though the redress of the duel is denied to him  but i am telling you frankly at lord avons request all that i thought and did upon that night and i shall continue to do so even if i am not fortunate enough to win your approval  when lord avon had left him the captain remained for some time in a kneeling attitude with his face sunk upon a chair  then he rose and paced slowly up and down the room his chin sunk upon his breast  every now and then he would pluck at his hair or shake his clenched hands in the air and i saw the moisture glisten upon his brow  for a time i lost sight of him and i heard him opening drawer after drawer as though he were in search of something  then he stood over by his dressingtable again with his back turned to me  his head was thrown a little back and he had both hands up to the collar of his shirt as though he were striving to undo it  and then there was a gush as if a ewer had been upset and down he sank upon the ground with his head in the corner twisted round at so strange an angle to his shoulders that one glimpse of it told me that my man was slipping swiftly from the clutch in which i had fancied that i held him  i slid my panel and was in the room in an instant  his eyelids still quivered and it seemed to me as my gaze met his glazing eyes that i could read both recognition and surprise in them  i laid my knife upon the floor and i stretched myself out beside him that i might whisper in his ear one or two little things of which i wished to remind him but even as i did so he gave a gasp and was gone  it is singular that i who had never feared him in life should be frightened at him now and yet when i looked at him and saw that all was motionless save the creeping stain upon the carpet i was seized with a sudden foolish spasm of terror and catching up my knife i fled swiftly and silently back to my own room closing the panels behind me  it was only when i had reached it that i found that in my mad haste i had carried away not the huntingknife which i had taken with me but the bloody razor which had dropped from the dead mans hand  this i concealed where no one has ever discovered it but my fears would not allow me to go back for the other as i might perhaps have done had i foreseen how terribly its presence might tell against my master  and that lady avon and gentlemen is an exact and honest account of how captain barrington came by his end  and how was it asked my uncle angrily that you have allowed an innocent man to be persecuted all these years when a word from you might have saved him  because i had every reason to believe sir charles that that would be most unwelcome to lord avon  how could i tell all this without revealing the family scandal which he was so anxious to conceal  i confess that at the beginning i did not tell him what i had seen and my excuse must be that he disappeared before i had time to determine what i should do  for many a year howeverever since i have been in your service sir charlesmy conscience tormented me and i swore that if ever i should find my old master i should reveal everything to him  the chance of my overhearing a story told by young mr stone here which showed me that some one was using the secret chambers of cliffe royal convinced me that lord avon was in hiding there and i lost no time in seeking him out and offering to do him all the justice in my power  what he says is true said his master but it would have been strange indeed if i had hesitated to sacrifice a frail life and failing health in a cause for which i freely surrendered all that youth had to offer  but new considerations have at last compelled me to alter my resolution  my son through ignorance of his true position was drifting into a course of life which accorded with his strength and spirit but not with the traditions of his house again i reflected that many of those who knew my brother had passed away that all the facts need not come out and that my death whilst under the suspicion of such a crime would cast a deeper stain upon our name than the sin which he had so terribly expiated  for these reasons  the tramp of several heavy footsteps reverberating through the old house broke in suddenly upon lord avons words  his wan face turned even a shade greyer as he heard it and he looked piteously to his wife and son  they will arrest me he cried  i must submit to the degradation of an arrest  this way sir james this way said the harsh tones of sir lothian hume from without  i do not need to be shown the way in a house where i have drunk many a bottle of good claret cried a deep voice in reply and there in the doorway stood the broad figure of squire ovington in his buckskins and topboots a ridingcrop in his hand  sir lothian hume was at his elbow and i saw the faces of two country constables peeping over his shoulders  lord avon said the squire as a magistrate of the county of sussex it is my duty to tell you that a warrant is held against you for the wilful murder of your brother captain barrington in the year 1786  i am ready to answer the charge  this i tell you as a magistrate  but as a man and the squire of rougham grange im right glad to see you ned and heres my hand on it and never will i believe that a good tory like yourself and a man who could show his horses tail to any field in the whole down county would ever be capable of so vile an act  you do me justice james said lord avon clasping the broad brown hand which the country squire had held out to him  i am as innocent as you are and i can prove it  damned glad i am to hear it ned  that is to say lord avon that any defence which you may have to make will be decided upon by your peers and by the laws of your country  until which time added sir lothian hume a stout door and a good lock will be the best guarantee that lord avon will be there when called for  the squires weatherstained face flushed to a deeper red as he turned upon the londoner  are you the magistrate of a county sir  i have not the honour sir james  then how dare you advise a man who has sat on the bench for nigh twenty years  when i am in doubt sir the law provides me with a clerk with whom i may confer and i ask no other assistance  you take too high a tone in this matter sir james  i am not accustomed to be taken to task so sharply  nor am i accustomed sir to be interfered with in my official duties  i speak as a magistrate sir lothian but i am always ready to sustain my opinions as a man  sir lothian bowed  you will allow me to observe sir that i have personal interests of the highest importance involved in this matter i have every reason to believe that there is a conspiracy afoot which will affect my position as heir to lord avons titles and estates  i desire his safe custody in order that this matter may be cleared up and i call upon you as a magistrate to execute your warrant  plague take it ned cried the squire i would that my clerk johnson were here for i would deal as kindly by you as the law allows and yet i am as you hear called upon to secure your person  permit me to suggest sir said my uncle that so long as he is under the personal supervision of the magistrate he may be said to be under the care of the law and that this condition will be fulfilled if he is under the roof of rougham grange  nothing could be better cried the squire heartily  you will stay with me ned until this matter blows over  in other words lord avon i make myself responsible as the representative of the law that you are held in safe custody until your person may be required of me  yours is a true heart james  tut tut it is the due process of the law  i trust sir lothian hume that you find nothing to object to in it  sir lothian shrugged his shoulders and looked blackly at the magistrate  then he turned to my uncle  there is a small matter still open between us said he  would you kindly give me the name of a friend  mr corcoran who is outside in my barouche would act for me and we might meet to morrow morning  with pleasure answered my uncle  i dare say your father would act for me nephew  your friend may call upon lieutenant stone of friars oak and the sooner the better  and so this strange conference ended  as for me i had sprung to the side of the old friend of my boyhood and was trying to tell him my joy at his good fortune and listening to his assurance that nothing that could ever befall him could weaken the love that he bore me  my uncle touched me on the shoulder and we were about to leave when ambrose whose bronze mask had been drawn down once more over his fiery passions came demurely towards him  beg your pardon sir charles said he but it shocks me very much to see your cravat  you are right ambrose my uncle answered  lorimer does his best but i have never been able to fill your place  i should be proud to serve you sir but you must acknowledge that lord avon has the prior claim  if he will release me  you may go ambrose you may go cried lord avon  you are an excellent servant but your presence has become painful to me  thank you ned said my uncle  but you must not leave me so suddenly again ambrose  permit me to explain the reason sir  i had determined to give you notice when we reached brighton but as we drove from the village that day i caught a glimpse of a lady passing in a phaeton between whom and lord avon i was well aware there was a close intimacy although i was not certain that she was actually his wife  her presence there confirmed me in my opinion that he was in hiding at cliffe royal and i dropped from your curricle and followed her at once in order to lay the matter before her and explain how very necessary it was that lord avon should see me  well i forgive you for your desertion ambrose said my uncle and he added i should be vastly obliged to you if you would re arrange my tie    chapter xxiithe end    sir james ovingtons carriage was waiting without and in it the avon family so tragically separated and so strangely reunited were borne away to the squires hospitable home  when they had gone my uncle mounted his curricle and drove ambrose and myself to the village  we had best see your father at once nephew said he  sir lothian and his man started some time ago  i should be sorry if there should be any hitch in our meeting  for my part i was thinking of our opponents deadly reputation as a duellist and i suppose that my features must have betrayed my feelings for my uncle began to laugh  why nephew said he you look as if you were walking behind my coffin  it is not my first affair and i dare bet that it will not be my last  when i fight near town i usually fire a hundred or so in mantons back shop but i dare say i can find my way to his waistcoat  but i confess that i am somewhat accable by all that has befallen us  to think of my dear old friend being not only alive but innocent as well  and that he should have such a strapping son and heir to carry on the race of avon  this will be the last blow to hume for i know that the jews have given him rope on the score of his expectations  and you ambrose that you should break out in such a way  of all the amazing things which had happened this seemed to have impressed my uncle most and he recurred to it again and again that a man whom he had come to regard as a machine for tying cravats and brewing chocolate should suddenly develop fiery human passions was indeed a prodigy  if his silver razorheater had taken to evil ways he could not have been more astounded  we were still a hundred yards from the cottage when i saw the tall greencoated mr corcoran striding down the garden path  my father was waiting for us at the door with an expression of subdued delight upon his face  happy to serve you in any way sir charles said he  weve arranged it for tomorrow at seven on ditching common  i wish these things could be brought off a little later in the day said my uncle  one has either to rise at a perfectly absurd hour or else to neglect ones toilet  they are stopping across the road at the friars oak inn and if you would wish it later  no no i shall make the effort  ambrose you will bring up the batteris de toilette at five  i dont know whether you would care to use my barkers said my father  ive had em in fourteen actions and up to thirty yards you couldnt wish a better tool  thank you i have my duelling pistols under the seat  see that the triggers are oiled ambrose for i love a light pull  ah sister mary i have brought your boy back to you none the worse i hope for the dissipations of town  i need not tell you how my dear mother wept over me and fondled me for you who have mothers will know for yourselves and you who have not will never understand how warm and snug the home nest can be how i had chafed and longed for the wonders of town and yet now that i had seen more than my wildest dreams had ever deemed possible my eyes had rested upon nothing which was so sweet and so restful as our own little sittingroom with its terracotta coloured walls and those trifles which are so insignificant in themselves and yet so rich in memoriesthe blowfish from the moluccas the narwhals horn from the arctic and the picture of the ca ira with lord hotham in chase  how cheery too to see at one side of the shining grate my father with his pipe and his merry red face and on the other my mother with her fingers ever turning and darting with her knittingneedles  as i looked at them i marvelled that i could ever have longed to leave them or that i could bring myself to leave them again  but leave them i must and that speedily as i learned amidst the boisterous congratulations of my father and the tears of my mother he had himself been appointed to the cato 64 with post rank whilst a note had come from lord nelson at portsmouth to say that a vacancy was open for me if i should present myself at once  and your mother has your seachest all ready my lad and you can travel down with me tomorrow for if you are to be one of nelsons men you must show him that you are worthy of it  all the stones have been in the seaservice said my mother apologetically to my uncle and it is a great chance that he should enter under lord nelsons own patronage  but we can never forget your kindness charles in showing our dear rodney something of the world  on the contrary sister mary said my uncle graciously your son has been an excellent companion to meso much so that i fear that i am open to the charge of having neglected my dear fidelio  i trust that i bring him back somewhat more polished than i found him  it would be folly to call him distingue but he is at least unobjectionable  nature has denied him the highest gifts and i find him adverse to employing the compensating advantages of art but at least i have shown him something of life and i have taught him a few lessons in finesse and deportment which may appear to be wasted upon him at present but which none the less may come back to him in his more mature years  if his career in town has been a disappointment to me the reason lies mainly in the fact that i am foolish enough to measure others by the standard which i have myself set  i am well disposed towards him however and i consider him eminently adapted for the profession which he is about to adopt  he held out his sacred snuffbox to me as he spoke as a solemn pledge of his goodwill and as i look back at him there is no moment at which i see him more plainly than that with the old mischievous light dancing once more in his large intolerant eyes one thumb in the armpit of his vest and the little shining box held out upon his snowwhite palm  he was a type and leader of a strange breed of men which has vanished away from englandthe fullblooded virile buck exquisite in his dress narrow in his thoughts coarse in his amusements and eccentric in his habits  they walk across the bright stage of english history with their finicky step their preposterous cravats their high collars their dangling seals and they vanish into those dark wings from which there is no return the world has outgrown them and there is no place now for their strange fashions their practical jokes and carefully cultivated eccentricities  and yet behind this outer veiling of folly with which they so carefully draped themselves they were often men of strong character and robust personality  the languid loungers of st jamess were also the yachtsmen of the solent the fine riders of the shires and the hardy fighters in many a wayside battle and many a morning frolic  wellington picked his best officers from amongst them  they condescended occasionally to poetry or oratory and byron charles james fox sheridan and castlereagh preserved some reputation amongst them in spite of their publicity  i cannot think how the historian of the future can hope to understand them when i who knew one of them so well and bore his blood in my veins could never quite tell how much of him was real and how much was due to the affectations which he had cultivated so long that they had ceased to deserve the name  through the chinks of that armour of folly i have sometimes thought that i had caught a glimpse of a good and true man within and it pleases me to hope that i was right  it was destined that the exciting incidents of that day were even now not at an end  i had retired early to rest but it was impossible for me to sleep for my mind would turn to boy jim and to the extraordinary change in his position and prospects  i was still turning and tossing when i heard the sound of flying hoofs coming down the london road and immediately afterwards the grating of wheels as they pulled up in front of the inn  my window chanced to be open for it was a fresh spring night and i heard the creak of the inn door and a voice asking whether sir lothian hume was within  at the name i sprang from my bed and i was in time to see three men who had alighted from the carriage file into the lighted hall  the two horses were left standing with the glare of the open door falling upon their brown shoulders and patient heads  ten minutes may have passed and then i heard the clatter of many steps and a knot of men came clustering through the door  you need not employ violence said a harsh clear voice  on whose suit is it  several suits sir  they eld over in the opes that youd pull off the fight this mornin  total amounts is twelve thousand pound  look here my man i have a very important appointment for seven oclock tomorrow  ill give you fifty pounds if you will leave me until then  couldnt do it sir really  its more than our places as sheriffs officers is worth  in the yellow glare of the carriagelamp i saw the baronet look up at our windows and if hatred could have killed his eyes would have been as deadly as his pistol  i cant mount the carriage unless you free my hands said he  old ard bill for e looks vicious  let go o one arm at a time  ah would you then  corcoran  corcoran screamed a voice and i saw a plunge a struggle and one frantic figure breaking its way from the rest then came a heavy blow and down he fell in the middle of the moonlit road flapping and jumping among the dust like a trout new landed  hes napped it this time  get im by the wrists jim  now all together  he was hoisted up like a bag of flour and fell with a brutal thud into the bottom of the carriage  the three men sprang in after him a whip whistled in the darkness and i had seen the last that i or any one else save some charitable visitor to a debtors gaol was ever again destined to see of sir lothian hume the once fashionable corinthian   lord avon lived for two years longerlong enough with the help of ambrose to fully establish his innocence of the horrible crime in the shadow of which he had lived so long  what he could not clear away however was the effect of those years of morbid and unnatural life spent in the hidden chambers of the old house and it was only the devotion of his wife and of his son which kept the thin and flickering flame of his life alight  she whom i had known as the play actress of anstey cross became the dowager lady avon whilst boy jim as dear to me now as when we harried birds nests and tickled trout together is now lord avon beloved by his tenantry the finest sportsman and the most popular man from the north of the weald to the channel  he was married to the second daughter of sir james ovington and as i have seen three of his grandchildren within the week i fancy that if any of sir lothians descendants have their eye upon the property they are likely to be as disappointed as their ancestor was before them  the old house of cliffe royal has been pulled down owing to the terrible family associations which hung round it and a beautiful modern building sprang up in its place  the lodge which stood by the brighton road was so dainty with its trelliswork and its rose bushes that i was not the only visitor who declared that i had rather be the owner of it than of the great house amongst the trees  there for many years in a happy and peaceful old age lived jack harrison and his wife receiving back in the sunset of their lives the loving care which they had themselves bestowed  never again did champion harrison throw his leg over the ropes of a twentyfourfoot ring but the story of the great battle between the smith and the west countryman is still familiar to old ringgoers and nothing pleased him better than to refight it all round by round as he sat in the sunshine under his rosegirt porch  but if he heard the tap of his wifes stick approaching him his talk would break off at once into the garden and its prospects for she was still haunted by the fear that he would some day go back to the ring and she never missed the old man for an hour without being convinced that he had hobbled off to wrest the belt from the latest upstart champion  it was at his own very earnest request that they inscribed he fought the good fight upon his tombstone and though i cannot doubt that he had black bank and crab wilson in his mind when he asked it yet none who knew him would grudge its spiritual meaning as a summing up of his clean and manly life  sir charles tregellis continued for some years to show his scarlet and gold at newmarket and his inimitable coats in st jamess  it was he who invented buttons and loops at the ends of dress pantaloons and who broke fresh ground by his investigation of the comparative merits of isinglass and of starch in the preparation of shirtfronts  there are old fops still lurking in the corners of arthurs or of whites who can remember tregelliss dictum that a cravat should be so stiffened that three parts of the length could be raised by one corner and the painful schism which followed when lord alvanley and his school contended that a half was sufficient then came the supremacy of brummell and the open breach upon the subject of velvet collars in which the town followed the lead of the younger man  my uncle who was not born to be second to any one retired instantly to st albans and announced that he would make it the centre of fashion and of society instead of degenerate london  it chanced however that the mayor and corporation waited upon him with an address of thanks for his good intentions towards the town and that the burgesses having ordered new coats from london for the occasion were all arrayed in velvet collars which so preyed upon my uncles spirits that he took to his bed and never showed his face in public again  his money which had ruined what might have been a great life was divided amongst many bequests an annuity to his valet ambrose being amongst them but enough has come to his sister my dear mother to help to make her old age as sunny and as pleasant as even i could wish  and as for methe poor string upon which these beads are strungi dare scarce say another word about myself lest this which i had meant to be the last word of a chapter should grow into the first words of a new one  had i not taken up my pen to tell you a story of the land i might perchance have made a better one of the sea but the one frame cannot hold two opposite pictures  the day may come when i shall write down all that i remember of the greatest battle ever fought upon salt water and how my fathers gallant life was brought to an end as with his paint rubbing against a french eightygun ship on one side and a spanish seventyfour upon the other he stood eating an apple in the break of his poop  i saw the smoke banks on that october evening swirl slowly up over the atlantic swell and rise and rise until they had shredded into thinnest air and lost themselves in the infinite blue of heaven and with them rose the cloud which had hung over the country and it also thinned and thinned until gods own sun of peace and security was shining once more upon us never more we hope to be bedimmed
