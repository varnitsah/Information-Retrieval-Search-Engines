62811362	extracts from adams diary  translated from the original ms  by mark twain     notei translated a portion of this diary some years ago and a friend of mine printed a few copies in an incomplete form but the public never got them  since then i have deciphered some more of adams hieroglyphics and think he has now become sufficiently important as a public character to justify this publicationm t     monday  this new creature with the long hair is a good deal in the way it is always hanging around and following me about  i dont like this i am not used to company  i wish it would stay with the other animals  cloudy today wind in the east think we shall have rain  where did i get that word  i remember now the new creature uses it  tuesday  been examining the great waterfall  it is the finest thing on the estate i think  the new creature calls it niagara fallswhy i am sure i do not know  says it looks like niagara falls  that is not a reason it is mere waywardness and imbecility  i get no chance to name anything myself  the new creature names everything that comes along before i can get in a protest  and always that same pretext is offeredit looks like the thing  there is the dodo for instance  says the moment one looks at it one sees at a glance that it looks like a dodo  it will have to keep that name no doubt  it wearies me to fret about it and it does no good anyway  dodo it looks no more like a dodo than i do  wednesday  built me a shelter against the rain but could not have it to myself in peace  the new creature intruded  when i tried to put it out it shed water out of the holes it looks with and wiped it away with the back of its paws and made a noise such as some of the other animals make when they are in distress  i wish it would not talk it is always talking  that sounds like a cheap fling at the poor creature a slur but i do not mean it so  i have never heard the human voice before and any new and strange sound intruding itself here upon the solemn hush of these dreaming solitudes offends my ear and seems a false note  and this new sound is so close to me it is right at my shoulder right at my ear first on one side and then on the other and i am used only to sounds that are more or less distant from me  friday  the naming goes recklessly on in spite of anything i can do  i had a very good name for the estate and it was musical and pretty gardenofeden  privately i continue to call it that but not any longer publicly  the new creature says it is all woods and rocks and scenery and therefore has no resemblance to a garden says it looks like a park and does not look like anything but a park  consequently without consulting me it has been newnamed niagara falls park  this is sufficiently highhanded it seems to me  and already there is a sign up                           keep off                          the grass  my life is not as happy as it was  saturday  the new creature eats too much fruit  we are going to run short most likely  we againthat is its word mine too now from hearing it so much  good deal of fog this morning  i do not go out in the fog myself  the new creature does  it goes out in all weathers and stumps right in with its muddy feet  and talks it used to be so pleasant and quiet here  sunday  pulled through  this day is getting to be more and more trying it was selected and set apart last november as a day of rest  i already had six of them per week before  this morning found the new creature trying to clod apples out of that forbidden tree  monday  the new creature says its name is eve  that is all right i have no objections  says it is to call it by when i want it to come i said it was superfluous then  the word evidently raised me in its respect and indeed it is a large good word and will bear repetition  it says it is not an it it is a she  this is probably doubtful yet it is all one to me what she is were nothing to me if she would but go by herself and not talk  tuesday  she has littered the whole estate with execrable names and offensive signs  this way to the whirlpool  this way to goat island  cave of the winds this way  she says this park would make a tidy summer resort if there was any custom for it  summer resortanother invention of hersjust words without any meaning  what is a summer resort but it is best not to ask her she has such a rage for explaining  friday  she has taken to beseeching me to stop going over the falls  what harm does it do says it makes her shudder  i wonder why  i have always done italways liked the plunge and the excitement and the coolness  i supposed it was what the falls were for  they have no other use that i can see and they must have been made for something  she says they were only made for scenerylike the rhinoceros and the mastodon  i went over the falls in a barrelnot satisfactory to her  went over in a tubstill not satisfactory  swam the whirlpool and the rapids in a figleaf suit  it got much damaged  hence tedious complaints about my extravagance  i am too much hampered here what i need is change of scene  saturday  i escaped last tuesday night and travelled two days and built me another shelter in a secluded place and obliterated my tracks as well as i could but she hunted me out by means of a beast which she has tamed and calls a wolf and came making that pitiful noise again and shedding that water out of the places she looks with i was obliged to return with her but will presently emigrate again when occasion offers  she engages herself in many foolish things among others trying to study out why the animals called lions and tigers live on grass and flowers when as she says the sort of teeth they wear would indicate that they were intended to eat each other  this is foolish because to do that would be to kill each other and that would introduce what as i understand it is called death and death as i have been told has not yet entered the park  which is a pity on some accounts  sunday  pulled through  monday  i believe i see what the week is for it is to give time to rest up from the weariness of sunday  it seems a good idea  she has been climbing that tree again  clodded her out of it  she said nobody was looking  seems to consider that a sufficient justification for chancing any dangerous thing  told her that the word justification moved her admirationand envy too i thought  it is a good word  thursday  she told me she was made out of a rib taken from my body  this is at least doubtful if not more than that  i have not missed any rib  she is in much trouble about the buzzard says grass does not agree with it is afraid she cant raise it thinks it was intended to live on decayed flesh  the buzzard must get along the best it can with what is provided  we cannot overturn the whole scheme to accommodate the buzzard  saturday  she fell in the pond yesterday when she was looking at herself in it which she is always doing  she nearly strangled and said it was most uncomfortable  this made her sorry for the creatures which live in there which she calls fish for she continues to fasten names on to things that dont need them and dont come when they are called by them which is a matter of no consequence to her as she is such a numskull anyway so she got a lot of them out and brought them in last night and put them in my bed to keep warm but i have noticed them now and then all day and i dont see that they are any happier there than they were before only quieter  when night comes i shall throw them outdoors  i will not sleep with them again for i find them clammy and unpleasant to lie among when a person hasnt anything on  sunday  pulled through  tuesday  she has taken up with a snake now  the other animals are glad for she was always experimenting with them and bothering them and i am glad because the snake talks and this enables me to get a rest  friday  she says the snake advises her to try the fruit of that tree and says the result will be a great and fine and noble education  i told her there would be another result tooit would introduce death into the world  that was a mistakeit had been better to keep the remark to myself it only gave her an ideashe could save the sick buzzard and furnish fresh meat to the despondent lions and tigers  i advised her to keep away from the tree  she said she wouldnt  i foresee trouble  will emigrate  wednesday  i have had a variegated time  i escaped that night and rode a horse all night as fast as he could go hoping to get clear out of the park and hide in some other country before the trouble should begin but it was not to be  about an hour after sunup as i was riding through a flowery plain where thousands of animals were grazing slumbering or playing with each other according to their wont all of a sudden they broke into a tempest of frightful noises and in one moment the plain was in a frantic commotion and every beast was destroying its neighbor  i knew what it meanteve had eaten that fruit and death was come into the world  the tigers ate my horse paying no attention when i ordered them to desist  and they would even have eaten me if i had stayedwhich i didnt but went away in much haste  i found this place outside the park and was fairly comfortable for a few days but she has found me out  found me out and has named the place tonawandasays it looks like that  in fact i was not sorry she came for there are but meagre pickings here and she brought some of those apples  i was obliged to eat them i was so hungry  it was against my principles but i find that principles have no real force except when one is well fed  she came curtained in boughs and bunches of leaves and when i asked her what she meant by such nonsense and snatched them away and threw them down she tittered and blushed  i had never seen a person titter and blush before and to me it seemed unbecoming and idiotic  she said i would soon know how it was myself  this was correct  hungry as i was i laid down the apple half eatencertainly the best one i ever saw considering the lateness of the seasonand arrayed myself in the discarded boughs and branches and then spoke to her with some severity and ordered her to go and get some more and not make such a spectacle of herself  she did it and after this we crept down to where the wildbeast battle had been and collected some skins and i made her patch together a couple of suits proper for public occasions  they are uncomfortable it is true but stylish and that is the main point about clothes    i find she is a good deal of a companion  i see i should be lonesome and depressed without her now that i have lost my property  another thing she says it is ordered that we work for our living hereafter she will be useful  i will superintend  ten days later  she accuses me of being the cause of our disaster she says with apparent sincerity and truth that the serpent assured her that the forbidden fruit was not apples it was chestnuts  i said i was innocent then for i had not eaten any chestnuts  she said the serpent informed her that chestnut was a figurative term meaning an aged and mouldy joke  i turned pale at that for i have made many jokes to pass the weary time and some of them could have been of that sort though i had honestly supposed that they were new when i made them  she asked me if i had made one just at the time of the catastrophe  i was obliged to admit that i had made one to myself though not aloud  it was this  i was thinking about the falls and i said to myself how wonderful it is to see that vast body of water tumble down there then in an instant a bright thought flashed into my head and i let it fly saying it would be a deal more wonderful to see it tumble up thereand i was just about to kill myself with laughing at it when all nature broke loose in war and death and i had to flee for my life there she said with triumph that is just it the serpent mentioned that very jest and called it the first chestnut and said it was coeval with the creation  alas i am indeed to blame would that i were not witty oh would that i had never had that radiant thought  next year  we have named it cain  she caught it while i was up country trapping on the north shore of the erie caught it in the timber a couple of miles from our dugoutor it might have been four she isnt certain which  it resembles us in some ways and may be a relation  that is what she thinks but this is an error in my judgment  the difference in size warrants the conclusion that it is a different and new kind of animala fish perhaps though when i put it in the water to see it sank and she plunged in and snatched it out before there was opportunity for the experiment to determine the matter  i still think it is a fish but she is indifferent about what it is and will not let me have it to try  i do not understand this  the coming of the creature seems to have changed her whole nature and made her unreasonable about experiments  she thinks more of it than she does of any of the other animals but is not able to explain why  her mind is disorderedeverything shows it  sometimes she carries the fish in her arms half the night when it complains and wants to get to the water  at such times the water comes out of the places in her face that she looks out of and she pats the fish on the back and makes soft sounds with her mouth to soothe it and betrays sorrow and solicitude in a hundred ways  i have never seen her do like this with any other fish and it troubles me greatly  she used to carry the young tigers around so and play with them before we lost our property but it was only play she never took on about them like this when their dinner disagreed with them  sunday  she doesnt work sundays but lies around all tired out and likes to have the fish wallow over her and she makes fool noises to amuse it and pretends to chew its paws and that makes it laugh i have not seen a fish before that could laugh  this makes me doubt  i have come to like sunday myself  superintending all the week tires a body so  there ought to be more sundays in the old days they were tough but now they come handy  wednesday  it isnt a fish  i cannot quite make out what it is  it makes curious devilish noises when not satisfied and says googoo when it is  it is not one of us for it doesnt walk it is not a bird for it doesnt fly it is not a frog for it doesnt hop it is not a snake for it doesnt crawl i feel sure it is not a fish though i cannot get a chance to find out whether it can swim or not  it merely lies around and mostly on its back with its feet up  i have not seen any other animal do that before  i said i believed it was an enigma but she only admired the word without understanding it  in my judgment it is either an enigma or some kind of a bug  if it dies i will take it apart and see what its arrangements are  i never had a thing perplex me so  three months later  the perplexity augments instead of diminishing  i sleep but little it has ceased from lying around and goes about on its four legs now  yet it differs from the other fourlegged animals in that its front legs are unusually short consequently this causes the main part of its person to stick up uncomfortably high in the air and this is not attractive  it is built much as we are but its method of travelling shows that it is not of our breed  the short front legs and long hind ones indicate that it is of the kangaroo family but it is a marked variation of the species since the true kangaroo hops whereas this one never does  still it is a curious and interesting variety and has not been catalogued before as i discovered it i have felt justified in securing the credit of the discovery by attaching my name to it and hence have called it kangaroorum adamiensis  it must have been a young one when it came for it has grown exceedingly since  it must be five times as big now as it was then and when discontented is able to make from twentytwo to thirtyeight times the noise it made at first  coercion does not modify this but has the contrary effect  for this reason i discontinued the system  she reconciles it by persuasion and by giving it things which she had previously told it she wouldnt give it  as already observed i was not at home when it first came and she told me she found it in the woods it seems odd that it should be the only one yet it must be so for i have worn myself out these many weeks trying to find another one to add to my collection and for this one to play with for surely then it would be quieter and we could tame it more easily but i find none nor any vestige of any and strangest of all no tracks  it has to live on the ground it cannot help itself therefore how does it get about without leaving a track i have set a dozen traps but they do no good  i catch all small animals except that one animals that merely go into the trap out of curiosity i think to see what the milk is there for  they never drink it  three months later  the kangaroo still continues to grow which is very strange and perplexing  i never knew one to be so long getting its growth it has fur on its head now not like kangaroo fur but exactly like our hair except that it is much finer and softer and instead of being black is red  i am like to lose my mind over the capricious and harassing developments of this unclassifiable zoological freak if i could catch another onebut that is hopeless it is a new variety and the only sample this is plain  but i caught a true kangaroo and brought it in thinking that this one being lonesome would rather have that for company than have no kin at all or any animal it could feel a nearness to or get sympathy from in its forlorn condition here among strangers who do not know its ways or habits or what to do to make it feel that it is among friends but it was a mistakeit went into such fits at the sight of the kangaroo that i was convinced it had never seen one before  i pity the poor noisy little animal but there is nothing i can do to make it happy  if i could tame itbut that is out of the question the more i try the worse i seem to make it  it grieves me to the heart to see it in its little storms of sorrow and passion  i wanted to let it go but she wouldnt hear of it  that seemed cruel and not like her and yet she may be right  it might be lonelier than ever for since i cannot find another one how could it  five months later  it is not a kangaroo  no for it supports itself by holding to her finger and thus goes a few steps on its hind legs and then falls down  it is probably some kind of a bear and yet it has no tailas yetand no fur except on its head  it still keeps on growingthat is a curious circumstance for bears get their growth earlier than this  bears are dangeroussince our catastropheand i shall not be satisfied to have this one prowling about the place much longer without a muzzle on  i have offered to get her a kangaroo if she would let this one go but it did no goodshe is determined to run us into all sorts of foolish risks i think  she was not like this before she lost her mind  a fortnight later  i examined its mouth  there is no danger yet it has only one tooth  it has no tail yet  it makes more noise now than it ever did beforeand mainly at night  i have moved out  but i shall go over mornings to breakfast and to see if it has more teeth if it gets a mouthful of teeth it will be time for it to go tail or no tail for a bear does not need a tail in order to be dangerous  four months later  i have been off hunting and fishing a month up in the region that she calls buffalo i dont know why unless it is because there are not any buffaloes there  meantime the bear has learned to paddle around all by itself on its hind legs and says poppa and momma  it is certainly a new species  this resemblance to words may be purely accidental of course and may have no purpose or meaning but even in that case it is still extraordinary and is a thing which no other bear can do  this imitation of speech taken together with general absence of fur and entire absence of tail sufficiently indicates that this is a new kind of bear  the further study of it will be exceedingly interesting  meantime i will go off on a far expedition among the forests of the north and make an exhaustive search  there must certainly be another one somewhere and this one will be less dangerous when it has company of its own species  i will go straightway but i will muzzle this one first  three months later  it has been a weary weary hunt yet i have had no success  in the mean time without stirring from the home estate she has caught another one  i never saw such luck  i might have hunted these woods a hundred years i never should have run across that thing  next day  i have been comparing the new one with the old one and it is perfectly plain that they are the same breed  i was going to stuff one of them for my collection but she is prejudiced against it for some reason or other so i have relinquished the idea though i think it is a mistake  it would be an irreparable loss to science if they should get away  the old one is tamer than it was and can laugh and talk like the parrot having learned this no doubt from being with the parrot so much and having the imitative faculty in a highly developed degree  i shall be astonished if it turns out to be a new kind of parrot and yet i ought not to be astonished for it has already been everything else it could think of since those first days when it was a fish  the new one is as ugly now as the old one was at first has the same sulphurandrawmeat complexion and the same singular head without any fur on it  she calls it abel  ten years later  they are boys we found it out long ago  it was their coming in that small immature shape that puzzled us we were not used to it there are some girls now  abel is a good boy but if cain had stayed a bear it would have improved him  after all these years i see that i was mistaken about eve in the beginning it is better to live outside the garden with her than inside it without her at first i thought she talked too much but now i should be sorry to have that voice fall silent and pass out of my life  blessed be the chestnut that brought us near together and taught me to know the goodness of her heart and the sweetness of her spirit
