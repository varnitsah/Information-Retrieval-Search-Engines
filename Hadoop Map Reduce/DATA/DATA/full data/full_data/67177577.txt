67177577	the life and death of mr badman     note    the life and death of mr badman was published by john bunyan in 1680 two years after the first edition of the first part of the pilgrims progress  in the opening sentence of his preface he tells us it was intended by him as the counterpart or companion picture to the allegory  but whatever his own intentions may have been the public of his own time seem to have declined to accept the book in this capacity  indeed another writer who signs himself t s undertook to complete bunyans allegory for him in a book in size and type closely resembling it and entitled the second part of the pilgrims progress    exactly described under the similitude of a dream  it was printed for jho malthus at the sun in the poultry and published in 1683  so far as is known only one copy of this book is now in existence the copy which was formerly in the library of the poet southey and now in that of the baptist union  upon this bunyan seems to have changed his purpose so far as the life and death of mr badman was concerned and on the first of january 1685 published the story of christiana and her children as his own second part of the pilgrims progress  the work before us therefore now stands apart by itself  in its composition bunyan seems to have been greatly influenced so far as form is concerned by a book which his wife brought with her on her marriage and which as he tells us in his grace abounding they read together  it was entitled the plaine mans pathway to heaven by arthur dent preacher of the word of god at south shoobury in essex  the eleventh impression the earliest now known is dated 1609  both books are in dialogue form and in each case the dialogue is supposed to be carried on through one long day bunyans mr wiseman like dents theologus holds forth instructive discourse while the mr attentive of the former like the philagathus of the latter listens and draws on his teacher by friendly questionings  there is not in bunyans conference as there is in dents an asunetus who plays the part of an ignorant man to come out enlightened and convinced at last or an antilegon who carps and cavils all the way and there is not in dents book what there is in bunyans a biographical narrative connecting the various parts of the dialogue but the groundwork of each is the samea searching manifestation and exposure of the nature and evils of various forms of immorality  bunyans book came out in 1680 and was published by nathaniel ponder who was also the publisher of the pilgrims progress  a third edition appeared in 1696 but as no copy of the second edition is known to exist no date can be assigned to it  in 1684 johannes boekholt a publisher in amsterdam obtained leave of the state to issue a dutch translation with the title het leven en sterben van mr quaat  this edition was illustrated by five copper plate engravings executed by jan luiken the eminent dutch engraver who also illustrated the pilgrims progress the following year  in 1782 a welsh version translated by t lewys was published at liverpool with the title  bywyd a marwolaeth yr annuwiol dan enw mr drygddyn  a gaelic version also was published at inverness in 1824 entitled beath agus bas mhr drochduine  the present edition 1a has been reprinted from a copy of the first issue lent by the trustees of the bunyan church at bedford and the proofs read with a second copy of the same issue in the library of the british museum  for convenience of reading as in other issues of this series of cambridge english classics the old type forms of j s u etc have been made uniform with those in general modern use but neither the spelling including the use of capitals and italics nor the punctuation has been altered save as specified  effect has been given to the errata noted by bunyan himself and printed on page 15 of this issue  the text of this edition of bunyans holy war 1b is a careful reproduction of the first edition of 1682  it is not certain that there was any further authentic reprint in bunyans lifetime  for though both in the bodleian and the british museum there is a copy purporting to be a second edition and bearing date 1684 it is difficult to resist the impression that they are pirated copies similar to those of which nathaniel ponder complained so bitterly in the case of the pilgrims progress  for both paper and typography are greatly inferior to those of the first edition some of bunyans most characteristic marginalia are carelessly omitted bunyans own titlethe holy war made by shaddai upon diabolus for the regaining of the metropolis of the worldis altered to the feebler and more commonplace formthe holy war made by christ upon the devil for the regaining of man and further when a new edition was issued in 1696 the alterations and omissions of 168 4 were ignored and a simple reprint made of the first edition of 1682  j b 1c 9 october 1905    the author to the reader    courteous reader  i was considering with my self what i had written concerning the progress of the pilgrim from this world to glory and how it had been acceptable to many in this nation  it came again into my mind to write as then of him that was going to heaven so now of the life and death of the ungodly and of their travel from this world to hell  the which in this i have done and have put it as thou seest under the name and title of mr badman a name very proper for such a subject  i have also put it into the form of a dialogue that i might with more ease to my self and pleasure to the reader perform the work  and although as i said i have put it forth in this method yet have i as little as may be gone out of the road of mine own observation of things  yea i think i may truly say that to the best of my remembrance all the things that here i discourse of i mean as to matter of fact have been acted upon the stage of this world even many times before mine eyes  here therefore courteous reader i present thee with the life and death of mr badman indeed  yea i do trace him in his life from his childhood to his death that thou mayest as in a glass behold with thine own eyes the steps that take hold of hell and also discern while thou art reading of mr badmans death whether thou thy self art treading in his path thereto  and let me entreat thee to forbear quirking and mocking for that i say mr badman is dead but rather gravely enquire concerning thy self by the word whether thou art one of his linage or no  for mr badman has left many of his relations behind him yea the very world is overspread with his kindred  true some of his relations as he are gone to their place and long home but thousands of thousands are left behind as brothers sisters cousens nephews besides innumerable of his friends and associates  i may say and yet speak nothing but too much truth in so saying that there is scarce a fellowship a community or fraternity of men in the world but some of mr badmans relations are there  yea rarely can we find a family or houshold in a town where he has not left behind him either brother nephew or friend  the butt therefore that at this time i shoot at is wide and twill be as impossible for this book to go into several families and not to arrest some as for the kings messenger to rush into an house full of traitors and find none but honest men there  i cannot but think that this shot will light upon many since our fields are so full of this game but how many it will kill to mr badmans course and make alive to the pilgrims progress that is not in me to determine this secret is with the lord our god only and he alone knows to whom he will bless it to so good and so blessed an end  however i have put fire to the pan and doubt not but the report will quickly be heard  i told you before that mr badman had left many of his friends and relations behind him but if i survive them as thats a great question to me i may also write of their lives  however whether my life be longer or shorter this is my prayer at present that god will stir up witnesses against them that may either convert or confound them for wherever they live and roll in their wickedness they are the pest and plague of that countrey  england shakes and totters already by reason of the burden that mr badman and his friends have wickedly laid upon it  yea our earth reels and staggereth to and fro like a drunkard the transgression thereof is heavy upon it  courteous reader i will treat thee now even at the door and threshold of this house but only with this intelligence that mr badman lies dead within  be pleased therefore if thy leisure will serve thee to enter in and behold the state in which he is laid betwixt his deathbed and the grave  he is not buried as yet nor doth he stink as is designed he shall before he lies down in oblivion  now as others have had their funerals solemnized according to their greatness and grandure in the world so likewise mr badman forasmuch as he deserveth not to go down to his grave with silence has his funeral state according to his deserts  four things are usual at great mens funerals which we will take leave and i hope without offence to allude to in the funeral of mr badman  first they are sometimes when dead presented to their friends by their compleatly wrought images as lively as by cunning mens hands they can be that the remembrance of them may be renewed to their survivors the remembrance of them and their deeds  and this i have endeavoured to answer in my discourse of mr badman and therefore i have drawn him forth in his featours and actions from his childhood to his gray hairs  here therefore thou hast him lively set forth as in cutts both as to the minority flower and seniority of his age together with those actions of his life that he was most capable of doing in and under those present circumstances of time place strength and the opportunities that did attend him in these  secondly there is also usual at great mens funerals those badges and scutcheons of their honour that they have received from their ancestors or have been thought worthy of for the deeds and exploits they have done in their life  and here mr badman has his but such as vary from all men of worth but so much the more agreeing with the merit of his doings  they all have descended in state he only as an abominable branch  his deserts are the deserts of sin and therefore the scutcheons of honour that he has are only that he died without honour and at his end became a fool thou shalt not be joyned with them in burialthe seed of evil doers shall never be renowned  the funeral pomp therefore of mr badman is to wear upon his hearse the badges of a dishonourable and wicked life since his bones are full of the sins of his youth which shall lye down as job sayes in the dust with him  nor is it fit that any should be his attendants now at his death but such as with him conspired against their own souls in their life persons whose transgressions have made them infamous to all that have or shall know what they have done  some notice therefore i have also here in this little discourse given the reader of them who were his confederates in his life and attendants at his death with a hint either of some high villany committed by them as also of those judgments that have overtaken and fallen upon them from the just and revenging hand of god  all which are things either fully known by me as being eye and earwitness thereto or that i have received from such hands whose relation as to this i am bound to believe  and that the reader may know them from other things and passages herein contained i have pointed at them in the margent as with a finger thus  2a  thirdly the funerals of persons of quality have been solemnized with some suitable sermon at the time and place of their burial but that i am not come to as yet having got no further than to mr badmans death  but for as much as he must be buried after he hath stunk out his time before his beholders i doubt not but some such that we read are appointed to be at the burial of gog will do this work in my stead such as shall leave him neither skin nor bone above ground but shall set a sign by it till the buriers have buried it in the valley of hamongog ezek 39  fourthly at funerals there does use to be mourning and lamentation but here also mr badman differs from others his familiars cannot lament his departure for they have not sence of his damnable state they rather ring him and sing him to hell in the sleep of death in which he goes thither  good men count him no loss to the world his place can well be without him his loss is only his own and tis too late for him to recover that dammage or loss by a sea of bloody tears could he shed them  yea god has said he will laugh at his destruction who then shall lament for him saying ah my brother  he was but a stinking weed in his life nor was he better at all in his death  such may well be thrown over the wall without sorrow when once god has plucked them up by the roots in his wrath  reader if thou art of the race linage stock or fraternity of mr badman i tell thee before thou readest this book thou wilt neither brook the author nor it because he hath writ of mr badman as he has  for he that condemneth the wicked that die so passeth also the sentence upon the wicked that live  i therefore expect neither credit of nor countenance from thee for this narration of thy kinsmans life  for thy old love to thy friend his wayes doings c will stir up in thee enmity rather in thy very heart against me  i shall therefore incline to think of thee that thou wilt rent burn or throw it away in contempt  yea and wish also that for writing so notorious a truth some mischief may befall me  i look also to be loaded by thee with disdain scorn and contempt yea that thou shouldest railingly and vilifyingly say i lye and am a bespatterer of honest mens lives and deaths  for mr badman when himself was alive could not abide to be counted a knave though his actions told all that went by that indeed he was such an one how then should his brethren that survive him and that tread in his very steps approve of the sentence that by this book is pronounced against him  will they not rather imitate corah dathan and abirams friends even rail at me for condemning him as they did at moses for doing execution  i know tis ill pudling in the cockatrices den and that they run hazards that hunt the wildboar  the man also that writeth mr badmans life had need to be fenced with a coat of mail and with the staffe of a spear for that his surviving friends will know what he doth  but i have adventured to do it and to play at this time at the hole of these asps if they bite they bite if they sting they sting  christ sends his lambs in the midst of wolves not to do like them but to suffer by them for bearing plain testimony against their bad deeds  but had one not need to walk with a guard and to have a sentinel stand at ones door for this verily the flesh would be glad of such help yea a spiritual man could he tell how to get it  acts 23  but i am stript naked of these and yet am commanded to be faithful in my service for christ  well then i have spoken what i have spoken and now come on me what will job 13 13  true the text sayes rebuke a scorner and he will hate thee and that he that reproveth a wicked man getteth himself a blot and shame but what then  open rebuke is better than secret love and he that receives it shall find it so afterwards  so then whether mr badmans friends shall rage or laugh at what i have writ i know that the better end of the staffe is mine  my endeavour is to stop an hellish course of life and to save a soul from death jam 5 and if for so doing i meet with envy from them from whom in reason i should have thanks i must remember the man in the dream that cut his way through his armed enemies and so got into the beauteous palace i must i say remember him and do my self likewise  yet four things i will propound to the consideration of mr badmans friends before i turn my back upon them  1  suppose that there be an hell in very deed not that i do question it any more than i do whether there be a sun to shine but i suppose it for argument sake with mr badmans friends i say suppose there be an hell and that too such an one as the scripture speaks of one at the remotest distance from god and life eternall one where the worm of a guilty conscience never dyes and where the fire of the wrath of god is not quenched  suppose i say that there is such an hell prepared of god as there is indeed for the body and soul of the ungodly world after this life to be tormented in  i say do but with thy self suppose it and then tell me is it not prepared for thee thou being a wicked man  let thy conscience speak i say is it not prepared for thee thou being an ungodly man  and dost thou think wast thou there now that thou art able to wrestle with the judgment of god  why then do the fallen angers tremble there thy hands cannot be strong nor can thy heart endure in that day when god shall deal with thee  ezek 22 14  2  suppose that some one that is now a soul in hell for sin was permitted to come hither again to dwell and that they had a grant also that upon amendment of life next time the dye to change that place for heaven ant glory what sayest thou o wicked man would such an one thinkest thou run again into the same course of life as before and venture the damnation that for sin he had already been in  would he choose again to lead that cursed life that afresh would kindle the flames of hell upon him and that would bind him up under the heavy wrath of god  o he would not he would not the sixteenth of luke insinuates it  yea reason it self awake would abhorr it and tremble at such a thought  3  suppose again that thou that livest and rollest in thy sin and that as yet hast known nothing but the pleasure thereof shouldst be by an angel conveyed to some place where with convenience from thence thou mightest have a view of heaven and hell of the joyes of the one and the torments of the other i say suppose that from thence thou mightest have such a view thereof as would convince thy reason that both heaven and hell are such realities as by the word they are declared to be wouldest thou thinkest thou when brought to thy home again chuse to thy self thy former life to wit to return to thy folly again  no if belief of what thou sawest remained with thee thou wouldest eat fire and brimstone first  4  i will propound again  suppose that there was amongst us such a law and such a magistrate to inflict the penalty that for every open wickedness committed by thee so much of thy flesh should with burning pincers be plucked from thy bones  wouldest thou then go on in thy open way of lying swearing drinking and whoring as thou with delight doest now  surely surely no  the fear of the punishment would make thee forbear yea would make thee tremble even then when thy lusts were powerfull to think what a punishment thou wast sure to sustain so soon as the pleasure was over  but oh the folly the madness the desperate madness that is in the hearts of mr badmans friends who in despite of the threatnings of an holy and sin revenging god and of the outcries and warnings of all good men yea that will in despite of the groans and torments of those that are now in hell for sin luk 16 24 28 go on in a sinfull course of life yea though every sin is also a step of descent down to that infernal cave  o how true is that saying of solomon the heart of the sons of men is full of evil and madness is in their heart while they live and after that they go to the dead eccles 9 3  to the dead that is to the dead in hell to the damned dead the place to which those that have dyed bad men are gone and that those that live bad men are like to go to when a little more sin like stollen waters hath been imbibed by their sinful souls  that which has made me publish this book is  1  for that wickedness like a flood is like to drown our english world  it begins already to be above the tops of mountains it has almost swallowed up all our youth our middle age old age and all are almost carried away of this flood  o debauchery debauchery what hast thou done in england  thou hast corrupted our young men and hast made our old men beasts thou hast deflowered our virgins and hast made matrons bawds  thou hast made our earth to reel to and fro like a drunkard tis in danger to be removed like a cottage yea it is because transgression is so heavy upon it like to fall and rise no more  isa 24 20  o that i could mourn for england and for the sins that are committed therein even while i see that without repentance the men of gods wrath are about to deal with us each having his slaughtering weapon in his hand  ezek 9 1 2  well i have written and by gods assistance shall pray that this flood may abate in england  and could i but see the tops of the mountains above it i should think that these waters were abating  2  it is the duty of those that can to cry out against this deadly plague yea to lift up their voice as with a trumpet against it that men may he awakened about it flye from it as from that which is the greatest of evils  sin pulld angels out of heaven pulls men down to hell and overthroweth kingdoms  who that sees an house on fire will not give the allarum to them that dwell therein who that sees the land invaded will not set the beacons on a fame  who that sees the devils as roaring lyons continually devouring souls will not make an outcry  but above all when we see sin sinful sin a swallowing up a nation sinking of a nation and bringing its inhabitants to temporal spiritual and eternal ruine shall we not cry out and cry they are drunk but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink they are intoxicated with the deadly poyson of sin which will if its malignity be not by wholsom means allayed bring soul and body and estate and countrey and all to ruin and destruction  3  in and by this my outcry i shall deliver my self from the ruins of them that perish  for a man can do no more in this matter i mean a man in my capacity than to detect and condemn the wickedness warn the evil doer of the judgment and fly therefrom my self  but oh that i might not only deliver my self  oh that many would hear and turn at this my cry from sin that they may be secured from the death and judgment that attend it  why i have handled the matter in this method is best known to my self  and why i have concealed most of the names of the persons whose sins or punishments i here and there in this book make relation of is  1  for that neither the sins nor judgments were all alike open the sins of some were committed and the judgments executed for them only in a corner  not to say that i could not learn some of their names for could i i should not have made them publick for this reason  2  because i would not provoke those of their relations that survive them i would not justly provoke them and yet as i think i should should i have intailed their punishment to their sins and both to their names and so have turned them into the world  3  nor would i lay them under disgrace and contempt which would as i think unavoidably have happened unto them had i withall inserted their names  as for those whose names i mention their crimes or judgments were manifest publick almost as any thing of that nature that happeneth to mortal men  such therefore have published their own shame by their sin and god his anger by taking of open vengeance  as job sayes god has strook them as wicked men in the open sight of others job 34 26  so that i cannot conceive since their sin and judgment was so conspicuous that my admonishing the world thereof should turn to their detriment  for the publishing of these things are so far as relation is concerned intended for remembrancers  that they may also bethink themselves repent and turn to god lest the judgments for their sins should prove hereditary  for the god of heaven hath threatned to visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children if they hate him to the third and fourth generation exod 20 5  nebuchadnezzars punishment for his pride being open for he was for his sin driven from his kingly dignity and from among men too to eat grass like an ox and to company with the beasts daniel did not stick to tell belshazzar his son to his face thereof nor to publish it that it might be read and remembred by the generations to come  the same may be said of judas and ananias c for their sin and punishment were known to all the dwellers at jerusalem acts 1 chap 5  nor is it a sign but of desperate impenitence and hardness of heart when the offspring or relations of those who have fallen by open fearfull and prodigious judgments for their sin shall overlook forget pass by or take no notice of such high outgoings of god against them and their house  thus daniel aggravates belshazzars crime for that he hardened his heart in pride though he knew that for that very sin and transgression his father was brought down from his height and made to be a companion for asses and thou his son o belshazzar sayes he hast not humbled thy heart though thou knewest all this  dan 5  a home reproof indeed but home is most fit for an open and continuedin transgression  let those then that are the offspring or relations of such who by their own sin and the dreadfull judgments of god are made to become a sign deut 16 9 10 having been swept as dung from off the face of the earth beware lest when judgment knocks at their door for their sins as it did before at the door of their pregenitors it falls also with as heavy a stroak as on them that went before them  lest i say they in that day instead of finding mercy find for their high daring and judgment affrontingsins judgment without mercy  to conclude let those that would not dye mr badmans death take heed of mr badmans wayes  for his wayes bring to his end wickedness will not deliver him that is given to it though they should cloak all with a profession of religion  if it was a transgression of old for a man to wear a womans apparel surely it is a transgression now for a sinner to wear a christian profession for a cloak  wolves in sheeps cloathing swarm in england this day  wolves both as to doctrine and as to practice too  some men make a profession i doubt on purpose that they may twist themselves into a trade and thence into an estate yea and if need be into an estate knavishly by the ruins of their neighbour  let such take heed for those that do such things have the greater damnation  christian make thy profession shine by a conversation according to the gospel  or else thou wilt damnifie religion bring scandal to thy brethren and give offence to the enemies and twould be better that a millstone was hanged about thy neck and that thou as so adorned wast cast into the bottom of the sea than so to do  christian a profession according to the gospel is in these dayes a rare thing seek then after it put it on and keep it without spot and as becomes thee white and clean and thou shalt be a rare christian  the prophecy of the last times is that professing men for so i understand the text shall be many of them base 2 tim 3 but continue thou in the things that thou hast learned not of wanton men not of licentious times but of the word and doctrine of god that is according to godliness and thou shalt walk with christ in white  now god almighty give his people grace not to hate or malign sinners nor yet to choose any of their wayes but to keep themselves pure from the blood of all men by speaking and doing according to that name and those rules that they profess to know and love for jesus christs sake  john bunyan    books lately printed for and sold by nathaniel ponder at the peacock

attentive    wiseman  good morrow my good neighbour mr attentive whither are you walking so early this morning methinks you look as if you were concerned about something more than ordinary  have you lost any of your cattel or what is the matter  attentive  good sir good morrow to you i have not as yet lost ought but yet you give a right ghess of me for i am as you say concerned in my heart but tis because of the badness of the times  and sir you as all our neighbours know are a very observing man pray therefore what do you think of them  wise  why  i think as you say to wit that they are bad times and bad they will be untill men are better  for they are bad men that make bad times if men therefore would mend so would the times  tis a folly to look for good dayes so long as sin is so high and those that study its nourishment so many  god bring it down and those that nourish it to repentance and then my good neighbour you will be concerned not as you are now  now you are concerned because times are so bad but then you will be so cause times are so good  now you are concerned so as to be perplexed but then you will be concerned so as to lift up your voice with shouting for i dare say could you see such dayes they would make you shout  atten  ai so they would such times i have prayed for such times i have longed for  but i fear theyl be worse before they be better  wise  make no conclusions man  for he that hath the hearts of men in his hand can change them from worse to better and so bad times into good  god give long life to them that are good and especially to those of them that are capable of doing him service in the world  the ornament and beauty of this lower world next to god and his wonders are the men that spangle and shine in godliness  now as mr wiseman said this he gave a great sigh  atten  amen  amen  but why good sir do you sigh so deeply is it for ought else than that for the which as you have perceived i my self am concerned  wise  i am concerned with you for the badness of the times but that was not the cause of that sigh of the which as i see you take notice  i sighed at the remembrance of the death of that man for whom the bell tolled at our town yesterday  atten  why  i trow mr goodman your neighbour is not dead indeed i did hear that he had been sick  wise  no no it is not he  had it been he i could not but have been concerned but yet not as i am concerned now  if he had died i should only have been concerned for that the world had lost a light  but the man that i am concerned for now was one that never was good therefore such an one who is not dead only but damned he died that he might die he went from life to death and then from death to death from death natural to death eternal  and as he spake this the water stood in his eyes  atten  indeed to goe from a deathbed to hell is a fearful thing to think on  but good neighbour wiseman be pleased to tell me who this man was and why you conclude him so miserable in his death  wise  well if you can stay i will tell you who he was and why i conclude thus concerning him  atten  my leisure will admit me to stay and i am willing to hear you out  and i pray god your discourse may take hold on my heart that i may be bettered thereby  so they agreed to sit down under a tree  then mr wiseman proceeded as followeth  wise  the man that i mean is one mr badman he has lived in our town a great while and now as i said he is dead  but the reason of my being so concerned at his death is not for that he was at all related to me or for that any good conditions died with him for he was far from them but for that as i greatly fear he hath as was hinted before died two deaths at once  atten  i perceive what you mean by two deaths at once and to speak truth tis a fearfull thing thus to have ground to think of any  for although the death of the ungodly and sinners is laid to heart but of few yet to die in such a state is more dreadful and fearful than any man can imagine  indeed if a man had no soul if his state was not truely immortal the matter would not be so much but for a man to be so disposed of by his maker as to be appointed a sensible being for ever and for him too to fall into the hands of revenging justice that will be always to the utmost extremity that his sin deserveth punishing of him in the dismal dungeon of hell this must needs be unutterably sad and lamentable  wise  there is no man i think that is sensible of the worth of one soul but must when he hears of the death of unconverted men be stricken with sorrow and grief  because as you said well that mans state is such that he has a sensible being for ever  for tis sense that makes punishment heavy  but yet sense is not all that the damned have they have sense and reason too so then as sense receiveth punishment with sorrow because it feels and bleeds under the same so by reason and the exercise thereof in the midst of torment all present affliction is aggravated and that three manner of wayes  1  reason will consider thus with himself for what am i thus tormented and will easily find tis for nothing but that base and filthy thing sin and now will vexation be mixed with punishment and that will greatly heighten the affliction  2  reason will consider thus with himself  how long must this be my state  and will soon return to himself this answer  this must be my state for ever and ever  now this will greatly increase the torment  3  reason will consider thus with himself what have i lost more than present ease and quiet by my sins that i have committed  and will quickly return himself this answer  i have lost communion with god christ saints and angels and a share in heaven and eternal life  and this also must needs greaten the misery of poor damned souls  and this is the case of mr badman  atten  i feel my heart even shake at the thoughts of coming into such a state  hell who knows that is yet alive what the torments of hell are  this word hell gives a very dreadful sound  wise  ai so it does in the ears of him that has a tender conscience  but if as you say and that truly the very name of hell is so dreadful what is the place it self and what are the punishments that are there inflicted and that without the least intermission upon the souls of damned men for ever and ever  atten  well but passing this my leisure will admit me to stay and therefore pray tell me what it is that makes you think that mr badman is gone to hell  wise  i will tell you  but first do you know which of the badmans i mean  atten  why was there more of them than one  wise  o yes a great many both brothers and sisters and yet all of them the children of a godly parent the more a great deal is the pity  atten  which of them therefore was it that died  wise  the eldest old in years and old in sin but the sinner that dies an hundred years old shall be accursed  atten  well but what makes you think he is gone to hell  wise  his wicked life and fearful death specially since the manner of his death was so corresponding with his life  atten  pray let me know the manner of his death if your self did perfectly know it  wise  i was there when he died  but i desire not to see another such man while i live die in such sort as he did  atten  pray therefore let me hear it  wise  you say you have leisure and can stay and therefore if you please we will discourse even orderly of him  first we will begin with his life and then proceed to his death  because a relation of the first may the more affect you when you shall hear of the second  atten  did you then so well know his life  wise  i knew him of a child  i was a man when he was but a boy and i made special observation of him from first to last  atten  pray then let me hear from you an account of his life but be as brief as you can for i long to hear of the manner of his death  wise  i will endeavour to answer your desires and first i will tell you that from a child he was very bad  his very beginning was ominous and presaged that no good end was in likelyhood to follow thereupon  there were several sins that he was given to when but a little one that manifested him to be notoriously infected with original corruption for i dare say he learned none of them of his father or mother nor was he admitted to go much abroad among other children that were vile to learn to sin of them  nay contrariwise if at any time he did get abroad amongst others he would be as the inventer of bad words and an example in bad actions  to them all he used to be as we say the ring leader and mastersinner from a childe  atten  this was a bad beginning indeed and did demonstrate that he was as you say polluted very much polluted with original corruption  for to speak my mind freely i do confess that it is mine opinion that children come polluted with sin into the world and that ofttimes the sins of their youth especially while they are very young are rather by vertue of indwelling sin than by examples that are set before them by others  not but that they learn to sin by example too but example is not the root but rather the temptation unto wickedness  the root is sin within for from within out of the heart of man proceedeth sin 20a 20b  wise  i am glad to hear that you are of this opinion and to confirm what you have said by a few hints from the word  man in his birth is compared to an ass an unclean beast and to a wretched infant in its blood  besides all the firstborn of old that were offered unto the lord were to be redeemed at the age of a month and that was before they were sinners by imitation  the scripture also affirmeth 21a that by the sin of one judgement came upon all and renders this reason for that all have sinned nor is that objection worth a rush that christ by his death hath taken away original sin  first because it is scriptureless secondly because it makes them incapable of salvation by christ for none but those that in their own persons are sinners are to have salvation by him  many other things might be added but between persons so well agreed as you and i are these may suffice at present  but when an antagonist comes to deal with us about this matter then we have for him often other strong arguments if he be an antagonist worth the taking notice of 21b  atten  but as was hinted before he used to be the ringleading sinner or the master of mischief among other children yet these are but generals pray therefore tell me in particular which were the sins of his childhood  wise  i will so  when he was but a child he was so addicted to lying 21c that his parents scarce knew when to believe he spake true yea he would invent tell and stand to the lyes that he invented and told and that with such an audacious face that one might even read in his very countenance the symptoms of an hard and desperate heart this way  atten  this was an ill beginning indeed and argueth that he began to harden himself in sin betimes  for a lye cannot be knowingly told and stood in and i perceive that this was his manner of way in lying but he must as it were force his own heart into it  yea he must make his heart 21d hard and bold to doe it  yea he must be arrived to an exceeding pitch of wickedness thus to doe since all this he did against that good education that before you seemed to hint he had from his father and mother  wise  the want of good education as you have intimated is many times a cause why children doe so easily so soon become bad especially when there is not only a want of that but bad examples enough as the more is the pity there is in many families by vertue of which poor children are trained up in sin and nursed therein for the devil and hell  but it was otherwise with mr badman for to my knowledge this his way of lying was a great grief to his parents for their hearts were much dejected at this beginning of their son nor did there want counsel and correction from them to him if that would have made him better  he wanted not to be told in my hearing and that over and over and over that all lyars should have their part in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone and that whosoever loveth and maketh a lye should not have any part in the new and heavenly jerusalem  22a but all availed nothing with him when a fit or an occasion to lie came upon him he would invent tell and stand to his lie as steadfastly as if it had been the biggest of truths that he told and that with that hardening of his heart and face that it would be to those that stood by a wonder  nay and this he would doe when under the rod of correction which is appointed by god for parents to use that thereby they might keep their children from hell 22b  atten  truly it was as i said a bad beginning he served the devil betimes yea he became a nurse to one of his 22c brats for a spirit of lying is the devils brat 22d for he is a liar and the father of it  wise  right he is the father of it indeed  a lie is begot by the devil as the father and is brought forth by the wicked heart as the mother  wherefore another scripture also saith why hath satan filled thy heart to lye 22e c  yea he calleth the heart that is big with a lye an heart that hath conceived that is by the devil  why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart thou hast not lied unto men but unto god  true his lye was a lye of the highest nature but every lye hath the 22f same father and mother as had the lie last spoken of  for he is a lier and the father of it  a lie then is the brat of hell and it cannot 23a be in the heart before the person has committed a kind of spiritual adultery with the devil  that soul therefore that telleth a known lie has lien with and conceived it by lying with the devil the only father of lies  for a lie has only one father and mother the devil and the heart  no marvel therefore if the hearts that hatch and bring forth lies be so much of complexion with the devil yea no marvel though god and christ have so bent their word against lyers  a lyer is weded to the devil himself  atten  it seems a marvellous thing in mine eyes that since a lye is the offspring of the devill and since a lye brings the soul to the very den of devils to wit the dark dungeon of hell that men should be so desperately wicked as to accustom themselves to so horrible a thing  wise  it seems also marvellous to me specially when i observe for how little a matter some men will study contrive make and tell a lye  you shall have some that will lye it over and over and that for a peny 23b profit  yea lye and stand in it although they know that they lye  yea you shall have some men that will not stick to tell lye after lye though themselves get nothing thereby they will tell lyes in their ordinary discourse with their neighbours also their news their jests and their tales must needs be adorned with lyes or else they seem to bear no good sound to the ear nor shew much to the fancie of him to whom they are told  but alas what will these lyers doe when for their lyes they shall be tumbled down into hell to that devil that did beget those lyes in their heart and so be tormented by fire and brimstone with him and that for ever and ever for their lyes  atten  can you not give one some example of gods judgements upon lyers that one may tell them to lyers when one hears them lye if perhaps they may by the hearing thereof be made afraid and ashamed to lye  wise  examples why 23c saphira and his wife are examples enough to put a stop one would think to a spirit addicted thereto for they both were stricken down dead for telling a lye and that by god himself in the midst of a company of people  but if gods threatning of liers with hellfire and with the loss of the kingdom of heaven will not prevail with them to leave off to lie and make lies it cannot be imagined that a relation of temporal judgements that have swept liers out of the world heretofore should do it  now as i said this lying was one of the first sins that mr badman was addicted to and he could make them and tell them fearfully  atten  i am sorry to hear this of him and so much the more because as i fear this sin did not reign in him 24a alone for usually one that is accustomed to lying is also accustomed to other evils besides and if it were not so also with mr badman it would be indeed a wonder  wise  you say true the lier is a captive slave of more than the spirit of lying  and therefore this mr badman as he was a lier from a child so he was also much given to 24b pilfer and steal so that what he could as we say handsomly lay his hands on that was counted his own whether they were the things of his fellow children or if he could lay hold of any thing at a neighbours house he would take it away you must understand me of trifles for being let but a child he attempted no great matter especially at first  but yet as he grew up in strength and ripeness of wit so he attempted to pilfer and steal things still of more value than at first  he took at last great pleasure in robbing of gardens and orchards and as he grew up to steal pullen from the neighbourhood  yea what was his 24c fathers could not escape his fingers all was fish that came to his net so hardened at last was he in this mischief also  atten  you make me wonder more and more  what play the thief too  what play the thief so soon  he could not but know though he was but a child that what he took from others was none of his own  besides if his father was a good man as you say it could not be but he must also hear from him that to steal was to transgress the law of god and so to run the hazard of eternal damnation  wise  his father was not wanting to use the means to reclaim him often urging as i have been told that saying in the law of moses 24d thou shalt not steal  and also that this is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth for every one that stealeth shall be cut off c 25a  the light of nature also though he was little must needs shew him that what he took from others was not his own and that he would not willingly have been served so himself  but all was to no purpose let father and conscience say what they would to him he would go on he was resolved to go on in his wickedness  atten  but his father would as you intimate sometimes rebuke him for his wickedness pray how would he carry it then  wise  how why like to a thief that is found  he would stand 25b gloating and hanging down his head in a sullen pouching manner a body might read as we use to say the picture of ill luck in his face and when his father did demand his answer to such questions concerning his villany he would grumble and mutter at him and that should be all he could get  atten  but you said that he would also rob his father methinks that was an unnatural thing  wise  natural or unnatural all is one to a thief  beside you must think that he had likewise companions to whom he was for the wickedness that he saw in them more 25c firmly knit than either to father or mother  yea and what had he cared if father and mother had died for grief for him  their death would have been as he would have counted great release and liberty to him  for the truth is they and their counsel was his bondage yea and if i forget not i have heard some say that when he was at times among his companions he would greatly 25d rejoyce to think that his parents were old and could not live long and then quoth he i shall be mine own man to do what i list without their controul  atten  then it seems he counted that robbing of his parents was no crime  wise  none at all and therefore he fell directly under that sentence whoso robbeth his father or his mother and saith it is no transgression the same is the companion of a destroyer  and for that he set so light by them as to their persons and counsels twas a sign that at present he was of a very abominable spirit 26a and that some judgement waited to take hold of him in time to come  atten  but can you imagin what it was i mean in his conceit for i speak not now of the suggestions of satan by which doubtless he was put on to do these things i say what it should be in his conceit that should make him think that this his manner of pilfering and stealing was no great matter  wise  it was for that the things that he stole were small to rob orchards and gardens and to steal pullen and the like these he counted 26b tricks of youth nor would he be beat out of it by all that his friends could say  they would tell him that he must not covet or desire and yet to desire is less than to take even any thing the least thing that was his neighbours and that if he did it would be a transgression of the law but all was one to him  what through the wicked talk of his companions and the delusion of his own corrupt heart he would go on in his pilfering course and where he thought himself secure would talk of and laugh at it when he had done  atten  well 26c i heard a man once when he was upon the ladder with the rope about his neck confess when ready to be turned off by the hangman that that which had brought him to that end was his accustoming of himself when young to pilfer and steal small things  to my best remembrance he told us that he began the trade of a thief by stealing pins and points and therefore did forewarn all the youth that then were gathered together to see him die to take heed of beginning though but with little sins because by tampering at first with little ones way is made for the commission of bigger  wise  since you are entred upon storyes i also will tell you one the which 26d though i heard it not with mine own ears yet my author i dare believe  26e it is concerning one old tod that was hanged about twenty years agoe or more at hartford for being a thief  the story is this  at 27a a summer assizes holden at hartford while the judge was sitting upon the bench comes this old tod into the court cloathed in a green suit with his leathern girdle in his hand his bosom open and all on a dung sweat as if he had run for his life and being come in he spake aloud as follows  27b my lord said he here is the veryest rogue that breaths upon the face of the earth i have been a thief from a child  when i was but a little one i gave my self to rob orchards and to do other such like wicked things and i have continued a thief ever since  my lord there has not been a robbery committed thus many years within so many miles if this place but i have either been at it or privy to it  the judge thought the fellow was mad but after some conference with some of the justices they agreed to indict him and so they did of several felonious actions to all which he heartily confessed guilty and so was hanged with his wife at the same time  atten  this is a remarkable story indeed and you think it is a true one  wise  it is not only remarkable but pat to our purpose  this thief like mr badman began his trade betimes he began too where mr badman began even at robbing of orchards and other such things which brought him as you may perceive from sin to sin till at last it brought him to the publick shame of sin which is the gallows  as for the truth of this story the relator told me that he was at the same time himself in the court and stood within less than two yards of old tod when he heard him aloud to utter the words  atten  these two sins of lying and stealing were a bad sign of an evil end  wise  so they were and yet mr badman came not to his end like old tod though i fear to as bad nay worse than was that death of the gallows though less discerned by spectators but more of that by and by  but you talk of these two sins as if these were all that mr badman was addicted to in his youth  alas alas he swarmed with sins even as a begger does with vermin and that when he was but a boy  atten  why what other sins was he addicted to i mean while he was but a child  wise  you need not ask to what other sins was he but to what other sins was he not addicted that is of such as suited with his age  for a man may safely say that nothing that was vile came amiss to him if he was but capable to do it  indeed some sins there be that childhood knows not how to be tampering with but i speak of sins that he was capable of committing of which i will nominate two or three more  and  first he could not endure the 28a lords day because of the holiness that did attend it the beginning of that day was to him as if he was going to prison except he could get out from his father and mother and lurk in byholes among his companions untill holy duties were over  reading the scriptures hearing sermons godly conference repeating of sermons and prayer were things that he could not away with and therefore if his father on such days as often he did though sometimes notwithstanding his diligence he would be sure to give him the slip did keep him strictly to the observation of the day he would plainly shew by all carriages that he was highly discontent therewith  he would sleep at duties would talk vainly with his brothers and as it were think every godly opportunity seven times as long as it was gruding till it was over  atten  this his abhorring of that day was not i think for the sake of the day itself  for as it is a day it is nothing else but as other days of the week  but i suppose it were think every godly as it was grudging till it that day was not i think as it is a day it is nothing of the week  but i suppose that the 28b reason of his loathing of it was for that god hath put sanctity and holiness upon it also because it is the day above all the days of the week that ought to be spent in holy devotion in remembrance of our lords resurrection from the dead  wise  yes twas therefore that he was such an enemy to it even because more restraint was laid upon him on that day from his own ways than were possible should be laid upon him on all others  atten  doth not god by instituting of a day unto holy duties make great proof how the hearts and inclinations of poor people do stand to holiness of heart and a conversation in holy duties  wise  29a yes doubtless and a man shall shew his heart and his life what they are more by one lordsday than by all the days of the week besides  and the reason is because on the lordsday there is a special restraint laid upon men as to thoughts and life more than upon other days of the week besides  also men are enjoyned on that day to a stricter performance of holy duties and restraint of worldly business than upon other days they are wherefore if their hearts incline not naturally to good now they will shew it now they will appear what they are  the lords day is a kind of an emblem of the heavenly sabbath above and it makes manifest how the heart stands to the perpetuity of holiness more than to be found in a transient duty does  on other days a man may be in and out of holy duties and all in a quarter of an hour but now the lords day is as it were a day that enjoyns to one perpetual duty of holiness  remember that thou keep holy the sabbath day 29b which by christ is not abrogated but changed into the first of the week not as it was given in particular to the jews but as it was sanctified by him from the beginning of the world and therefore is a greater proof of the frame and temper of a mans heart and does more make manifest to what he is inclined than doth his other performance of duties therefore god puts great difference between them that truly call and walk in this day as holy and count it honourable 29c upon the account that now they have an opportunity to shew how they delight to honour him 29d in that they have not only an hour but a whole day to shew it in  i say he puts great difference between these and that other sort that say when will the sabbath be gone that we may be at our worldly business 29e  the first he calleth a blessed man but brandeth the other for an unsanctified worldling  and indeed to delight ourselves in gods service upon his holy days gives a better proof of a sanctified nature than to grudge at the coming and to be weary of the holy duties of such dayes as mr badman did  atten  there may be something in what you say for he that cannot abide to keep one day holy to god to be sure he hath given a sufficient proof that he is an unsanctified man and as such what should he do in heaven that being the place where a perpetual sabath is to be kept to god 30a i say to be kept for ever and ever  and for ought i know one reason why one day in seven hath been by our lord set apart unto holy duties for men may be to give them conviction that there is enmity in the hearts of sinners to the god of heaven for he that hateth holiness hateth god himself they pretend to love god and yet love not a holy day and yet love not to spend that day in one continued act of holiness to the lord they had as good say nothing as to call him lord lord and yet not doe the things that he says  and this mr badman was such an one he could not abide this day nor any of the duties of it  indeed when he could get from his friends and so 30b spend it in all manner of idleness and profaneness then he would be pleased well enough  but what was this but a turning the day into night or other than taking an opportunity at gods forbidding to follow our callings to solace and satisfie our lusts and delights of the flesh  i take the liberty to speak thus of mr badman upon a confidence of what you sir have said of him is true  wise  you needed not to have made that apology for your censuring of mr badman for all that knew him will confirm what you said of him to be true  he could not abide either that day or any thing else that had the stamp or image of god upon it  sin sin and to do the thing that was naught was that which he delighted in and that from a little child  atten  i must say again i am sorry to hear it and that for his own sake and also for the sake of his relations who must needs be broken to pieces with such doings as these  for for these things sake comes the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience 30c and doubtless he must be gone to hell if he died without repentance and to beget a child for hell is sad for parents to think on  wise  of his dying as i told you i will give you a relation anon but now we are upon his life and upon the manner of his life in his childhood even of the sins that attended him then some of which i have mentioned already and indeed i have mentioned but some for yet there are more to follow and those not at all inferiour to what you have already heard  atten  pray what were they  wise  why he was greatly given and that while a lad to grievous 31a swearing and cursing  yea he then made no more of swearing and cursing than i do of telling my fingers  yea he would do it without provocation thereto  he counted it a glory to swear and curse and it was as natural to him as to eat and drink and sleep  atten  oh what a young villain was this here is as the apostle says a yielding of members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin 31b indeed  this is proceeding from evil to evil with a witness this argueth that he was a blackmouthed young wretch indeed  wise  he was so and yet as i told you he counted above all this kind of sinning to be 31c a badge of his honour  he reckoned himself a mans fellow when he had learnt to swear and curse boldly  atten  i am perswaded that many do think as you have said that to swear is a thing that does bravely become them and that it is the best way for a man when he would put authority or terrour into his words to stuff them full of the sin of swearing  wise  you say right else as i am perswaded men would not so usually belch out their blasphemous oaths as they do  they take a pride in it they think that to swear is gentlemanlike and having once accustomed themselves unto it they hardly leave it all the days of their lives  atten  well but now we are upon it pray shew me 31d the difference between swearing and cursing for there is a difference is there not  wise  yes  there is a difference between swearing and cursing swearing vain swearing such as young badman accustomed himself unto  now vain and sinful swearing 31e is a light and wicked calling of god c to witness to our vain and foolish attesting of things and those things are of two sorts  1  things that we swear are or shall be done  2  things so sworn to true or false  1  things that we swear are or shall be done  thou swearest thou hast done such a thing that such a thing is so or shall be so for it is no matter which of these it is that men swear about if it be done lightly and wickedly and groundlesly it is vain because it is a sin against the third commandement which says thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain 32a for this is a vain using of that holy and sacred name and so a sin for which without sound repentance there is not nor can be rightly expected forgiveness  atten  then it seems though as to the matter of fact a man swears truely yet if he sweareth lightly and groundlesly his oath is evil and he by it under sin  wise  yes a man may say 32b the lord liveth and that is true and yet in so saying swear falsly because he sweareth vainly needlesly and without a ground  to swear groundedly and necessarily which then a man does when he swears as being called thereto of god that is tolerated of the word  but this was none of mr badmans swearing and therefore that which now we are not concerned about  atten  i perceive by the prophet that a man may sin in swearing to a truth  they therefore must needs most horribly sin that swear to confirm their jests and lies and as they think the better to beautifie their foolish talking  wise  they sin with an high hand for they presume to imagine 32c that god is as wicked as themselves to wit that he is an avoucher of lies to be true  for as i said before to swear is to call god to witness and to swear to a lie is to call god himself to witness that that lie is true  this therefore must needs offend for it puts the highest affront upon the holiness and righteousness of god therefore his wrath must sweep them away this kind of swearing is put in with lying and killing and stealing and committing adultery and therefore must not go unpunished  32d for if god will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain which a man may doe when he swears to a truth as i have shewed before how can it be imagined that he should hold such guiltless who by swearing will appeal to god if lies be not true or that swear out of their frantick and bedlam madness  it would grieve and provoke a sober man to wrath if one should swear to a notorious lye and avouch that that man would attest it for a truth and yet thus do men deal with the holy god they tell their jestings tales and lies and then swear by god that they are true  now this kind of swearing was as common with young badman as it was to eat when he was an hungred or to go to bed when it was night  atten  i have often mused in my mind what it should be that should make men so common in the use of the sin of swearing since those that be wise will believe them never the sooner for that  wise  it cannot be any thing that is good you may be sure because the thing it self is abominable  33a 1  therefore it must be from the promptings of the spirit of the devil within them 2  also it flows sometimes from hellish rage when the tongue hath set on fire of hell even the whole course of nature 33b 3  but commonly swearing flows from that daring boldness that biddeth defiance to the law that forbids it  4  swearers think also that by their belching of their blasphemous oaths out of their black and polluted mouths they shew themselves the more valiant men  5 and imagine also that by these outrageous kind of villianies they shall conquer those that at such a time they have to do with and make them believe their lyes to be true  6  they also swear frequently to get gain thereby and when they meet with fools they overcome them this way  but if i might give advice in this matter no buyer should lay out one farthing with him that is a common swearer in his calling especially with such an oathmaster that endeavoureth to swear away his commodity to another and that would swear his chapmans money into his own pocket  atten  all these causes of swearing so far as i can perceive flow from the same root as doe the oaths themselves even from a hardened and desperate heart  but pray shew me now how wicked cursing is to be distinguished from this kind of swearing  wise  34a swearing as i said hath immediately to do with the name of god and it calls upon him to be witness to the truth of what is said  that is if they that swear swear by him  some indeed swear by idols as by the mass by our lady by saints beasts birds and other creatures but the usual way of our profane ones in england is to swear by god christ faith and the like  but however or by whatever they swear cursing is distinguished from swearing thus  to 34b curse to curse profanely it is to sentence another or our self for or to evil  or to wish that some evil might happen to the person or thing under the curse unjustly  it is to sentence for or to evil that is without a cause thus shimei cursed david  he sentenced him for and to evil unjustly when he said to him come out come out thou bloody man and thou man of belial  the lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of saul in whose stead thou hast reigned and the lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of absalom thy son  and behold thou art taken in thy mischief because thou art a bloody man 34c  this david calls a grievous curse  and behold saith he to solomon his son thou hast with thee shimei a benjamite which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when i went to mahanaim 34d  but what was this curse  why first it was a wrong sentence past upon david shimei called him bloody man man of belial when he was not  secondly he sentenced him to the evil that at present was upon him for being a bloody man that is against the house of saul when that present evil overtook david for quite another thing  and we may thus apply it to the 34e profane ones of our times who in their rage and envy have little else in their mouths but a sentence against their neighbour for and to evil unjustly  how common is it with many when they are but a little offended with one to cry hang him damn him rogue  this is both a sentencing of him for and to evil and is in it self a grievous curse  2  the other kind of cursing is to wish that some evil might happen to and overtake this or that person or thing  and this kind of cursing job counted a grievous sin  i have not suffered says he my mouth to sin 35a by wishing a curse to his soul or consequently to body or estate  this then is a wicked cursing to wish that evil might either befall another or our selves  and this kind of cursing young badman accustomed himself unto  1  he 35b would wish that evil might befall others he would wish their necks broken or that their brains were out or that the pox or plague was upon them and the like  all which is a devilish kind of cursing and is become one of the common sins of our age  2  he would also as often wish a curse to himself saying would i might be hanged or burned or that the devil might fetch me if it be not so or the like  we count the 35c damme blades to be great swearers but when in their hellish fury they say goddamme me god perish me or the like they rather curse than swear yea curse themselves and that with a wish that damnation might light upon themselves which wish and curse of theirs in a little time they will see accomplished upon them even in hellfire if they repent not of their sins  atten  but did this young badman accustom himself to such filthy kind of language  wise  i think i may say that nothing was more frequent in his mouth and that upon the least provocation  yea he was so versed in such kind of language that neither 35d father nor mother nor brother nor sister nor servant no nor the very cattel that his father had could escape these curses of his  i say that even the bruit beasts when he drove them or rid upon them if they pleased not his humour they must be sure to partake of his curse 35e he would wish their necks broke their legs broke their guts out or that the devil might fetch them or the like  and no marvel for he that is so hardy to wish damnation or other bad curses to himself or dearest relations will not stick to wish evil to the silly beast in his madness  atten  well i see still that this badman was a desperate villain but pray sir since you have gone thus far now shew me whence this evil of cursing ariseth and also what dishonour it bringeth to god for i easily discern that it doth bring damnation to the soul  wise  this evil of cursing ariseth in general from the desperate wickedness of the heart but particularly from 36a 36b 1 envie which is as i apprehend the leading sin to witchcraft  2 it also ariseth from pride which was the sin of the fallen angels 3  it ariseth too from scorn and contempt of others  4  but for a man to curse himself must needs arise from desperate madness  the 36c dishonour that it bringeth to god is this  it taketh away from him his authority in whose power it is onely to bless and curse not to curse wickedly as mr badman but justly and righteously giving by his curse to those that are wicked the due reward of their deeds  besides these wicked men in their wicked cursing of their neighbour c do even curse god himself in his handy work  man is gods image and to curse wickedly the image of god is to curse god himself 36d  therefore as when men wickedly swear they rend and tare gods name and make him as much as in them lies the avoucher and approver of all their wickedness so he that curseth and condemneth in this sort his neighbour or that wisheth him evil curseth condemneth and wisheth evil to the image of god and consequently judgeth and condemneth god himself  suppose that a man should say with his mouth i wish that the kings picture was burned would not this mans so saying render him as an enemy to the person of the king  even so it is with them that by cursing wish evil to their neighbour or to themselves they contemn the image even the image of god himself  atten  but do you think that the men that do thus do think that they do so vilely so abominably  wise  the question is not what men do believe concerning their sin but what gods word says of it  if gods word says that swearing and cursing are sins though men should count them for vertues their reward will be a reward for sin to wit the damnation of the soul  to 37a curse another and to swear vainly and falsly are sins against the light of nature  1  to curse is so because whoso curseth another knows that at the same time he would not be so served himself  2  to swear also is a sin against the same law  for nature will tell me that i should not lie and therefore much less swear to confirm it  yea the heathens have looked upon swearing to be a solemn ordinance of god and therefore not to be lightly or vainly used by men though to confirm a matter of truth 37b  atten  but i wonder since curseing and swearing are such evils in the eyes of god that he doth not make some examples to others for their committing such wickedness  wise  alas so he has a thousand times twice told as may be easily gathered by any observing people in every age and countrey i could present you with several my self but waving the abundance that might be mentioned i will here present you with 37c two one was that dreadful judgment of god upon one n p at wimbleton in surrey who after a horrible fit of swearing at and cursing of some persons that did not please him suddenly fell sick and in little time died raving cursing and swearing  but above all take that dreadful story of dorothy mately an inhabitant of ashover in the county of darby  this 37d dorothy mately saith the relator was noted by the people of the town to be a great swearer and curser and lier and thief just like mr badman  and the labour that she did usually follow was to wash the rubbish that came forth of the lead mines and there to get sparks of leadore and her usual way of asserting of things was with these kind of imprecations  i would i might sink into the earth if it be not so or i would god would make the earth open and swallow me up  now upon the 23 of march 1660 this dorothy was washing of ore upon the top of a steep hill about a quarter of a mile from ashover and was there taxed by a lad for taking of two single pence out of his pocket for he had laid his breeches by and was at work in his drawers but she violently denyed it wishing that the ground might swallow her up if she had them  she also used the same wicked words on several other occasions that day  now one george hodgkinson of ashover a man of good report there came accidentally by where this dorothy was and stood still a while to talk with her as she was washing her ore there stood also a little child by her tubside and another a distance from her calling aloud to her to come away wherefore the said george took the girle by the hand to lead her away to her that called her but behold they had not gone above ten yards from dorothy but they heard her crying out for help so looking back he saw the woman and her tub and sive twirling round and sinking into the ground  then said the man pray to god to pardon thy sin for thou art never like to be seen alive any longer  so she and her tub twirled round and round till they sunk about three yards into the earth and then for a while staid  then she called for help again thinking as she said that she should stay there  now the man though greatly amazed did begin to think which way to help her but immediately a great stone which appeared in the earth fell upon her head and brake her skull and then the earth fell in upon her and covered her  she was afterwards digged up and found about four yards within ground with the boys two single pence in her pocket but her tub and sive could not be found  atten  you 38a bring to my mind a sad story the which i will relate unto you  the thing is this about a bowshoot from where i once dwelt there was a blind alehouse and the man that kept it had a son whose name was edward  this edward was as it were an halffool both in his words and manner of behaviour  to this blind alehouse certain jovial companions would once or twice a week come and this ned for so they called him his father would entertain his guests withall to wit by calling for him to make them sport by his foolish words and gestures  so when these boon blades came to this mans house the father would call for ned  ned therefore would come forth and the villain was devilishly addicted to cursing yea to cursing his father and mother and any one else that did cross him  and because though he was an halffool he saw that his practice was pleasing he would do it with the more audaciousness  well when these brave fellows did come at their times to this tipplinghouse as they call it to fuddle and make merry then must ned be called out and because his father was best acquainted with ned and best knew how to provoke him therefore he would usually ask him such questions or command him such business as would be sure to provoke him indeed  then would he after his foolish manner curse his father most bitterly at which the old man would laugh and so would the rest of the guests as at that which pleased them best still continuing to ask that ned still might be provoked to curse that they might still be provoked to laugh  this was the mirth with which the old man did use to entertain his guests  the curses wherewith this ned did use to curse his father and at which the old man would laugh were these and such like  the devil take you the devil fetch you  he would also wish him plagues and destructions many  well so it came to pass through the righteous judgement of god that neds wishes and curses were in a little time fuelled upon his father for not many months passed between them after this manner but the devil did indeed take him possess him and also in few days carried him out of this world by death i say satan did take him and possess him  i mean so it was judged by those that knew him and had to do with him in that his lamentable condition  he could feel him like a live thing goe up and down in his body but when tormenting time was come as he had often tormenting fits then he would lye like an hard bump in the soft place of his chest i mean i saw it so and so would rent and tare him and make him roar till he died away  i told you before that i was an ear and eye witness of what i here say and so i was  i have heard ned in his roguery cursing his father and his father laughing thereat most heartily still provoking of ned to curse that his mirth might be encreased  i saw his father also when he was possessed i saw him in one of his fits and saw his flesh as twas thought by the devil gathered up on an heap about the bigness of half in egge to the unutterable torture and affliction of the old man  there was also one freeman who was more than an ordinary doctor sent for to cast out this devil and i was there when he attempted to do it the manner whereof was this  they had the possessed into an out room and laid him on his belly upon a form with his head hanging over the forms end then they bound him down thereto  which done they set a pan of coals under his mouth and put something therein which made a great smoak by this means as twas said to fetch out the devil  there therefore they kept the man till he was almost smothered in the smoak but no devil came out of him at which freeman was somewhat abashed the man greatly afflicted and i made to go away wondering and fearing  in a little time therefore that which possessed the man carried him out of the world according to the cursed wishes of his son  and this was the end of this hellish mirth  wise  these were all sad judgements  atten  these were dreadful judgments indeed  wise  ai and they look like the threatning of that text though chiefly it concerned judas as he loved cursing so let it come unto him as he delighted not in blessing so let it be far from him  as he cloathed himself with cursing as with a garment so let it come into his bowels like water and as oyl into his bones 40a  atten  it is a fearful thing for youth to be trained up in a way of cursing and swearing  wise  trained up in them that i cannot say mr badman was for his father hath ofttimes in my hearing bewailed the badness of his children and of this naughty boy in particular  i believe that the wickedness of his children made him in the thoughts of it goe many a night with heavy heart to bed and with as heavy an one to rise in the morning  but all was one to his graceless son neither wholsom counsel nor fatherly sorrow would make him mend his manners  there 40b are some indeed that do train up their children to swear curse lye and steal and great is the misery of such poor children whose hard hap it is to be ushered into the world by and to be under the tuition too of such ungodly parents  it had been better for such parents had they not begat them and better for such children had they not been born  o methinks for a father or a mother to train up a child in that very way that leadeth to hell and damnation what thing so horrible  but mr badman was not by his parents so brought up  atten  but methinks since this young badman would not be ruled at home his father should have tryed what good could have been done of him abroad by putting him out to some man of his acquaintance that he knew to be able to command him and to keep him pretty hard to some employ  so should he at least have been prevented of time to do those wickednesses that could not be done without time to do them in  wise  alas his father did so 41a he put him out betimes to one of his own acquaintance and entreated him of all love that he would take care of son and keep him from extravagant wayes  his trade also was honest and commodious he had besides a full employ therein so that this young badman had no vacant seasons nor idle hours yielded him by his calling therein to take opportunities to do badly  but all was one to him as he had begun to be vile in his fathers house even so he continued to be when he was in the house of his master  atten  i have known some children who though they have been very bad at home yet have altered much when they have been put out abroad especially when they have fallen into a family where the governours thereof have made conscience of maintaining of the worship and service of god therein but perhaps that might be wanting in mr badmans masters house  wise  indeed some children do greatly mend when put under other mens roofs but as i said this naughty boy did not so nor did his badness continue because he wanted a master that both could and did correct it  for his 41b master was a very good man a very devout person one that frequented the best soulmeans that set up the worship of god in his family and also that walked himself thereafter  he was also a man very meek and merciful one that did never overdrive young badman in business nor that kept him at it at unseasonable hours  atten  say you so  this is rare  i for my part can see but few that can parallel in these things with mr badmans master  wise  nor i neither yet mr badman had such an one for for the most past 42a masters are now a days such as mind nothing but their worldly concerns and if apprentices do but answer their commands therein soul and religion may go whither they will  yea i much fear that there have been many towardly lads put out by their parents to such masters that have quite undone them as to the next world  atten  the more is the pity  but pray now you have touched upon this subject shew me how many wages a master may be the ruin of his poor apprentice  wise  nay i cannot tell you of all the wayes yet some of them i will mention  suppose then that a towardly lad be put to be an apprentice with one that is reputed to be a godly man yet that lad may be ruined many wayes that is if his master be not circumspect in all things that respect both god and man and that before his apprentice  1  if 42b he be not moderate in the use of his apprentice if he drives him beyond his strength if he holds him to work at unseasonable hours if he will not allow him convenient time to read the word to pray c  this is the way to destroy him that is in those tender beginnings of good thoughts and good beginnings about spiritual things  2  if he suffers his house to be scattered with profane and wicked books such as stir up to lust to wantonness such as teach idle wanton lascivious discourse and such as has a tendency to provoke to profane drollery and jesting and lastly such as tend to corrupt and pervert the doctrine of faith and holiness  all these things will eat as doth a canker and will quickly spoil in youth c those good beginnings that may be putting forth themselves in them  3  if there be a mixture of servants that is if some very bad be in the same place thats a way also to undo such tender lads for they that are bad and sordid servants will be often and they have an opportunity too to be distilling and fomenting of their profane and wicked words and tricks before them and these will easily stick in the flesh and minds of youth to the corrupting of them  4  if the master have one guise for abroad and another for home that is if his religion hangs by in his house as his cloak does and he be seldom in it except he be abroad this young beginners will take notice of and stumble at  we say hedges have eyes and little pitchers have ears and indeed 43a children make a greater inspection into the lives of fathers masters c than ofttimes they are aware of  and therefore should masters be carefull else they may soon destroy good beginnings in their servants  5  if the master be unconscionable in his dealing and trades with lying words or if bad commodities be avouched to be good or if he seeks after unreasonable gain or the like his servant sees it and it is enough to undo him  elies sons being bad before the congregation made men despise the sacrifices of the lord 43b  but these things by the by only they may serve for a hint to masters to take heed that they take not apprentices to destroy their souls  but young badman had none of these hinderances 43c his father took care and provided well for him as to this  he had a good master he wanted not good books nor good instruction nor good sermons nor good examples no nor good fellowservants neither  but all would not doe  atten  tis a wonder that in such a family amidst so many spiritual helps nothing should take hold of his heart  what not good books nor good instructions nor good sermons nor good examples nor good fellowservants nor nothing do him good  wise  you talk he minded none of these things nay all these were 43d abominable to him  1  for good books they might lie in his masters house till they rotted for him he would not regard to look into them but contrarywise would get all the bad and abominable books that he could as beastly romances and books full of ribbauldry even such as immediately tended to set all fleshly lusts on fire  true he durst not be known to have any of these to his master therefore would he never let them be seen by him but would keep them in close places and peruse them at such times as yielded him fit opportunities thereto  2  for good instruction he liked that much as he liked good books his care was to hear but little thereof and to forget what he heard as soon as twas spoken  yea i have heard some that knew him then say that one might evidently discern by the shew of his countenance and gestures that good counsel was to him like 44a littleease even a continual torment to him nor did he ever count himself at liberty but when farthest off of wholsom words  he would hate them that rebuked him and count them his deadly enemies  3  for good example which was frequently set him by his master both in religious and civil matters these young badman would laugh at and would also make a byword of them when he came in place where he with safety could  4  his master indeed would make him go with him to sermons and that where he thought the best preachers were but this ungodly young man what shall i say was i think a master of art in all mischief he had these wicked ways to hinder himself of hearing let the preacher thunder never so loud  1  his 44b way was when come into the place of hearing to sit down in some corner and then to fall fast asleep  2  or else to fix his adulterous eyes upon some beautifull object that was in the place and so all sermonwhile therewith be feeding of his fleshly lusts  3  or if he could get near to some that he had observed would fit his humour he would be whispering gigling and playing with them till such time as sermon was done  atten  why he was grown to a prodigious height of wickedness  wise  he was so and that which aggravates all was this was his practice as soon as he was come to his master he was as ready at all these things as if he had before he came to his master served an apprentiship to learn them  atten  there could not but be added as you relate them rebellion to his sin  methinks it is as if he had said i will not hear i will not regard i will not mind good i will not mend i will not turn i will not be converted  wise  you 45a say true and i know not to whom more fitly to compare him 45b than to that man who when i my self rebuked him for his wickedness in this great huff replied what would the devil do for company if it was not for such as i  atten  why did you ever hear any man say so  wise  yes that i did and this young badman was as like him as an egg is like an egg  alas the scripture makes mention of many that by their actions speak the same  they say unto god depart from us for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways again they refuse to hearken and pull away their shoulder and stop their ears yea they make their hearts hard as an adamantstone lest they should hear the law and the words that the lord of hosts hath sent 45c  what are all these but such as badman and such as the young man but now mentioned  that young man was my play fellow when i was solacing my self in my sins  i may make mention of him to my shame but he has a great many fellows  atten  young badman was like him indeed and he trod his steps as if his wickedness had been his very copy i mean as to his desperateness  for had he not been a desperate one he would never have made you such a reply when you was rebuking of him for his sin  but when did you give him such a rebuke  wise  a while after god had parted him and i by calling of me as i hope by his grace still leaving him in his sins and so far as i could ever gather as he lived so he died even as mr badman did  but we will leave him and return again to our discourse  atten  ha poor obstinate sinners doe they think that god cannot be even with them  wise  i do not know what they think but i know that god hath said that as he cried and they would not hear so they shall crie and i will not hear saith the lord  45d doubtless there is a time a coming when mr badman will crie for this  atten  but i wonder that he should be so expert in wickedness so soon alas he was but a stripling i suppose he was as yet not twenty  wise  no nor eighteen neither  but as with ishmael and with the children that mocked the prophet the seeds of sin did put forth themselves betimes in him 46a  atten  well he was as wicked a young man as commonly one shall hear of  wise  you will say so when you know all  atten  all i think here is a great all but if there is more behind pray let us hear it  wise  why then i will tell you that he had not been with his master much above a year and a half but he came 46b acquainted with three young villains who here shall be nameless that taught him to adde to his sin much of like kind and he as aptly received their instructions  one of them was chiefly given to uncleanness another to drunkenness and the third to purloining or stealing from his master  atten  alas poor wretch he was bad enough before but these i suppose made him much worse  wise  that they made him worse you may be sure of for they taught him to be an arch a chief one in all their wayes  atten  it was an ill hap that he ever came acquainted with them  wise  you must rather word it thus  it 46c was the judgement of god that he did that is he came acquainted with them through the anger of god  he had a good master and before him a good father by these he had good counsel given him for months and years together but his heart was set upon mischief he loved wickedness more than to do good even untill his iniquity came to be hateful therefore from the anger of god it was that these companions of his and he did at last so acquaint together  sayes paul they did not like to retain god in their knowledge 46d and what follows wherefore god gave them over or up to their own hearts lusts  and again as for such as turn aside to their own crooked wayes the lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity 46e  this therefore was gods hand upon him that he might be destroyed be damned because he received not the love of the truth that he might be saved  he chose his delusions and deluders for him even the company of base men of fools that he might be destroyed 46f 47a  atten  i cannot but think indeed that it is a great judgment of god for a man to be given up to the company of vile men for what are such but the devils 47b  decoyes even those by whom he drawes the simple into the net  a whoremaster a drunkard a thiefe what are they but the devils baits by which he catcheth others  wise  you say right but this young badman was no simple one if by simple you mean one uninstructed for he had often good counsel given him  but if by simple you mean him that is a fool as to the true knowledge of and faith in christ then he was a simple one indeed  for he chose death rather than life and to live in continual opposition to god rather than to be reconciled unto him according to that saying of the wise man the fooles hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the lord  47c and what judgement more dreadfull can a fool be given up to than to be delivered into the hands of such men that have skill to do nothing but to ripen sin and hasten its finishing unto damnation and therefore men should be afraid of offending god because he can in this manner punish them for their sins  i 47d knew a man that once was as i thought hopefully awakened about his condition yea i knew two that were so awakened but in time they began to draw back and to incline again to their lusts wherefore god gave them up to the company of three or four men that in less than three years time brought them roundly to the gallows where they were hanged like dogs because they refused to live like honest men 47e  atten  but such men do not believe that thus to be given up of god is in judgement and anger they rather take it to be their liberty and do count it their happiness they are glad that their cord is loosed and that the reins are in their neck they are glad that they may sin without controul and that they may choose such company as can make them more expert in an evil way  wise  their judgement is therefore so much the greater because thereto is added blindness of mind and hardness of heart in a wicked way  they are turned up to the way of death but must not see to what place they are going  they must go as the ox to the slaughter and as the fool to the correction of the stocks 48a till a dart strikes through their liver not knowing that it is for their life  this i say makes their judgement double they are given up of god for a while to sport themselves with that which will assuredly make them mourn at last when their flesh and their body is consumed 48b  these are those that peter 48c speaks of that shall utterly perish in their own corruptions these i say who count it pleasure to ryot in the daytime and that sport themselves with their own deceivings are as natural bruit beasts made to be taken and destroyed  atten  well but i pray now concerning these three villains that were young badmans companions  tell me more particularly how he carried it then  wise  how he carried it why he did as they  i intimated so much before when i said they made him an arch a chief one in their ways  first he became a frequenter of 48d taverns and tipplinghouses and would stay there untill he was even as drunk as a beast  and if it was so that he could not get out by day he would be sure get out by night  yea he became so common a drunkard at last that he was taken notice of to be a drunkard even by all  atten  this was swinish for drunkenness is so beastly a sin a sin so much against nature that i wonder that any that have but the appearance of men can give up themselves to so beastly yea worse than beastly a thing  wise  it is a swinish vanity indeed  i will tell you another story 48e 48f  there was a gentleman that had a drunkard to be his groom and coming home one night very much abused with beer his master saw it  well quoth his master within himself i will let thee alone to night but to morrow morning i will convince thee that thou art worse than a beast by the behaviour of my horse  so when morning was come he bids his man goe and water his horse and so he did but coming up to his master he commands him to water him again so the fellow rid into the water the second time but his masters horse would now drink no more so the fellow came up and told his master  then said his master thou drunken sot thou art far worse than my horse he will drink but to satisfie nature but thou wilt drink to the abuse of nature he will drink but to refresh himself but thou to thy hurt and dammage he will drink that he may be more serviceable to his master but thou till thou art uncapable of serving either god or man  o thou beast how much art thou worse than the horse that thou ridest on  atten  truly i think that his master served him right for in doing as he did he shewed him plainly as he said that he had not so much government of himself as his horse had of himself and consequently that his beast did live more according to the law of his nature by far than did his man  but pray go on with what you have further to say  wise  why i say that there are 49a four things which if they were well considered would make drunkenness to be abhorred in the thoughts of the children of men  1  it greatly tendeth to impoverish and beggar a man  the drunkard says solomon shall come to poverty 49b  many that have begun the world with plenty have gone out of it in rags through drunkenness  yea many children that have been born to good estates have yet been brought to a flail  a rake through this beastly sin of their parents  2  this sin of drunkenness it bringeth upon the body many great and incurable diseases by which men do in little time come to their end and none can help them  so because they are overmuch wicked therefore they dye before their time 49c  3  drunkenness is a sin that is often times attended with abundance of other evils  who hath woe  who hath sorrow  who hath contention  who hath babblings  who hath wounds without cause  who hath redness of the eyes  they that tarry long at the wine they that go to seek mixt wine 49d  that is the drunkard  4  by drunkenness men do often times shorten their dayes goe out of the alehouse drunk and break their necks before they come home  instances not a few might be given of this but this is so manifest a man need say nothing  atten  but 50a 50b that which is worse than all is it also prepares men for everlasting burnings  wise  yea and it so stupifies and besotts the soul that a man that is far gone in drunkenness is hardly ever recovered to god tell me when did you see an old drunkard converted  no no such an one will sleep till he dies though he sleeps on the top of a 50c mast let his dangers be never so great and death and damnation never so near he will not be awaked out of his sleep so that if a man have any respect either to credit health life or salvation he will not be a drunken man  but the truth is where this sin gets the upper hand men are as i said before so intoxicated and bewitched with the seeming pleasures and sweetness thereof that they have neither heart nor mind to think of that which is better in itself and would if imbraced do them good  atten  you said that drunkenness tends to poverty yet some make themselves rich by drunken bargains  wise  i 50d said so because the word says so  and as to some mens getting thereby that is indeed but rare and base  yea and base will be the end of such gettings  the word of god is against such wayes and the curse of god will be the end of such doings an inheritance may sometimes thus be hastily gotten at the beginning but the end thereof shall not be blessed  hark what the prophet saith wo to him that coveteth an evil covetousness that he may set his nest on high 50e  whether he makes drunkenness or ought else the engine and decoy to get it for that man doth but consult the shame of his own house the spoiling of his family and the damnation of his soul for that which he getteth by working of iniquity is but a getting by the devices of hell therefore he can be no gainer neither for himself or family that gains by an evil course  but this was one of the sins that mr badman was addicted to after he came acquainted with these three fellows nor could all that his master could do break him of this beastly sin  atten  but where since he was but an apprentice could he get money to follow this practice for drunkenness as you have intimated is a very costly sin  wise  his master 51a paid for all  for as i told you before as he learned of these three villains to be a beastly drunkard so he learned of them to pilfer and steal from his master  sometimes he would sell off his masters goods but keep the money that is when he could also sometimes he would beguile his master by taking out of his cashbox  and when he could do neither of these he would convey away of his masters wares what he thought would be least missed and send or carry them to such and such houses where he knew they would be laid up to his use and then appoint set times there to meet and make merry with these fellowes  atten  this was as bad nay i think worse than the former for by thus doing he did not only run himself under the wrath of god but has endangered the undoing of his master and his familie  wise  sins go not alone but follow one the other as do the links of a chain he that will be a drunkard must have money either of his own or of some other mans either of his fathers mothers masters or at the highway or some way  atten  i fear that many an honest man is undone by such kind of servants  wise  i am of the same mind with you but 51b this should make the dealer the more wary what kind of servants he keeps and what kind of apprentices he takes  it should also teach him to look well to his shop himself also to take strict account of all things that are bought and sold by his servants  the masters neglect herein may embolden his servant to be bad and may bring him too in short time to rags and a morsel of bread  atten  i am afraid that there is much of this kind of pilfering among servants in these bad dayes of ours  wise  now while it is in my mind i will tell you a story 51c when i was in prison there came a woman to me that was under a great deal of trouble  so i asked her she being a stranger to me what she had to say to me  she said she was afraid she should be damned  i asked her the cause of those fears  she told me that she had sometime since lived with a shopkeeper at wellingborough and had robbed his box in the shop several times of money to the value of more than now i will say and pray says she tell me what i shall do  i told her i would have her go to her master and make him satisfaction  she said she was afraid i asked her why she said she doubted he would hang her  i told her that i would intercede for her life and would make use of other friends too to do the like but she told me she durst not venture that  well said i shall i send to your master while you abide out of sight and make your peace with him before he sees you and with that i asked her her masters name  but all that she said in answer to this was pray let it alone till i come to you again  so away she went and neither told me her masters name nor her own  this is about ten or twelve years since and i never saw her again  i tell you this story for this cause to confirm your fears that such kind of servants too many there be and that god makes them sometimes like old tod of whom mention was made before through the terrors that he layes upon them to betray themselves  i could tell you of another 52a that came to me with a like relation concerning her self and the robbing of her mistress but at this time let this suffice  atten  but what was that other villain addicted to i mean young badmans third companion  wise  uncleanness 52b  i told you before but it seems you forgot  atten  right it was uncleanness  uncleanness is also a filthy sin  wise  it is so and yet it is one of the most reigning sins in our day  atten  so they say and that too among those that one would think had more wit even among the great ones  wise  the more is the pity  for usually examples that are set by them that are great and chief 52c spread sooner and more universally then do the sins of other men yea and when such men are at the head in transgressing sin walks with a bold face through the land  as jeremiah saith of the prophets so may it be said of such from them is profaneness gone forth into all the land that is with bold and audacious face jer 23  15  atten  but pray let us return again to mr badman and his companions  you say one of them was very vile in the commission of uncleanness  wise  yes so i say not but that he was a drunkard and also thievish but he was most arch in this sin of uncleanness  this roguery was his masterpiece for he was a ringleader to them all in the beastly sin of whoredom  he was also best acquainted with such houses where they were and so could readily lead the rest of his gang unto them  the strumpets also because they knew this young villain would at first discover themselves in all their whorish pranks to those that he brought with him  atten  that is a deadly thing  i mean it is a deadly thing to young men when such beastly queans shall with words and carriages that are openly tempting discover themselves unto them it is hard for such to escape their snare  wise  that is true therefore the wise mans counsel is the best come not near the door of her house 53a for they are as you say very tempting as is seen by her in the proverbs  i looked says the wise man through my casement and beheld among the simple ones i discerned a young man void of understanding passing through the streets near her corner and he went the way to her house  in the twilight in the evening in the black and dark night  and behold there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot and subtle of heart 53c she is loud and stubborn her feet abide not in her house  now she is without now she is in the street and lieth in wait at every corner  so she caught him and kissd him and with an impudent face said unto him  i have peace offerings with me this day have i payed my vows  therefore came i forth to meet thee diligently to seek thy face and i have found thee  i have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry with carved works with fine linnen of aegypt  i have perfumed my bed with myrrhe aloes and cinnamon come let us take our fill of love untill the morning let us solace our selves with loves 53b here was a bold beast  and indeed the very eyes hands words and ways of such are all snares and bands to youthful lustful fellows  and with these was young badman greatly snared  atten  this sin of uncleanness 54a is mightily cried out against both by moses the prophets christ and his apostles and yet as we see for all that how men run headlong to it  wise  you have said the truth and i will adde that god to hold men back from so filthy a sin has set such a stamp of his indignation upon it and commanded such evil effects to follow it that were not they that use it bereft of all fear of god and love to their own health they could not but stop and be afraid to commit it  for besides the eternal damnation that doth attend such in the next world for these have no inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god ephes 5 the evil effects thereof in this world are dreadfull  atten  pray skew me some of them that as occasion offereth it self i may shew them to others for their good  wise  so i will  1 54b it bringeth a man as was said of the sin before to want and poverty for by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread  the reason is for that an whore will not yield without hire and men when the devil and lust is in them and god and his fear far away from them will not stick so they may accomplish their desire to lay their signet their bracelets and their staff to pledge 54c rather than miss of the fulfilling of their lusts  2  again by this sin men diminish their strength and bring upon themselves even upon the body a multitude of diseases  this king lemuels mother warned him of  what my son said she and what the son of my womb and what the son of my vows  give not thy strength unto women nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings 54d this sin is destructive to the body  give me leave to tell you another story  i 54e 54f have heard of a great man that was a very unclean person and he had lived so long in that sin that he had almost lost his sight  so his physicians were sent for to whom he told his to disease but they told him that they could do him no good unless he would forbear his women  nay then said he farewell sweet sight  whence observe that this sin as i said is destructive to the body and also that some men be so in love therewith that they will have it though it destroy their body  atten  paul says also that he that sins this sin sins against his own body  but what of that he that will run the hazard of eternal damnation of his soul but he will commit this sin will for it run the hazard of destroying his body  if young badman feared not the damnation of his soul do you think that the consideration of impairing of his body would have deterred him therefrom  wise  you say true  but yet methinks there are still such bad effects follow often upon the commission of it that if men would consider them it would put at least a stop to their career therein  atten  what other evil effects attend this sin  wise  outward shame and disgrace and that in these particulars 55a  first there often follows this foul sin the foul disease now called by us the pox  a disease so nauseous and stinking so infectious to the whole body and so intailed to this sin that hardly are any common with unclean women but they have more or less a touch of it to their shame  atten  that is a foul disease indeed  i knew 55b a man once that rotted away with it and another that had his nose eaten off and his mouth almost quite sewed up thereby  wise  it is a disease that where it is it commonly declares that the cause thereof is uncleanness  it declares to all that behold such a man that he is an odious a beastly unclean person this is that strange punishment that job speaks of that is appointed to seize on these workers of iniquity 55c  atten  then it seems you think that the strange punishment that job there speaks of should be the foul disease  wise  i have thought so indeed and that for this reason  we see that this disease is entailed as i may say to this most beastly sin nor is there any disease so entailed to any other sin as this to this  that this is the sin to which the strange punishment is entailed you will easily perceive when you read the text  i made a covenant with mine eyes said job why should i think upon a maid  for what portion is there for that sin from above and what inheritance of the almighty from on high  and then he answers himself is not destruction to the wicked and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity  this strange punishment is the pox  also i think that this foul disease is that which solomon intends when he saith speaking of this unclean and beastly creature a wound and dishonour shall he get and his reproach shall not be turned away 56a a punishment job calls it a wound and dishonour solomon calls it and they both do set it as a remark upon this sin job calling it a strange punishment and solomon a reproach that shall not be turned away from them that are common in it  atten  what other things follow upon the commission of this beastly sin  wise  why oftentimes it is attended with murder with the murder of the babe begotten on the defiled bed  how common it is for the bastardgetter and bastardbearer to consent together to murder their children will be better known at the day of judgement yet something is manifest now  i will tell you another story 56b  an ancient man one of mine acquaintance a man of good credit in our countrey had a mother that was a midwife  who was mostly imployed in laying great persons  to this womans house upon a time comes a brave young gallant on horseback to fetch her to lay a young lady  so she addresses herself to go with him wherefore he takes her up behind him and away they ride in the night  now they had not rid far but the gentleman litt off his horse and taking the old midwife in his arms from the horse turned round with her several times and then set her up again then he got up and away they went till they came at a stately house into which he had her and so into a chamber where the young lady was in her pains  he then bid the midwife do her office and she demanded help but he drew out his sword and told her if she did not make speed to do her office without she must look for nothing but death  well to be short this old midwife laid the young lady and a fine sweet babe she had now there was made in a room hard by a very great fire  so the gentleman took up the babe went and drew the coals from the stock cast the child in and covered it up and there was an end of that  so when the midwife had done her work he paid her well for her pains but shut her up in a dark room all day and when night came took her up behind him again and carried her away till she came almost at home then he turned her round and round as he did before and had her to her house set her down bid her farewell and away he went  and she could never tell who it was  this story the midwifes son who was a minister told me and also protested that his mother told it him for a truth  atten  murder doth often follow indeed as that which is the fruit of this sin  but sometimes god brings even these adulterers and adulteresses to shameful ends  i heard 57a of one i think a doctor of physick and his whore who had had three or four bastards betwixt them and had murdered them all but at last themselves were hanged for it in or near to colchester  it came out after this manner  the whore was so afflicted in her conscience abort it that she could not be quiet untill she had made it known  thus god many times makes the actors of wickedness their own accusers and brings them by their own tongues to condigne punishment for their own sins  wise  there has been many such instances but we will let that pass  i was once in the presence of a woman a married woman that lay sick of the sickness whereof she died and being smitten in her conscience for the sin of uncleanness which she had often committed with other men i heard 57b her as she lay upon her bed cry out thus  i am a whore and all my children are bastards and i must go to hell for my sin and look there stands the devil at my beds feet to receive my soul when i die  atten  these are sad storyes tell no more of them now but if you please shew me yet some other of the evil effects of this beastly sin  wise  this sin is such a snare to the soul that unless a miracle of grace prevents it unavoidably perishes in the enchanting and bewitching pleasures of it  this is manifest by these and such like texts  the adulteress will hunt for the precious life  whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding and he that doth it destroys his own soul 57c  an whore is a deep ditch and a strange woman is a narrow pit  her house inclines to death and her pathes unto the dead  none that go in unto her return again neither take they hold of the path of life  she hath cast down many wounded yea many strong men have been slain by her her house is the way to hell going down to the chambers of death 58a  atten  these are dreadful sayings and do shew the dreadful state of those that are guilty of this sin  wise  verily so they doe  but yet that which makes the whole more dreadful is that men are given up to this sin because they are abhorred of god and because abhorred therefore they shall fall into the commission of it and shall live there  the mouth that is the flattering lips of a strange woman is a deep pit the abhorred of the lord shall fall therein 58b  therefore it saith again of such that they have none inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god 58c  atten  put all together and it is a dreadful thing to live and die in this transgression  wise  true  but suppose that instead of all these judgments this sin had attending of it all the felicities of this life and no bitterness shame or disgrace mixed with it yet one hour in hell will spoil all  o this hell hellfire damnation in hell it is such an inconceivable punishment that were it but throughly believed it would nip this sin with others in the head  but here is the mischief those that give up themselves to these things do so harden themselves in unbelief and atheism about the things the punishments that god hath threatned to inflict upon the committers of them that at last they arrive to almost an absolute and firm belief that there is no judgment to come hereafter  else they would not they could not no not attempt to commit this sin by such abominable language as some do  i heard 58d of one that should say to his miss when he tempted her to the committing of this sin if thou wilt venture thy body i will venture my soul 58e  and i my self heard another say when he was tempting of a maid to commit uncleanness with him it was in olivers dayes that if she did prove with child he would tell her how she might escape punishment and that was then somewhat severe say saith he when you come before the judge that you are with child by the holy ghost  i heard 59a him say thus and it greatly afflicted me i had a mind to have accused him for it before some magistrate but he was a great man and i was poor and young  so i let it alone but it troubled me very much  atten  twas the most horrible thing that ever i heard in my life but how far off are these men from that spirit and grace that dwelt in joseph  wise  right when josephs mistress tempted him yea tempted him daily 59b yea she laid hold on him and said with her whores forehead come lie with me but he refused  he hearkned not to lie with her or to be with her  mr badman would have taken the opportunity  and a little to comment upon this of joseph 59c  1  here is a miss a great miss the wife of the captain of the guard some beautiful dame ile warrant you  2  here is a miss won and in her whorish affections come over to joseph without his speaking of a word  3  here is her unclean desire made known come lie with me said she  4  here was a fit opportunity  there was none of the men of the house there within  5  joseph was a young man full of strength and therefore the more in danger to be taken  6  this was to him a temptation from her that lasted days  7  and yet joseph refused 1  her daily temptation 2  her daily solicitation  3  her daily provocation heartily violently and constantly  for when she caught him by the garment saying lie with me he left his garment in her hand and gat him out  ay and although contempt treachery slander accusation imprisonment and danger of death followed for an whore careth not what mischief she does when she cannot have her end yet joseph will not defile himself sin against god and hazard his own eternal salvation  atten  blessed joseph  i would thou hadst more fellows  wise  mr badman has more fellows than joseph else there would not be so many whores as there are  for though i doubt not but that that sex is bad enough this way yet i verify believe that many of them are made whores at first by the flatteries of badmans fellows  alas there is many a woman plunged into this sin at first even by promises of marriage 60a  i say by these promises they are flattered yea forced into a consenting to these villanies and so being in and growing hardened in their hearts they at last give themselves up even as wicked men do to act this kind of wickedness with greediness  but joseph you see was of another mind for the fear of god was in him  i will before i leave this tell you here two notable storyes and i wish mr badmans companions may hear of them  they are found in clarks lookingglass for sinners and are these  mr cleaver says mr clark reports of one whom he knew that had committed the act of uncleanness whereupon he fell into such horror of conscience that he hanged himself leaving it thus written in a paper indeed saith he i acknowledge it to be utterly unlawful for a man to kill himself but i am bound to act the magistrates part because the punishment of this sin is death  clark doth also in the same page make mention of two more who as they were committing adultery in london were immediately struck dead with fire from heaven in the very act  their bodyes were so found half burnt up and sending out a most loathsom savour  atten  these are notable storyes indeed  wise  so they are and i suppose they are as true as notable  atten  well but i wonder if young badmans master knew him to be such a wretch that he would suffer him in his house  wise  they liked one another even as 60c fire and water doe young badmans wayes were odious to his master and his masters wayes were such as young badman could not endure  thus in these two was fulfilled that saying of the holy ghost  an unjust man is an abomination to the just and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked 60d  the good mans wayes mr badman could not abide nor could the good man abide the bad wayes of his base apprentice  yet would his master if he could have kept him and also have learnt him his trade  atten  if he could why he might if he would might he not  wise  alas badman ran away 61a from him once and twice and would not at all be ruled  so the next time he did run away from him he did let him go indeed  for he gave him no occasion to run away except it was by holding of him as much as he could and that he could do but little to good and honest rules of life  and had it been ones own case one should have let him go  for what should a man do that had either regard to his own peace his childrens good or the preservation of the rest of his servants from evil but let him go  had he staid the house of correction had been most fit for him but thither his master was loth to send him because of the love that he bore to his father  an house of correction i say had been the fittest place for him but his master let him go  atten  he ran away you say but whither did he run  wise  why to one of his own trade 61b and also like himself thus the wicked joyned hand in hand and there he served out his time  atten then sure he had his hearts desire when he was with one so like himself  wise  yes  so he had but god gave it him in his anger  atten  how do you mean  wise  i mean as before that for a wicked man to be by the providence of god turned out of a good mans doors into a wicked mans house to dwell is a sign of the anger of god 61c  for god by this and such judgements says thus to such an one  thou wicked one thou lovest not me my wayes nor my people thou castest my law and good counsel behinde thy back  come i will dispose of thee in my wrath thou shalt be turned over to the ungodly thou shalt be put to school to the devil i will leave thee to sink and swim in sin till i shall visit thee with death and judgment  this was therefore another judgment that did come upon this young badman  atten  you have said the truth for god by such a judgment as this in effect says so indeed for he takes them out of the hand of the just and binds them up in the hand of the wicked and whither they then shall be carried a man may easily imagin  wise  it is one of the saddest tokens of gods anger that happens to such kind of persons  and that for several reasons 62a  1  such an one by this judgment is put out out of the way and from under the means which ordinarily are made use of to do good to the soul  for a family where godliness is professed and practised is gods ordinance the place which he has appointed to teach young ones the way and fear of god 62b  now to be put out of such a family into a bad a wicked one as mr badman was must needs be in judgment and a sign of the anger of god  for in ungodly families men learn to forget god to hate goodness and to estrange themselves from the wayes of those that are good  2  in bad families they have continually fresh examples and also incitements to evil and fresh encouragements to it too  yea moreover in such places evil is commended praised wellspoken of and they that do it are applauded and this to be sure is a drowning judgement  3  such places are the very haunts and walks of the infernal spirits who are continually poysoning the cogitations and minds of one or other in such families that they may be able to poyson others  therefore observe it usually in wicked families some one or two are more arch for wickedness then are any other that are there  now such are satans conduitpipes for by them he conveighs of the spawn of hell through their being crafty in wickedness into the ears and souls of their companions  yea and when they have once conceived wickedness they travel with it as doth a woman with child till they have brought it forth behold he travelleth with iniquity and hath conceived mischief and brought forth falshood 62c  some men as here is intimated in the text and as was hinted also before have a kind of mystical but hellish copulation with the devil who is the father and their soul the mother of sin and wickedness and they so soon as they have conceived by him finish by bringing forth sin both it and their own damnation 62d  atten  how 63a much then doth it concern those parents that love their children to see that if they go from them they be put into such families as be good that they may learn there betimes to eschew evil and to follow that which is good  wise  it doth concern them indeed and it doth also concern them 63b that take children into their families to take heed what children they receive  for a man may soon by a bad boy be dammaged both in his name estate and family and also hindred in his peace and peaceable pursuit after god and godliness i say by one such vermin as a wicked and filthy apprentice  atten  true for one sinner destroyeth much good and a poor man is better than a lier  but many times a man cannot help it for such as at the beginning promise very fair are by a little time proved to be very rogues like young badman  wise  that is true also but when a man has done the best he can to help it he may with the more confidence expect the blessing of god to follow or he shall have the more peace if things go contrary to his desire  atten  well but did mr badman and his master agree so well  i mean his last master since they were birds of a feather i mean since they were so well met for wickedness  wise  this second master was as before i told you bad enough but yet he would often fall out 63c with young badman his servant and chide yea and some times beat him too for his naughty doings  atten  what for all he was so bad himself  this is like the proverb the devil corrects vice  wise  i will assure you tis as i say  for you must know that badmans wayes suited not with his masters gains  could he have done as the damsel that we read of acts 16 63d did to wit fill his masters purse with his badness he had certainly been his whiteboy but it was not so with young badman and therefore though his master and he did suit well enough in the main yet in this and that point they differed  young badman 63e was for neglecting of his masters business for going to the whorehouse for beguiling of his master for attempting to debauch his daughters and the like  no marvel then if they disagreed in these points  not so much for that his master had an antipathy against the fact it self for he could do so when he was an apprentice but for that his servant by his sin made spoil of his commodities c and so damnified his master  had as i said before young badmans wickedness had only a tendency to his masters advantage as could he have sworn lied cousened cheated and defrauded customers for his master and indeed sometimes he did so but had that been all that he had done he had not had no not a wry word from his master  but this was not always mr badmans way  atten  that was well brought in even the maid that we read of in the acts and the distinction was as clear betwixt the wickedness and wickedness of servants  wise  alas men that are wicked themselves yet greatly hate it in others not simply because it is wickedness but because it opposeth their interest  do you think that that maids master would have been troubled at the loss of her if he had not lost with her his gain  no ile warrant you she might have gone to the devil for him  but when her master saw that the hope of his gain was gone then then he fell to persecuting paul 64a  but mr badmans master did sometimes lose by mr badmans sins and then badman and his master were at odds  atten  alas poor badman  then it seems thou couldest not at all times please thy like  wise  no he could not and the reason i have told you  atten  but do not bad masters condemn themselves in condemning the badness of their servants 64b  wise  yes 64c in that they condemn that in another which they either have or do allow in themselves  and the time will come when that very sentence that hath gone out of their own mouths against the sins of others themselves living and taking pleasure in the same shall return with violence upon their own pates  the lord pronounced judgment against baasha as for all his evils in general so for this in special because he was like the house of jeroboam and yet killed him 64d  this is mr badmans masters case he is like his man and yet he beats him  he is like his man and yet he rails at him for being bad  atten  but why did not young badman run away from this master as he ran away from the other  wise  he did not  and if i be not mistaken the reason 65a why was this  there was godliness in the house of the first and that young badman could not endure  for fare for lodging for work and time he had better and more by this masters allowance than ever he had by his last but all this would not content because godliness was promoted there  he could not abide this praying this reading of scriptures and hearing and repeating of sermons he could not abide to be told of his transgressions in a sober and godly manner  atten  there is a great deal in the manner of reproof wicked men both can and cannot abide to hear their transgressions spoken against  wise  there is a great deal of difference indeed  this last master of mr badmans would tell mr badman of his sins in mr badmans own dialect he would swear and curse and damn when he told him of his sins and this he could bear better 65b than to be told of them after a godly sort  besides that last master would when his passions and rage was over laugh at and make merry with the sins of his servant badman  and that would please young badman well  nothing offended badman but blows and those he had but few of now because he was pretty well grown up  for the most part when his master did rage and swear he would give him oath for oath and curse for curse at least secretly let him go on as long as he would  atten  this was hellish living  wise  twas hellish living indeed  and a man might say that with this master young badman compleated himself 65c yet more and more in wickedness as well as in his trade  for by that he came out of his time what with his own inclination to sin what with his acquaintance with his three companions and what with this last master and the wickedness he saw in him he became a sinner in grain  i think he had a bastard laid to his charge before he came out of his time  atten  well but it seems he did live to come out of his time 66a but what did he then  wise  why he went home to his father and he like a loving and tenderhearted father received him into his house  atten  and how did he carry it there  wise  why the reason why he went home 66b was for money to set up for himself he staied but a little at home but that little while that he did stay he refrained himself 66c as well he could and did not so much discover himself to be base for fear his father should take distaste and so should refuse or for a while forbear to give him money  yet even then he would have his times and companions and the fill of his lusts with them but he used to blind all with this he was glad to see his old acquaintance and they as glad to see him and he could not in civility but accomodate them with a bottle or two of wine or a dozen or two of drink  atten  and did the old man give him money to set up with  wise  yes above two hundred pounds  atten  therein i think the old man was out  had i been his father i would have held him a little at stavesend till i had had far better proof of his manners to be good for i perceive that his father did know what a naughty boy he had been both by what he used to do at home and because he changed a good master for a bad c  he should not therefore have given him money so soon  what if he had pinched a little and gone to journeywork for a time that he might have known what a penny was by his earning of it  then in all probability he had known better how to have spent it  yea and by that time perhaps have better considered with himself how to have lived in the world  ay and who knows but he might have come to himself with the prodigal and have asked god and his father forgiveness for the villanies that he had committed against them 66d  wise  if his father could also have blessed this manner of dealing to him and have made it effectual for the ends that you have propounded then i should have thought as you  but alas alas you talk as if you never knew or had at this present forgot what the bowels and compassions of a father are  why did you not serve your own son so  but tis evident enough that we are better at giving good counsel to others than we are at taking good counsel our selves 67a  but mine honest neighbour suppose that mr badmans father had done as you say and by so doing had driven his son to ill courses what had he bettered either himself or his son in so doing  atten  thats true but it doth not follow that if the father had done as i said the son would have done as you suppose  but if he had done as you have supposed what had he done worse than what he hath done already 67b  wise  he had done bad enough thats true  but suppose his father had given him no money and suppose that young badman had taken a pett thereat and in an anger had gone beyond sea and his father had neither seen him nor heard of him more  or suppose that of a mad and headstrong stomach he had gone to the highway for money and so had brought himself to the gallows and his father and family to great contempt or if by so doing he had not brought himself to that end yet he had added to all his wickedness such and such evils besides  and what comfort could his father have had in this  besides when his father had done for him what he could with desire to make him an honest man he would then whether his son had proved honest or no have laid down his head with far more peace than if he had taken your counsel  atten  nay i think i should not a been forward to have given advice in the cause but truly you have given me such an account of his vilianies that the hearing thereof has made me angry with him  wise  in an angry mood we may soon outshoot our selves but poor wretch as he is he is gone to his place  but as i said when a good father hath done what he can for a bad child and that child shall prove never the better he will lie down with far more peace than if through severity he had driven him to inconveniencies  i remember that i have heard of a good woman that had as this old man a bad and ungodly 68a son and she prayed for him counselled him and carried it motherly to him for several years together but still he remained bad  at last upon a time after she had been at prayer as she was wont for his conversion she comes to him and thus or to this effect begins again to admonish him  son said she thou hast been and art a wicked child thou hast cost me many a prayer and tear and yet thou remainest wicked well i have done my duty i have done what i can to save thee now i am satisfied that if i shall see thee damned at the day of judgment i shall be so far off from being grieved for thee that i shall rejoyce to hear the sentence of thy damnation at that day and it converted him  i tell you that if parents carry it lovingly towards their children mixing their mercies with loving rebukes and their loving rebukes with fatherly and motherly compassions they are more likely to save their children than by being churlish and severe toward them  but if they do not save them if their mercy doth them no good yet it will greatly ease them at the day of death to consider i have done by love as much as i could to save and deliver my child from hell  atten  well i yield  but pray let us return again to mr badman you say that his father gave him a piece of money that he might set up for himself  wise  yes his father did give him a piece of money and he did set up 68b and almost as soon set down again  for he was not long set up but by his ill managing of his matters at home together with his extravagant expences abroad he was got so far into debt and had so little in his shop to pay that he was hard put to it to keep himself out of prison  but when his creditors understood that he was about to marry and in a fair way to get a rich wife they said among themselves we will not be hasty with him if he gets a rich wife he will pay us all  atten  but how could he so quickly run out for i perceive twas in little time by what you say  wise  twas in little time indeed i think he was not above two years and a half in doing of it  but the reason 69a is apparent for he being a wild young man and now having the bridle loose before him and being wholly subjected to his lusts and vices he gave himself up to the way of his heart and to the sight of his eye forgetting that for all these things god will bring him to judgment 69b and he that doth thus you may be sure shall not be able long to stand on his leggs  besides he had now an addition of 69c new companions companions you must think most like himself in manners and so such that cared not who sunk if they themselves might swim  these would often be haunting of him and of his shop too when he was absent they would commonly egg him to the alehouse but yet make him jackpayforall they would be borrowing also money of him but take no care to pay again except it was with more of their company which also he liked very well and so his poverty came like one that travelleth and his want like an armed man  but all the while they studied his temper 69d he loved to be flattered praised and commanded for wit manhood and personage and this was like stroking him over the face  thus they collogued with him and got yet more and more into him and so like horse leaches they drew away that little that his father had given him and brought him quickly down almost to dwell next dore to the begger  atten  then was the saying of the wise man fulfilled he that keepeth company with harlots and a companion of fools shall be destroyed 69e  wise  ay and that too a companion of riotous persons shameth his father 69f for he poor man had both grief and shame to see how his son now at his own hand behaved himself in the enjoyment of those good things in and under the lawfull use of which he might have lived to gods glory his own comfort and credit among his neighbours  but he that followeth vain persons shall have poverty enough 69g  the way that he took led him directly into this condition for who can expect other things of one that follows such courses  besides when he was in his shop he could not abide to be doing he was naturally given to idleness  he loved to live high but his hands refused to labour and what else can the end of such an one be but that which the wise man saith  the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty and drowsiness shall cloath a man with rags 70a  atten  but now methinks when he was brought thus low he should have considered the hand of god that was gone out against him and should have smote upon the breast and have returned  wise  consideration good consideration was far from him he was as stout and proud now as ever in all his life and was as high too in the pursuit of his sin as when he was in the midst of his fulness only he went now 70b like a tyred jade the devil had rid him almost off of his leggs  atten  well but what did he do when all was almost gone  wise  two things were now his play 70c 1  he bore all in hand by swearing and cracking and lying that he was as well to pass as he was the first day he set up for himself yea that he had rather got than lost and he had at his beck some of his companions that would swear to confirm it as fast as he  atten  this was double wickedness twas a sin to say it and another to swear it  wise  thats true but what evil is that that he will not doe that is left of god as i believe mr badman was  atten  and what was the other thing  wise  why that which i hinted before he was for looking out for a rich wife  70d and now i am come to some more of his invented devised designed and abominable roguery such that will yet declare him to be a most desperate sinner  the thing was this  a wife he wanted or rather money for as for a woman he could have whores enow at his whistle  but as i said he wanted money and that must be got by a wife or no way nor could he so easily get a wife neither except he became an artist at the way of dissembling nor would dissembling do among that people that could dissemble as well as he  but there dwelt a maid not far from him that was both godly 70e and one that had a good portion but how to get her there lay all the craft 71a well he calls a council of some of his most trusty and cunning companions 71b and breaks his mind to them to wit that he had a mind to marry  and he also told them to whom but said he how shall i accomplish my end she is religious and i am not  then one of them made reply saying since she is religious you must pretend to be so likewise and that for some time before you go to her  mark therefore whither she goes daily to hear and do you go thither also but there you must be sure to behave your self soberly and make as if you liked the word wonderful well stand also where she may see you and when you come home be sure that you walk the street very soberly and go within sight of her  this done for a while then go to her and first talk of how sorry you are for your sins and shew great love to the religion that she is of still speaking well of her preachers and of her godly acquaintance bewailing your hard hap that it was not your lot to be acquainted with her and her fellowprofessors sooner and this is the way to get her  also you must write down sermons talk of scriptures and protest that you came a wooing to her only because she is godly and because you should count it your greatest happiness if you might but have such an one  as for her money slight it it will be never the further off thats the way to come soonest at it for she will be jealous at first that you come for her money you know what she has but make not a word about it  do this and you shall see if you do not intangle the lass  thus was the snare laid for this poor honest maid and she was quickly catched in his pit  atten  why did he take this counsel  wise  did he yes and after a while went as boldly to her 71c and that under a vizzard of religion as if he had been for honesty and godliness one of the most sincere and uprighthearted in england  he observed all his points and followed the advice of his counsellers and quickly obtained her too for natural parts he had he was tall and fair and had plain but very good cloaths on his back and his religion was the more easily attained for he had seen something in the house of his father and first master and so could the more readily put himself into the form and shew thereof  so he appointed his day and went to her as that he might easily do for she had neither father nor mother to oppose  well when he was come and had given her a civil complement 72a to let her understand why he was come then he began and told her that he had found in his heart a great deal of love to her person and that of all the damosels in the world he had pitched upon her if she thought fit to make her his beloved wife  the reasons as he told her why he had pitched upon her were her religious and personal excellencies and therefore intreated her to take his condition into her tender and loving consideration  as for the world quoth he i have a very good trade and can maintain my self and family well while my wife sits still on her seat i have got thus and thus much already and feel money come in every day but that is not the thing that i aim at tis an honest and godly wife  then he would present her with a good book or two pretending how much good he had got by them himself  he would also be often speaking well of godly ministers especially of those that he perceived she liked and loved most  besides he would be often telling of her what a godly father he had and what a new man he was also become himself and thus did this treacherous dealer deal with this honest and good girl to her great grief and sorrow as afterward you shall hear  atten  but had the maid no friend to looke after her  wise  her father and mother were dead and that he knew well enough and so she was the more easily overcome by his naughty lying tongue  but if she had never so many friends she might have been beguiled by him  it is too much the custom of young people now to think themselves wise enough to make their own choyce and that they need not ask counsel of those that are older and also wiser then they  72b but this is a great fault in them and many of them have paid dear for it  well to be short in little time mr badman obtains his desire 73a gets this honest girl and her money is married to her brings her home makes a feast entertains her royally but her portion must pay for all  atten  this was wonderfull deceitfull doings a man shall seldom hear of the like  wise  by this his doing he shewed how little he feared god 73b and what little dread he had of his judgments  for all this carriage and all these words were by him premeditated evil he knew he lyed he knew he dissembled yea he knew that he made use of the name of god of religion good men and good books but as a stalkinghorse thereby the better to catch his game  in all this his glorious pretense of religion he was but a glorious painted hypocrite and hypocrisie is the highest sin that a poor carnal wretch can attain unto it is also a sin that most dareth god and that also bringeth the greater damnation  now was he a whited wall now was he a painted sepulchre 73c now was he a grave that appeared not for this poor honest godly damosel little thought that both her peace and comfort and estate and liberty and person and all were going to her burial 73d when she was going to be married to mr badman and yet so it was she enjoyed her self but little afterwards she was as if she was dead and buried to what she enjoyed before  atten  certainly some wonderfull judgment of god must attend and overtake such wicked men as these  wise  you may be sure that they shall have judgment to the full for all these things when the day of judgment is come  but as for judgment upon them in this life it doth not alwayes come no not upon those that are worthy thereof  they that tempt god are delivered and they that work wickedness are set up  73e  but they are reserved to the day of wrath and then for their wickedness god will repay them to their faces 73f  the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath who shall declare his way to his face and who shall repay him what he hath done yet shall he be brought to the grave and remain in the tomb 73g  that is ordinarily they escape gods hand in this life save only a few examples are made that others may be cautioned and take warning thereby  but at the day of judgment they must be rebuked for their evil with the lashes of devouring fire  atten  can you give me no examples of gods wrath upon men that have acted this tragical wicked deed mr badman  wise  yes 74a hamor and shechem and all the men of their city for attempting to make god and religion the stalkinghorse to get jacobs daughters to wife were together slain with the edge of the sword  a judgment of god upon them no doubt for their dissembling in that matter  all manner of lying and dissembling is dreadfull but to make god and religion a disguise therewith to blind thy dissimulation from others eyes is highly provoking to the divine majesty  i knew 74b one that dwelt not far off from our town that got him a wife as mr badman got his but he did not enjoy her long  for one night as he was riding home from his companions where he had been at a neighbouring town his horse threw him to the ground where he was found dead at break of day frightfully and lamentably mangled with his fall and besmeared with his own blood  atten  well but pray return again to mr badman how did he carry it to his wife after he was married to her  wise  nay let us take things along as we go  he had not been married but a little while but his creditors came upon him 74c for their money  he deferred them a little while but at last things were come to that point that pay he must or must do worse so he appointed them a time and they came for their money and he payed them down with her money before her eyes for those goods that he had profusely spent among his whores long before besides the portion that his father gave him to the value of two hundred pounds  atten  this beginning was bad but what shall i say twas like mr badman himself  poor woman this was but a bad beginning for her i fear it filled her with trouble enough as i think such a beginning would have done one perhaps much stronger than she  wise  trouble ay you may be sure of it but now twas too late to repent 75a she should have looked better to herself when being wary would have done her good her harms may be an advantage to others that will learn to take heed thereby but for her self she must take what follows even such a life now as mr badman her husband will lead her and that will be bad enough  atten  this beginning was bad and yet i fear it was but the beginning of bad  wise  you may he sure that it was but the beginning of badness for other evils came on apace as for instance  it was but a little while after he was married 75b but he hangs his religion upon the hedge or rather dealt with it as men deal with their old cloaths who cast them off or leave them to others to wear for his part he would be religious no longer  now therefore he had pulled off his vizzard and began to shew himself in his old shape a base wicked debauched fellow and now the poor woman saw that she was betrayed indeed now also his old companions begin to flock about him and to haunt his house and shop as formerly  and who with them but mr badman and who with him again but they  now those good people that used to company with his wife began to be amated and discouraged 75c also he would frown and gloat upon them as it he abhorred the appearance of them  so that in little time he drove all good company from her and made her sit solitary by herself  he also began now to go out a nights to those drabs 75d who were his familiars before with whom he would stay somtimes till midnight and sometimes till almost morning and then would come home as drunk as a swine and this was the course of mr badman  now when he came home in this case if his wife did but speak a word to him about where he had been and why he had so abused himself though her words were spoken in never so much meekness and love then she was whore 76a and bitch and jade and twas well if she missd his fingers and heels  sometimes also he would bring his puncks home to his house and wo be to his wife when they were gone if she did not entertain them with all varieties possible and also carry it lovingly to them  thus this good woman was made by badman her husband to possess nothing but disappointments as to all that he had promised her or that she hoped to have at his hands  but that that added pressing weight to all her sorrow was that as he had cast away all religion himself so he attempted if possible to make her do so too 76b  he would not suffer her to go out to the preaching of the word of christ nor to the rest of his appointments for the health and salvation of her soul  he would now taunt at and reflectingly speak of her preachers 76c and would receive yea raise scandals of them to her very great grief and affliction  now she scarce durst go to an honest neighbours house or have a good book in her hand specially when he had his companions in his house or had got a little drink in his head  he would also when he perceived that she was dejected speak tauntingly 76d and mockingly to her in the presence of his companions calling of her his religious wife his demure dame and the like also he would make a sport of her among his wanton ones abroad  if she did ask him as sometimes she would to let her go out to a sermon he would in a currish manner reply keep at home keep at home and look to your business we cannot live by hearing of sermons 76e  if she still urged that he would let her goe then he would say to her goe if you dare  he would also charge her with giving of what he had to her ministers when vile wretch he had spent it on his vain companions before  this was the life that mr badmans good wife lived within few months after he had married her  atten  this was a disappointment indeed  wise  a disappointment indeed as ever i think poor woman had one would think that the knave might a little let her have had her will since it was nothing but to be honest and since she brought him so sweet so lumping a portion for she brought hundreds into his house  i say one would think he should have let her had her own will a little since she desired it only in the service and worship of god  but could she win him to grant her that no not a bit if it would have saved her life  true sometimes she would steal out when he was from home on a journey or among his drunken companions but with all privacy imaginable 77a and poor woman this advantage she had she carried it so to all her neighbours that though many of them were but carnal yet they would not betray her or tell of her going out to the word if they saw it but would rather endeavour to hide it from mr badman himself  atten  this carriage of his to her was enough to break her heart  wise  it was enough to do it indeed yea it did effectually do it it killed her in time yea it was all the time a killing of her she would oftentimes when she sate by her self thus mournfully bewail her condition  77b wo is me that i sojourn in meshech and that i dwell in the tents of kedar my soul hath long time dwelt with him that hateth peace 77c  o what shall be given unto thee thou deceitful tongue or what shall be done unto thee thou false tongue  i am a woman grieved in spirit my husband has bought me and sold me for his lusts  twas not me but my money that he wanted  o that he had had it so i had had my liberty  this she said not of contempt of his person but of his conditions and because she saw that by his hypocritical tongue he had brought her not only almost to beggery but robbed her of the word of god  atten  it is a deadly thing i see to be unequally yoaked with unbelievers  if this woman had had a good husband how happily might they have lived together  such an one would have prayed for her taught her and also would have encourages her in the faith and ways of god  but now poor creature instead of this there is nothing but the quite contrary  wise  it is a deadly thing indeed and therefore by the word of god his people are forbid to be joyned in marriage with them 77d be not saith it unequally yoaked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness  and what concord hath christ with belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols 78a  there can be no agreement where such matches are made even god himself hath declared the contrary from the beginning of the world  i says he will put enmity betwixt thee and the woman betwixt thy seed and her seed 78b  therefore he saith in another place they can mix no better than iron and clay  i say they cannot agree they cannot be one and therefore they should be aware at first and not lightly receive such into their affections  god has often made such matches bitter especially to his own  such matches are as god said of elies sons that were spared to consume the eyes and to grieve the heart  oh the wailing and lamentation that they have made that have been thus yoaked especially if they were such as would be so yoaked against their light and good counsel to the contrary  atten  alas he deluded her with his tongue and feigned reformation  wise  well well she should have gone more warily to work  78d what if she had acquainted some of her best most knowing and godly friends therewith what if she had engaged a godly minister or two to have talked with mr badman  also what if she had laid wait round about him to espie if he was not otherwise behind her back than he was before her face  and besides i verily think since in the multitude of counsellors there is safety that if she had acquainted the congregation with it and desired them to spend some time in prayer to god about it and if she must have had him to have received him as to his godliness upon the judgment of others rather than her own she knowing them to be godly and judicious and unbiassed men she had had more peace all her life after than to trust to her own poor raw womanish judgment as she did  love is blind and will see nothing amiss where others may see an hundred faults  therefore i say she should not have trusted to her own thoughts in the matter of his goodness  as to his person there she was fittest to judge because she was to be the person pleased but as to his godliness there the word was the fittest judge and they that could best understand it because god was therein to be pleased  i wish 79a that all young maidens will take heed of being beguiled with flattering words with feigning and lying speeches and take the best way to preserve themselves from being bought and sold by wicked men as she was lest they repent with her when as to this repentance will do them no good but for their unadvisedness goe sorrowing to their graves  atten  well things are past with this poor woman and cannot be called back let others 79b beware by her misfortunes lest they also fall into her distress  wise  that is the thing that i say let them take heed lest for their unadvisedness the smart as this poor woman has done  and ah methinks that they that yet are single persons and that are tempted to marry to such as mr badman would to inform and warn themselves in this matter before they intangle themselves but goe to some that already are in the snare and ask them how it is with them as to the suitable or unsuitableness of their marriage and desire their advice  surely they would ring such a peal in their ears about the unequality unsuitableness disadvantages and disquietments and sins that attend such marriages that would make them beware as long as they live  but the bird in the air knows not the notes of the bird in the snare untill she comes thither herself  besides to make up such marriages satan and carnal reason and lust or at least inconsiderateness has the chiefest hand and where these things bear sway designs though never so destructive will goe headlong on  and therefore i fear that but little warning will be taken by young girls at mr badmans wives affliction  atten  but are there no disswasive arguments to lay before such to prevent their future misery  wise  yes  there is the law of god that forbiddeth marriage with unbelievers  these kind of marriages also are condemned even by irrational creatures  1 it is forbidden by the law of god both in the old testament and in the new  1 in the old  thou shalt not make marriages with them thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son deut 7 4 5 80a  2  in the new testament it is forbidden  be ye not unequally yoaked together with unbelievers let them marry to whom they will only in the lord 80b  here now is a prohibition 80c plainly forbidding the believer to marry with the unbeliever therefore they should not do it  again these unwarrantable marriages are as i may so say condemned by irrational creatures who will not couple but with their own sort will the sheep couple with a dog the partridge with a crow or the feasant with an owl  no they will strictly tye up themselves to those of their own sort only  yea it sets all the world a wondring when they see or hear the contrary  man only is most subject to wink at and allow of these unlawful mixtures of men and women because man only is a sinful beast a sinful bird therefore he above all will take upon him by rebellious actions to answer or rather to oppose and violate the law of his god and creator nor shall these or other interogatories what fellowship what concord what agreement what communion can there be in such marriages be counted of weight or thought worth the answering by him  but further  the dangers 80d that such do commonly run themselves into should be to others a disswasive argument to stop them from doing the like  for besides the distresses of mr badmans wife many that have had very hopefull beginnings for heaven have by vertue of the mischiefs that have attended these unlawfull marriages miserably and fearfully miscarried  soon after such marriages conviction the first step toward heaven hath ceased prayer the next step toward heaven hath ceased hungrings and thirstings after salvation another step towards the kingdom of heaven have ceased  in a word such marriages have estranged them from the word from their godly and faithful friends and have brought them again into carnal company among carnal friends and also into carnal delights where and with whom they have in conclusion both sinfully abode and miserably perished  and this is one reason why god hath forbidden this kind of unequal marriages  for they saith he meaning the ungodly will turn away thy son from following me that they may serve other gods so will the anger of the lord be kindled against you and destroy you suddenly 81a  now mark there were some in israel that would notwithstanding this prohibition venture to marry to the heathens and unbelievers  but what followed  they served their idols they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils  thus were they defiled with their own works and went a whoring with their own inventions  therefore was the wrath of the lord kindled against his people insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance 81b  atten  but lets return again to mr badman had he any children by his wife  wise  yes seven  atten  i doubt they were but badly brought up  wise  one of them loved its mother dearly and would constantly harken to her voice  now that child 81c she had the opportunity to instruct in the principles of christian religion and it became a very gracious child  but that child mr badman could not abide he would seldom afford it a pleasant word but would scowl and frown upon it speak churlishly and doggedly to it and though as to nature it was the most feeble of the seven yet it oftenest felt the weight of its fathers fingers  three of his children did directly follow his steps and began to be as vile as in his youth he was himself  the other that remained became a kind of mungrel professors not so bad as their father nor so good as their mother but were betwixt them both  they had their mothers notions and their fathers actions and were much like those that you read of in the book of nehemiah these children spake half in the speech of ashdod and could not speak in the jews language but according to the language of each people 81d  atten  what you say in this matter is observable and if i take not my mark amiss it often happeneth after this manner where such unlawful marriages are contracted  wise  it sometimes doth so and the reason with respect to their parents is this  where the one of the parents is godly and the other ungodly and vile though they can agree in begetting of children yet they strive for their children when they are born 82a  the godly parent strives for the child and by prayers counsel and good examples labours to make it holy in body and soul and so fit for the kingdom of heaven but the ungodly would have it like himself wicked and base and sinful and so they both give instructions accordingly  instructions did i say yea and examples too according to their minds  thus the godly as hannah is presenting her samuel unto the lord  but the ungodly like them that went before them are for offering their children to moloch to an idol to sin to the devil and to hell  thus one harkeneth to the law of their mother and is preserved from destruction but as for the other as their fathers did so do they  thus did mr badman and his wife part some of their children betwixt them but as for the other three that were as twere mungrels betwixt both they were like unto those that you read of in kings they feared the lord but served their own idols 82b  they had as i sail their mothers notions and i will adde profession too but their fathers lusts and something of his life  now their father did not like them because they had their mothers tongue and the mother did not like them because they had still their fathers heart and life nor were they indeed fit company for good or bad  the good would not trust them because they were bad the bad would not trust them because they were good viz  the good would not trust them because they were bad in their lives and the bad would not trust them because they were good in their words  so they were forced with esau to joyn in affinity with ishmael to wit to look out a people that were hypocrites like themselves and with them they matcht and lived and died  atten  poor woman she could not but have much perplexity  wise  yea and poor children that ever they were sent into the world as the fruit of the loyns and under the government of such a father as mr badman  atten  you say right for such children lye almost under all manner of disadvantages  but we must say nothing because this also is the sovereign will of god  wise  we may not by any means object against god  yet we may talk of the advantages and disadvantages that children have by having for their parents such as are either godly or the contrary  atten  you say right we may so and pray now since we are about it speak something in brief unto it that is unto this what advantage those children have above others that have for their parents such as indeed are godly  wise  so i will only i must first premise these two or three things 83a  1  they have not the advantage of election for their fathers sakes  2  they are born as others the children of wrath though they come of godly parents  3  grace comes not unto them as an inheritance because they have godly parents  these things premised i shall now proceed  1  the children of godly parents are the children of many prayers they are prayed for before and prayed for after they are born and the prayer of a godly father and godly mother doth much  2  they have the advantage of what restraint is possible from what evils their parents see them inclinable to and that is a second mercy  3  they have the advantage of godly instruction and of being told which be and which be not the right ways of the lord  4  they have also those ways commended unto them and spoken well of in their hearing that are good  5  such are also what may be kept out of evil company from evil books and from being taught the way of swearing lying and the like as sabbathbreaking and mocking at good men and good things and this is a very great mercy  6  they have also the benefit of a godly life set before them doctrinally by their parents and that doctrine backt with a godly and holy example  and all these are very great advantages  now all these advantages the children of ungodly parents want 84a and so are more in danger of being carried away with the error of the wicked  for ungodly parents neither pray for their children nor do nor can they heartily instruct them they do not after a godly manner restrain them from evil nor do they keep them from evil company  they are not grieved at nor yet do they forewarn their children to beware of such evil actions that are abomination to god and to all good men  they let their children break the sabbath swear lye be wicked and vain  they commend not to their children an holy life nor set a good example before their eyes  no they do in all things contrary  estranging of their children what they can from the love of god and all good men so soon as they are born  therefore it is a very great judgment of god upon children to be the offspring of base and ungodly men 84b  atten  well but before we leave mr badmans wife and children i have a mind if you please to enquire a little more after one thing the which i am sure you can satisfie me in  wise  what is that  atten  you said a while ago that this mr badman would not suffer his wife to go out to hear such godly ministers as she liked but said if she did she had as good never come home any more  did he often carry it thus to her  wise  he did say so he did often say so  this i told you then and had also then told you more but that other things put me out  atten  well said pray therefore now go on  wise  so i will  upon a time she was on a lords day for going to hear a sermon and mr badman was unwilling 84c she should  but she at that time as it seems did put on more courage than she was wont and therefore after she had spent upon him a great many fair words and entreaties if perhaps she might have prevailed by them but all to no purpose at all  at last she said she would go and rendred this reason for it i have an husband but also a god my god has commanded me and that upon pain of damnation to be a continual worshipper of him and that in the way of his own appointments  i have an husband but also a soul and my soul ought to be more unto me than all the world besides  this soul of mine i will look after care for and if i can provide it an heaven for its habitation  you are commanded to love me as you love your own body and so do i love you 85a but i tell you true i preferr my soul before all the world and its salvation i will seek  at this first 85b he gave her an ugly wish and then fell into a fearfull rage and sware moreover that if she did go he would make both her and all her damnable brotherhood for so he was pleased to call them to repent their coming thither  atten  but what should he mean by that  wise  you may easily guess what he meant  he meant he would turn informer and so either weary out those that she loved from meeting together to worship god or make them pay dearly for their so doing the which if he did he knew it would vex every vein of her tender heart  atten  but do you think mr badman would have been so base  wise  truly he had malice and enmity enough in his heart to do it onely he was a tradesman also he knew that he must live by his neighbours and so he had that little wit in his anger that he refrained himself and did it not  but as i said he had malice and envy enough in his heart 85c to have made him to do it only he thought it would worst him in his trade  yet these three things he would be doing  1  he would be putting of others on to molest and abuse her friends  2  he would be glad when he heard that any mischief befell them  3  and would laugh at her when he saw her troubled for them  and now i have told you mr badmans way as to this  atten  but was he not afraid of the judgments of god that did fly about at that time  wise  he regarded not the judgment nor mercy of god for had he at all done that he could not have done as he did  but what judgments do you mean  atten  such judgments that if mr badman himself had taken but sober notice of they might have made him a hung down his ears  wise  why have you heard of any such persons that the judgments of god have overtaken  atten  yes and so i believe have you too though you make so strange about it  wise  i have so indeed to my astonishment and wonder  atten  pray therefore if you please tell me what it is as to this that you know and then perhaps i may also say something to you of the same  wise  in 86a our town 86b there was one w s a man of a very wicked life and he when there seemed to be countenance given to it would needs turn informer  well so he did and was as diligent in his business as most of them could be he would watch a nights climb trees and range the woods a days if possible to find out the meeters for then they were forced to meet in the fields  yea he would curse them bitterly and swear most fearfully what he would do to them when he found them  well after he had gone on like a bedlam in his course a while and had done some mischiefs to the people he was stricken by the hand of god and that in this manner  1  although he had his tongue naturally at will now he was taken with a faultering in his speech and could not for weeks together speak otherwise than just like a man that was drunk  2  then he was taken with a drauling or slabbering at his mouth which slabber sometimes would hang at his mouth well nigh half way down to the ground  3  then he had such a weakness in the back sinews of his neck that oft times he could not look up before him unless he clapped his hand hard upon his forehead and held up his head that way by strength of hand  4  after this his speech went quite away and he could speak no more than a swine or a bear  therefore like one of them he would gruntle and make an ugly noyse according as he was offended or pleased or would have any thing done c  in this posture he continued for the space of half a year or thereabouts all the while otherwise well and could go about his business save once that he had a fall from the bell as it hangs in our steeple which twas a wonder it did not kill him  but after that he also walked about till god had made him a sufficient spectacle of his judgment for his sin and then on a sudden he was stricken and dyed miserably  and so there was an end of him and his doings  i will tell you 87a of another  about four miles from st neots there was a gentleman had a man and he would needs be an informer and a lusty young man he was  well an informer he was and did much distress some people and had perfected his informations so effectually against some that there was nothing further to do but for the constables to make distress on the people that he might have the money or goods and as i heard he hastened them much to do it  now while he was in the heat of his work as he stood one day by the fireside he had it should seem a mind to a sop in the pan for the spit was then at the fire so he went to make him one but behold a dog so say his own dog took distaste at something and bit his master by the leg the which bite notwithstanding all the means that was used to cure him turned as was said to a gangrene however that wound was his death and that a dreadful one too  for my relator said that he lay in such a condition by this bite as the beginning till his flesh rotted from off him before he went out of the world  but what need i instance in particular persons when the judgement of god against this kind of people was made manifest i think i may say if not in all yet in most of the counties in england where such poor creatures were  but i would if it had been the will of god that neither i nor any body else could tell you more of these stories true stories that are neither lye nor romance  atten  well i also heard of both these my self and of more too as remarkable in their kind as these if i had any list to tell them  but let us leave those that are behind to others or to the coming of christ who then will justifie or condemn them as the merit of their work shall require or if they repented and found mercy i shall be glad when i know it for i wish not a curse to the soul of mine enemy  wise  there can be no pleasure in the telling of such stories though to hear of them may do us a pleasure  they may put us in mind that there is a god that judgeth in the earth and that doth not alwayes forget nor deferre to hear the crye of the destitute they also carry along with them both caution and counsel to those that are the survivors of such  let us tremble at the judgements of god and be afraid of sinning against him and it shall be our protection  it shall go well with them that fear god that fear before him  atten  well sir as you have intimated so i think we have in this place spoken enough about these kind of men if you please let us return again to mr badman himself if you have any more to say of him  wise  more we have yet scarce throughly begun with any thing that we have said  all the particulars are in themselves so full of badness that we have rather only looked in them than indeed said any thing to them  but we will pass them and proceed  you have heard of the sins of his youth of his apprentiship and how he set up and married and what a life he hath led his wife and now i will tell you some more 88a of his pranks  he had the very knack of knavery had he as i said before been bound to serve an apprentiship to all these things he could not have been more cunning he could not have been more artificial at it  atten  nor perhaps so artificially neither  for as none can teach goodness like to god himself so concerning sin and knavery none can teach a man it like the devil to whom as i perceive mr badman went to school from his childhood to the end of his life but pray sir make a beginning  wise  well so i will  you may remember that i told you what a condition he was in for money before he did marry and how he got a rich wife with whose money he paid his debts  now when he had paid his debts he having some moneys left he sets up again 88b as briskly as ever keeps a great shop drives a great trade and runs again a great way into debt but now not into the debt of one or two but into the debt of many so that at last he came to owe some thousands and thus he went on a good while  and to pursue his ends the better he began now to study to please all men and to suit himself to any company he could now be as they say as they that is if he listed and then he would list when he perceived that by so doing he might either make them his customers or creditors for his commodities  if he dealt with honest men as with some honest men he did then he would be as they talk as they seem to be sober as they talk of justice and religion as they and against debauchery as they yea and would too seem to shew a dislike of them that said did or were otherwise than honest  again when he did light among those that were bad then he would be as they but yet more close and cautiously except he were sure of his company  then he would carry it openly be as they say damnem and sinkem as they  if they railed on good men so could he 89a if they railed on religion so could he  if they talked beastly vainly idlely so would he if they were for drinking swearing whoring or any the like villanies so was he  this was now the path he trod in and could do all artificially as any man alive  and now he thought himself a perfect man he thought he was always a boy till now  what think you now of mr badman  atten  think why i think he was an atheist  for no man but an atheist can do this  i say it cannot be but that the man that is such as this mr badman must be a rank and stinking atheist for he that believes that there is either god or devil heaven or hell or death and judgment after cannot doe as mr badman did i mean if he could do these things without reluctancy and check of conscience yea if he had not sorrow and remorse for such abominable sins as these  wise  nay he was so far off from reluctancies and remorse of conscience for these things that he counted them the excellency of his attainments the quintessence of his wit his rare and singular vertues such as but few besides himself could be the masters of therefore as for those that made boggle and stop at things and that could not in conscience and for fear of death and judgement do such things as he he would call them fools and noddies and charge them for being frighted with the talk of unseen bugbears and would encourage them if they would be men indeed to labour after the attainment of this his excellent art  he would often times please himself 90a with the thoughts of what he could do in this matter saying within himself i can be religious and irreligious i can be any thing or nothing i can swear and speak against swearing i can lye and speak against lying i can drink wench be unclean and defraud and not be troubled for it  now i enjoy my self and am master of mine own wayes and not they of me this i have attained with much study great care and more pains but this his talk should be only with himself to his wife who he knew durst not divulge it or among his intimates to whom he knew he might say any thing  atten  did i call him before an atheist  i may call him now a devil or a man possessed with one if not with many  i think that there cannot be found in every corner such an one as this  true it is said of king ahaz that be sinned more and more and of ahab that he sold himself to work wickedness and of the men of sodom that they were sinners exceedingly before the lord 90b  wise  an atheist he was no doubt if there be such a thing as an atheist in the world but for all his brags of perfection and security in his wickedness i believe that at times god did let down fire from heaven into his conscience  true i believe he would quickly put it out again and grow more desperate and wicked afterward but this also turned to his destruction as afterward you may hear 90c  but i am not of your mind to think that there are but few such in the world except you mean as to the degree of wickedness unto which he had attained  for otherwise no doubt 90d there is abundance of such as he  men of the same mind of the same principles and of the same conscience too to put them into practice  yea i believe that there are many that are endeavouring to attain to the same pitch of wickedness and all them are such as he in the judgment of the law nor will their want of hellish wit to attain thereto excuse them at the day of judgment  you know that in all science some are more arch than some and so it is in the art as well as in the practice of wickedness  some are two fold and some sevenfold more the children of hell than others and yet all the children of hell else they would all be masters and none scholars in the school of wickedness  but there must be masters and there must be learners mr badman was a master in this art and therefore it follows that he must be an arch and chief one in that mystery  atten  you are in the right for i perceive that some men though they desire it cannot be so arch in the practice thereof as others but are as i suppose they call them fools and dunces to the rest their heads and capacities will not serve them to act and do so wickedly  but mr badman wanted not a wicked head to contrive as well as a wicked heart to do his wickedness  wise  true but yet i say such men shall at the day of judgment be judged not only for what they are but also for what they would be  for if the thought of foolishness is sin 91a doubtless the desire of foolishness is more sin  and if the desire be more the endeavour after it must needs be more and more 91b  he then that is not an artificial atheist and transgressor yet if he desires to be so if he endeavoureth to be so he shall be judged and condemned to hell for such an one  for the law judgeth men as i said according to what they would be  he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart 91c  by the same rule he that would steal doth steal he that would cheat doth cheat he that would swear doth swear and he that would commit adultery doth do so  for god judgeth men according to the working of their minds and saith as he thinketh so is he  that is so is he in his heart in his intentions in his desires in his endeavours and gods law i say lays hold of the desires intentions and endeavours even as it lays hold of the act of wickedness it self 91d  a man then that desires to be as bad as mr badman and desires to be so wicked have many in their hearts though he never attains to that proficiency in wickedness as he shall yet be judged for as bad a man as he because twas in his desires to be such a wicked one  atten  but this height of wickedness in mr badman will not yet out of my mind  this hard desperate or what shall i call it diabolicall frame of heart was in him a foundation a groundwork to all acts and deeds that were evil  wise  the heart and the desperate wickedness of it is the foundation and groundwork of all  atheism professed and practicall spring both out of the heart yea and all manner of evils besides 92a  for they be not bad deeds that make a bad man but he is already a bad man that doth bad deeds  a man must be wicked before he can do wickedness 92b  wickedness proceedeth from the wicked  tis an evil tree that bears evil fruit men gather no grapes of thorns the heart therefore must be evil before the man can do evil and good before the man doth good  atten  now i see the reason why mr badman was so base as to get a wife by dissimulation and to abuse her so like a villain when he had got her it was because he was before by a wicked heart prepared to act wickedness  wise  you may be sure of it for from within out of the heart of man proccedeth evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders thefts coveteousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy pride foolishness  all these things come from within and defile a man 92c  and a man as his naughty mind inclines him makes use of these or any of these to gratifie his lust to promote his designs to revenge his malice to enrich or to wallow himself in the foolish pleasures and pastimes of this life  and all these did mr badman do even to the utmost if either opportunity or purse or perfidiousness would help him to the obtaining of his purpose  atten  purse  why he could not but have purse to do almost what he would having married a wife with so much money  wise  hold you there some of mr badmans sins were costly as his drinking and whoring and keeping other bad company though he was a man that had ways too many to get money as well as ways too many to spend it  atten  had he then such a good trade for all he was such a bad man or was his calling so gainfull to him as alwayes to keep his purses belly full though he was himself a great spender  wise  no  it was not his trade that did it though he had a pretty trade too  he had another way to get money and that by hatfulls and pocketfulls at a time  atten  why i trow he was no highway man was he  wise  i will be sparing in my speech as to that though some have muttered as if he could ride out now and then about no body but himself knew what over night and come home all dirty and weary next morning  but that is not the thing i aim at  atten  pray let me know it if you think it convenient that i should  wise  i will tell you  it was this he had an art to break 93a and get hatfulls of money by breaking  atten  but what do you mean by mr badmans breaking you speak mystically do you not  wise  no no i speak plainly  or if you will have it in plainer language tis this  when mr badman had swaggered and whored away most of his wifes portion he began to feel that he could not much longer stand upon his legs in this course of life and keep up his trade and repute such as he had in the world but by the new engine of breaking  wherefore upon a time he gives a great and sudden 93b rush into several mens debts to the value of about four or five thousand pound driving at the same time a very great trade by selling many things for less than they cost him to get him custom therewith to blind his creditors eyes  his creditors therefore feeling that he had a great employ and dreaming that it must needs at length turn to a very good account to them trusted him freely without mistrust and so did others too to the value of what was mentioned before  well when mr badman had well feathered his nest with other mens goods and money after a little time 93c he breaks  and by and by it is noysed abroad that mr badman had shut up shop was gone and could trade no longer  now by that time his breaking was come to his creditors ears he had by craft and knavery made so sure of what he had that his creditors could not touch a penny  well when he had done he sends his mournfull sugered letters to his creditors to let them understand what had happened unto him and desired them not to be severe with him 94a for he bore towards all men an honest mind and would pay so far as he was able  now he sends his letters by a man 94b confederate with him who could make both the worst and best of mr badmans case  the best for mr badman and the worst for his creditors  so when he comes to them he both bemoans them and condoles mr badmans condition  telling of them that without a speedy bringing of things to a conclusion mr badman would be able to make them no satisfaction but at present he both could and would and that to the utmost of his power  and to that end he desired that they would come over to him  well his creditors appoint him a time and come over and he mean while authorizes another to treat with them but will not be seen himself unless it was on a sunday lest they should snap him with a writ  so his deputed friend treats with them about their concern with mr badman first telling them of the great care that mr badman took to satisfie them and all men for whatsoever he ought as far as in him lay and how little he thought a while since to be in this low condition  he pleaded also the greatness of his charge the greatness of taxes the badness of the times and the great losses that he had by many of his customers some of which died in his debt others were run away and for many that were alive he never expected a farthing from them  yet nevertheless he would shew himself an honest man and would pay as far as he was able and if they were willing to come to terms he would make a composition with them for he was not able to pay them all  the creditors asked what he would give 94c  twas replyed half a crown in the pound  at this they began to huff and he to renew his complaint and entreaty but the creditors would not hear and so for that time their meeting without success broke up  but after his creditors were in cool blood and admitting of second thoughts and fearing lest delays should make them lose all they admit of a second debate come together again and by many words and great ado they obtained five shillings ith pound 94d  so the money was produced releases and discharges drawn signed and sealed books crossed and all things confirmed and then mr badman can put his head out of dores again and be a better man than when he shut up shop by several thousands of pounds  atten  and did he do thus indeed  wise yes once and again  i think he brake twice or thrice  atten  and did he do it before he had need to do it  wise  need  what do you mean by need there is no need at any time for a man to play the knave 95a  he did it of a wicked mind to defraud and beguile his creditors  he had wherewithall of his father and also by his wife to have lived upon with lawfull labour like an honest man  he had also when he made this wicked break though he had been a profuse and prodigal spender to have paid his creditors their own to a farthing  but had he done so he had not done like himself like mr badman had he i say dealt like an honest man he had then gone out of mr badmans road  he did it therefore of a dishonest mind and to a wicked end to wit that he might have wherewithall howsoever unlawfully gotten to follow his cups and queans and to live in the full swinge of his lusts even as he did before  atten  why this was a meer cheat  wise  it was a cheat indeed  this way of breaking it is else but a more neat way of thieving of picking of pockets of breaking open of shops and of taking from men what one has nothing to do with  but though it seem easie it is hard to learn no man that has conscience to god or man can ever be his crafts master in this hellish art  atten  oh sirs what a wicked man was this  wise  a wicked man indeed  by this art he could tell how to make men send their goods to his shop and then be glad to take a penny for that for which he had promised before it came thither to give them a groat  i say he could make them glad to take a crown for a pounds worth and a thousand for that for which he had promised before to give them four thousand pounds  atten  this argueth that mr badman had but little conscience  wise  this argued that mr badman had no conscience at all for conscience the least spark of a good conscience cannot endure this  atten  before we go any further in mr badmans matters let me desire you if you please to give me an answer to these two questions 96a  1  what do you find in the word of god against such a practice as this of mr badmans is 96b  2  what would you have a man do that is in his creditors debt and can neither pay him what be owes him nor go on in a trade any longer  wise  i will answer you as well as i can  and first to the first of your questions  to wit what i find in the word of god against such a practice as this of mr badmans is  answ  the word of god doth forbid this wickedness and to make it the more odious in our eyes it joyns it with theft and robbery thou shalt not says god defraud thy neighbour nor rob him 96c thou shalt not defraud that is deceive or beguile  now thus to break is to defraud deceive and beguile which is as you see forbidden by the god of heaven  thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour nor rob him  it is a kind of theft and robbery thus to defraud and beguile 96d  it is a wilely robbing of his shop and picking of his pocket  a thing odious to reason and conscience and contrary to the law of nature  it is a designed piece of wickedness and therefore a double sin  a man cannot do this great wickedness on a sudden and through a violent assault of satan  he that will commit this sin must have time to deliberate that by invention he may make it formidable and that with lies and high dissimulations  he that commits this wickedness must first hatch it upon his bed beat his head about it and lay his plot strong  so that to the completing of such a wickedness there must be adjoyned many sins and they too must go hand in hand untill it be compleated  but what saith the scripture 96e96f let no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter because the lord is the avenger of all such  but this kind of breaking is a going beyond my brother this is a compassing of him about that i may catch him in my net and as i said an art to rob my brother and to pick his pocket and that with his consent which doth not therefore mitigate but so much the more greaten and make odious the offence  for men that are thus wilily abused cannot help themselves they are taken in a deceitfull net  but god will here concern himself he will be the avenger he will be the avenger of all such either here or in another world  and this the apostle testifies again where he saith 97a but he that doth wrong shall receive for the wrong that he hath done and there is no respect of persons 97b  that is there is no man be he what he will if he will be guilty of this sin of going beyond of beguiling of and doing wrong to his brother but god will call him to an account for it and will pay him with vengeance for it too for there is no respect of persons  i might add that this sin of wronging of going beyond and defrauding of my neighbour it is like that first prank that the devil plaid with our first parents 97c as the altar that uriah built for ahaz was taken from the fashion of that that stood at damascus to be the very pattern of it  the serpent beguiled me says eve mr badman beguiles his creditors  the serpent beguiled eve with lying promises of gain and so did mr badman beguile his creditors  the serpent said one thing and meant another when he beguiled eve and so did mr badman when he beguiled his creditors  that man therefore that doth thus deceive and beguile his neighbour imitateth the devil he taketh his examples from him and not from god the word or good men  and this did mr badman  and now to your second question  to wit what i would have a man do that is in his creditors debt and that can neither pay him nor go on in a trade any longer 97d  answ  first of all  if this be his case and he knows it let him not run one penny further in his creditors debt  for that cannot be done with good conscience  he that knowes he cannot pay and yet will run into debt does knowingly wrong and defraud his neighbour and falls under that sentence of the word of god the wicked borroweth and payeth not again  yea worse he borrows though at the very same time he knows that he cannot pay again  he doth also craftily take away what is his neighbours  that is therefore the first thing that i would propound to such  let him not run any further into his creditors debt 98a  secondly after this let him consider 98b how and by what means he was brought into such a condition that he could not pay his just debts  to wit whether it was by his own remisness in his calling by living too high in dyet or apparel by lending too ravishingly that which was none of his own to his loss or whether by the immediate hand and judgment of god  if by searching he findes that this is come upon him through remisness in his calling extravagancies in his family or the like let him labour for a sence of his sin and wickedness 98c for he has sinned against the lord  first in his being slothfull in business and in not providing to wit of is own by the sweat of his brows or other honest ways for those of his own house 98d  and secondly in being lavishing in dyet and apparel in the family or in lending to others that which was none of his own this cannot be done with good conscience  it is both against reason and nature and therefore must be a sin against god  i say therefore if thus this debtor hath done if ever he would live quietly in conscience and comfortably in his condition for the future let him humble himself before god and repent of this his wickedness  for he that is slothfull in his work is brother to him that is a great waster 98e  to be slothfull and a waster too is to be as it were a double sinner  but again as this man should enquire into these things so he should also into this  how came i into this way of dealing in which i have now miscarried is it a way that my parents brought me up in put me apprentice to or that by providence i was first thrust into or is it a way into which i have twisted my self as not being contented with my first lot that by god and my parents i was cast into  this ought duly to be considered 98f  and if upon search a man shall find that he is out of the place and calling into which he was put by his parents or the providence of god and has miscarried in a new way that through pride and dislike of his first state he as chose rather to embrace his miscarriage is his sin the fruit of his pride and a token of the judgment of god upon him for his leaving of his first state  and for this he ought as for the former to be humble and penitent before the lord  but if by search he finds that his poverty came by none of these if by honest search he finds it so and can say with good conscience i went not out of my place and state in which god by his providence had put me but have abode with god in the calling wherein i was called and have wrought hard and fared meanly been civilly apparelled and have not directly nor indirectly made away with my creditors goods  then has his fall come upon him by the immediate hand of god whether by visible or invisible wayes  for sometimes it comes by visible wayes to wit by fire by thieves by loss of cattel or the wickedness of sinful dealers c  and sometimes by means invisible and then no man knows how we only see things are going but cannot see by what way they go  well now suppose that a man by an immediate hand of god is brought to a morsel of bread what must he do now  i answer  his surest way is still to think that this is the fruit of some sin though possibly not sin in the management of his calling yet of some other sin  god casteth away the substance of the wicked  therefore let him still humble himself before his god because his hand is upon him and say what sin is this for which this hand of god is upon me and let him be diligent to find it out for some sin is the cause of this judgment for god doth not willingly afflict nor grieve the children of men  either the heart is too much set upon the world or religion is too much neglected in thy family or some thing  there is a snake in the grass a worm in the gourd some sin in thy bosom for the sake of which god doth thus deal with thee  thirdly this thus done let that man again consider thus with himself  perhaps god is now changing of my condition and state in the world he has let me live in fashion in fulness and abundance of worldly glory and i did not to his glory improve as i should that his good dispensation to me 100a  but when i lived in full and fat pasture i did there lift up the heel  therefore he will now turn me into hard commons that with leanness and hunger and meanness and want i may spend the rest of my days  but let him do this without murmering and repining let him do it in a godly manner submitting himself to the judgment of god  let the rich rejoyce in that he is made low 100b  this is duty and it may be priviledg to those that are under this hand of god  and for thy encouragement to this hard work for this is a hard work consider of these four things 100c  1  this is right lying down under gods hand and the way to be exalted in gods time  when god would have job embrace the dunghill he embraces it and says the lord giveth and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord 100d  2  consider that there are blessings also that attend a low condition more than all the world are aware of  a poor condition has preventing mercy attending of it  the poor because they are poor are not capable of sinning against god as the rich man does  3  the poor can more clearly see himself preserved by the providence of god than the rich for he trusteth in the abundance of his riches 100e  4  it may be god has made thee poor because he would make thee rich  hearken my beloved brethren hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of a kingdom which god hath promised to them that love him 100f  i am perswaded if men upon whom this hand of god is would thus quietly lye down and humble themselves under it they would find more peace yea more blessing of god attending them in it than the most of men are aware of  but this is an hard chapter and therefore i do not expect that many should either read it with pleasure or desire to take my counsel  having thus spoken to the broken man with reference to his own self i will now speak to him as he stands related to his creditors  in the next place therefore let him fall upon the most 101a honest way of dealing with his creditors and that i think must be this  first let him timely make them acquainted with his condition and also do to them these three things  1  let him heartily and unfeignedly ask them forgiveness for the wrong that he has done them  2  let him proffer them all and the whole all that ever he has in the world let him hide nothing let him strip himself to his raiment for them let him not keep a ring a spoon or any thing from them  3  if none of these two will satisfie them let him proffer them his body to be at their dispose to wit either to abide imprisonment their pleasure or to be at their service till by labour and travel he hath made them such amends as they in reason think fit only reserving something for the succour of his poor and distressed family out of his labour which in reason and conscience and nature he is bound also to take care of  thus shall he make them what amends he is able for the wrong that he hath done them in wasting and spending of their estates  by thus doing he submits himself to gods rod commits himself to the dispose of his providence yea by thus doing he casteth the lot of his present and future condition into the lap of his creditors and leaves the whole dispose thereof to the lord 101b even as he shall order and incline their hearts to do with him and let that be either to forgive him or to take that which he hath for satisfaction or to lay his body under affliction this way or that according to law can he i say thus leave the whole dispose to god let the issue be what it will that man shall have peace in his mind afterward  and the comforts of that state which will be comforts that attend equity justice and duty will be more unto him because more according to godliness than can be the comforts that are the fruits of injustice fraudulency and deceit  besides this is the way to engage god to favour him by the sentence of his creditors for he can entreat them to use him kindly and he will do it when his ways are pleasing in his sight  when a mans ways please the lord his enemies shall be at peace with him 102a and surely for a man to seek to make restitution for wrongs done to the utmost of his power by what he is has and enjoys in this world is the best way in that capacity and with reference to that thing that a man can at this time be found active in  but he that doth otherwise abides in his sin refuses to be disposed of by the providence of god chuseth an high estate though not attained in gods way when gods will is that he should descend into a low one  yea he desperately saith in his heart and actions i will be mine own chooser and that in mine own way whatever happens or follows thereupon  atten  you have said well in my mind  but suppose now that mr badman was here could he not object as to what you have said saying go and teach your brethren that are professors this lesson for they as i am are guilty of breaking yea i am apt to think of that which you call my knavish way of breaking to wit of breaking before they have need to break  but if not so yet they are guilty of neglect in their calling 102b of living higher both in fare and apparrel than their trade or income will maintain  besides that they do break all the world very well knowes and that they have the art to plead for a composition is very well known to men and that it is usual with them to hide their linnen their plate their jewels and tis to be thought sometimes money and goods besides is as common as four eggs a penny  and thus they beguile men debauch their consciences sin against their profession and make tis to be feared their lusts in all this and the fulfilling of them their end  i say if mr badman was here to object thus unto you what would be your reply  wise  what  why i would say i hope no good man no man of good conscience no man that either feareth god regardeth the credit of religion the peace of gods people or the salvation of his own soul will do thus  professors such perhaps there may be and who upon earth can help it  jades there be of all colours 103a  if men will profess and make their profession a stalkinghorse to beguile their neighbours of their estates as mr badman himself did when he beguiled her that now is with sorrow his wife who can help it the churches of old were pestered with such and therefore no marvel if these perilous difficult times be so  but mark how the apostle words it  nay do wrong and defraud and that your brethren  know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god  be not deceived neither fornicator nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god 103b  none of these shall be saved in this state nor shall profession deliver them from the censure of the godly when they shall be manifest such to be  but their profession we cannot help  how can we help it if men should ascribe to themselves the title of holy ones godly ones zealous ones selfdenying ones or any other such glorious title and while they thus call themselves they should be the veryest rogues for all evil sin and villany imaginable who could help it  true they are a scandal to religion a grief to the honest hearted an offence to the world and a stumbling stone to the weak and these offences have come do come and will come do what all the world can but wo be to them through whom they come 103c let such professors therefore disowned by all true christians and let them be reckoned among those base men of the world which by such actions they most resemble  they are mr badmans kindred  for 103d they are a shame to religion i say these slithy rob shop pickpocket men they are a shame to religion and religious men should be ashamed of them  god puts such an one among the fools of the world therefore let not christians put them among those that are wise for heaven  as the partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not so he that getteth riches and not by right shall leave them in the midst of his dayes and at his end shall be a fool 103e  and the man under consideration is one of these and therefore must look to fall by this judgment  a professor and practice such villianies as these such an one is not worthy to bear that name any longer  we may say to such as the prophet spake to their like to wit to the rebellious that were in the house of israel  goe ye serve every man his idols if ye will not hearken to the law and testament of god to lead your lives thereafter  but pollute gods holy name no more with your gifts and with your idols 104a  goe professors goe leave off profession unless you will lead your lives according to your profession  better never profess than to make profession a stalkinghorse to sin deceit to the devil and hell  the ground and rules of religion allow not any such thing  receive us says the apostle we have wronged no man we have corrupted no man we have defrauded no man 104b  intimating that those that are guilty of wronging corrupting or defrauding of any should not be admitted to the fellowship of saints no nor into the common catalogue of brethren with them  nor can men with all their rhetorick and eloquent speaking prove themselves fit for the kingdom of heaven or men of good conscience on earth 104c  o that godly plea of samuel  behold here i am says he witness against me before the lord and  before his anointed whose oxe have i taken or whose ass have i taken or whom have i defrauded whom have i oppressed 104d c  this was to do like a man of good conscience indeed  and in this his appeal he was so justified in the consciencies of the whole congregation that they could not but with one voice as with one mouth break out joyntly and say thou hast not defrauded us nor oppressed us 104e  a professor and defraud away with him a professor should not owe any man any thing but love  a professor should provide things not of other mens but of his own of his own honest getting and that not onely in the sight of god but of all men that he may adorn the doctrine if god our saviour in all things  atten  but 105a suppose god should blow upon a professor in his estate and calling and he should be run out before he is aware must he be accounted to be like mr badman and lie under the same reproach as he  wise  no  105b if he hath dutifully done what he could to avoid it  it is possible for a ship to sink at sea notwithstanding the most faithfull endeavour of the most skilful pilot under heaven and thus as i suppose it was with the prophet that left his wife in debt to the hazarding the slavery of her children by the creditors 105c  he was no profuse man nor one that was given to defraud for the text says he feared god yet as i said he was run out more than she could pay  if god would blow upon a man who can help it and he will do so sometimes 105d because he will change dispensations with men and because he will trye their graces 105e  yea also because he will overthrow the wicked with his judgments and all these things are seen in job  but then the consideration of this should bid men have a care that they be honest lest this comes upon them for their sin  it should also bid them beware of launching further into the world than in an honest way by ordinary means they can godlily make their retreat for the further in the greater fall it should also teach them to begg of god his blessing upon their endeavours their honest and lawfull endeavours  and it should put them upon a diligent looking to their steps that if in their going they should hear the ice crack they may timely goe back again  these things considered and duely put in practice if god will blow upon a man then let him be content and with job embrace the dunghill let him give unto all their dues and not fight against the providence of god but humble himself rather under his mighty hand which comes to strip him naked and bare  for he that doth otherwise fights against god and declares that he is a stranger to that of paul i know both how to be abased and i know how to abound every where in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need 105f  atten  but mr badman would not i believe have put this difference twixt things feigned and those that fall of necessity  wise  if he will not god will conscience will and that not thine own only but the consciences of all those that have seen the way and that have known the truth of the condition of such an one  atten  well  let us at this time leave this matter and return again to mr badman  wise  with all my heart will i proceed to give you a relation of what is yet behind of his life in order to our discourse of his death  atten  but pray do it with as much brevity as you can  wise  why are you a weary of my relating of things  atten  no  but it pleases me to hear a great deal in few words  wise  i profess not my self an artist that way but yet as briefly as i can i will pass through what of his life is behind and again i shall begin with his fraudulent dealing as before i have shewed with his creditors so now with his customers and those that he had otherwise to deal withall  he dealt by deceitfull weights and measures 106a  he kept weights to buy by and weights to sell by measures to buy by and measures to sell by  those he bought by were too big those he sold by were too little  besides he could use a thing called slight of hand if he had to do with other mens weights and measures and by that means make them whether he did buy or sell yea though his customer or chapman looked on turn to his own advantage  moreover he had the art to misreckon men in their accounts whether by weight or measure or money and would often do it to his worldly advantage and their loss  what say you to mr badman now  and if a question was made of his faithfull dealing he had his servants ready that to his purpose he had brought up that would avouch and swear to his book or word  this was mr badmans practice what think you of mr badman now  atten  think  why i can think no other but that he was a man left to himself a naughty man for these as his other were naughty things if the tree as indeed it may ought to be judged what it is by its fruits then mr badman must needs be a bad tree  but pray for my further satisfaction shew me now by the word of god evil of this his practice  and first of his using false weights and measures  wise  the evil of that why the evil of that appears to every eye the heathens that live like beasts and bruits in many things do abominate and abhorr such wickedness as this  let a man but look upon these things as he goes by and he shall see enough in them from the light of nature to make him loath so base a practice although mr badman loved it  atten  but shew me something out of the word against it will you  wise  i will willingly do it  and first we will look into the old testament  107a you shall saith god there do no unrighteousness in judgment in meteyard in weights or in measures a just ballance a just weight a just ephah and a just hin shall you have 107b  this is the law of god and that which all men according to the law of the land ought to obey  so again ye shall have just ballances and a just ephah c 107c  now having shewed you the law i will also shew you how god takes swerving therefrom  a false ballance is not good a false ballance is an abomination to the lord 107d  some have just weights but false ballances and by vertue of those false ballances by their just weights they deceive the countrey  107e wherefore god first of all commands that the ballance be made just  a just ballance shalt thou have  else they may be yea are decievers notwithstanding their just weights  now having commanded that men have a just ballance and testifying that a false one is an abomination to the lord he proceedeth also unto weight and measure  thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights a great and a small 107f that is one to buy by and another to sell by as mr badman had  thou shalt not have in thy house divers measures a great and a small and these had mr badman also but thou shalt have a perfect and a just weight a perfect and a just measure shalt thou have that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee  for all that do such things that is that use false weights and measures and all that do unrighteously are abomination to the lord  see now both how plentiful and how punctual the scripture is in this matter  but perhaps it may be objected that all this is old law and therefore hath nothing to do with us under the new testament  not that i think you neighbour will object thus well to this foolish objection let us make an answer  first he that makes this objection if he doth it to overthrow the authority of those texts 108a discovereth that himself is first cousen to mr badman  for a just man is willing to speak reverently of those commands  that man therefore hath i doubt but little conscience if any at all that is good that thus objecteth against the text  but let us look into the new testament and there we shall see how christ confirmeth the same where he commandeth that men make to others good measure including also that they make good weight telling such that doe thus or those that do it not that they may be encouraged to do it good measure pressed down shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that ye mete withall it shall be measured to you again  108b to wit both from god and man  for as god will shew his indignation against the false man by taking away even that he hath so he will deliver up the false man to the oppressor and the extortioner shall catch from him as well as he hath catched from his neighbour therefore another scripture saith when thou shalt cease to deal treacherously they shall deal treacherously with thee  that the new testament also hath an inspection into mens trading yea even with their weights and measures is evident from these general exhortations 108c  defraud not lye not one to another let no man goe beyond his brother in any matter for god is the avenger of all such  whatsoever you do do it heartily as unto the lord doing all in his name to his glory and the like  all these injunctions and commandments do respect our life and conversation among men with reference to our dealing trading and so consequently they forbid false deceitful yea all doings that are corrupt  having thus in a word or two shewed you that these things are bad i will next for the conviction of those that use them shew you where god saith they are to be found 109a  1  they are not to be found in the house of the good and godly man for he as his god abhorrs them but they are to be found in the house of evil doers 109b such as mr badmans is  are there saith the prophet yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked and the scant measure that is abomination 109c  are they there yet notwithstanding gods forbidding notwithstanding gods tokens of anger against those that do such things  o how loth is a wicked man to let goe a sweet a gainful sin when he hath hold of it  they hold fast deceit they refuse to let it goe  2  these deceitful weights and measures are not to be found in the house of the mercifull but in the house of the cruel in the house of them that love to oppress 109d  the ballances of deceit are in his hand he loveth to oppress 109e  he is given to oppression and cruelty therefore he useth such wicked things in his calling  yea he is a very cheat and as was hinted before concerning mr badmans breaking so i say now concerning his using these deceitful weights and measures it is as bad as base as to take a purse or pick a pocket for it is a plain robbery it takes away from a man that which is his own even the price of his money  3  the deceitful weights and measures are not to be found in the house of such as relieve the belly and that cover the loyns of the poor but of such as indeed would swallow them up 109f  hear ye this ye that swallow up the needy and that make the poor of the land to fail saying when will the new moon be gone that we may sell corn and the sabbath that we may set forth wheat making the ephah small and the sheckle great making the measure small and the price great and falsifying the ballances by deceit that ye may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of shooes and sell the refuse of the wheat  the lord hath sworn by the excellencie of jacob surely i will not forget any of their works 109g  so detestable and vile a thing is this in the sight of god  4  god abominates the thoughts of calling of those that use false weights and measures by any other term than that they be impure ones 110a or the like  shall i count them pure saith he with the bag of deceitful weights 110b no by no means they are impure ones their hands are defiled deceitful gain is in their houses they have gotten what they have by coveting an evil covetousness and therefore must and shall be counted among the impure among the wicked of the world  thus you see how full and plain the word of god is against this sin and them that use it  and therefore mr badman for that he used by these things thus to rook and cheat his neighbours is rightly rejected from having his name in and among the catalogue of the godly  atten  but i am perswaded that the using of these things and the doing by them thus deceitfully is not counted so great an evil by some  wise  whether it be counted an evil or a vertue by men it mattereth not you see by the scriptures the judgment of god upon it  it was not counted an evil by mr badman nor is it by any that still are treading in his steps  but i say tis no matter how men esteem of things let us adhere to the judgment of god and the rather because when we our selves have done weighing and measuring to others then god will weigh and measure both us and our actions  and when he doth so as he will do shortly then wo be to him to whom and of whose actions it shall be thus said by him  tekel thou art weighed in the ballances and art found wanting 110c  god will then recompense their evil of deceiving upon their own head when he shall shut them out of his presence favour and kingdom for ever and ever  atten  but tis a wonder that since mr badmans common practice was to do thus that some one or more did not find him out and blame him for this his wickedness  wise  for the generality of people he went away clever with his knavery  for what with his ballance his false ballance and good weight and what with his slight of hand to boot he beguiled sometimes a little and sometimes more most that he had to deal with  besides those that use this naughty trade are either such as blind men with a shew of religion or by hectoring the buyer out by words  i must confess mr badman was not so arch at the first 111a that is to do it by shew of religion for now he began to grow threadbare though some of his brethren are arch enough this way yea and of his sisters too for i told you at first that there was a great many of them and of them good but for hectoring for swearing for lying if these things would make weight and measure they should not be wanting to mr badmans customers  atten  then it seem he kept good weights and a bad ballance well that was better than that both should be bad  wise  not at all  there lay the depth of his deceit  111b for if any at any time found fault that he used them hardly and that they wanted their weight of things he would reply  why did you not see them weighed will you not believe your own eyes  if you question my weights pray carry them whether you will i will maintain them to be good and just  the same he would say of his scales  so he blinded all by his ballance  atten  this is cunning indeed  but as you say there must be also something done or said to blind therewith and this i perceive mr badman had  wise  yes  he had many ways to blind but he was never clever at it by making a shew of religion though he cheated his wife therewith for he was especially by those that dwelt near him too well known to do that though he would bungle at it as well as he could  but there are some that are arch villains this way they shall to view live a whole life religiously and yet shall be guilty of these most horrible sins  and yet religion in it self is never the worse nor yet the true professors of it  but as luther says in the name of god begins all mischief  for hypocrites have no other way to bring their evils to maturity but by using and mixing the name of god and religion therewith 112b  thus they become whited walls 112a for by this white the white of religion the dirt of their actions is hid  thus also they become graves that appear not and they that goe over them that have to do with them are not aware of them but suffer themselves to be deluded by them  yea if there shall as there will sometimes rise a doubt in the heart of the buyer about the weight and measure he should have why he suffereth his very sences to be also deluded by recalling of his chapmans religion to mind and thinks verily that not his good chapman but himself is out for he dreams not that his chapman can deceive  but if the buyer shall find it out and shall make it apparent that he is beguiled then shall he be healed by having amends made and perhaps fault shall be laid upon servants c and so master cheat shall stand for a right honest man in the eye of his customer though the next time he shall pick his pocket again  some 112c plead custom for their cheat as if that could acquit them before the tribunal of god  and others say it came to them for so much and therefore another must take it for so much though there is wanting both as to weight and measure  but in all these things there are juggles or if not such must know 112d that that which is altogether just they must doe  suppose that i be cheated my self with a brass halfcrown must i therefore cheat another therewith if this be bad in the whole it is also bad in the parts  therefore however thou are dealt withall in thy buying yet thou must deal justly in selling or thou sinnest against thy soul and art become as mr badman  and know that a pretence to custom is nothing worth  tis not custom but good conscience that will help at gods tribunal  atten  but i am perswaded that that which is gotten by men this way doth them but little good  wise  i am of your mind for that but this is not considered by those thus minded  for if they can get it though they get as we say the devil and all by their getting yet they are content and count that their getting is much  little good  why do you think they consider that  no  no more than they consider what they shall doe in the judgment at the day of god almighty for their wrong getting of what they get and that is just nothing at all 113a  but to give you a more direct answer  this kind of getting is so far off from doing them little good that it doth them no good at all because thereby they lose their own souls what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul 113b  he loseth then he loseth greatly that getteth after this fashion  this is the man that is pennywise and pound foolish this is he that loseth his good sheep for a halfpennyworth of tarr that loseth a soul for a little of the world  and then what doth he get thereby but loss and dammage 113c  thus he getteth or rather loseth about the world to come  but what doth he get in this world more than travel and sorrow vexation of spirit and disappointment  men aim at blessedness in getting i mean at temporal blessedness but the man that thus getteth shall not have that  for though an inheritance after this manner may be hastily gotten at the beginning yet the end thereof shall not be blessed  they gather it indeed and think to keep it too but what says solomon  god casteth it away  the lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish but he casteth away the substance of the wicked  the time as i said that they do enjoy it it shall doe them no good at all but long to be sure they must not have it  for god will either take it away in their life time or else in the generation following according to that of job  he the wicked may prepare it but the just shall put it on and the innocent shall divide the silver 113d  consider that also that is written in the proverbs  a good man leaveth an inheritance to his childrens children and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just 113e  what then doth he get thereby that getteth by dishonest means why he getteth sin and wrath hell and damnation  and now tell me how much he doth get  this i say is his getting so that as david says we may be bold to say too  i beheld the wicked in great prosperity and presently i cursed his habitation  for it cannot prosper with him  fluster and huff and make a doe for a while he may but god hath determined that both he and it shall melt like grease and any observing man may see it so  behold the unrighteous man in a way of injustice getteth much and loadeth himself with thick clay but anon it withereth it decayeth and even he or the generation following decline and return to beggery  and this mr badman notwithstanding his cunning and crafty tricks to get money did dye no body can tell whether worth a farthing or no  atten  he had all the bad tricks i think that it was possible for a man to have to get money one would think that he should a been rich  wise  you reckon too fast if you count these all his bad tricks to get money  for he had more besides 114a  if his customers were in his books as it should goe hard but he would have them there at least if he thought he could make any advantage of them then then would he be sure to impose upon them his worst even very bad comodity yet set down for it the price that the best was sold at  like those that sold the refuse wheat or the worst of the wheat making the sheckle great 114b yet hoisting up the price  this was mr badmans way  he 114c would sell goods that cost him not the best price by far for as much as he sold the best of all for  he had also a trick to mingle his comodity that that which was bad might goe off with the less mistrust  besides if his customers at any time paid him money let them look to themselves and to their acquitances for he would usually attempt to call for that payment again specially if he thought that there was hopes of making a prize thereby and then to be sure if they could not produce good and sufficient ground of the payment a hundred to one but they payed it again  sometimes the honest chapman would appeal to his servants for proof of the payment of money but they were trained up by him to say after his mind right or wrong  so that relief that way he could get none  atten  it is a bad yea an abominable thing for a man to have such servants  for by such means a poor customer may be undone and not know how to help himself  alas if the master be so unconscionable as i perceive mr badman was to call for his money twice and if his servant will swear that it is a due debt where is any help for such a man he must sink there is no remedy  wise  this is very bad but this has been a practice and that hundreds of years agoe  but what saith the word of god  i will punish all those that leap upon the threshold which fill their masters houses with violence and deceit 115a 115b  mr badman also had this art could he get a man at advantage that is if his chapman durst not go from him or if the comodity he wanted could not for the present be conveniently had elsewhere then let him look to himself he would surely make his purse strings crack he would exact upon him without any pity or conscience  atten  that was extortion was it not  i pray let me hear your judgment of extortion what it is and when committed  wise  extortion 115c is a screwing from men more than by the law of god or men is right and it is committed sometimes by them in office about fees rewards and the like  but tis most commonly committed by men of trade who without all conscience when they have the advantage will make a prey of their neighbour  and thus was mr badman an extortioner for although he did not exact and force away as bailifs and clarks have used to doe yet he had his opportunities and such cruelty to make use of them that he would often in his way be extorting and forcing of money out of his neighbours pocket  for every man that makes a prey of his advantage upon his neighbours necessities to force from him more than in reason and conscience according to the present prizes of things such comodity is worth may very well be called an extortioner and judged for one that hath no inheritance in the kingdom of god 115d  atten  well this badman was a sad wretch  wise  thus you have often said before  but now we are in discourse of this give me leave a little to goe on  we have a great many people in the countrey too that live all their dayes in the practice and so under the guilt of extortion  people alas that think scorn to be so accounted  as for example  116a there is a poor body that dwells we will suppose so many miles from the market and this man wants a bushel of grist a pound of butter or a cheese for himself his wife and poor children  but dwelling so far from the market if he goes thither he shall lose his dayes work which will be eight pence or ten pence dammage to him and that is something to a poor man  so he goeth to one of his masters or dames for what he wanteth and asks them to help him with such a thing  yes say they you may have it but withall they will give him a gripe perhaps make him pay as much or more for it at home as they can get when they have carryed it five miles to a market yea and that too for the refuse of their commodity  but in this the women are especially faulty in the sale of their butter and cheese c  now this is a kind of extortion it is a making a prey of the necessity of the poor it is a grinding of their faces a buying and selling of them  but above all your 116b hucksters that buy up the poor mans victuals by wholesale and sell it to him again for unreasonable gains by retale and as we call it by piece meal they are got into a way after a stingeing rate to play their game upon such by extortion  i mean such who buy up butter cheese eggs bacon c by whole sale and sell it again as they call it by penny worths two penny worths a half penny worth or the like to the poor all the week after the market is past  these though i will not condemn them all do many of them bite and pinch the poor by this kind of evil dealing  these destroy the poor because he is poor and that is a grievous sin  he that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches and that giveth to the rich shall surely come to want 116c  therefore he saith again rob not the poor because he is poor neither oppress the afflicted in the gate for the lord will plead their cause and spoil the soul of them that spoile them  oh that he that gripeth and grindeth the face of the poor would take notice of these two scriptures  here is threatned the destruction of the estate yea and of the soul too of them that oppress the poor  their soul we shall better see where and in what condition that is in when the day of doom is come but for the estates of such they usually quickly moulter and that sometimes all men and sometimes no man knows how  besides these are usurers yea they take usury for victuals which thing the lord has forbidden 117a  and because they cannot so well do it on the marketday therefore they do it as i said when the market is over for then the poor falls into their mouths and are necessitated to have as they can for their need and they are resolved they shall pay soundly for it  perhaps some will find fault for my medling thus with other folks matters and for my thus prying into the secrets of their iniquity  but to such i would say since such actions are evil tis time they were hissed out of the world  for all that doe such things offend against god wrong their neighbour and like mr badman doe provoke god to judgment god knows there is abundance of deceit in the world  wise  deceit  aie but i have not told you the thousandth part of it nor is it my business now to rake to the bottom of that dunghill  what would you say if i should anatomize some of those vile wretches called pawnbrokers that lend money and goods to poor people who are by necessity forced to such an inconvenience and will make by one trick or other the interest of what they so lend amount to thirty forty yea sometimes fifty pound by the year nothwithstanding the principal is secured by a sufficient pawn which they will keep too at last if they can find any shift to cheat the wretched borrower  atten  say  why such miscreants are the pest and vermin of the commonwealth not fit for the society of men but methinks by some of those things you discoursed before you seem to import that it is not lawful for a man to make the best of his own  wise  if by making the best you mean to sell for as much as by hook or crook he can get for his comodity then i say it is not lawful  and if i should say the contrary i should justifie mr badman and all the rest of that gang  but that i never shall doe for the word of god condemns them  but that it is not lawful for a man at all times to sell his commodity for as much as he can i prove by these reasons 118a  first if it be lawful for me alway to sell my commodity as dear or for as much as i can then tis lawful for me to lay aside in my dealing with others good conscience to them and to god  but it is not lawful for me in my dealing with others to lay aside good conscience c  therefore it is not lawful for me always to sell my commodity as dear or for as much as i can  that 118b it is not lawful to lay aside good conscience in our dealings has already been proved in the former part of our discourse  but that a man must lay it aside that will sell his commodity always as dear or for as much as he can is plainly manifest thus  1  he that will as is mentioned afore sell his commodity as dear as he can must sometimes make a prey of the ignorance of his chapman  118c but that he cannot doe with a good conscience for that is to overreach and to goe beyond my chapman and is forbidden 1 thess 4 6  therefore he that will sell his commodity as afore as dear or for as much as he can must of necessity lay aside good conscience  2  he that will sell his commodity always as dear as he can must needs sometimes make a prey of his neighbours necessity 118d but that he cannot doe with a good conscience for that is to goe beyond and defraud his neighbour contrary to 1 thess 4 6 therefore he that will sell his commodity as afore as dear or for as much as he can must needs cast off and lay aside a good conscience  3  he that will as afore sell his commodity as dear or for as much as he can must if need be make a prey of his neighbours fondness but that a man cannot doe with a good conscience 119a for that is still a going beyond him contrary to 1 thess 4 6 therefore he that will sell his commodity as dear or for as much as he can must needs cast off and lay aside good conscience  the same also may be said for buying no man may always buy as cheap as he can but must also use good conscience in buying 119b the which he can by no means use and keep if he buyes always as cheap as he can and that for the reasons urged before for such will make a prey of the ignorance necessity and fondness of their chapman the which they cannot doe with a good consceince  when abraham would buy a buryingplace of the sons of heth thus he said unto them  intreat for me to ephron the son of zohar that he may give me the cave of machpelah which he hath in the end his field  for as much as it is worth shall he give it me  gen 23 8 9 110c  he would not have it under foot he scorned it he abhored it  it stood not with his religion credit nor conscience  so also when david would buy a field of ornon the jebusite  thus he said unto him  grant me the place the threshingfloor that i may build an altar there unto the lord thou shalt give it me for the full price 119d  he also as abraham made conscience of this kind of dealing  he would not lie at catch to go beyond no not the jebusite but will give him his full price for his field  for he knew that there was wickedness as in selling too dear so in buying too cheap therefore he would not do it  there ought therefore to be good conscience used as in selling so in buying for tis also unlawful for a man to goe beyond or to defraud his neighbour in buying yea tis unlawful to doe it in any matter and god will plentifully avenge that wrong  as i also before have forewarned and testified  see also the 119e text in the margent  but  secondly if it be lawful for me always to sell my commodity as dear or for as much as i can then it is lawful for me to deal with my neighbour without the use of 120a charity  but it is not lawful for me to lay aside or to deal with my neighbour without the use of charity therefore it is not lawful for me always to sell my commodity to my neighbour for as much as i can  a man in dealing should as really design his neighbours good profit and advantage as his own  for this is to exercise charity in his dealing  that i should thus use or exercise charity towards my neighbour in my buying and selling c with him is evident from the general command  let all your things be done in charity 120b  but that a man cannot live in the exercise of charity that selleth as afore as dear or that buyeth as cheap as he can is evident by these reasons  1  he that sells his commodity as dear or for as much money always as he can seeks himself and himself only but charity seeketh not her own nor her own only 120c  so then he that seeks himself and himself onely as he that sells as afore as dear as he can does maketh not use of nor doth he exercise charity in his so dealing  2  he that selleth his commodity always for as much as he can get hardeneth his heart against all reasonable entreaties of the buyer  but he that doth so cannot exercise charity in his dealing therefore it is not lawful for a man to sell his commodity as afore as dear as he can  thirdly if it be lawful for me to sell my commodity as afore as dear as i can then there can be no sin in my trading how unreasonably soever i manage my calling whether by lying swearing cursing cheating for all this is but to sell my commodity as dear as i can  but that there is sin in these is evident therefore i may not sell my commodity always as dear as i can 120d 120e  fourthly he that sells as afore as dear as he can offereth violence to the law of nature  121b for that saith doe unto all men even as ye would that they should doe unto you 121a  now was the seller a buyer he would not that he of whom he buyes should sell him always as dear as he can therefore he should not sell so himself when it is his lot to sell and others to buy of him  fifthly he that selleth as afore as dear as he can makes use of that instruction that god hath not given to others but sealed up in his hand 121c to abuse his law and to wrong his neighbour withall  which indeed is contrary to god 121d  god hath given thee more skill more knowledge and understanding in thy commodity than he hath given to him that would buy of thee  but what canst thou think that god has given thee this that thou mightest thereby make a prey of thy neighbour that thou mightest thereby goe beyond and beguile thy neighbour  no verily but he hath given thee it for his help that thou mightest in this be eyes to the blind and save thy neighbour from that dammage that his ignorance or necessity or fondness would betray him into the hands of  sixthly in all that a man does he should have an eye to the glory of god 121f but that he cannot have that sells his commodity always for as much as he can for the reasons urged before  seventhly all that a man does he should doe in the name of the lord jesus christ 121g that is as being commanded and authorized to doe it by him  but he that selleth always as dear as he can cannot so much as pretend to this without horrid blaspheming of that name because commanded by him to doe otherwise  eightly and lastly in all that a man does he should have an eye to the day of judgment and to the consideration of how his actions will be esteemed of in that day 121h  therefore there is not any man can or ought to sell always as dear as he can  unless he will yea he must say in so doing i will run the hazard of the tryal of that day  if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour or buyest ought of thy neighbour ye shall not oppress one another 122a  atten  but why doe you put in those cautionary words  they must not sell always as dear nor buy always as cheap as they can doe you not thereby intimate that a man may sometimes do so  wise  i doe indeed intimate that somtimes the seller may sell as dear and the buyer buy as cheap as he can but this is allowable only in these cases  when he that sells is a knave and lays aside all good conscience in selling or when the buyer is a knave and layes aside all good conscience in buying  if the buyer therefore lights of a knave or if the seller lights of a knave then let them look to themselves  but yet so as not to lay aside conscience because he that thou dearest with doth so  but how vile or base soever the chapman is do thou keep thy commodity at a reasonable price  or if thou buyest offer reasonable gain for the thing thou wouldest have  and if this will not do with the buyer or seller then seek thee a more honest chapman  if thou objectest but i have not skil to know when a pennyworth is before me  get some that have more skill than thy self in that affair and let them in that matter dispose of thy money  but if there were no knaves in the world these objections need not be made  and thus my very good neighbour have i given you a few of my reasons why a man that hath it should not always sell too dear nor buy as cheap as he can  but should use good conscience to god and charity to his neighbour in both  atten  but were some men here to hear you i believe they would laugh you to scorn  wise  i question not that at all for so 122b mr badman used to doe when any man told him of his faults  he used to think himself wiser than any and would count as i have hinted before that he was not arrived to a manly spirit that did stick or boggle at any wickedness  but let mr badman and his fellowes laugh i will bear it and still give them good counsel  but i will remember also for my further relief and comfort that thus they that were covetous of old served the son of god himself  it is their time to laugh now that they may mourn in time to come 122c  and i say again when they have laughed out their laugh he that useth not good conscience to god and charity to his neighbour in buying and selling dwells next dore to an infidel and is near of kin to mr badman  atten  well but what will you say to this question 123a you know that there is no settled price set by god upon any commodity that is bought or sold under the sun but all things that we buy and sell do ebbe and flow as to price like the tide  how then shall a man of a tender conscience doe neither to wrong the seller buyer nor himself in buying and selling of commodities  wise  this question is thought to be frivolous by all that are of mr badmans way tis also difficult in it self  yet i will endeavour to shape you an answer 123b and that first to the matter of the question to wit how a tradesman should in trading keep a good conscience a buyer or seller either  secondly how he should prepare himself to this work and live in the practice of it  for the first  he 123c must observe what hath been said before to wit he must have conscience to god charity to his neighbour and i will add much moderation in dealing  let him therefore keep within the bounds of the affirmative of those eight reasons that before were urged to prove that men ought not in their dealing but to do justly and mercifully twixt man and man and then there will be no great fear of wronging the seller buyer or himself  but particularly to prepare or instruct a man to this work  1  let the tradesman or others consider that there is not that in great gettings and in abundance which the most of men do suppose for all that a man has over and above what serves for his present necessity and supply serves only to feed the lusts of the eye for what good is there to the owners thereof save the beholding of them with their eyes 123d  men also many times in getting of riches get therewith a snare to their soul  123e but few get good by getting of them  but this consideration mr badman could not abide  2  consider that the getting of wealth dishonestly as he does that getteth it without good conscience and charity to his neighbour is a great offender against god  hence he says i have smitten mine hands at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made 124a  it is a manner of speech that shews anger in the very making of mention of the crime  therefore  3  consider that a little honestly gotten though it may yield thee but a dinner of herbs at a time will yield more peace therewith than will a stalled ox ill gotten  better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right 124b  4  be thou confident that gods eyes are upon all thy wayes and that he pondereth all thy goings and also that he marks them writes them down and seals them up in a bag against the time to come 124c  5  be thou sure that thou remembrest that thou knowest not the day of thy death  remember also that when death comes god will give thy substance for the which thou hast laboured and for the which perhaps thou hast hazarded thy soul to one thou knowest not who nor whether he shall be a wise man or a fool  and then what profit hath he that laboureth for the wind 124d  besides thou shalt have nothing that thou mayest so much as carry away in thine hand  guilt shall goe with thee if thou hast got it dishonestly and they also to whom thou shalt leave it shall receive it to their hurt  these things duly considered and made use of by thee to the preparing of thy heart to thy calling of buying or selling i come in the next place to shew thee how thou shouldest live in the practick part of this art  art thou to buy or sell  1  if thou sellest do not commend if thou buyest do not dispraise any otherwise but to give the thing that thou hast to do with its just value and worth for thou canst not do otherwise knowingly but of a covetous and wicked mind  wherefore else are comodities overvalued by the seller and also undervalued by the buyer  it is naught it is naught says the buyer but when he hath got his bargain he boasteth thereof 124e  what hath this man done now but lyed in the dispraising of his bargain and why did he dispraise it but of a covetous mind to wrong and beguile the seller  2  art thou a seller and do things grow dear set not thy hand to help or hold them up higher this cannot be done without wickedness neither for this is a making of the sheckle great 125a art thou a buyer and do things grow dear use no cunning or deceitful language to pull them down  for that cannot be done but wickedly too  what then shall we do will you say  why i answer leave things to the providence of god and do thou with moderation submit to his hand  but since when they are growing dear the hand that upholds the price is for the time more strong than that which would pull it down that being the hand of the seller who loveth to have it dear specially if it shall rise in his hand therefore i say do thou take heed and have not a hand in it  the which thou mayest have to thine own and thy neighbours hurt these three ways  1  by crying out scarcity scarcity beyond the truth and state of things  especially take heed of doing of this by way of a prognostick for time to come  twas for 125b this for which he was trodden to death in the gate of samaria that you read of in the book of kings  this sin has a double evil in it  1  it belieth the present blessing of god amongst us  and 2  it undervalueth the riches of his goodness which can make all good things to abound towards us  2  this wicked thing may be done by hoarding up when the hunger and necessity of the poor calls for it  now that god may shew his dislike against this he doth as it were license the people to curse such an hoarder up  he that withholdeth corn the people shall curse him but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it 125c  3  but if things will rise do thou be grieved be also moderate in all thy sellings and be sure let the poor have a pennyworth and sell thy corn to those in necessity  125d which then thou wilt do when thou shewest mercy to the poor in thy selling to him and when thou for his sake because he is poor undersellest the market  this is to buy and sell with good conscience  thy buyer thou wrongest not thy conscience thou wrongest not thy self thou wrongest not for god will surely recompense thee  i have spoken concerning corn but thy duty is to let thy moderation in all things be known unto all men the lord is at hand 125e  atten  well sir now i have heard enough of mr badmans naughtiness pray now proceed to his death  wise  why sir the sun is not so low we have yet three hours to night  atten  nay i am not in any great hast but i thought you had even now done with his life  wise  done no i have yet much more to say  atten  then he has much more wickedness than i thought he had  wise  that may be  but let us proceed  this mr badman added to all his wickedness this he was a very proud man a very proud man 126a  he was exceeding proud and haughty in mind he looked that what he said ought not must not be contradicted or opposed  he counted himself as wise as the wisest in the countrey as good as the best and as beautiful as he that had most of it  he took great delight in praising of himself and as much in the praises that others gave him  he could not abide that any should think themselves above him or that their wit or personage should by others be set before his 126b  he had scarce a fellowly carriage for his equals  but for those that were of an inferior ranck he would look over them in great contempt  and if at any time he had any remote occasion of having to do with them he would shew great height and a very domineering spirit  so that in this it may be said that solomon gave a characteristical note of him when he said  proud and haughty scorner is his name who dealeth in proud wrath 126c  he never thought his dyet well enough dressed his cloathes fine enough made or his praise enough refined  atten  this pride is a sin that sticks as close to nature i think as most sins  there is uncleanness and pride i know not of any two gross sins that stick closer to men then they  they have as i may call it an interest in nature it likes them because they most suit its lusts and fancies  and therefore no marvel though mr badman was tainted with pride since he had so wickedly given up himself to work all iniquity with greediness  wise  you say right pride is a sin that sticks close to nature 126d and is one of the first follies wherein it shews it self to be polluted  for even in childhood even in little children pride will first of all shew it self it is a hasty an early appearance of the sin of the soul  it as i may say is that corruption that strives for predominancy in the heart and therefore usually comes out first  but though children are so incident to it yet methinks those of more years should be ashamed thereof  i might at the first have begun with mr badmans pride only i think it is not the pride in infancy that begins to make a difference betwixt one and another as did and do those wherewith i began my relation of his life  therefore i passed it over but now since he had no more consideration of himself and of his vile and sinful state but to be proud when come to years i have taken the occasion in this place to make mention of his pride  atten  but pray if you can remember them tell me of some places of scripture that speak against pride  i the rather desire this because that pride is now a reigning sin and i happen sometimes to fall into the company of them that in my conscience are proud very much and i have a mind also to tell them of their sin now when i tell them of it unless i bring gods word too i doubt they will laugh me to scorn  wise  laugh you to scorn the proud man will laugh you to scorn bring to him what text you can except god shall smite him in his conscience by the word  mr badman did use to serve them so that did use to tell him of his  and besides when you have said what you can they will tell you they are not proud and that you are rather the proud man else you would not judge nor so malapertly meddle with other mens matters as you do  nevertheless since you desire it i will mention two or three texts  they are these pride and arrogancy do i hate  a mans pride shall bring him low and he shall bring down their pride  and all the proud and all that do wickedly shall be as stubble and the day that comes shall burn them up 127a  this last is a dreadful text it is enough to make a proud man shake  god saith he will make the proud ones as stubble that is as fuel for the fire and the day that cometh shall be like a burning oven and that day shall burn them up saith the lord  but mr badman could never abide to hear pride spoken against nor that any should say of him he is a proud man  atten  what should be the reason of that  wise  he did not tell me the reason but i suppose it to be that which is common to all vile persons  they love this vice but care not to bear its name 128a  the drunkard loves the sin but loves not to be called a drunkard  the thief loveth to steal but cannot abide to be called a thief the whore loveth to commit uncleanness but loveth not to be called a whore and so mr badman loved to be proud but could not abide to be called a proud man  the sweet of sin is desirable to polluted and corrupted man but the name thereof is a blot in his scutcheon  atten  tis true that you have said  but pray how many sorts of pride are there  wise  there are two sorts of pride 128b pride of spirit and pride of body  the first of these is thus made mention of in the scriptures  every one that is proud in heart is abomination to the lord 128c  a high look and a proud heart and the plowing of the wicked is sin  the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit  bodily pride these scriptures mention  in that day the lord shall take away the bravery of their tinckling ornaments about their feet and their cauls and their round tires like the moon the chains and the bracelets and the mufflers the bonnets and the ornaments of the legs and the headbands and the tablets and the earrings the rings and the nosejewels  128d the changable suits of apparell and the mantles and the wimples and the crisping pins the glasses and the fine linnen and the hoods and the vails  by these expressions it is evident that there is pride of body as well as pride of spirit and that both are sin and so abominable to the lord  but these texts mr badman could never abide to read they were to him as micaiah was to ahab they never spake good of him but evil  atten  i suppose that it was not mr badmans case alone even to maligne those texts that speak against their vices  for i believe that most ungodly men where the scriptures are have a secret antipathy against those words of god that do most plainly and fully rebuke them for their sins 128e  wise  that is out of doubt and by that antipathy they shew that sin and satan are more welcome to them than are the wholesome instructions of life and godliness  atten  well but not to goe off from our discourse of mr badman you say he was proud  but will you shew me now some symptoms of one that is proud  wise  yes that i will  and first i will shew you some symptoms of pride of heart 129a  pride of heart is seen by outward things as pride of body in general is a sign of pride of heart for all proud gestures of the body flow from pride of heart therefore solomon saith there is a generation o how lofty are their eyes and their eyelids are lifted up  129b and again there is that exalteth their gate their going 129c  now these lofty eyes and this exalting of the gate is a sign of a proud heart  for both these actions come from the heart  for out of the heart comes pride in all the visible appearances of it 129d but more particularly  1  heart pride is discovered 129e by a stretched out neck and by mincing as they go  for the wicked the proud have a proud neck a proud foot a proud tongue by which this their going is exalted  this is that which makes them look scornfully speak ruggedly and carry it huffingly among their neighbours  2  a proud heart is a persecuting one  the wicked through his pride doth persecute the poor 129f  3  a prayerless man is a proud man 129g  4  a contentious man is a proud man 129h  5  the disdainful man is a proud man 129i  6  the man that oppresses his neighbour is a proud man 129j  7  he that hearkeneth not to gods word with reverence and fear is a proud man 129k  8  and he that calls the proud happy is be sure a proud man all these are proud in heart and this their pride of heart doth thus discover it self 129l 129m  as to bodily 129n pride it is discovered that is something of it by all the particulars mentioned before for though they are said to be symptoms of pride of heart yet they are symptoms of that pride by their shewing of themselves in the body  you know diseases that are within are seen ofttimes by outward and visible signs yet by them very signs even the outside is defiled also  so all those visible signs of heartpride are signs of bodily pride also  but to come to more outward signs  the putting on of gold and pearls and costly array the pleating of the hair the following of fashions the seeking by gestures to imitate the proud either by speech looks dresses goings or other fools baubles of which at this time the world is full all these and many more are signs as of a proud heart so of bodily pride also 130b  but mr badman would not allow by any means that this should be called pride 130c but rather neatness handsomness comeliness cleanliness c neither would he allow that following of fashions was any thing else but because he would not be proud singular and esteemed fantastical by his neighbours  atten  but i have been told that when some have been rebuked for their pride they have turned it again upon the brotherhood of those by whom they have been rebuked  saying physician heal thy friends look at home among your brotherhood even among the wisest of you and see if you your selves be clear even you professors  for who is prouder than you professors scarcesly the devil himself  wise  my heart akes at this answer because there is too much cause for it 130d  this very answer would mr badman give his wife when she as she would sometimes reproved him for his pride we shall have says he great amendments in living now for the devil is turned a corrector of vice  for no sin reigneth more in the world quoth he than pride among professors  and who can contradict him let us give the devil his due the thing is too apparent for any man to deny  and i doubt not but the same answer is ready in the mouths of mr badmans friends for they may and do see pride display it self in the apparel and carriages of professors one may say almost as much as among any people in the land the more is the pity  ay and i fear that even their extravagancies in this hath hardened the heart of many a one as i perceive it did somewhat the heart of mr badman himself  for mine own part i have seen many my self and those church members too so deckt and bedaubed with their fangles and toyes and that when they have been at the solemn appointments of god in the way of his worship that i have wondred with what face such painted persons could sit in the place where they were without swounding  but certainly the holiness of god and also the pollution of themselves by sin must needs be very far out of the minds of such people what profession soever they make  i have read of an whores forehead 131a and i have read of christianshamefacedness i have read of costly array and of that which becometh women professing godliness with good works 131b 131c but if i might speak i know what i know and could say and yet do no wrong that which would make some professors stink in their places 131d but now i forbear  atten  sir you seem to be greatly concerned at this but what i shall say more it is whispered that some good ministers have countenanced their people in their light and wanton apparrel yea have pleaded for their gold and pearls and costly array c  wise  i know not what they have pleaded for but tis easily seen that they tolerate or at least wise wink and connive at such things both in their wives and children  and so from the prophets of jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land 131e and when the hand of the rulers are chief in a trespass who can keep their people from being drowned in that trespass  atten  this is a lamentation and must stand for a lamentation  wise  so it is and so it must  and i will add it is a shame it is a reproach it is a stumblingblock to the blind 131f for though men be as blind as mr badman himself yet they can see the foolish lightness that must needs be the bottom of all these apish and wanton extravagancies  but many have their excuses ready to wit their parents their husbands and their breeding calls for it and the like  yea the examples of good people prompt them to it  but all these will be but the spiders webb when the thunder of the word of the great god shall rattle from heaven against them as it will at death or judgment but i wish it might do it before but alas these excuses are but bare pretences these proud ones love to have it so  i once talked with a maid by way of reproof for her fond and gaudy garment  but she told me 132a the tailor would make it so  when alas poor proud girle she gave order to the taylor so to make it  many make parents and husbands and taylors c the blind to others but their naughty hearts and their giving of way thereto that is the original cause of all these evils  atten  now you are speaking of the cause of pride pray shew me yet further why pride is now so much in request 132b  wise  i will shew you what i think are the reasons of it  1  the first is 132c because such persons are led by their own hearts rather than by the word of god  i told you before that the original fountain of pride is the heart  for out of the heart comes pride it is therefore because they are led by their hearts which naturally tends to lift them up in pride  this pride of heart tempts them and by its deceits overcometh them 132d yea it doth put a bewitching vertue into their peacocks feathers and then they are swallowed up with the vanity of them  2  another reason why professors are so proud for those we are talking of now is because they are more apt to take example of those that are of the world than they are to take example of those that are saints indeed  pride is of the world  for all that is of the world the lusts of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life are not of the father but of the world 132e  of the world therefore professors learn to be proud  but they should not take them for example  it will be objected no nor your saints neither for you are as proud as others  well let them take shame that are guilty  but when i say professors should take example for their life by those that are saints indeed i mean as peter says  they should take example of those that were in old time the saints for saints of old time were the best therefore to these he directeth us for our pattern  let the wives conversation be chast and also coupled with fear  whose adorning saith peter let it not be that outward adorning of pleating the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel  but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price  for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in god adorned themselves being in subjection to their own husbands 132f  3  another reason is 133a because they have forgotten the pollution of their nature  for the remembrance of that must needs keep us humble and being kept humble we shall be at a distance from pride  the proud and the humble are set in opposition god resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble  and can it be imagined that a sensible christian should be a proud one sence of baseness tends to lay us low not to lift us up with pride not with pride of heart nor pride of life  but when a man begins to forget what he is then he if ever begins to be proud  methinks it is one of the most senceless and ridiculous things in the world that a man should be proud of that which is given him on purpose to cover the shame of his nakedness with  4  persons that are proud have gotten god and his holiness out of their sight 133b  if god was before them as he is behind their back and if they saw him in his holiness as he sees them in their sins and shame they would take but little pleasure in their apish knacks  the holiness of god makes the angels cover their faces crumbles christians when they behold it into dust and ashes 133c and as his majesty is such is his word therefore they abuse it that bring it to countenance pride  lastly 133d but what can be the end of those that are proud in the decking of themselves after their antick manner why are they for going with their bullsforetops with their naked shoulders and paps hanging out like a cows bag why are they for painting their faces for stretching out their necks and for putting of themselves into all the formalities which proud fancy leads them to  is it because they would honour god because they would adorn the gospel because they would beautifie religion and make sinners to fall in love with their own salvation  no no  it is rather to please their lusts to satisfie their wild and extravagant fancies and i wish none doth it to stir up lust in others to the end they may commit uncleanness with them  i believe whatever is their end this is one of the great designes of the devil  and i believe also that satan has drawn more into the sin of uncleanness by the spangling shew of fine cloaths than he could possibly have drawn unto it without them  i wonder what it was that of old was called the attire of an harlot  certainly it could not be more bewitching and tempting than are the garments of many professors this day  atten  i like what you say very well and i wish that all the proud dames in england that profess were within the reach and sound of your words  wise  what i have said i believe is true but as for the proud dames in england that profess they have moses and the prophets and if they will not hear them how then can we hope that they should recieve good by such a dull sounding ramshorn as i am however i have said my mind and now if you will we will proceed to some other of mr badmans doings  atten  no  pray before you shew me any thing else of mr badman shew me yet more particularly the evil effects of this sin of pride  wise  with all my heart i will answer your request 134a  1 134b  then  tis pride that makes poor man so like the devil in hell that he cannot in it be known to be the image and similitude of god  the angels when they became devils twas through their being lifted or puffed up with pride  tis pride also that lifteth or puffeth up the heart of the sinner and so makes him to bear the very image of the devil  2 134c  pride makes a man so odious in the sight of god that he shall not must not come nigh his majesty  though the lord be high yet hath he respect to the lowly but the proud he knows afar off  pride sets god and the soul at a distrance pride will not let a man come nigh god nor god will not let a proud man come nigh unto him  now this is a dreadful thing  3 134d  as pride sets so it keeps god and the soul at a distance  god resisteth the proud resists that is he opposes him he thrusts him from him he contemneth his person and all his performances  come in to gods ordinances the proud man may but come into his presence have communion with him or blessing from him he shall not  for the high god doth resist him 135a  4 135b  the word saith that the lord will destroy the house of the proud  he will destroy his house it may be understood he will destroy him and his  so he destroyed proud pharaoh so he destroyed proud corah and many others  5 135c  pride where it comes and is entertained is a certain forerunner of some judgment that is not far behind  when pride goes before shame and destruction will follow after  when pride cometh then cometh shame  pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall  6 135d  persisting in pride makes the condition of a poor man as remediless as is that of the devils themselves  and this i fear was mr badmans condition and that was the reason that he died so as he did as i shall shew you anon  but what need i thus talk of the particular actions or rather prodigious sins of mr badman when his whole life and all his actions went as it were to the making up one massie body of sin 135e  instead of believing that there was a god his mouth his life and actions declared that he believed no such thing  his transgression said within my heart that there was no fear of god before his eyes 135f 135g  instead of honouring of god and of giving glory to him for any of his mercies or under any of his good providences towards him for god is good to all and lets his sun shine and his rain fall upon the unthankful and unholy he would ascribe the glory to other causes  if they were mercies he would ascribe them if the open face of the providence did not give him the lye to his own wit labour care industry cunning or the like  if they were crosses he would ascribe them or count them the offspring of fortune ill luck chance the ill mannagement of matters the ill will of neighbours or to his wifes being religious and spending as he called it too much time in reading praying or the like  it was not in his way to acknowledge god that is graciously or his hand in things  but as the prophet saith let favour be skewed to the wicked yet will he not learn righteousness 136a  and again they returned not to him that smote them nor did they seek the lord of hosts 136b this was mr badmans temper neither mercies nor judgment would make him seek the lord  nay as another scripture sayes he would not see the works of god nor regard the operations of his hands either in mercies or in judgments 136c  but further when by providence he has been cast under the best means for his soul for as was shewed before he having had a good master and before him a good father and after all a good wife and being sometimes upon a journey and cast under the hearing of a good sermon as he would sometimes for novelties sake go to hear a good preacher he was always without heart to make use thereof  in this land of righteousness he would deal unjustly and would not behold the majesty of the lord  instead of reverencing the word 136g when he heard it preached read or discoursed of he would sleep talk of other business or else object against the authority harmony and wisdom of the scriptures  saying how do you know them to be the word of god how do you know that these sayings are true  the scriptures he would say were as a nose of wax and a man may turn them whithersoever he lists  one scripture says one thing and another sayes the quite contrary besides they make mention of a thousand imposibilities they are the cause of all dissensions and discords that are in the land  therefore you may would he say still think what you will but in my mind they are best at ease that have least to do with them  instead of loving and honouring of them that did bear in their foreheads the name and in their lives the image of christ they should be his song 136h the matter of his jests and the objects of his slanders  he would either make a mock at their sober deportment their gracious language quiet behaviour or else desperately swear that they did all in deceit and hypocrisie  he would endeavour to render godly men as odious and contemptable as he could any lyes that were made by any to their disgrace those he would avouch for truth and would not endure to be controlled he was much like those that the prophet speaks of that would sit and slander his mothers son 137a yea he would speak reproachfully of his wife though his conscience told him and many would testifie that she was a very vertuous woman  he would also raise slanders of his wives friends himself affirming that their doctrine tended to lasciviousness and that in their assemblies they acted and did unbeseeming men and women that they committed uncleanness c  he was much like those that affirmed the apostle should say let us do evil that good may come  137b or like those of whom it is thus written  report say they and we will report it 137c  and if he could get any thing by the end that had scandal in it if it did but touch professors how falsely soever reported oh then he would glory laugh and be glad and lay it upon the whole party  saying hang them rogues there is not a barrel better herring of all the holy brotherhood of them like to like quoth the devil to the collier this is your precise crew  and then he would send all home with a curse  atten  if those that make profession of religion be wise mr badmans watchings and words will make them the more wary and careful in all things  wise  you say true  for when we see men do watch for our halting and rejoyce to see us stumble and fall it should make us so much abundance the more careful 137d  i do think it was as delightful to mr badman to hear raise and tell lies and lying stories of them that fear the lord as it was for him to go to bed when a weary  but we will at this time let these things pass  for as he was in these things bad enough so he added to these many more the like  he was an 137e angry wrathfull envious man a man that knew not what meekness or gentleness meant nor did he desire to learn  his natural temper was to be surly huffie and rugged and worse and he so gave way to his temper as to this that it brought him to be furious and outrageous in all things specially against goodness it self and against other things too when he was displeased 138a  atten  solomon saith he is a fool that rageth  wise  he doth so and sayes moreover that anger rests in the bosom of fools 138b  and truly if it be a sign of a fool to have anger rest in his bosom then was mr badman notwithstanding the conceit that he had of his own abilities a fool of no small size  atten  fools are mostly most wise in their own eyes  wise  true  but i was a saying that if it be a sign that a man is a fool when anger rests in his bosom then what is it a sign of think you when malice and envy rests there  for to my knowledge mr badman was as malicious and as envious a man as commonly you can hear of  atten  certainly malice and envy flow 138c from pride and arrogancy and they again from ignorance and ignorance from the devil and i thought that since you spake of the pride of mr badman before we should have something of these before we had done  wise  envy flows from ignorance indeed  and this mr badman was so envious an one where he set against that he would swell with it as a toad as we say swells with poyson  he whom he maligned might at any time even read envy in his face wherever he met with him or in whatever he had to do with him  his envy was so rank and strong that if it at any time turned its head against a man it would hardly ever be pulled in again  he would watch over that man to do him mischief as the cat watches over the mouse to destroy it yea he would wait seven years but he would have an opportunity to hurt him and when he had it he would make him feel the weight of his envy  envy is a devilish thing the scripture intimates that none can stand before it  a stone is heavy and the sand weighty but a fools wrath is heavier than them both  wrath is cruel and anger is outrageous but who can stand before envy 138d 138e  this envy for the foulness of it is reckoned 138f among the foulest villanies that are as adultery murder drunkenness revellings witchcrafts heresies seditions c  yea it is so malignant a corruption that it rots the very bones of him in whom it dwells  a sound heart is life to the flesh but envy the rottenness of the bones 139a  atten  this envy is the very father and mother of a great many hideous and prodigious wickednesses  i say it is the very 139b father and mother of them it both besets them and also nourishes them up till they come to their cursed maturity in the bosom of him that entertains them  wise  you have given it a very right description in calling of it the father and mother of a great many other prodigious wickednesses  for it is so venomous and vile a thing that it puts the whole course of nature out of order and makes it fit for nothing but confusion and a hold for every evil thing for where envy and strife is there is confusion and every evil work 139c wherefore i say you have rightly called it the very father and mother of a great many other sins  and now for our further edification i will reckon up some of the births of envy  1  envy as i told you before it rotteth the very bones of him that entertains it  and  2  as you have also hinted it is heavier than a stone than sand yea and i will add it falls like a millstone upon the head therefore  3  it kills him that throws it and him at whom it is thrown envy slayeth the silly one 139e  that is him in whom it resides and him who is its object  4  twas that also that slew jesus christ himself for his adversaries persecuted him through their envy 139f 139g  5  envy was that by vertue of which joseph was sold by his brethren into egypt  139h  6  tis envy that hath the hand in making of variance among gods saints 139i  7  tis envy in the hearts of sinners that stirres them up to thrust gods ministers out of their coasts  8  what shall i say  tis envy that is the very nursery of whisperings debates backbitings slanders reproaches murders c  tis not possible to repeat all the particular fruits of this sinfull root  therefore it is no marvel that mr badman was such an ill natured man for the great roots of all manner of wickedness were in him unmortified unmaimed untouched  atten  but it is 140a a rare case even this of mr badman that he should never in all his life be touched with remorse for his illspent life  wise  remorse i cannot say he ever had if by remorse you mean repentance for his evils  yet twice i remember he was under some trouble of mind about his condition  140b once when he broke his legg as he came home drunk from the alehouse and another time when he fell sick and thought he should die  besides these two times i do not remember any more  atten  did he break his legg then  wise  yes  once as he came home drunk from the alehouse  atten  pray how did he break it  wise  why upon a time he was at an alehouse that wicked house about two or three miles from home and having there drank hard the greatest part of the day when night was come he would stay no longer but calls for his horse gets up and like a madman as drunken persons usually ride away he goes as hard as horse could lay legs to the ground  thus he rid till coming to a dirty place where his horse flouncing in fell threw his master and with his fall broke his legg  so there he lay 140c  but you would not think how he 140d swore at first  but after a while he comeing to himself and feeling by his pain and the uselesness of his legg what case he was in and also fearing that this bout might be his death he began to crie out after the manner of such 140e lord help me lord have mercy upon me good god deliver me and the like  so there he lay till some came by who took him up carried him home where he lay for some time before he could go abroad again  atten  and then you say he called upon god  wise  he cryed out in his pain and would say o god and o lord help me  but whether it was that his sin might be pardoned and his soul saved or whether to be rid of his pain i will not positively determine though i fear it was but for the last 141a because when his pain was gone and he had got hopes of mending even before he could go abroad he cast off prayer and began his old game to wit to be as bad as he was before  he then would send for his old companions his sluts also would come to his house to see him and with them he would be as well as he could for his lame leg as vicious as they could be for their hearts  atten  twas a wonder he did not break his neck  wise  his neck had gone instead of his leg but that god was long suffering towards him he had deserved it ten thousand times over there have been many as i have heard and as i have hinted to you before that have taken their horses when drunk as he but they have gone from the pot to the grave for they have broken their necks twixt the alehouse and home  one hard by us 141b also drunk himself dead he drank and dyed in his drink  atten  tis a sad thing to dye drunk  wise  so it is  but yet i wonder that no more do so  for considering the heinousness of that sin and with how many other sins it is accompanied 141c as with oaths blasphemies lyes revellings whoreings brawlings c it is a wonder to me that any that live in that sin should escape such a blow from heaven that should tumble them into their graves  besides when i consider also how when they are as drunk as beasts they without all fear of danger will ride like bedlams and mad men even as if they did dare god to meddle with them if he durst for their being drunk  i say i wonder that he doth not withdraw his protecting providences from them and leave them to those dangers and destructions that by their sin they have deserved and that by their bedlam madness they would rush themselves into  only i consider again that he has appointed a day wherein he will reckon with them 141d and doth also commonly make examples of some to shew that he takes notice of their sin abhorrs their way and will count with them for it at the set time  atten  it is worthy of our remark to take notice how god to shew his dislike of the sins of men strikes some of them down with a blow as the breaking of mr badmans legg for doubtless that was a stroak from heaven  wise  it is worth our remark indeed  it was an open stroak it fell upon him while he was in the height of his sin  and it looks much like to that in job therefore he knoweth their works and overturneth them in the night so that they are destroyed  he striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others  142a or as the margent reads it in the place of beholders  he layes them with his stroak in the place of beholders  there was 142b mr badman laid his stroak was taken notice of by every one  his broken legg was at this time the towntalk  mr badman has broken his legg sayes one  how did he break it sayes another  as he came home drunk from such an alehouse said a third a judgment of god upon him said a fourth  this his sin his shame and punishment are all made conspicuous to all that are about him  i will here tell you another story or two  i have read in mr clarks lookingglass for sinners 142c that upon a time a certain drunken fellow boasted in his cups that there was neither heaven nor hell also he said he believed that man had no soul and that for his own part he would sell his soul to any that would buy it  then did one of his companions buy it of him for a cup of wine and presently the devil in mans shape bought it of that man again at the same price and so in the presence of them all laid hold on this soulseller and carried him away through the air so that he was never more heard of  in pag 148 he tells us also  that there was one at salisbury in the midst of his health drinking and carousing in a tavern and he drank a health to the devil saying that if the devil would not come and pledge him he would not believe that there was either god or devil  whereupon his companions stricken with fear hastened out of the room  and presently after hearing a hideous noise and smelling a stinking savour the vintner ran up into the chamber and coming in he missed his guest and found the window broken the iron barr in it bowed and all bloody  but the man was never heard of afterwards  again in pag 149 he tells us of a bailiff of hedly  who upon a lords day being drunk at melford got upon his horse to ride through the streets saying that his horse would carry him to the devil  and presently his horse threw him and broke his neck these things are worse than the breaking of mr badmans leg and should be a caution to all of his friends that are living lest they also fall by their sin into these sad judgements of god  but as i said mr badman quickly forgot all his conscience was choaked before his legg was healed  and therefore before he was well of the fruit of one sin he tempts god to send another judgment to seize upon him  and so he did quickly after  for not many months after his legg was well he had a very dangerous fit of sickness insomuch that now he began to think he must dye in very deed 143a  atten  well and what did he think and do then  wise  he thought he must go to hell this i know for he could not forbear but say so 143b  to my best remembrance he lay crying out all one night for fear and at times he would so tremble that he would make the very bed shake under him 143c  but oh how the thoughts of death of hellfire and of eternal judgment did then wrack his conscience  fear might be seen in his face and in his tossings to and fro  it might also be heard in his words and be understood by his heavy groans  he would often cry i am undone i am undone my vile life has undone me  atten  then his former atheistical thoughts and principles were too weak now to support him from the fears of eternal damnation  wise  aie they were too weak indeed  they may serve to stifle conscience when a man is in the midst of his prosperity and to harden the heart against all good counsel when a man is left of god and given up to his reprobate mind  143d but alas atheistical thoughts notions and opinions must shrink and melt away when god sends yea comes with sickness to visit the soul of such a sinner for his sin  there was a man dwelt about 12 miles off from us that had so trained up himself in his atheistical notions that at last he attempted to write a book against jesus christ and against the divine authority of the scriptures  but i think it was not printed  well after many days god struck him with sickness whereof he dyed  so being sick and musing upon his former doings the book that he had written came into his mind and with it such a sence of his evil in writing of it that it tore his conscience as a lyon would tare a kid  he lay therefore upon his deathbed in sad case 144a and much affliction of conscience  some of my friends also went to see him and as they were in his chamber one day he hastily called for pen ink and paper which when it was given him he took it and writ to this purpose  i 144b such an one in such a town must goe to hell fire for writing a book against jesus christ and against the holy scriptures  and would also have leaped out of the window of his house to have killed himself but was by them prevented of that so he dyed in his bed such a death as it was  twill be well if others take warning by him  atten  this is a remarkable story  wise  tis as true as remarkable i had it from them that i dare believe who also themselves were eye and ear witnesses and also that catcht him in their arms and saved him when he would have leaped out of his chamberwindow to have destroyed himself  atten  well you have told me what were mr badmans thoughts now being sick of his condition pray tell me also what he then did when he was sick  wise  did he did many things which i am sure he never thought to have done and which to be sure was not looked for of his wife and children  in this fit of sickness his thoughts were quite altered about his wife i say his thoughts so far as could be judged by his words and carriages to her 144c  for now she was his good wife his godly wife his honest wife his duck and dear and all  now he told her that she had the best of it she having a good life to stand by her while his debaucheries and ungodly life did always stare him in the face  now he told her the counsel that she often gave him was good though he was so bad as not to take it  now he would hear her talk to him and he would lie sighing by her while she so did  now he would bid her pray for him that he might be delivered from hell 145a  he would also now consent that some of her good ministers might come to him to comfort him and he would seem to shew them kindness when they came for he would treat them kindly with words and hearken diligently to what they said only he did not care that they should talk much of his ill spent life because his conscience was clogged with that already he cared not now to see his old companions the thoughts of them was a torment to him  and now he would speak kindly to that child of his that took after its mothers steps though he could not at all abide it before  he also desired the prayers of good people that god of his mercy would spare him a little longer promising that if god would but let him recover this once what a new what a penitent man he would be toward god and what a loving husband he would be to his wife what liberty he would give her yea how he would goe with her himself to hear her ministers and how they should go hand in hand in the way to heaven together  atten  here was a fine shew of things ile warrant you his wife was glad for this  wise  his wife  aie and a many good people besides  it was noysed all over the town 145b what a great change there was wrought upon mr badman how sorry he was for his sins how he began to love his wife how he desired good men should pray to god to spare him and what promises he now made to god in his sickness that if ever he should raise him from his sick bed to health again what a new penitent man he would be towards god and what a loving husband to his good wife  well ministers prayed and good people rejoyced thinking verily that they now had gotten a man from the devil nay some of the weaker sort did not stick to say that god had began a work of grace in his heart and his wife poor woman 145c you cannot think how apt she was to believe it so she rejoyced and she hoped as she would have it  but alas alas in little time things all proved otherwise  after he had kept his bed a while his distemper began to abate and he to feel himself better so he in little time was so finely mended that he could walk about the house and also obtained a very fine stomach to his food  146a and now did his wife and her good friends stand gaping to see mr badman fulfill his promise of becoming new towards god and loving to his wife  but the contrary only shewed it self  for so soon as ever he had hopes of mending and found that his strength began to renew his trouble began to goe off his heart and he grew as great a stranger to his frights and fears as if he had never had them  but verily i am apt to think that one reason of his no more regarding or remembring of his sickbed fears and of being no better for them was some words that the doctor that supplied him with physick said to him when he was mending  for as soon as mr badman began to mend the doctor comes and sits him down by him in his house and there fell into discourse with him about the nature of his disease and among other things they talked of badmans trouble and how he would cry out tremble and express his fears of going to hell when his sickness lay pretty hard upon him  to which the doctor replyed  146b that those fears and outcries did arise from the height of his distemper for that disease was often attended with lightness of the head by reason the sick party could not sleep and for that the vapours disturbed the brain  but you see sir quoth he that so soon as you got sleep and betook your self to rest you quickly mended and your head settled and so those frenzies left you  and was it so indeed thought mr badman was my troubles only the effects of my distemper and because ill vapours got up into my brain  then surely since my physician was my saviour my lust again shall be my god  so he never minded religion more but betook him again to the world his lusts and wicked companions and there was an end of mr badmans conversion  atten  i thought as you told me of him that this would be the result of the whole for i discerned by your relating of things that the true symptoms of conversion were wanting in him and that those that appeared to be any thing like them were only such as the reprobates may have  wise  you say right for there wanted in him when he was most sensible a sence of the pollution of his nature he only had guilt for his sinful actions the which cain and pharaoh and saul and judas those reprobates have had before him 147a  besides the great things that he desired were to be delivered from going to hell and who would willingly and that his life might be lengthened in this world  we find not by all that he said or did that jesus christ the saviour was desired by him from a sence of his need of his righteousness to cloath him and of his spirit to sanctifie him 147b  his own strength was whole in him he saw nothing of the treachery of his own heart for had he he would never have been so free to make promises to god of amendment  he would rather have been afraid that if he had mended he should have turned with the dog to his vomit and have begged prayers of saints and assistance from heaven upon that account that he might have been kept from doing so  tis true he did beg prayers of good people and so did pharaoh of moses and aaron and simon magus of simon peter 147c  his mind also seemed to be turned to his wife and child but alas twas rather from conviction that god had given him concerning their happy estate over his than for that he had any true love to the work of god that was in them  true some shews of kindness he seemed to have for them and so had rich dives when in hell to his five brethren that were yet in the world yea he had such love as to wish them in heaven that they might not come thither to be tormented 147d  atten  sickbed repentance is seldom good for any thing  wise  you 147e say true it is very rarely good for any thing indeed  death is unwelcom to nature and usually when sickness and death visit the sinner the first taking of him by the shoulder and the second standing at the bedchamber door to receive him then the sinner begins to look about him and to bethink with himself these will have me away before god and i know that my life has not been as it should how shall i do to appear before god  or if it be more the sence of the punishment and the place of the punishment of sinners that also is starting to a defiled conscience now rouzed by deaths lumbring at the door  and hence usually is sickbed repentance and the matter of it  to wit to be saved from hell and from death and that god will restore again to health till they mend concluding that it is in their power to mend as is evident by their large and lavishing promises to do it  i have known many that when they have been sick have had large measures of this kind of repentance and while it has lasted the noyse and sound thereof has made the town to ring again  but alas how long has it lasted ofttimes scarce so long as untill the party now sick has been well  it has passed away like a mist or a vapour it has been a thing of no continuance  but this kind of repentance is by god compared to the howling of a dog  and they have not cried unto me with their heart when they howled upon their bed 148a  atten  yet one may see by this the desperateness of mans heart 148b for what is it but desperate wickedness to make promise to god of amendment if he will but spare them and yet so soon as they are recovered or quickly after fall to sin as they did before and never to regard their promise more  wise  it is a sign of desperateness indeed yea of desperate madness  for surely they must needs think that god took notice of their promise that he heard the words that they spake 148c and that he hath laid them up against the time to come and will then bring out and testifie to their faces that they flattered him with their mouth and lyed unto him with their tongue 148d when they lay sick to their thinking upon their deathbed and promised him that if he would recover them they would repent and amend their ways  but thus as i have told you mr badman did he made great promises that he would be a new man that he would leave his sins and become a convert that he would love c his godly wife c  yea many fine words had mr badman in his sickness but no good actions when he was well  atten  and how did his good wife take it when she saw that he had no amendment but that he returned with the dog to his vomit to his old courses again  wise  why it 149a broke her heart it was a worse disappointment to her than the cheat that he gave her in marriage  at least she laid it more to heart and could not so well grapple with it  you must think that she had put up many a prayer to god for him before even all the time that he had carried it so badly to her and now when he was so affrighted in his sickness and so desired that he might live and mend poor woman she thought that the time was come for god to answer her prayers nay she did not let with gladness to whisper it out amongst her friends that twas so  but when she saw her self disappointed by her husbands turning rebel again she could not stand up under it but falls into a languishing distemper and in a few weeks gave up the ghost  atten  pray how did she dye  wise  die she dyed bravely full of comfort of the faith of her interest in christ and by him of the world to come  she had many brave expressions in her sickness and gave to those that came to visit her many signs of her salvation the thoughts of the grave but specially of her rising again were sweet thoughts to her  she would long for death because she knew it would be her friend  she behaved her self like to some that were making of them ready to go meet their bridegroom 149b  now said she i am going to rest from my sorrows my sighs my tears my mournings and complaints i have heretofore longed to be among the saints but might by no means be suffered to goe but now i am going and no man can stop me to the great meeting to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven 149c  there i shall have my hearts desire there i shall worship without temptation or other impediment there i shall see the face of my jesus whom i have loved whom i have served and who now i know will save my soul 149d  i have prayed often for my husband that he might be converted but there has been no answer of god in that matter are my prayers lost are they forgotten are they thrown over the barr no they are hanged upon the horns of the golden altar and i must have the benefit of them my self that moment that i shall enter into the gates in at which the righteous nation that keepeth truth shall enter  i say i shall have the benefit of them  i can say as holy david i say i can say of my husband as he could of his enemies  as for me when they were sick my cloathing was of sack cloth i humbled my soul with fasting and my prayer returned into my bosom 150a  my prayers are not lost my tears are yet in gods bottle i would have had a crown and glory for my husband and for those of my children that follow his steps but so far as i can see yet i must rest in the hope of having all my self  atten  did she talk thus openly  wise  no this she spake but to one or two of her most intimate acquaintance who were permitted to come and see her when she lay languishing upon her deathbed  atten  well but pray go on in your relation this is good  i am glad to hear it this is as a cordial to my heart while we sit thus talking under this tree  wise  when she drew near her end she called for her husband and when he was come to her she told him 150b that now he and she must part and said she god knows and thou shalt know that i have been a loving faithful wife unto thee my prayers have been many for thee and as for all the abuses that i have received at thy hand those i freely and heartily forgive and still shall pray for thy conversion even as long as i breathe in this world  but husband i am going thither where no bad man shall come and if thou dost not convert thou wilt never see me more with comfort let not my plain words offend thee  i am thy dying wife and of my faithfulness to thee would leave this exhortation with thee break off thy sins fly to god for mercy while mercies gate stands open remember that the day is coming when thou though now lusty and well must lye at the gates of death as i do  and what wilt thou then do if thou shalt be found with a naked soul to meet with the cherubims with their flaming swords yea what wilt thou then do if death and hell shall come to visit thee and thou in thy sins and under the curse of the law  atten  this was honest and plain  but what said mr badman to her  wise  he did what he could to divert her talk 151a by throwing in other things he also shewed some kind of pity to her now and would ask her what she would have and with various kind of words put her out of her talk for when she see that she was not regarded she fetcht a deep sigh and lay still  so he went down and then she called for her children and began to talk to them and first she spake to those that were rude 151b and told them the danger of dying before they had grace in their hearts  she told them also that death might be nearer them than they were aware of and bid them look when they went through the churchyard again if there was not little graves there  and ah children said she will it not be dreadful to you if we only shall meet at the day of judgment and then part again and never see each other more  and with that she wept the children also wept so she held on her discourse  children said she i am going from you i am going to jesus christ and with him there is neither sorrow nor sighing nor pain nor tears nor death 151c  thither would i have you go also but i can neither carry you nor fetch you thither but if you shall turn from your sins to god and shall beg mercy at his hands by jesus christ you shall follow me and shall when you dye come to the place where i am going that blessed place of rest  and then we shall be for ever together beholding the face of our redeemer to our mutual and eternal joy  so she bid them remember the words of a dying mother when she was cold in her grave and themselves were hot in their sins if perhaps her words might put check to their vice and that they might remember and turn to god  then they all went down but her 151d darling to wit the child that she had most love for because it followed her ways  so she addressed her self to that  come to me said she my sweet child thou art the child of my joy  i have lived to see thee a servant of god thou shalt have eternal life  i my sweet heart shall goe before and thou shalt follow after if thou shalt hold the beginning of thy confidence stedfast to the end 152a  when i am gone do thou still remember my words love thy bible follow my ministers deny ungodliness still and if troublous times shall come set an higher price upon christ his word and wayes and the testimony of a good conscience than upon all the world besides carry it kindly and dutifully to thy father but choose none of his ways  if thou mayest goe to service choose that rather than to stay at home but then be sure to choose a service where thou mayest be helped forwards in the way to heaven and that thou mayest have such a service speak to my minister he will help thee if possible to such an one  i would have thee also my dear child to love thy brothers and sisters but learn none of their naughty tricks  have no fellowship with the unfruitfull works of darkness but rather reprove them 152b  thou hast grace they have none  do thou therefore beautifie the way of salvation before their eyes by a godly life and conformable conversation to the revealed will of god that thy brothers and sisters may see and be the more pleased with the good wayes of the lord  if thou shalt live to marry take heed of being served as i was that is of being beguiled with fair words and the flatteries of a lying tongue  but first be sure of godliness  yea as sure as it is possible for one to be in this world  trust not thine own eyes nor thine own judgment i mean as to that persons godliness that thou art invited to marry  ask counsel of good men and do nothing therein if he lives without my ministers advice  i have also my self desired him to look after thee  thus she talked to her children and gave them counsel and after she had talked to this a little longer she kissd it and bid it go down  well in short her time drew on and the day that she must die so she 152c died with a soul full of grace an heart full of comfort and by her death ended a life full of trouble  her husband made a funerall for her perhaps because he was glad he was rid of her but we will leave that to be manifest at judgment  atten  this woman died well  and now we are talking of the dying of christians i will tell you a story of one that died some time since in our town  the man was a godly old puritan for so the godly were called in time past  this man after a long and godly life fell sick of the sickness whereof he died  and as he lay drawing on the woman that looked to him thought she heard musick and that the sweetest that ever she heard in her life which also continued untill he gave up the ghost  153a now when his soul departed from him the musick seemed to withdraw and to go further and further off from the house and so it went untill the sound was quite gone out of hearing  wise  what do you think that might be  atten  for ought i know the melodious notes of angels that were sent of god to fetch him to heaven  wise  i cannot say but that god goes out of his ordinary road with us poor mortals sometimes  i cannot say this of this woman but yet she had better musick in her heart than sounded in this womans ears  atten  i believe so but pray tell me did any of her other children hearken to her words so as to be bettered in their souls thereby  wise  one of them did 153b and became a very hopefull young man  but for the rest i can say nothing  atten  and what did badman do after his wife was dead  wise  why even as he did before he scarce mourned a fortnight for her and his mourning then was i doubt more in fashion than in heart  atten  would he not sometimes talk of his wife when she was dead  wise  yes when the fit took him and could commend her too extremely saying she was a good godly vertuous woman  but this is not a thing to be wondred at  it is common with wicked men to hate gods servants while alive and to commend them when they are dead  so served the pharisees the prophets  those of the prophets that were dead they commended and those of them that were alive they condemned 153c  atten  but did not mr badman marry again quickly  wise  no not a good while after  and when he was asked the reason he would make this slighty answer who would keep a cow of their own that can have a quart of milk for a penny 154a meaning who would be at the charge to have a wife that can have a whore when he listeth  so villanous so abominable did he continue after the death of his wife  yet at last there was one was too hard for him  for getting of him to her upon a time and making of him sufficiently drunk she was so cunning as to get a promise of marriage of him and so held him to it and forced him to marry her 154b  and she as the saying is was as good as he 154c at all his vile and ranting tricks  she had her companions as well as he had his and she would meet them too at the tavern and ale house more commonly than he was aware of  to be plain she was a very whore and had as great resort came to her where time and place was appointed as any of them all  aie and he smelt it too but could not tell how to help it  for if he began to talk she could lay in his dish the whores that she knew he haunted and she could fit him also with cursing and swearing for she would give him oath for oath and curse for curse  atten  what kind of oaths would she have  wise  why damn her and sink her and the like  atten  these are provoking things  wise  so they are  but god doth not altogether let such things goe unpunished in this life  something of this i have shewed you already and will here give you one or two instances more  there lived saith one 154d in the year 1551 in a city of savoy a man who was a monstrous curser and swearer and though he was often admonished and blamed for it yet would he by no means mend his manners  at length a great plague happening in the city he withdrew himself into a garden where being again admonished to give over his wickedness he hardned his heart more swearing blaspheming god and giving himself to the devil  and immediately the devil snatched him up suddenly his wife and kinswoman looking on and carried him quite away  the magistrates advertised hereof went to the place and examined the woman who justified the truth of it  also at oster in the dutchy of magalapole saith mr clark a wicked woman used in her cursing to give herself body and soul to the devil and being reproved for it still continued the same till being at a weddingfeast the devil came in person and carried her up into the air with most horrible outcries and roarings  and in that sort carried her round about the town that the inhabitants were ready to dye for fear  and by and by he tore her in four pieces leaving her four quarters in four several high wayes and then brought her bowels to the marriagefeast and threw them upon the table before the maior of the town saying behold these dishes of meat belong to thee whom the like destruction waiteth for if thou dost not amend thy wicked life  atten  though god forbears to deal thus with all men that thus rend and tare his name and that immediate judgments do not overtake them yet he makes their lives by other judgments bitter to them does he not  wise  yes yes  and for proof i need goe no further than to this badman and his wife for their railing and cursing and swearing ended not in words  they would fight and fly at each other and that like cats and dogs  but it must be looked upon as the hand and judgment of god upon him for his villany he had an honest woman before but she would not serve his turn and therefore god took her away and gave him one as bad as himself  thus that measure that he meted to his first wife this last did mete to him again  and this is a punishment wherewith sometimes god will punish wicked men  so said amos to amaziah  thy wife shall be an harlot in the city 155a  with this last wife mr badman lived a pretty while but as i told you before in a most sad and hellish manner  and now he would bewail his first wifes death  not of love that he had to her godliness for that he could never abide but for that she used alwayes to keep home whereas this would goe abroad his first wife was also honest and true to that relation but this last was a whore of her body  the first woman loved to keep things together but this last would whirl them about as well as he  the first would be silent when he chid and would take it patiently when he abused her but this would give him word for word blow for blow curse for curse so that now mr badman had met with his match  156a god had a mind to make him see the baseness of his own life in the wickedness of his wives 156b but all would not do with mr badman he would be mr badman still this judgment did not work any reformation upon him no not to god nor man  atten  i warrant you that mr badman thought when his wife was dead that next time he would match far better  wise  what he thought i cannot tell but he could not hope for it in this match  for here he knew himself to be catcht he knew that he was by this woman intangled and would therefore have gone back again but could not  he knew her i say to be a whore before and therefore could not promise himself a happy life with her  for he or she that will not be true to their own soul will neither be true to husband nor wife  and he knew that she was not true to her own soul and therefore could not expect she should be true to him but solomon says an whore is a deep pit and mr badman found it true  for when she had caught him in her pit she would never leave him till she had got him to promise her marriage and when she had taken him so far she forced him to marry indeed  and after that they lived that life that i have told you  atten  but did not the neighbours take notice of this alteration that mr badman had made  wise  yes and many of his neighbours yea many of those that were carnal said 156c tis a righteous judgment of god upon him for his abusive carriage and language to his other wife  for they were all convinced that she was a vertuous woman and he vile wretch had killed her i will not say with but with the want of kindness  atten  and how long i pray did they live thus together  wise  some fourteen or sixteen years even untill though she also brought somthing with her they had sinned all away and parted as poor as howlets 156d  and in reason how could it be otherwise he would have his way and she would have hers he among his companions and she among hers he with his whores and she with her rogues and so they brought their noble to ninepence  atten  pray of what disease did mr badman die for now i perceive we are come up to his death  wise  i cannot so properly say that he died of one disease 157a for there were many that had consented and laid their heads together to bring him to his end  he was dropsical he was consumptive he was surfeited was gouty and as some say he had a tang of the pox in his bowels  yet the captain of all these men of death that came against him to take him away was the consumption for twas that that brought him down to the grave  atten  although i will not say but the best men may die of a consumption a dropsie or a surfeit yea that these may meet upon a man to end him  yet i will say again that many times these diseases come through mans inordinate use of things  much drinking brings dropsies consumptions surfeits and many other diseases and i doubt that mr badmans death did come by his abuse of himself in the use of lawfull and unlawfull things  i ground this my sentence upon that report of his life that you at large have given me  wise  i think verily that you need not call back your sentence for tis thought by many that by his cups and his queans he brought himself to this his destruction  he was not an old man when he dyed nor was he naturally very feeble but strong and of a healthy complexion  yet as i said he moultered away and went when he set a going rotten to his grave  and that which made him stink when he was dead i mean that made him stink in his name and fame was that he died with a spice of the foul disease upon him a man whose life was full of sin and whose death was without repentance  atten  these were blemishes sufficient to make him stink indeed  wise  they were so and they did do it  no man could speak well of him when he was gone 157b  his name rotted above ground as his carkass rotted under  and this is according to the saying of the wise man  the memory of the just is blessed but the name of the wicked shall rot 157c  this text in both the parts of it was fulfilled upon him and the woman that he married first  for her name still did flourish though she had been dead almost seventeen years but his began to stink and rot before he had been buried seventeen dayes  atten  that man that dieth with a life full of sin and with an heart void of repentance although he should die of the most golden disease if there were any that might be so called i will warrant him his name shall stink and that in heaven and earth  wise  you say true and therefore doth the name of cain pharaoh saul judas and the pharisees though dead thousands of years agoe stink as fresh in the nostrils of the world as if they were but newly dead  atten  i do fully acquiesce with you in this  but sir since you have charged him with dying impenitent pray let me see how you will prove it  not that i altogether doubt it because you have affirmed it but yet i love to have proof for what men say in such weighty matters  wise  when i said he died without repentance i meant so far as those that knew him could judge when they compared his life the word and his death together  atten  well said they went the right way to find out whether he had that is did manifest that he had repentance or no  now then shew me how they did prove he had none  wise  so i will  and first 158b this was urged to prove it he had not in all the time of his sickness a sight and sence of his sins but was as secure and as much at quiet as if he had never sinned in all his life  atten  i must needs confess that this is a sign he had none  for how can a man repent of that of which he hath neither sight nor sence  but tis strange that he had neither sight nor sence of sin now when he had such a sight and sence of his evil before  i mean when he was sick before  wise  he was as i said as secure now as if he had been as sinless as an angel though all men knew what a sinner he was for he carried his sins in his forehead  his debauched life was read and known of all men but his reputation was read and known of no man for as i said he had none  and for ought i know the reason he had no sence of his sins now was because he profited not by that sence that he had of them before  he liked not to retain that knowledge of god then that caused his sins to come to remembrance therefore god gave him up now to a reprobate mind to hardness and stupidity of spirit and so was that scripture fulfilled upon him he hath blinded their eyes  and that let their eyes be darkned that they may not see 159a  oh for a man to live in sin and to go out of the world without repentance for it is the saddest judgement that can overtake a man  atten  but sir although both you and i have consented that 159b without a sight and sence of sin there can be no repentance yet that is but our bare sayso let us therefore now see if by the scripture we can make it good  wise  that is easily done  the three thousand that were converted acts the second repented not till they had sight and sence of their sins  159c paul repented not till he had sight and sence of his sins  the jailor repented not till he had sight and sence of his sins  nor could they  for of what should a man repent  the answer is of sin  what is it to repent of sin  the answer is to be sorry for it to turn from it 159d  but how can a man be sorry for it that has neither sight nor sence of it david did not only commit sins but abode impenitent for them untill nathan the prophet was sent from god to give him a sight and sence of them 159e and then but not till then he indeed repented of them  job in order to his repentance cries unto god shew me wherefore thou contendest with me  and again that which i see not teach thou me i have born chastisement i will not offend any more  159f that is not in what i know for i will repent of it nor yet in what i know not when thou shalt shew me it  also ephraims repentance was after he was turned to the sight and sence of his sins and after he was instructed about the evil of them 159g  atten  these are good testimonies of this truth and doe if matter of fact with which mr badman is charged be true prove indeed that he did not repent but as he lived so he dyed in his sin  for without repentance a man is sure to dye in his sin for they will lie down in the dust with him 160a rise at the judgement with him hang about his neck like cords and chains when he standeth at the barre of gods tribunal and goe with him too when he goes away from the judgmentseat with a depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels and there shall fret and gnaw his conscience because they will be to him a neverdying worm 160b  wise  you say well and i will add a word or two more to what i have said  repentance as it is not produced without a sight and sence of sin so every sight and sence of sin cannot produce it  i mean every sight and sence of sin cannot 160c produce that repentance that is repentance unto salvation repentance never to be repented of  for it is yet fresh before us that mr badman had a sight and sence of sin in that fit of sickness that he had before but it dyed without procuring any such godly fruit as was manifest by his so soon returning with the dog to his vomit  many people think also that repentance stands in confession of sin only but they are very much mistaken  for repentance as was said before is a being sorry for and a turning from transgression to god by jesus christ  now if this be true that every sight and sence of sin will not produce repentance then repentance cannot be produced there where there is no sight and sence of sin  that every sight and sence of sin will not produce repentance to wit the godly repentance that we are speaking of is manifest in cain pharaoh saul and judas who all of them had sence great sence of sin but none of them repentance unto life  now i conclude that mr badman did die impenitent and so a death most miserable  atten  but pray now before we conclude our discourse of mr badman give me another proof of his dying in his sins  wise  another proof is this 160d  he did not desire a sight and sence of sins that he might have repentance for them  did i say he did not desire it i will add he greatly desired to remain in his security  and that i shall prove by that which follows first he could not endure that any man now should talk to him of his sinfull life and yet that was the way to beget a sight and sence of sin and so of repentance from it in his soul  but i say he could not endure such discourse  those men that did offer to talk unto him of his illspent life they were as little welcome to him in the time of his last sickness as was elijah when he went to meet with ahab as he went down to take possession of naboths vineyard  hast thou found me said ahab o mine enemy 161a  so would mr badman say in his heart to and of those that thus did come to him though indeed they came even of love to convince him of his evil life that he might have repented thereof and have obtained mercy  atten  did good men then goe to see him in his last sickness  wise  yes  those that were his first wifes acquaintance they went to see him and to talk with and to him if perhaps he might now at last bethink himself and cry to god for mercy  atten  they did well to try now at last if they could save his soul from hell  but pray how can you tell that he did not care for the company of such  wise  because of the differing carriage that he had for them from what he had when his old carnal companions came to see him  when his old campanions came to see him he would stir up himself as much as he could both by words and looks to signifie they were welcome to him he would also talk with them freely and look pleasantly upon them though the talk of such could be none other but such as david said carnal men would offer to him when they came to visit him in his sickness  if he comes to see me says he he speaketh vanity his heart gathereth iniquity to itself 161b but these kind of talks i say mr badman better brooked than he did the company of better men  but i will more particularly give you a character 161c of his carriage to good men and good talk when they came to see him  1  when they were come he would seem to fail in his spirits at the sight of them  2  he would not care to answer them to any of those questions that they would at times put to him to feel what sence he had of sin death hell and judgment  but would either say nothing or answer them by way of evasion or else by telling of them he was so weak and spent that he could not speak much  3  he would never shew forwardness to speak to or talk with them but was glad when they held their tongues  he would ask them no question about his state and another world or how he should escape that damnation that he had deserved  4  he had got a haunt at last to bid his wife and keeper when these good people attempted to come to see him to tell them that he was asleep or inclining to sleep or so weak for want thereof that he could not abyde any noyse  and so they would serve them time after time till at last they were discouraged from coming to see him any more  5  he was so hardned now in this time of his sickness that he would talk when his companions came unto him to the disparagement of those good men and of their good doctrine too that of love did come to see him and that did labour to convert him  6  when these good men went away from him he would never say pray when will you be pleased to come again for i have a desire to more of your company and to hear more of your good instruction no not a word of that but when they were going would scarce bid them drink or say thank you for your good company and good instruction  7  his talk in his sickness with his companions would be of the world as trades houses lands great men great titles great places outward prosperity or outward adversity or some such carnal thing  by all which i conclude that he did not desire a sence and sight of his sin that he might repent and be saved  atten  it must needs be so as you say if these things be true that you have asserted of him  and i do the rather believe them because i think you dare not tell a lie of the dead  wise  i was one of them that went to him and that beheld his carriage and manner of way and this is a true relation of it that i have given you  atten  i am satisfied  but pray if you can shew me now by the word what sentence of god doth pass upon such men  wise  why the man that is thus averse to repentance that desires not to hear of his sins that he might repent and be saved is said to be a man that saith unto god depart from me for i desire not the knowledge of thy wayes 163a  he is a man that sayes in his heart and with his actions i have loved strangers sins and after them i will goe  he is a man that shuts his eyes stops his ears and that turneth his spirit against god  yea he is the man that is at enmity with god and that abhorres him with his soul 163b  atten  what other signe can you give me that mr badman died without repentance  wise  why he did never heartily cry to god for mercy all the time of his affliction 163c  true when sinking fits stitches or pains took hold upon him then he would say as other carnal men use to do lord help me lord strengthen me lord deliver me and the like  but to cry to god for mercy that he did not but lay as i hinted before as if he never had sinned  atten  that is another bad sign indeed for crying to god for mercy is one of the first signs of repentance  when paul lay repenting of his sin upon his bed the holy ghost said of him behold he prayes 163d  but he that hath not the first signs of repentance tis a sign he hath none of the other and so indeed none at all  i do not say but there may be crying where there may be no sign of repentance  they cryed says david to the lord but he answered them not 163e but that he would have done if their cry had been the fruit of repentance  but i say if men may cry and yet have no repentance be sure they have none that cry not at all  it is said in job they cry not when he bindeth them 163f that is because they have no repentance no repentance no cryes false repentance false cryes true repentance true cryes  wise  i know that it is as possible for a man to forbear crying that hath repentance as it is for a man to forbear groaning that feeleth deadly pain  he that looketh into the book of psalms where repentance is most lively set forth even in its true and proper effects shall there find that crying strong crying hearty crying great crying and uncessant crying hath been the fruits of repentance  but none of this had this mr badman therefore he dyed in his sins  that crying is an inseparable effect of repentance is seen in these scriptures  have mercy upon me o god according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions  o lord rebuke me not in thine anger neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure  have mercy upon me o lord for i am weak  o lord heal me for my bones are vexed  my soul is also vexed but thou o lord how long  return o lord deliver my soul  o save me for thy mercies sake  o lord rebuke me not in thy wrath neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure for thine arrows stick fast in me and thy hand presseth me sore  there is  no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin  for mine iniquities are gone over mine head as an heavy burthen they are too heavy for me  my wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness  i am troubled i am bowed down greatly i goe mourning all the day long  my loyns are filled with a loathsom disease and there is no soundness in my flesh  i am feeble and sore broken i have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart 164a  i might give you a great number more of the holy sayings of good men whereby they express how they were what they felt and whether they cryed or no when repentance was wrought in them alas alas it is as possible for a man when the pangs of guilt are upon him to forbear praying as it is for a woman when pangs of travel are upon her to forbear crying  if all the world should tell me that such a man hath repentance yet if he is not a praying man i should not be perswaded to believe it  atten  i know no reason why you should  for there is nothing can demonstrate that such a man hath it  but pray sir what other sign have you by which you can prove that mr badman died in his sins and so in a state of damnation  wise  i have this to prove it 164b  those who were his old sinfull companions in the time of his health were those whose company and carnal talk he most delighted in in the time of his sickness  i did occasionally hint this before but now i make it an argument of his want of grace  for where there is indeed a work of grace in the heart that work doth not only change the heart thoughts and desires but the conversation also yea conversation and company too  when paul had a work of grace in his soul he assayed to joyn himself to the disciples  he was for his old companions in their abominations no longer  he was now a disciple and was for the company of disciples  and he was with them coming in and going out in jerusalem 165a  atten  i thought something when i heard you make mention of it before  thought i this is a shrewd sign that he had not grace in his heart  birds of a feather thought i will flock together  if this man was one of gods children he would heard with gods children his delight would be with and in the company of gods children  as david said i am a companion of all them that fear thee and of them that keep thy precepts 165b  wise  you say well for what fellowship hath he that believeth with an infidel  and although it be true that all that joyn to the godly are not godly yet they that shall inwardly choose the company of the ungodly and open profane rather than the company of the godly as mr badman did surely are not godly men but profane  he was as i told you out of his element when good men did come to visit him but then he was where he would be when he had his vain companions about him  alas grace as i said altereth all heart life company and all for by it the heart and man is made new  and a new heart a new man must have objects of delight that are new and like himself  old things are passed away why  for all things are become new 165c  now if all things are become new to wit heart mind thoughts desires and delights it followeth by consequence that the company must be answerable  hence it is said that they that believed were together that they went to their own company that they were added to the church that they were of one heart and of one soul 165d and the like  now if it be objected that mr badman was sick and so could not goe to the godly yet he had a tongue in his head and could had he had an heart have spoken to some to call or send for the godly to come to him  yea he would have done so yea the company of all others specially his fellow sinners would even in every appearance of them before him have been a burden and a grief unto him  his heart and affection standing bent to good good companions would have suited him best  but his companions were his old associates his delight was in them therefore his heart and soul were yet ungodly  atten  pray how was he when he drew near his end for i perceive that what you say of him now hath reference to him and to his actions at the beginning of his sickness  then he could endure company and much talk besides perhaps then he thought he should recover and not die as afterwards he had cause to think when he was quite wasted with pining sickness when he was at the graves mouth  but how was he i say when he was as we say at the graves mouth within a step of death when he saw and knew and could not but know that shortly he must dye and appear before the judgment of god  wise  why 166a there was not any other alteration in him than what was made by his disease upon his body  sickness you know will alter the body also pains and stitches will make men groan but for his mind he had no alteration there  his mind was the same his heart was the same  he was the selfsame mr badman still  not onely in name but conditions and that to the very day of his death  yea so far as could be gathered to the very moment in which he died  atten  pray how was he in his death was death strong upon him or did he dye with ease quietly  wise  as quietly as a 166b lamb  there seemed not to be in it to standers by so much as a strong struggle of nature  and as for his mind it seemed to be wholly at quiet  but pray why do you ask me this question  atten  not for mine own sake but for others  for there is such 166c an opinion as this among the ignorant  that if a man dies as they call it like a lamb that is quietly and without that consternation of mind that others shew in their death they conclude and that beyond all doubt that such an one is gone to heaven and is certainly escaped the wrath to come  wise  there is no judgment to be made by a quiet death of the eternal state of him that so dieth  suppose one man should die quietly another should die suddenly and a third should die under great consternation of spirit no man can judge of their eternall condition by the manner of any of these kinds of deaths  he that dies quietly suddenly or under consternation of spirit may goe to heaven or may goe to hell no man can tell whether a man goes by any such manner of death  the 167a judgment therefore that we make of the eternall condition of a man must be gathered from another consideration  to wit did the man die in his sins did he die in unbelief did he die before he was born again then he is gone to the devil and hell though he died never so quietly again was the man a good man had he faith and holiness was he a lover and a worshipper of god by christ according to his word then he is gone to god and heaven how suddenly or in what consternation of mind soever he died  but mr badman was naught his life was evil his wayes were evil evil to his end  he therefore went to hell and to the devil how quietly soever he died  indeed there is in some cases a judgment to be made of a mans eternal condition by the manner of the death he dieth 167b  as suppose now a man should murder himself or live a wicked life and after that die in utter despair these men without doubt do both of them goe to hell  and here i will take an occasion to speak of two of mr badmans brethren for you know i told you before that he had brethren and of the manner of their death  one of them killed himself and the other after a wicked life died in utter despair  now i should not be afraid to conclude of both these that they went by and through their death to hell  atten  pray tell me concerning the first how he made away himself  wise  why he took a knife and cut his own throat and immediately gave up the ghost and died  now what can we judge of such a mans condition since the scripture saith no murderer hath eternall life c but that it must be concluded that such an one is gone to hell  he was a murderer a selfmurderer and he is the worst murderer one that slays his own body and soul  nor doe we find mention made of any but cursed ones that doe such kind of deeds  i say no mention made in holy writ of any others but such that murder themselves  and this is the sore judgment of god upon men when god shall for the sins of such give them up to be their own executioners or rather to execute his judgment and anger upon themselves  and let me earnestly give this caution to sinners  take heed sirs break off your sins lest god serves you as he served mr badmans brother  that is lest he gives you up to be your own murderers  atten  now you talk of this  i did once know a man 168a a barber that took his own raisor and cut his own throat and then put his head out of his chamberwindow to shew the neighbours what he had done and after a little while died  wise  i can tell you 168b a more dreadful thing than this  i mean as to the manner of doing the fact 168c  there was about twelve years since a man that lived at brafield by northampton named john cox that murdered himself the manner of his doing of it was thus  he was a poor man and had for some time been sick and the time of his sickness was about the beginning of haytime and taking too many thoughts how he should live afterwards if he lost his present season of work he fell into deep despair about the world and cryed out to his wife the morning before he killed himself saying we are undone  but quickly after he desired his wife to depart the room because said he i will see if i can get any rest so she went out  but he instead of sleeping quickly took his raisor and therewith cut up a great hole in his side out of which he pulled and cut off some of his guts and threw them with the blood up and down the chamber  but this not speeding of him so soon as he desired he took the same raisor and therewith cut his own throat  his wife then hearing of him sigh and fetch his wind short came again into the room to him and seeing what he had done she ran out and called in some neighbours who came to him where he lay in a bloody manner frightfull to behold  then said one of them to him ah john what have you done are you not sorry for what you have done  he answered roughly tis too late to be sorry  then said the same person to him again ah john pray to god to forgive thee this bloody act of thine  at the hearing of which exhortation he seemed much offended and in angry manner said pray and with that flung himself away to the wall and so after a few gasps died desperately  when he had turned him of his back to the wall the blood ran out of his belly as out of a boul and soaked quite through the bed to the boards and through the chinks of the boards it ran pouring down to the ground  some said that when the neighbours came to see him he lay groaping with his hand in his bowels reaching upward as was thought that he might have pulled or cut out his heart  twas said also that some of his liver had been by him torn out and cast upon the boards and that many of his guts hung out of the bed on the side thereof  but i cannot confirm all particulars but the general of the story with these circumstances above mentioned is true i had it from a sober and credible person who himself was one that saw him in this bloody state and that talked with him as was hinted before  many other such dreadful things might be told you but these are enough and too many too if god in his wisdom had thought necessary to prevent them  atten  this is a dreadful story  and i would to god that it might be a warning to others to instruct them to fear before god and pray lest he gives them up to doe as john cox hath done  for surely selfmurderers cannot goe to heaven  and therefore as you have said he that dieth by his own hands is certainly gone to hell  but speak a word or two of the other man you mentioned  wise  what of a wicked man dying in despair  atten  yes of a wicked man dying in despair  wise  well then  169a this mr badmans other brother was a very wicked man both in heart and life i say in heart because he was so in life nor could anything reclaim him neither good men good books good examples nor gods judgements  well after he had lived a great while in his sins god smote with a sickness of which he died  now in his sickness his conscience began to be awakened and he began to roar out of his illspent life insomuch that the town began to ring of him  now when it was noysed about many of the neighbours came to see him and to read by him as is the common way with some but all that they could doe 170a could not abate his terror but he would lie in his bed gnashing of his teeth and wringing of his wrists concluding upon the damnation of his soul and in that horror and despair he dyed not calling upon god but distrusting in his mercy and blaspheming of his name  atten  this brings to my mind a man that a friend of mine told me of 170b  he had been a wicked liver so when he came to die he fell into despair and having concluded that god had no mercy for him he addressed himself to the devil for favour saying good devil be good unto me  wise  this is almost like saul who being forsaken of god went to the witch of endor and so to the devil for help 170c  but alas should i set my self to collect these dreadful stories it would be easie in little time to present you with hundreds of them  but i will conclude as i began they that are their own murderers or that die in despair after they have lived a life of wickedness do surely go to hell  and here i would put in a caution  every one that dieth under consternation of spirit that is under amazement and great fear do not therefore die in despair  for a good man may have this for his bands in his death and yet go to heaven and glory  for as i said before he that is a good man a man that hath faith and holiness a lover and worshipper of god by christ according to his word may die in consternation of spirit  for satan will not be wanting to assault good men upon their deathbed but they are secured by the word and power of god yea and are also helped though with much agony of spirit to exercise themselves in faith and prayer the which he that dieth in despair can by no means doe  but let us return to mr badman and enter further discourse of the manner of his death  atten  i think you and i are both of a mind for just now i was thinking to call you back to him also  and pray now since it is your own motion to return again to him let us discourse a little more of his quiet and still death  wise  with all my heart  you know we were speaking before of the manner of mr badmans death  171a how that he dyed very stilly and quietly upon which you made observation that the common people conclude that if a man dyes quietly and as they call it like a lamb he is certainly gone to heaven  when alas if a wicked man dyes quietly if a man that has all his dayes lived in notorious sin dyeth quietly his quiet dying is so far off from being a sign of his being saved that it is an uncontrollable proof of his damnation  this was mr badmans case he lived wickedly even to the last and then went quietly out of the world therefore mr badman is gone to hell  att  well but since you are upon it and also so confident in it to wit that a man that lives a wicked life till he dyes and then dyes quietly is gone to hell let me see hat shew of proof you have for this your opinion  wise  my first argument is drawn from the necessity of repentance no man can be saved except he repents nor can he repent that sees not that knows not that he is a sinner and he that knows himself to be a sinner will i will warrant him be molested for the time by that knowledge 171b  this as it is testified by all the scriptures so it is testified by christian experience  he that knows of himself to be a sinner is molested especially if that knowledge comes not to him untill he is cast upon his deathbed molested i say before he can dye quietly  yea he is molested dejected and cast down he is also made to cry out to hunger and thirst after mercy by christ and if at all he shall indeed come to die quietly i mean with that quietness that is begotten by faith and hope in gods mercy to the which mr badman and his brethren were utter strangers his quietness is distinguished by all judicious observers by what went before it by what it flows from and also by what is the fruit thereof  i must confess i am no admirer of sickbed repentance for i think verily it is seldom 171c good for any thing  but i say he that hath lived in sin and profaneness all his dayes as mr badman did and yet shall dye quietly that is without repentance steps in twixt his life and death he is assuredly gone to hell and is damned  atten  this does look like an argument indeed for repentance must come or else we must goe to hellfire  and if a lewd liver shall i mean that so continues till the day of his death yet goe out of the world quietly tis a sign that he died without repentance and so a sign that he is damned  wise  i am satisfied in it for my part and that from the necessity and nature of repentance  it is necessary because god calls for it and will not pardon sin without it  except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish  this is that which god hath said and he will prove but a foolhardy man that shall yet think to goe to heaven and glory without it  repent for the ax is laid to the root of the tree every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit but no good fruit can be where there is not sound repentance shall be hewn down and cast into the fire 172a this was mr badmans case he had attending of him a sinfull life and that to the very last and yet dyed quietly that is without repentance he is gone to hell and is damned  for the nature of repentance i have touched upon that already and shewed that it never was where a quiet death is the immediate companion of a sinfull life and therefore mr badman is gone to hell  secondly 172b my second argument is drawn from that blessed word of christ while the strong man armed keeps the house his goods are in peace till a stronger than he comes  but the strong man armed kept mr badmans house that is his heart and soul and body for he went from a sinfull life quietly out of this world the stronger did not disturb by intercepting with sound repentance betwixt his sinful life and his quiet death  therefore mr badman is gone to hell  the strong man armed is the devil and quietness is his security the devil never fears losing of the sinner if he can but keep him quiet  can he but keep him quiet in a sinfull life and quiet in his death he is his own  therefore he saith his goods are in peace that is out of danger  there is no fear of the devils losing such a soul i say because christ who is the best judge in this matter saith his goods are in peace in quiet and out of danger  atten  this is a good one too 173a for doubtless peace and quiet with sin is one of the greatest signs of a damnable state  wise  so it is  therefore when god would shew the greatness of his anger against sin and sinners in one word he saith they are joyned to idols let them alone 173b  let them alone that is disturb them not let them goe on without controll let the devil enjoy them peaceably let him carry them out of the world unconverted quietly  this is one of the sorest of judgments and bespeaketh the burning anger of god against sinfull men  see also when you come home the fourteenth verse of the chapter last mentioned in the margent  i will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom  i will let them alone they shall live and dye in their sins  but  thirdly my third argument 173c is drawn from that saying of christ  he hath blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their hearts and be converted and i should heal them 173d  there are three things that i will take notice of from these words  1  the first is that there can be no conversion to god where the eye is darkned and the heart hardened  the eye must first be made to see and the heart to break and relent under and for sin or else there can be no conversion  he hath blinded their eyes and hardned their hearts lest they should see and understand and so be converted  and this was clearly mr badmans case he lived a wicked life and also died with his eyes shut and heart hardened as is manifest in that a sinful life was joyned with a quiet death and all for that he should not be converted but partake of the fruit of his sinfull life in hell fire  2  the second thing that i take notice of from these words is that this is a dispensation and manifestation of gods anger against a man for his sin  when god is angry with men i mean when he is so angry with them this among many is one of the judgments that he giveth them up unto to wit to blindness of mind and hardness of heart which he also suffereth to accompany them till they enter in at the gates of death  and then and there and not short of then and there their eyes come to be opened  hence it is said of the rich man mentioned in luke he dyed and in hell he lifted up his eyes  174a implying that he did not lift them up before  he neither saw what he had done nor whither he was going till he came to the place of execution even into hell  he died asleep in his soul he dyed bespotted stupified and so consequently for quietness like a child or lamb even as mr badman did  this was a sign of gods anger he had a mind to damn him for his sins and therefore would not let him see nor have an heart to repent for them lest he should convert and his damnation which god had appointed should be frustrate  lest they should be converted and i should heal them  3  the third thing that i take notice of from hence is that a sinfull life and a quiet death annexed to it is the ready the open the beaten the common highway to hell  there is no surer sign of damnation than for a man to dye quietly after a sinfull life  i do not say that all wicked men that are molested at their death with a sence of sin and fears of hell do therefore goe to heaven for some are also made to see and are left to despair not converted by seeing that they might go roaring out of this world to their place  but i say there is no surer sign of a mans damnation than to dye quietly after a sinful life than to sin and dye with his eyes shut than to sin and dye with an heart that cannot repent  he hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart no not so long as they are in this world lest they should see with their eyes and understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them 174b  god has a judgment for wicked men god will be even with wicked men  god knows how to reserve the ungodly to the day of judgment to be punished  174c and this is one of his wayes by which he doth it  thus it was with mr badman  4  fourthly 174d it is said in the book of psalms concerning the wicked there is no bands in their death but their strength is firm  by no bands he means no troubles no gracious chastisements no such corrections for sin as fall to be the lot of gods people for theirs yea that many times falls to be theirs at the time of their death  therefore he adds concerning the wicked they are not troubled then like other men neither are they plagued like other men but go as securely out of the world as if they had never sinned against god and put their own souls into danger of damnation  there is no band in their death  they seem to go unbound and set at liberty out of this world though they have lived notoriously wicked all their dayes in it  the prisoner that is to dye at the gallows for his wickedness must first have his irons knockt off his legs so he seems to goe most at liberty when indeed he is going to be executed for his transgressions wicked men also have no bands in their death they seem to be more at liberty when they are even at the windup of their sinfull life than at any time besides  hence you shall have them boast of their faith and hope in gods mercy when they lye upon their deathbed yea you shall have them speak as confidently of their salvation as if they had served god all their dayes  when the truth is the bottom of this their boasting is because they have no bands in their death  their sin and base life comes not into their mind to correct them and bring them to repentance but presumptuous thoughts and an hope and faith of the spiders the devils making possesseth their soul to their own eternal undoing 175a  hence wicked mens hope is said to dye not before but with them they give up the ghost together  and thus did mr badman  his sins and his hope went with him to the gate but there his hope left him because it dyed there but his sins went in with him to be a worm to gnaw him in his conscience for ever and ever  the opinion therefore of the common people concerning this kind of dying is 175b frivolous and vain for mr badman died like a lamb or as they call it like a chrisom child quietly and without fear  i speak not this with reference to the strugling of nature with death but as to the strugling of the conscience with the judgment of god  i know that nature will struggle with death  i have seen a dog and sheep dye hardly  and thus may a wicked man doe because there is an antipathy betwixt nature and death  but even while even then when death and nature are strugling for mastery the soul the conscience may be as besotted as benummed as senceless and ignorant of its miserable state as the block or bed on which the sick lyes  and thus they may dye like a chrisom child in shew but indeed like one who by the judgment of god is bound over to eternal damnation and that also by the same judgment is kept from seeing what they are and whither they are going till they plunge down among the flames  and as it is a very great judgment of god on wicked men that so dye for it cuts them off from all possibility of repentance and so of salvation 176a so it is as great a judgment upon those that are their companions that survive them  for by the manner of their death they dying so quietly so like unto chrisom children as they call it they are hardened and take courage to go on in their course  for comparing their life with their death their sinful cursed lives with their childlike lamblike death they think that all is well that no damnation is happened to them though they lived like devils incarnate yet they dyed like harmless ones  there was no whirlwind no tempest no band nor plague in their death they dyed as quietly as the most godly of them all and had as great faith and hope of salvation and would talk as boldly of salvation as if they had assurance of it  but as was their hope in life so was their death  their hope was without tryal because it was none of gods working and their death was without molestation because so was the judgment of god concerning them  but i say at this their survivors take heart to tread their steps and to continue to live in the breach of the law of god yea they carry it statelily in their villanies for so it follows in the psalm  there is no bands in their death but their strength is firm c  therefore pride compasseth them the survivors about as a chain violence covereth them as a garment 176b  therefore they take courage to do evil therefore they pride themselves in their iniquity  therefore wherefore  why because their fellows died after they had lived long in a most profane and wicked life as quietly and as like to lambs as if they had been innocent  yea they are bold by seeing this to conclude that god either does not or will not take notice of their sins  they speak wickedly they speak loftily  they speak wickedly of sin for that they make it better than by the word it is pronounced to be  they speak wickedly concerning oppression that they commend and count it a prudent act  they also speak loftily  they set their mouth against the heavens c  and they say how doth god know and is there knowledge in the most high  and all this so far as i can see ariseth in their hearts from the beholding of the quiet and lamblike death of their companions 177a  behold these are the ungodly that prosper in the world 177b that is by wicked ways they increase in riches  this therefore is a great judgment of god both upon that man that dyeth in his sins and also upon his companion that beholdeth him so to dye  he sinneth he dyeth in his sins and yet dyeth quietly  what shall his companion say to this  what judgment shall he make how god will deal with him by beholding the lamb like death of his companion  be sure he cannot as from such a sight say wo be to me for judgment is before him  he cannot gather that sin is a dreadful and a bitter thing by the child like death of mr badman  but must rather if he judgeth according to what he sees or according to his corrupted reason conclude with the wicked ones of old that every one that doth evil is good in the sight of the lord and he delighteth in them or where is the god of judgment 177c  yea this is enough to puzzle the wisest man  david himself was put to a stand by beholding the quiet death of ungodly men verily sayes he i have cleansed my heart in vain and have washed my hands in innocency  psal 73 13  they to appearance fare better by far than i  their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than heart can wish but all the day long have i been plagued and chastned every morning  this i say made david wonder yea and job and jeremiah too  but he goeth into the sanctuary and then he understands their end nor could he understand it before i went into the sanctuary of god  what place was that why there where he might enquire of god and by him be resolved of this matter  then says he understood i their end  then i saw that thou hast set them in slippery places and that thou castest them down to destruction  castest them down that is suddenly or as the next words say as in a moment they are utterly consumed with terrors  which terrors did not cease them on their sickbed for they had no bands in their death  the terrors therefore ceased them there where also they are holden in them for ever  this he found out i say but not without great painfulness grief and pricking in his reins  so deep so hard and so difficult did he find it rightly to come to a determination in this matter  and indeed this is a deep judgment of god towards ungodly sinners it is enough to stagger a whole world only the godly that are in the world have a sanctuary to go to where the oracle and word of god is by which his judgements and a reason of many of them are made known to and understood by them  atten  indeed this is a staggering dispensation  it is full of the wisdom and anger of god  and i believe as you have said that it is full of judgment to the world  who would have imagined that had not known mr badman and yet had seen him die but that he had been a man of an holy life and conversation since he died so stilly so quietly so like a lamb or chrisom child  would they not i say have concluded that he was a righteous man or that if they had known him and his life yet to see him die so quietly would they not have concluded that he had made his peace with god nay further if some had known that he had died in his sins and yet that he died so like a lamb would they not have concluded that either god doth not know our sins or that he likes them or that he wants power or will or heart or skill to punish them since mr badman himself went from a sinfull life so quietly so peaceably and so like a lamb as he did  wise  without controversie this is an heavy judgment of god upon wicked men job 21 23 one goes to hell in peace another goes to hell in trouble one goes to hell being sent thither by his own hands another goes to hell being sent thither by the hand of his companion one goes thither with his eyes shut and another goes thither with his eyes open one goes thither roaring and another goes thither boasting of heaven and happiness all the way he goes one goes thither like mr badman himself and others go thither as did his brethren  but above all mr badmans death as to the manner of dying is the fullest of snares and traps to wicked men therefore they that die as he are the greatest stumble to the world  they goe and goe they go on peaceably from youth to old age and thence to the grave and so to hell without noyse  they goe as an ox to the slaughter and as a fool to the correction of the stocks that is both sencelesly and securely  o but being come at the gates of hell  o but when they see those gates set open for them  o but when they see that that is their home and that they must go in thither then their peace and quietness flies away for ever  then they roar like lions yell like dragons howl like dogs and tremble at their judgment as do the devils themselves  oh when they see they must shoot the gulf and throat of hell when they shall see that hell hath shut her ghastly jaws upon them when they shall open their eyes and find themselves within the belly and bowels of hell then they will mourn and weep and hack and gnash their teeth for pain  but this must not be or if it must yet very rarely till they are gone out of the sight and hearing of those mortals whom they do leave behind them alive in the world  atten  well my good neighbour wiseman i perceive that the sun grows low and that you have come to a conclusion with mr badmans life and death and therefore i will take my leave of you  only first let me tell you i am glad that i have met with you to day and that our hap was to fall in with mr badmans state  i also thank you for your freedom with me in granting of me your reply to all my questions  i would only beg your prayers that god will give me much grace that i may neither live nor die as did mr badman  wise  my good neighbour attentive i wish your welfare in soul and body and if ought that i have said of mr  badmans life anddeath may be of benefit unto you i shall be heartily glad only i desire you to thank god for it and to pray heartily for me that i with you may be kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation  atten  amen  farewell  wise  i wish you heartily farewell    margin notes    general note  when mr badman was printed much of the text was annotated with notes in the margins  these are unlike our modern footnotes in that
